### Exposing the Darkness of Inducement to Surrender: China is Not Czechoslovakia or Spain!

Since the war of resistance entered its second phase, in the past five months, the policy of the × people (Japanese) towards China has sometimes employed political peace inducement to surrender and sometimes military adventures, exhibiting a great sense of "indecision." Many who are ignorant of the general situation are also misled by this. In fact, the reason why the × people are acting in this way is very simple, that is, in the twenty months since the Sino-Japanese War, the situation at home and abroad in our country has been progressing and improving day by day, while the internal and external situation in Japan is just the opposite. A quick victory is impossible, and the conspiracy of a quick peace has also failed. Therefore, their actions are embarrassed and troubled, seeming unbearable to scrutinize. But if we can observe calmly, we can know that the difficulties of × are deepening, but have not deepened to the point of collapsing the entire aggressive camp, and have not deepened to the point of losing the power to continue the attack; our strength has indeed progressed, but has not progressed to the point of completely stopping the attack of the × people and recovering the lost land. Therefore, the × people are currently using military adventures as a backup for political conspiracies on the one hand, and using peace inducement to surrender to supplement the lack of military power on the other hand. Therefore, their "war" is indeed an adventure, and their "peace" is also without sincerity. Their purpose lies in preventing the political progress of our country, eliminating the strength of our resistance war, and realizing the complete "subjugation of China"! The smokescreens of "peace," "compromise," and "international mediation," etc., are constantly being released under this situation of the Japanese × people for the aforementioned attempt to conquer China. In the past few days, the × people's traitors have been releasing these smokescreens again, and the purpose also lies in this. This is our basic internal understanding that we should have.

The treacherous plans of "peace," "compromise," "international mediation," etc., which induce surrender, are obviously derived from the latest facts of the German and Italian annihilation of Czechoslovakia and the "conquest" of Spain. Therefore, although the general public already clearly knows the conspiracies and treacherous plans of the × people's traitors, they are also deeply concerned that China may unfortunately follow the footsteps of Czechoslovakia or Spain in the future. Therefore, the alarm bells of "a new Munich!" and "a Munich in the Far East!" are constantly being sounded. We should indeed raise our vigilance today to prevent the human tragedy of Munich from being staged in the Far East. But at the same time, we should still understand that any conspiracy to turn China into a second Czechoslovakia or Spain is impossible and futile. Why? We can briefly explain as follows:

First of all, we know that Czechoslovakia originally had no reason to be annihilated, because they had a great democratic tradition in politics, the people of the whole country supported the government in resisting aggression, and they also had a fairly strong army and solid national defense construction in the military. However, why did Czechoslovakia finally perish? This is because the internal unity of Czechoslovakia was insufficient, the forces protecting democracy were suspicious of each other, and a part of them openly befriended the enemy (Germany). The enemy also supported rebel parties such as Henlein in Czechoslovakia to create internal disruption. At the same time, in terms of international relations, although there was a Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, France was constrained by Britain and abandoned aid to Czechoslovakia. Britain even sent Runciman to pressure Czechoslovakia to yield. The Soviet Union also did not provide assistance because Czechoslovakia compromised midway and ultimately did not resist. These are the factors for the demise of Czechoslovakia. Now China already possesses more conditions than Czechoslovakia for not perishing, but does not have any of the factors for the fall of Czechoslovakia. The main thing is that our internal unity is becoming more and more consolidated, the phenomenon of suspicion and friction has almost disappeared, a part of the pro × (Japan) elements has been eliminated, and the lurking pro × elements are subject to unanimous national attack as soon as they make a move. Rebel parties such as Henlein have never been produced, and in terms of international relations, not only is there no strong country that openly pressures our country to yield, but also has a Soviet Union that resolutely aids China in resisting Japan, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the vast majority of peace-loving and just people in the world!

Secondly, let us look at Spain. Spain had even less reason to be conquered than Czechoslovakia. Because Spain has been resisting for more than thirty months, the people of the whole country unanimously support the Republican government to resist to the end, all parties in the country have also established a consolidated and united front, and have won the sympathy and assistance of the people all over the world. However, why was the Spanish resistance finally destroyed? And why was all of Spain actually "conquered" under the rule of the Franco regime, the hawk and dog of the German and Italian aggressors? This is because the enemies of Spain were not only the troops of the traitor Franco, but also the joint attack of the two major aggressive countries of Germany and Italy, and Franco's forces had already seized seven or eight tenths of the government's regular army from the beginning. How could they withstand the addition of hundreds of thousands of German and Italian elite troops and the latest weapons! At the same time, the British and French rulers had long pressed the Republican army with a policy of non-interference, blocking foreign aid to the Republican army, while Germany and Italy could continuously aid Franco, and finally even tried their best to undermine the Spanish People's Front and constantly provoke coups to destroy the Republican government. Finally, due to excessive international pressure, a few leaders of the Republican government, such as Casado and Miaja, betrayed and implemented anti-communist peace talks, which led to the recent tragic event of "being conquered." On the contrary, in our country, in terms of the domestic situation, we are large in land, rich in resources, and populous, which are far superior to Czechoslovakia and Spain, and are the main conditions for our resolute non-perishability. Secondly, in the twenty months since the start of our country's war of resistance, domestic unity has become increasingly consolidated, politics has become increasingly progressive, the economy has become increasingly developed, the army has continued to maintain more than two million soldiers, and has become increasingly strong, and new troops are being cultivated on a large scale! Our united front includes all parties, all ethnic minorities, especially all strata, and the party leading the united front has determined long-term close cooperation with ten years of experience. These conditions of victory are not only better than those of Czechoslovakia, but also better than those of Spain. In terms of the international situation, on the one hand, because the United Kingdom and France are considering their own interests, they not only cannot add pressure to us as they did to Czechoslovakia and Spain, but also adopt a positive approach to aid. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's aid to China is also greatly facilitated by geographical and political relations, and has a lasting guarantee. These are also the conditions of victory that Czechoslovakia and Spain did not have. In addition, the strength of our × people is not as strong as the combined forces of Germany and Italy attacking Czechoslovakia and Spain. The Chinese traitors and collaborators are also unable to match Henlein's shoulders, and are far from being one ten-thousandth of Franco's strength; these are the main conditions that we will never become Czechoslovakia or Spain.

From the comparison of the various concrete conditions above, we have already understood that even if the × traitors intensify their various steps of inducement to surrender, attempting to turn our country into a second Czechoslovakia or Spain, it will in fact be absolutely impossible. However, we are not saying that we can therefore allow the × people's conspiracies and treacherous plans of inducement to surrender to run rampant! No! If we allow it to run rampant, if we do not give it a thorough and fatal blow, then the future of our war of resistance and the future of the national liberation movement will inevitably encounter various unexpected obstacles and sufferings! Especially as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, our military and political offensive is not enough to stop the necessary degree of the × people's offensive. Therefore, even if we can already assert that the result of persevering in unity and resistance will be victory, the breadth, severity, and cruelty of the suffering we will suffer in this process will be unimaginable to us! How should we give the × traitors' conspiracy to induce surrender a thorough and fatal blow today? This is what we have repeatedly hoped for. We must strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line and expand the guerrilla warfare behind the × people in the military. The most important thing is to realize democratic politics and improve the people's livelihood in politics, so as to effectively realize the total mobilization of the spirit and material strength of the whole nation.

### Children in Socialist Countries – Written in Commemoration of This Year's Children's Day –

— Mei Zhen

The War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has entered a new stage. Commemorating "Children's Day" in this new stage feels exceptionally significant. We must strive to rescue suffering children in the war zones and those wandering throughout the country. We must strive to nurture children throughout the nation, nurturing the future masters of the new China. This newspaper published Ms. Shufen's article "Nurturing the Masters of the New China" on April 1st in advance, addressing how we should commemorate this year's Children's Day. Today, we are publishing this article by Mr. Mei Zhen, depicting the lives of children in the Soviet Union after the success of the socialist revolution and the government's measures to ensure the lives of children and women. On the one hand, it can serve as a reference for those who pay attention to children's issues today. On the other hand, it can greatly increase our courage and determination in the revolutionary struggle. We are specially introducing it to our readers.

I. Soviet Children After the Success of the Revolution

The success of the "October Socialist Revolution" laid the foundation for eliminating the social system of human exploitation and class oppression, and also laid the foundation for the complete and ultimate liberation of women. Following the smooth and complete completion of the first and second Five-Year Plans, the elimination of the exploitative social system was fully realized, and a classless social life was fully realized. Socialist construction in the Soviet Union was completely successful! Soviet children born after the success of the revolution, today's Soviet youth, have grown up entirely in a happy socialist society. All systems of human oppression and exploitation, as well as the deception, humiliation, exploitation, and slaughter, and the phenomena of class struggle that we often suffer in capitalist and semi-feudal, semi-colonial societies, Soviet children and youth can only see in newspapers. Consequently, they imagine its cruelty and are filled with righteous indignation, expressing their grievances for the working masses!

The happy lives of Soviet children, growing up happily in a socialist society, are simply unimaginable for capitalist countries, let alone for the children of semi-feudal, semi-colonial China. Even when they are still in their mothers' wombs, they enjoy the protection of the socialist Soviet government's laws, receiving protection from anti-abortion laws that are completely different from those in capitalist and feudal countries. As soon as they leave the womb, they not only gain the protection of laws ensuring complete equality between men and women in all political, social, and family life, but also immediately receive the protection of Soviet government regulations for rewarding child-rearing subsidies. This government legal protection not only benefits children but also practically benefits children's parents, especially mothers. They can receive special government treatment.

Soviet children, from the moment they are born, can immediately enjoy the preferential treatment of nurseries, kindergartens, and schools at all levels, all with specialized government facilities, without their parents having to worry. At the same time, they still enjoy family happiness; they still enjoy the warmth of the family in the evenings and on holidays. However, in addition to family happiness, what is even more commendable is collective, larger-scale happiness. Furthermore, they enjoy all sorts of entertainment unimaginable in capitalist and feudal countries. The forms and contents are revolutionary, full of future ideals, and by no means fantasies: various dances, dramas, movies, and even the world's leading sports, as well as gliding, parachuting, and other games. These games are almost unattainable for capitalist youth, and even more unattainable for Chinese youth and even military officers. However, in the Soviet Union, they have become common games for children!

Soviet children live such happy lives until they enter adulthood. At the same time, they are definitely not treated as toy-like little birds or butterflies. No, they also possess independent personalities that are unprecedented in other capitalist and all countries. Although they are guided by socialist education to embark on the path of defending socialism and defending the progress of human culture, they also gain natural human development. Whether in daily life, in games and entertainment, or in all social services, they have ample opportunities to exercise their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity.

Until they enter adulthood, they can continue to develop their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity towards life, politics, and society. However, at that time, in addition to obtaining the freedoms such as political democracy granted by the government, they also gain what people in capitalist countries and other countries do not enjoy: truly equal conditions of material life for men and women, without class distinctions, uniformly improved working conditions, reduced working hours, rapid medical progress, and increased cultural entertainment!

In particular, from early childhood, they are educated and prepared to fight for the defense of the socialist motherland, for the interests of the oppressed masses worldwide, for the liberation of small and weak nations, and for the defense of world peace and the progress of human culture.

(II) Soviet Laws Protecting Women and Children

When discussing Soviet laws protecting women and children, the first thing to mention is the law prohibiting abortion.

In the years following the civil war and international armed intervention, the Soviet domestic economy collapsed. The inadequate cultural level inherited by women from before the revolution prevented them from immediately fully utilizing the rights granted to them by law, and also prevented them from immediately assuming the tasks of producing and educating children, and of being citizens and mothers without worry. At that time, as long as the situation met the criteria specified in the resolution of the People's Committee for Health and Justice of November 18, 1920, which stated that "the moral legacy of the past and the difficult economic situation of the present still compel some women to resort to this operation," women were permitted to have abortions.

The revolutionary leaders of the Soviet Union firmly opposed abortion. Lenin, in a 1913 article, stated that class-conscious workers "are undoubtedly enemies of neo-Malthusianism. This doctrine caters to the desires of cowardly and self-abnegating philistines who shudderingly whisper: 'May God keep our bodies and souls always together. As for children, it is better to have none.'" However, while Lenin regarded abortion as a social evil, he also pointed out that any legislation prohibiting abortion would clearly be ineffective. He also pointed out that under capitalism, laws prohibiting abortion only reflect the "hypocrisy of the ruling class" because these laws "cannot heal the sores of capitalism, but instead turn them into a special malignancy, into a special wound for the oppressed class." Only under socialism, where the phenomenon of human exploitation no longer exists, where women have become equal members of society, and where the improvement of the material welfare of the working people has become the law of social development, is it possible to solemnly organize the struggle against abortion—by law or other means.

The resolution of the People's Committees for Health and Justice of November 18, 1920, which permitted abortion, was eventually revised. Furthermore, on the one hand, the necessary material reserves for women and their children were realized, subsidies for large families were realized, and the networks of maternity wards, nurseries, and kindergartens were greatly developed, as well as the explicit stipulation of the minimum amount of child support that fathers must pay after separation from their spouses. On the other hand, abortion was prohibited, the criminal law for deliberately failing to pay child support as determined by the court was aggravated, and certain legislative amendments were proposed during divorce. They resolutely opposed attitudes that trivialize family and family obligations! These are the paths that must be followed regarding the important issues of the entire population. The Soviet government responded to the appeals made by many working women.

First, regarding the prohibition of abortion, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union decided on the following legal act on June 27, 1936: (1) Because of the proven harm, the two committees decided to strictly prohibit abortion, whether in hospitals and special health institutions, or in doctors' homes and pregnant women's private homes. However, abortion may be specifically permitted when pregnancy endangers life or there is a risk of harming the pregnant woman's health, as well as when serious parental illness can be transmitted to the fetus, but it must be performed in a hospital or maternity ward. (2) If abortion is performed outside of a hospital or if anyone in the hospital violates the above abortion behavior, the doctor performing the abortion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for one to two years. If the abortion behavior is performed by a person without special medical education under unhygienic conditions, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years. (3) If a woman is forced to have an abortion, she shall be sentenced to two years of imprisonment. (4) For pregnant women who violate the prohibition of abortion, the two committees stipulated social condemnation instead of criminal law. If there is a recurrence, a fine of no more than 300 rubles shall be imposed.

Secondly, regarding the protection of pregnant women and the encouragement of childbirth, the two committees decided on the following legal act: (1) In order to improve the material status of women (female workers and employees) insured by social insurance organizations, the two committees decided to increase the allowance prepared for necessary childcare from the state's social insurance fund from 32 rubles to 45 rubles. (2) The two committees decided to increase the breastfeeding allowance issued to mothers from 5 rubles per month to 10 rubles. (3) For uninsured working women (members of cooperative combinations and cooperative enterprises), it is stipulated that the above-mentioned allowances shall be issued by the cooperative mutual aid fund on an equal basis. (4) Abolish the restrictions imposed on female employees by the Labor Code, so that they are equal to working women in terms of the length of prenatal and postnatal leave (56 days before birth and 56 days after birth). (5) Formulate criminal laws for refusing to hire pregnant women and reducing pregnant women's wages, and stipulate in the law that when transferring a pregnant woman to lighter work, the employer has the obligation to maintain her original wage earned in the most recent six months. (6) Formulate state subsidies for mothers with large families. A mother who already has six children will receive an annual subsidy of 2,000 rubles for each additional child until the child is five years old. A mother who already has ten children will receive a one-time state subsidy of 5,000 rubles for each additional child, and then an annual subsidy of 3,000 rubles until the child is four years old. (One ruble is approximately one Taiwan or Hong Kong dollar.)

III. How the Soviet Union Loves Children

Soviet children, from the moment they are born, receive the love of government laws in addition to the affection of their parents, older brothers, and older sisters. For example, the networks of maternity wards, nurseries, and kindergartens all over the country are carefully arranged by the government in response to the needs of the people.

The aforementioned two committees simultaneously instructed the People's Committees for Health of all federal republics to carry out the following tasks: (1) In order to provide special medical assistance in special maternity wards to all women in urban industrial centers and local centers, each People's Committee for Health shall, before January 1, 1939, set up 110,000 new maternity beds. (2) In order to expand medical services for pregnant women in rural villages, each People's Committee for Health should set up and put into use 32,000 maternity beds. (3) In order to provide midwifery services at home for women who do not go to maternity hospitals, each People's Committee for Health should open 14,000 new midwife stations before January 1, 1938. The above is about expanding the maternity ward network. Secondly, regarding the promotion of nurseries, (1) the two committees decided to double the existing nursery bed network in cities, state-owned farms, workers' districts, and railways before January 1, 1939, with the total number of beds increasing to 800,000. (2) Before the same date, double the existing nursery bed network in rural collective farm nurseries and seasonal collective farm nurseries, so that the number of beds in regular nurseries increases by 500,000, and the number of beds in seasonal nurseries increases by 400,000. (3) In urban areas and industrial centers, from January 1, 1937, the work of nursery schools is rotated by two shifts of personnel. (4) In addition to the training expenses for intermediate personnel, another 15 million rubles will be allocated, instructing the People's Committees for Health of all federal republics to cultivate suitable talents for newly established institutions. (5) Before January 1, 1939, each Republican Health Committee will add 800 new milk kitchens in cities, industrial centers, and local centers to feed 1.5 million children under the age of three. Again, regarding the expansion of kindergartens, the Soviet Union completed the following plan from 1936 to 1938: (1) Expand the existing regular kindergarten network in cities, factory areas, and railways to three times its original size, increasing it to 2.1 million places before January 1, 1938; in state-owned farms and state-owned institutions in rural areas, increase it to 300,000 places. (2) Before the New Year of 1936, in addition to the existing 400,000 places, add 700,000 additional kindergarten places on collective farms, and at the same time establish seasonal playgrounds for all children of collective farms who have not reached school age. Established 23 million places. The education committees of each republic trained 50,000 teachers for those kindergartens that will be opened in the second half of 1936, and allocated an additional 35 million rubles to fund the training of cadres for new kindergartens in just this half year.

In addition, in order to reduce the burden on mothers with many children, the Soviet Union has given these mothers large amounts of subsidies. As of April 1, 1937, 260,000 mothers had received subsidies, totaling 566 million rubles. In addition, the number of gynecological and pediatric medical clinics and infant and child protection offices was only 9 before the revolution until 1911, but by 1935, there were 3,945 of the former, with 3.4 million people receiving treatment, and 794 of the latter, with 17 million people receiving treatment! These institutions are all equipped with exquisite laboratories, X-rays, and other advanced medical equipment.

IV. The Cultural Life and Entertainment of Soviet Children

The cultural life and entertainment life of Soviet children are worthy of boasting to the capitalist world. The number of schools specially run for children in the Soviet Union is noteworthy. Before the revolution, there were only 103,000 primary schools, with 7 million students, 1,600 incomplete secondary schools, with 200,000 students, and 1,800 secondary schools, with 600,000 students. Several years later, in 1935-1936, there were 126,600 primary schools, with 11 million students, 31,500 incomplete secondary schools, with 10 million students, and 6,000 secondary schools, with 4.5 million students. In addition, there are more than 700 workers' colleges, teaching secondary education, with 250,000 students. In 1936-1937, the number of students in primary and secondary schools increased to 28,842,000. Now that the second Five-Year Plan has been completed and the third Five-Year Plan has begun, more emphasis is placed on improving the standard of living and cultural life, and the quantity will increase several times. School enrollment for students in Soviet schools is completely free. Schools are generally established by the state. Some primary and secondary school students are also subsidized for lunch by the school. Students in specialized schools and universities do not pay tuition fees and also receive subsidies. And women's access to education has also reached an equal footing. For example, in 193_ each girls in primary and secondary schools accounted for 48 percent of the total number.

Russia was known for its poverty, but the development of Soviet Russia's cultural publishing industry has become incredible to the world. Regarding children, in order to implement correct and appropriate education for children, various languages of children's books, magazines, and telegrams are specially published for children. In 1934, there were 10.5 million copies of children's literature books, 16.4 million copies in 1935, and 32.1 million copies in 1936. There were 19 million copies of children's magazines in 1935 and 30.7 million copies in 1936. There are hundreds of kinds of children's and teenagers' magazines. As for children's newspapers, almost every town, township, village, neighborhood, and even primary school and kindergarten has one!

Speaking of the entertainment life of Soviet children, it is even more interesting. The Soviet Union has special theaters, cinemas, and circuses for children. In order to provide children with correct education in the field of drama, most ordinary adult theaters do not accept children. At the end of 1936, there were 100 ordinary theaters and circuses exclusively for children and young people. In addition, children's gardens are set up in streets and forests, and children's equipment such as遊toys, libraries, and zoos are available in the park. Especially in winter, children participate in ice skating. It is simply a daily entertainment for every child. In Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkiv, and other cities, there are also children's palaces, which are specially equipped to inspire children to study various domestic and international subjects, and to recruit talented children to develop their talents. These children's palaces are currently being built in various cities and collective farms. As for summer, children have two months of vacation. The vast majority of children leave the city to live in the suburbs in the summer and receive the tempering of nature. There are also children selected from all over the country who are studying well (shock troops) to spend two months at the children's camp in Ortek, by the Russian sea. This is one of the larger and better-equipped places for children to collectively recuperate. All expenses for children, including travel expenses, clothing, etc., are not borne by themselves. There, the flag is raised at 7:00 every day, there are three regular meals and three refreshments every day, and a one-hour nap is required after lunch. Every day, they must swim and sunbathe, and the rest of the time is spent on various scientific specialized research that each child is interested in, collecting various animals and plants to make specimens, researching how to make airplanes and build tanks, or taking short trips during travel. Some children have also made inventions related to machines. They have various specialized instructors guiding them. When individuals or groups go to visit them there, they are all hospitably received. After refreshments, they gather together to perform songs and dances. During the break, they also compete with each other to increase their weight. Those who have a good break are also rewarded.

(V) Foreign Children Living in the Soviet Union

"Do you also want to go to the Soviet Union?" Children of any country, when talking about the life of Soviet children, cannot help but think of going to this red Soviet Union. In fact, there is no country in the world that welcomes foreign children to travel as much as the Soviet Union! What's more, the Soviet Union itself is a union of seven socialist republics and many other free states. Their country also has hundreds of ethnic groups!

Since the German aggressor's henchman Franco launched a war in the Spanish Republic, the children have suffered the same bombings, knife and gun killings as we Chinese are suffering today. There are even more thousands of people who are hungry, wandering, and dying! Democratic and peaceful countries launched a campaign to rescue Spanish children in distress the year before last. The Soviet Union, a socialist country, naturally supports and assists even more vigorously. Now, more than 100,000 Spanish children in distress have been safely taken to the Soviet Union. Some have even moved entire schools to the Soviet Union. All the faculty and staff of the school were originally hired in Spain. The original Spanish education is carried out in Spanish language and script. This kind of school is especially favored by the Soviet government. For the rest of the children in distress, the Soviet government organized them and established schools for them. Most of the teachers are also Spanish, and the teaching materials and books are entirely in Spanish. The Soviet Union issued them uniform uniforms, which are neat and beautiful, and provided them with all supplies. Some of the children's fathers are still fighting in Spain. They can use the radio to talk to their parents and contact their families as if they were at home.

In addition, the children of revolutionaries from various countries who stayed in the Soviet Union also enjoy various rights like Soviet children. There are also many children of Chinese revolutionaries there! They are all in the international children's nurseries and schools established by the International Relief Organization for Revolutionaries. Although their faces are different in black, white, brown, yellow and red, they get along very harmoniously and kindly. They are healthy, lively, and intelligent in this happy paradise, and the institutions that nurture them not only pay close attention to their daily life, diet, learning, and entertainment, but also try their best to make them not forget their motherland and often educate them to love their motherland and love their vast compatriots and the sufferers of the world.

Since our war of resistance, the Japanese aggressors have used airplanes and artillery to create thousands of infant corpses and child corpses and thousands of orphans. We have a vast rear area, especially the southwest and northwest. Our children do not need to flee to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has done its best to help us spiritually and by raising medical donations. We also have hundreds and thousands of outstanding children and young people who have been sent to the Soviet Union to learn specialized sciences and aircraft manufacturing and piloting. Let us look forward to their great success here!

### Chengdu Unveils the Curtain on Military Build-up (1)

— Zi Fei

[Special Chengdu Airmail Report] The weather on March 5th was particularly clear and bright; the people of Chengdu, who had not seen the sun for many days, were exceptionally delighted, especially on this day of the Lantern Festival.

The Jinshui River (a river within Chengdu City) brought countless ripples from Huanhua Creek (where the Jinshui River originates), slowly pacing and gurgling through the city; enticing the weeping willows on both banks to open their weary eyes, dress in new, soft green attire, and greet people with smiles. "Happy!" "Extremely fun!" Everywhere, men and women were shouting. Indeed, after days of "dogs barking at the sun," the sudden clarity of ten thousand miles without a cloud was truly indescribable joy. Moreover, it was both the Lantern Festival and a Sunday, and the "Chengdu Cultural Circles Military Build-up Joint Movement Publicity Week," which had never been written in Chinese history before.

While wealthy wives, young ladies, gentlemen seeking refuge, and big shots hoping for a quick victory were still pursuing sweet dreams, there was a constant sound of gongs on the streets; following the sound came the announcement: "Fellow neighbors, everyone on the street! The Police Bureau orders that today is the opening day of the * Military Build-up Publicity Week, and every household must hang the national flag." After the voice stopped, there was again the sound of gongs.

National flags fluttered at the entrance of every house. Smiles appeared on everyone's faces. Chengdu today was completely different from usual. Banners of various colors were hung across the main roads; some read: "Build an army of ten million, restore our rivers and mountains," while others read "Mobilize all our strength, dedicate it to the country," "Everyone should be a soldier, victory in the war of resistance is certain," "Everyone should contribute, nation-building will surely succeed," and "...". Innumerable patriotic slogans were written. People rushed to Shaocheng Park. National flags fluttered freely in the pleasant spring breeze.

The Military Build-up Publicity Conference was held in Shaocheng Park.

When people walked to the entrance of Cishi Street, they saw a very large human-shaped lantern, with a blood-red mouth, extending an arm more than two zhang long, tightly clenching a fist. Below the fist, along the arm, was written: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves." Looking at it, you would inevitably ask yourself: "Have I risen up in the war of resistance? Or not?" A red and white banner stretched across the street below the fist, reading "Build 5,000 airplanes to strengthen national defense." Above the main gate, in white cloth with black characters, was a horizontal inscription saying, "Sichuan has abundant land and people. Contribute troops and grain, be a model for the whole country." On the right was a map of China drawn by the Political Department of the Air Force Commission, depicting the resistance strength and dynamics of various provinces and ethnic groups, which hundreds of spectators looked up at with great interest. (To be continued)

### Military Deployment in Jiangxi and Hunan Completed; × Southward Advance from Nanchang Trapped; Yueyang City Completely Under Our Control

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 2nd] The overall war situation has not changed significantly. Our new deployment and military preparations in Jiangxi and Hunan have been completed. We are steadily continuing our attacks against ×. In areas north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, we have increased our troops and are controlling everything. The × southward advance from Nanchang is already trapped. The × who invaded Jing'an and Wuning are still engaged in fierce fighting with us nearby. Our army is attacking major towns and cities, achieving many victories. We are currently counter-attacking Xiangfu Temple.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guilin on the 2nd] The × along the Fengxin highway are advancing fiercely and have already launched fierce fighting in the suburbs of Gao'an.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Chinese newspapers here are all discussing the second objective of the Japanese army after occupying Nanchang. Many believe that the Japanese army will attack Changsha. If successful, they can advance southward and unite with the Japanese army in Guangdong. Currently, the Japanese army is attacking Gao'an to the west of Nanchang. It is reported that the Chinese army is currently planning to strengthen the forces and activities of guerrillas near Nanchang.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 2nd] Frontline reports say that the units besieging Yueyang have launched swift and courageous attacks in recent days and have achieved great victories.

### National Muslim Compatriots Unanimously Support the War of Resistance; × Sends Traitors Impersonating Muslim Representatives to Mecca to Deceive Muslims from Various Countries

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st] Last year, more than seventy of our Muslim compatriots from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai departed from Qinghai and went to participate in the pilgrimage through Tibet, India, and other places. Now, this group has returned to Kunming from Mecca via Myanmar yesterday. According to Ma Hanchen, when they arrived in Mecca, the Japanese had sent four Chinese Muslims to impersonate our Muslim representatives and spread unfavorable propaganda about us to more than 100,000 Muslims from various countries who were performing the Hajj. After they arrived in Mecca and learned about this, they strongly defended themselves to all parties, explaining the situation of our Muslim families in our country uniting as one, and announced the Japanese × killing and arson, in making Muslims and mosques, etc. After that, Zhao Weiyun, a Muslim youth studying in Egypt, also wrote a booklet in Arabic, strongly refuting their slander and shamelessness, and detailing the elimination of the situation where the country is united in one heart and bravely resisting the war. As a result, not only did the truth come to light, but the situation of our Muslims supporting the government and resisting the war won the respect of Muslims from various countries.

### Minerals Discovered in Mile County, Yunnan

[Correspondent of Mile] In the county-owned Meihuazhai (four or five miles away from the city), there is a kind of black sand. Whenever the sunset shines in the west, the golden light shines brightly. Its body is extremely heavy. Each small teacup weighs more than two or three taels. I don't know what kind of mineral it is.

### The Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association is Established: Four Democratic Nations Cling Together Under Oppression, Aggression, Plunder, and Threat

[Chongqing Dispatch] In the torrent of the War of Resistance, a truth about human survival has been revealed—that is, the indivisibility of freedom, peace, and war. Today, when the crisis in China and Europe, especially in Eastern Europe, is intensifying, this truth is further proven. The countries in Europe that love freedom, peace, and justice—France, Belgium, and Switzerland—have the same rational national character as our country and are also facing the same threats of oppression, aggression, and plunder as we are. It is in this situation that we have deepened our mutual understanding and strengthened our cooperation. Worthy of attention is the grand establishment of the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association on March 26.

Among those present were members of the presidium, including Weng Wenhao, Xie Guansheng, and Mao Qingxiang; Qiao Buke, the Counselor of the French Consulate; Xue Wen, the Chargé d'Affaires of Belgium; guests; Bishop Luo Dunwei; and members Bi Xiushao, Tong Mengsheng, Chen Zhonghao, and Yuan Yaoguo, totaling more than two hundred people.

Minister Weng Wenhao delivered the opening speech in fluent French. He said that no country in the world is isolated; they need the help of sympathy and friendship to stand firm. China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland are all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries. Now that we have the organization of this association, we naturally have high hopes for the promotion of future diplomatic relations. Yi Xihong briefly reported on the preparations, saying that the preparatory work went very smoothly, taking less than three months from initiation to establishment. Following him, a representative from the Central Department of Social Affairs spoke, emphasizing three points: First, to hope for the organization of society; second, to rationalize undertakings; and third, to introduce the unique national spirit of France, Belgium, and Switzerland to help the War of Resistance and promote its spiritual mobilization. The representative of the Ministry of Education expressed special gratitude to France, Belgium, and Switzerland for their assistance to China because their numbers in the Far East are dwindling. It is truly commendable that they can resist Japan with their spirit of freedom, peace, and justice, and with an attitude of doing what is right without seeking personal gain. The Ministry of Education is launching cultural lectures on various countries in major regions and systematically introducing famous works from various countries, expecting the support of the members present today. Dean Qin Zhen and representatives from the political circles also delivered very meaningful speeches, generally saying that freedom, equality, and fraternity are the highest cultures and thoughts of mankind. The "Decameron" of the West and China in the East were the first to have such cultural thoughts. Based on this ideological foundation, the four countries can unite and attack Japan, a barbaric country that destroys world peace.

Picquet, the Counselor of the French Embassy, first spoke amid applause that resounded throughout the hall. He said that Sino-French relations have always maintained friendly relations in the past. Now, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of those involved in the cultural work of various countries, a regular contact has been established, and future emotions will naturally be very good. Seven, the Counselor of the Belgian Embassy, said in a humorous tone that the four countries of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland have a close relationship that complements each other, like water, fire, earth, and air. Their existence has created the world, and the cooperation of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland is also an important factor in creating the world and promoting civilization. Madame Xia Ming, Li Meng, Havas News Agency, and Biyiait all delivered speeches, believing that the future cultural exchanges between the four countries of China, France, Belgium, and Switzerland will be beneficial to the creation of the world.

In the midst of laughter and applause, a clear symbol emerged, leaving a deep impression on me—the exchange of the great world's freedom, peace, and sense of justice!

After the speeches, the charter was adopted, and directors were elected. The venue was filled with a harmonious and friendly spirit. The honorary speakers of the association are Ma Xiangbo, Li Yuying, Zhang Renjie, Zhang Ji, Helio, and Qi Lan Mengda, among others. Wu Jingheng is the president, and the honorary directors are Wang Chonghui, the French Ambassador, Si Mo; the Belgian Ambassador, Ji Youmu; the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires, Dong Zinen; Zou Lu, Ye Shicang, Jun Lizi, Chen Lifu, Weng Wenhao, Wei Jingming, Li Shuhua, Gu Weijun, Qian Xun, Hu Shilu, Gao Lu, Xie Guansheng, Zhang Daohuai, Wei Huai, Chen Cheng, He Jian, Ma Chaojun, Dong Xianguang, Xie Choukang, Lu Zhengxiang, Yu Can, Lei Mingyuan, Wang Jingqi, Liu Wendao, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Enlai, Bi Yuzhang, Li Qiong, Mai Huanzhang, Qin Huifang, Li Linyu, Xiong Guanglai, He Lu, Duan Tiaoyuan, Liao Pinzhuo, Hong Lanyou, and Mao Qingxiang, among others. Twenty-five people were elected as directors of the association. (27th)

### The Awkward Predicament of Puppet Suiyuan ×

— Gao Lu

[Huan Yuan Dispatch] Due to Suiyuan's special international status in the Northwest, it has long been coveted by the Japanese ×. They use Inner Mongolia, Yu Gong, and bandits as their tools and pawns for aggression, engaging in political disintegration. In 1936, the × Kou intensified their aggression against Suiyuan, and only then did we have the glorious page in our history of liberation of General Fu Zuoyi's War of Resistance in eastern Suiyuan. After the flames of the Lugou Bridge Incident were ignited, except for the Yikezhao League and a part of western Suiyuan, which can still serve as a strict national defense barrier, most of Suiyuan's cities and transportation lines—the Pinghan Road—are controlled by the devilish hands of the × people. The protagonists who perform this cruel demonic play are the puppet Mongolian troops who are tempted and coerced. The real Japanese × are only a small number who occupy a supervisory position in the army.

Reaching the present, it has become an exhausted crossbow, full of awkwardness!

Due to the persistent resistance and heroic struggle of our regular army, guerrilla forces, and self-defense forces in Suiyuan, the × people have been trapped in dangerous cities for a year, desperately defending the main railway lines, not daring to cross the line. Every time they went out, they were attacked by our guerrillas. According to people from Baotou, the distribution of the × puppet army in Suiyuan is as follows:

First Division—Around Baotou Machi, including the × puppet army's Tanaka Detachment and the puppet army's Ding Qichang's unit.

Second Division and Third Division—Stationed in the Taolin Wuchuan area.

Fourth Division, Baoguima Unit—Branched out to the Daxue Bay, Shaxian area.

Fifth Division, Seben Unit—Stationed in the Guyang area.

Sixth Division and Seventh Division—Stationed in Pingdiquan, Fengzhen area.

Eighth Division—Stationed in the Qingshuihe area.

Ninth Division—Stationed in Tuoxian.

Yu Zhiqian's Anti-Communist Autonomous Army—Stationed in the Guyang area.

The Mongolian puppet army once occupied the Zhunge National Banner but was driven across the river by the advancing army. The puppet Mongolian army of Hangjin Banner was also driven away by the Suiyuan National Army. When the Senge unit attacked Dongsheng, we took advantage of the victory to drive all the puppet rebel army out of Dalate Banner, so that the flags of Yikezhao League were free from the harassment, ravaging, and exploitation of the × puppet army.

The troops stationed in Suiyuan by the × puppet army, nominally a large division, actually only have nine or six hundred people (including both Japanese and puppet Mongolian troops) or three or four hundred people. For example, Baotou, nominally the First Division, actually only has a Tanaka Detachment and Ding Qichang's four hundred-odd people.

Especially as the Japanese × deepen inland, the battle line becomes longer and longer, and the military strength is not enough to distribute. The × army in Suiyuan is particularly distressed by the distribution of military strength; in every fierce battle, they feel that they cannot take care of both ends. Therefore, in a predicament, they recently reorganized the scattered bandit teams in Hedong into the Northwest Autonomous Army. Li Ni Zhaoxing serves as the division commander and is currently stationed in Shaerqin, Eerxun, Haidai, Tuheqi, Balagai, Youfang Congzi, and other places between Baotou and Saer. However, the puppet army is ultimately Chinese, constantly remembering his motherland and secretly brewing a rebellion. According to a Mongolian youth who followed the Japanese back to China and arrived in Yu, the youth in the puppet army are eagerly missing their motherland. The subordinates of Prince De asked Prince De: "What should I do?" And Prince De is also gray-haired, unable to withstand the pressure of the Japanese. In this situation: the Japanese × are unusually worried, and the × people suspect the Han Chinese officers. In addition to a large number of deserters, the officers of each regiment are transferred to each other from time to time, and the vacancies are replaced by Mongolian people from the puppet headquarters' officer training corps. However, they are still afraid that they are unreliable, and the daily surveillance is extremely strict.

Since the Japanese × arrived in Suiyuan, they have made no progress in a year and have suffered painful wounds at the same time. At the same time, the × country is in turmoil, and the military's labor is high. According to people from Baotou: "The × soldiers' aversion to war is increasing day by day. A few days ago, × soldiers, including those in the city, gathered to drink alcohol. After drinking, they cried out loud and said to each other: "We cannot return to our country; we must die in China. We hope that the government will make peace quickly." According to the × counselor of the Mongolian Banner Pacification Envoy's Office, four or five × soldiers who graduated from university and worked in the special agency forcibly occupied the house of Gao, the counselor in Baotou. The wife of a certain counselor had no choice but to say: "We are slaves to a fallen country and have to let people live in the house." The × soldiers were very moved and said: "We are the real slaves of a fallen country."

Since the battles of Xincheng, the puppet army in Baotou has become more panicked. At the same time, there are no troops to come to aid from other places, so they have come up with several wonderful methods, such as making many wooden figures and standing them in the courtyards where they are stationed, or piling up sacks of hemp and soil at various street and road junctions to defend. At night, they wear the clothes of our Hui people to prepare for the guerrillas so that they can escape when attacked. From this point of view, the awkwardness of the × puppet army in Suiyuan is fully exposed, and the time of its disintegration is not far away. (Minge News Agency)

[Minge News Agency Yulin Second Electricity] A certain unit of the puppet Northwest Autonomous Army's two divisions revolted and has now arrived in a certain city. Our army sent a certain commander on the 27th to reorganize and issue rewards to encourage them.

### Hitler's Speech: Abolishing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Responding to Britain with a Provocative Attitude, Using Oppression as an Excuse to Continue Expanding the Army

[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Hitler gave a speech here today, saying that Britain has no right to interfere in Germany's internal affairs.

What we have done is for the peace-loving people." Regarding the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Hitler said, "If Britain does not intend to adhere to peace, then all the practical prerequisites in the treaty have lost their effect." He also said that "those who take chestnuts from the fire" are only enough to burn their own hands. "We have a strong country to back up its rights. We do not have to rely on the goodwill of other countries or foreign politicians." Hitler's speech lasted for an hour, and it was interrupted by shouts of "shame" every time. When he mentioned Britain, the audience showed contempt. The speech also caused laughter. Hitler then spoke about Germany's territorial demands on Czechoslovakia, saying, "When Britain was still very small, the first German emperor was crowned in Prague. If Czechoslovakia has not oppressed the Germans and has not become a tool of communism, we have no hostility towards Czechoslovakia's independence." Regarding the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Hitler said, "We did this by using Germany's original rights, historical instructions, and our geographical location. We have no intention of suppressing the Czechs. The Czech people will enjoy more freedom than other so-called 'pure nations.' I dare say that this move has made a great contribution to peace, because the German-Czech annexation has invisibly eliminated a major crisis in Central Europe. Germany has never had the delusion of attacking other countries. We only seek to develop our own economic interests. Germany, like a large buyer of goods, is the most ideal economic partner. As for armaments, Germany will not stop expanding its army as long as other countries do not abandon their policy of oppressing Germany. I firmly believe that my country's progress can be faster than other countries. As for the Axis relationship in diplomacy, it will always be maintained under any circumstances and at any time. This is the most natural political tool in the world. Reports from the outside world that the Axis has broken up are absurd. If there are irreconcilable or psychological contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union, I congratulate those who say this." Hitler then discussed the rights of Franco's army in Spain, saying that it was a victory for a country to be freed from the shackles of communism, and he was deeply proud of the German youth's contribution to the Spanish Civil War. Hitler cited Germany's pre-war history, calling it a struggle for a place in the sun. He then said that although Germany only followed its peaceful steps, other countries opposed it with resentment and accusations, which eventually led to war. Then, the head of state enumerated the cruel policies taken by other countries against Germany and continued to say that Britain had stated that "subjugating Germany would give the British great hope." Hitler also declared that no one could admit that he had defeated the heroic Germany. Then, he recounted President Wilson's "Fourteen Points," saying that Germany fully hoped to conclude a peace treaty under the conditions of no victors and no losers, no responsibility for compensation for losses, no plunder of colonies, and joint disarmament. Germany first implemented disarmament, and other countries should also follow. All issues must be discussed freely and openly, and most importantly, Germany has the right to make its own decisions. Germany firmly believed in this guarantee. Unexpectedly, all countries have now reneged on their promises, creating an unprecedented record. Europe has become a land of sin, where oppression and plunder are rampant.

[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] During Hitler's speech, he announced the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, saying that the purpose of the treaty no longer exists. He defended Germany's Central European policy, saying that Germany's policy has been to maintain peace until now. Germany is now on guard, and Britain's policy of encircling Germany is contradictory to the highest interests of Europe. Britain's conspiracy to overthrow Germany will never succeed. He also mentioned the last European war, saying that Germany was not defeated, and no one will be able to defeat Germany in the future. Some news said that Hitler's expression was impatient and extremely uneasy during his speech, which was very different from his usual voice.

[Associated Press, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Hitler responded to Britain with a provocative attitude, saying that if Britain wants war, he is ready to deal with it, and declared that Chamberlain's current attitude will destroy the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Munich Four-Power Agreement. Hitler also said, "If British politicians say that this issue should be resolved through negotiations, I dare say that there have been fifteen years for you to work hard." The politician in the words refers to Chamberlain. Regarding the issue of countries competing to expand their armies, Hitler said, "If other countries want to rearm, others will never be able to stop us from doing the same." Then, he announced that the National Socialist Party Congress to be held in Nuremberg in September of this year will be named the "Peace Congress." Finally, he said, "Today, the time has come to test our strength. The entire German people are ready to mobilize at any time."

The United States Supports Democratic Countries in Wartime

[Reuters, London, 2nd] According to those who listened to Hitler's shortwave broadcast here last night, the shortwave broadcast of the speech was interrupted for a short time shortly after Hitler began his speech.

[London, 1st] Foreign news: The response of Hitler to the declaration of Chamberlain is now being awaited here. It is reported that the original speech of Hitler was scheduled for only fifteen minutes, but it was extended to more than one hour. It was not completed until 5 o'clock (about 2:30 a.m. on the 2nd of this port's time), which shows the importance of Hitler's speech this time. The general public is prepared to give it a deep impression. News from Berlin said that although the reporters from various countries who participated in the launching ceremony in Wilhelmshaven were given a copy of Hitler's speech, they were required to leave the town hall only after Hitler's speech was completed. The spread of this news made the atmosphere here even more tense. Since the day before yesterday, the diplomatic contacts of European capitals have continued unabated, both on the democratic countries' side and on the Axis countries' side.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British authorities have not yet made any statement on Hitler's speech. They will have to study the full text in detail before making a comment.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Hitler's speech openly accepted Britain's challenge against aggression. Hitler refuted Britain point by point and threatened to cancel the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. This is the best way Hitler believes to threaten Britain. Hitler's speech has clearly divided the two major opposing camps in Europe. This is what Britain has repeatedly tried to avoid but could not achieve. The relationship between Britain and Germany has never been as tense as it is now since the end of the continuous war.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] Senator Pittman declared today that Chamberlain's guarantee to Poland has opened the way to European peace. He also said that the U.S. government has recently indicated that in the event of war, the United States is very likely to support democratic countries, or to stop Hitler's future land grabs.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Senator Pittman declared that our government and most of the people are strongly opposed to Hitler's ambitions and his attempt to dominate Europe. Pittman refused to comment on Hitler's speech yesterday, saying only that "recent measures taken by European countries have kept the world's disaster far away."

### New Zealand Implements Social Security Law: Couples Over Sixty Receive Weekly Pension

[Reuters, Wellington, 1st] New Zealand implemented the Social Security Act today. Couples over the age of sixty can receive a pension of three pounds a week from the government. The act stipulates free treatment in hospitals, provision of medicines, and confinement, which is expected to be implemented soon. In addition, it also provides benefits to the disabled and the unemployed. New Zealand Prime Minister Savage told reporters that the act is the best of the social security programs around the world.

### Polish Minister of Commerce Roman Visits Italy to Conduct Commercial Negotiations

[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish Minister of Commerce Roman left here today for Rome at the invitation of the Italian government to hold commercial negotiations with Italy.

### The Roman Pope Will Change His Relationship with Germany

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 2nd] The Italian International Echo newspaper published a report yesterday saying that Pope Pius XII will work to improve the relationship between the Vatican and Germany. Pius has been in Germany for many years and knows that most German Catholics pay close attention to the church, so he is expected to improve to meet the needs of German Catholics.

### German Naval Minister Raeder Receives Medal

[Haitong News Agency, Wilhelmshaven, 2nd] Yesterday, Hitler presided over the launching ceremony of Germany's second large warship, "Tirpitz," here. Then, on the "Schloss," he awarded General Tonnde, the Minister of the Navy, a testimonial to commemorate his 45 years of service in the military.

### Goebbels' Speech Attacks Democratic Countries Again

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article entitled "Who Wants War," which said that the war mentality among Western European democratic countries is developing day by day. In recent weeks, London, Paris, and New York have been stirring up war. Goebbels again attacked the Jews, Marxists, and mutual aid members, saying that "they should be responsible for the increase in war feeling, while centralized countries are only defending their own interests. Enlightened people in Britain and France should not deny the centralized states this right, so enlightened people in all countries who love peace can achieve true peace only by meeting the legitimate and important demands of vigorous nations."

### Rumor has it that Italy will convene a seven-nation conference, and Mussolini's speech will once again demand land

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] It is rumored on the fascist side that Italy intends to convene a seven-nation conference in response to the European war crisis. Mussolini has now returned to Rome from southern Italy and is busy reviewing documents on the European situation.

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Mussolini said in a speech in the city of Capua today that Italy has a large population, and the original land is not enough to develop. Other countries must give us land. We demand what is not prohibited by pen and ink. We are backed by a strong will and red blood.

### The Lithuanian Government Protests to Germany for Violating the Treaty

[Central News Agency, Kaunas, Lithuania, 2nd] The Lithuanian government protested to Germany through the Lithuanian embassy in Germany, saying that Germany had not implemented the regulations of the Lithuanian-German treaty in the Memel region. It is reported that some Lithuanians in the Memel region have been arrested and have suffered economic oppression and damage.

### The British Chief of Staff Will Leave France and Return Home Today

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The British Chief of Staff returned here last night from Strasbourg after inspecting the Maginot Line. The French military and political circles attached great importance to his trip. It is said that he will return to London today.

### The German Ambassador to Argentina Denies Any Intention of Aggression

[Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2nd] The German ambassador formally denied today that Germany had any intention of aggression against Argentina. The aforementioned claim was made after Foreign Minister Otilis met with the German chargé d'affaires to discuss a certain document. The text of the document was written by Mora, the Nazi leader in Argentina, who has now been arrested. Officials are keeping silent, but it is generally believed that Mora's arrest is related to Nazi activities in Argentina.

### Eden's Speech Agrees with Chamberlain's Declaration and Asks the British People to Unite Further

[Reuters, London, 1st] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in New School that he fully agreed with Chamberlain's declaration on Poland and said that he was convinced that this move would be supported by the people of the whole country. He said, "It is unbearable and indignant that there have been rumors that my remarks have implied any difference of opinion among the responsible authorities regarding foreign policy." Eden finally asked the people of the country to unite even more.

### Slovakia is Forced to Cede Land, the Border Dispute with Hungary is Resolved, and Political Circles are Dissatisfied with Germany's Attitude

[Central News Agency, Bratislava, 1st] The dispute between Slovakia and Hungary over the border has been declared resolved because the country has agreed to cede land without any accompanying exchange conditions. The ceded land covers about 30 kilometers and has a population of 60,000, all of whom are said to be Ukrainian and Slovak. Political figures here are saying that Germany has signed a protection agreement with this country to guarantee territorial integrity for a period of 25 years. How can it be that today it is forcing this country to cede land to Hungary? What is the effect of the protection agreement? It is also impossible to understand.

### Foreign Minister of Poland Departs for England; Expected to Arrive in London This Afternoon; Foreign Minister Meets with German and Polish Ambassadors

[Reuters, Polish Capital, 2nd] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck (see right image) departed from here at 1:23 PM today for London. Accompanying Beck were Count Potocki, Director of the Western Department of the Polish Foreign Ministry, and two other members. Before his departure, Beck met with British Ambassador Kennard at the train station. He is expected to arrive in London on Monday afternoon.

(Haitong Agency, London, 2nd) Yesterday afternoon, Polish Ambassador Raczyński visited the British Foreign Office for an hour-long meeting. The discussion centered on preparing the agenda for Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London next week.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Diplomatic activities in Rome, Berlin, and Warsaw continued throughout the day. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had a long telephone conversation with Mussolini, who is currently in southern Italy, and then met with the German Ambassador to Italy and the Polish and German Ambassadors. Subsequently, he met with the German and Polish Ambassadors. After leaving the Italian Foreign Ministry, the Polish Ambassador spoke with Polish authorities by telephone. These diplomatic contacts have led to widespread speculation among Roman observers.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The newspaper "L'Oeuvre" reported that Germany is continuously intensifying its military preparations for an invasion of Poland. 65% of the German air force is concentrated near the Polish border, ready to launch a simultaneous invasion of Poland from four different locations. The newspaper concluded that Germany's plans have not alarmed Poland, and Poland is prepared to meet German aggression head-on.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] According to a dispatch from the Katowice News Agency, two officials from the German consulate in that city were seriously injured today after being beaten by Poles. The owner of a German printing company in Jaworzno was also reportedly injured by Poles for speaking German.

Italian Dissatisfaction; Germany Pressures Poland

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Diplomatic circles here say that Italian newspapers have recently declared that Italy is quite dissatisfied with Germany's pressure on Poland, resembling its disapproval of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Italy maintains sincere friendship with Hungary and also favors Poland, viewing this as an extension of its friendship with Hungary. At this critical moment, Italy will undoubtedly strive to prevent Germany from invading Poland. At the same time, it will also prevent Poland from establishing permanent ties with Britain. It is unlikely that Mussolini intends to mediate between Germany and Poland, as Hitler will certainly reject it outright.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 31st] Experienced observers here have recently commented on German policy, stating that while Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is about to visit England, Germany's main goal is to put pressure on Poland, satirizing the unreliability of British and French aid. However, Germany may not engage in conflict with Poland at this time due to two reasons: (1) Poland's resistance is quite strong, and (2) Italy is very concerned about Poland, as evidenced by Foreign Minister Ciano's recent visit to Warsaw. If a conflict were to occur between Germany and Poland under these circumstances, the Rome-Berlin Axis would inevitably be weakened. (3) If the German-Polish dispute were to lead to war, it would be even more disadvantageous than a war caused by Italy's colonial demands. Therefore, it can be asserted that Hitler will continue to expand his influence in Eastern Europe by peaceful means and avoid armed conflict at all costs.

French Diplomatic Circles Comment on the Polish Situation

[Central News Agency, Paris, 31st] Diplomatic circles here recently stated that since Germany occupied the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, peace-loving countries have considered forming a coalition to resist. Now that Germany is threatening Poland, this idea has become even more compelling. Germany's goals are: (1) to gain territory from Poland, and (2) to force Poland to remain neutral, allowing Germany to develop in other directions without worry. Since annexing Czechoslovakia and reclaiming the Memel region, Germany has surrounded Poland, which has already felt uneasy. In addition, during recent talks with Germany, Germany made three demands: (1) a certain area in Poland should be returned to Germany, (2) Germany should be allowed to build a highway through the Polish Corridor, and (3) new temporary measures should be established for the Free City of Danzig as a preliminary step to German annexation. Germany's desire to control Poland is evident here. However, Poland has also decided to resist, rejecting the first and second demands. Regarding the third, it only agreed to seriously consider it. It is rumored that Germany has delivered an ultimatum to Poland, but both the German and Polish governments have denied it. However, diplomatic circles here still say that it is true that German troops are on high alert near the Polish border. In light of this, the British government has decided to accept new constraints on Poland and provide guarantees. Poland, in addition to declaring that it would maintain ties with Romania if attacked by Germany, has not accepted any restrictions from Britain, lest Germany uses it as an excuse.

### Mrs. Tabouis Predicts the European Situation; Exposes German Ambitions; Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Should Unite to Resist

[London, 1st] Mrs. Tabouis recently published an article in "L'Œuvre" predicting the European situation, stating that unless Britain and France form a common front and invite the Soviet Union to join, Hitler's ambitions will have no end. Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia will gradually come under Germany's direct control. As for Belgium and the countries along the northern Polish sea, which have been subjected to constant political pressure since June, they will inevitably be forced to satisfy Germany's great desires. The sudden hardening of the attitude of Western democratic countries has made Germany worry about going to war with them, and Germany's desire for Poland to maintain military neutrality is also very strong. In terms of the eastward advance policy, Poland's position has a very significant impact. Therefore, Germany expects the first guarantee from Poland to be the immediate delivery of the iron ore from Upper Silesia to Germany. The French side has sensed the seriousness of this matter and believes that if anything happens, Germany will occupy the northern Polish territory bordering Slovakia. Germany's offensive towards Romania is also very obvious. Hungarian Prime Minister Horthy has agreed to Germany's request to dissolve the parliament, hold elections, suppress domestic political parties, reorganize the Hungarian army, and allow German troops to pass through Hungary to occupy the Romanian oil fields, using Romania's occupation of the city of Ruthenia as an excuse. Germany has also instructed Italy to attack Albania if anything happens. At this time, Yugoslavia will be controlled by Germany and Italy and forced to submit. The Nordic countries were recently warned that if Germany goes to war with the West, they must supply all minerals and products to the totalitarian countries, otherwise their coasts will be blockaded by Germany. At noon on March 15, Hitler drafted a detailed plan to send ultimatums to the Baltic countries and Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, demanding that they strongly resist the Soviet Union's invasion of the Baltic Sea, otherwise they would be occupied by German troops. On the active side, a "Belgian Affairs Bureau" has been established to prepare for Belgium. If the Soviet military authorities and the British General Staff fail to immediately reach an agreement, Poland's resistance to Germany will be hopeless. The Soviet Union advocates for a

Clear and Firm Agreement, otherwise the Soviet Union will stand aside. The Soviet Union does not feel threatened by Germany, Germany's purpose is economic, but it still wants to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Although Britain and France have the Soviet Union as an ally, they will also feel quite difficult when dealing with Germany and Italy. If the Soviet Union is further sidelined, the European situation will be even more hopeless.

### After the Occupation of Spratly Island, France Protests to Japan; American Newspapers Say Its Importance Will Increase; Mocking Japan's Ambitions

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 2nd] According to newspapers here, the French government has protested to Tokyo about Japan's occupation of Spratly Island, declaring the island to be French territory in principle.

[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] Today's "The Times" editorial said that six years ago, France already felt the importance of Spratly Island to French Indochina, but yesterday the Japanese flag was hoisted on the island without resistance. If the island was already important, its importance has suddenly increased since Japan occupied it. From Spratly to Hong Kong, Manila, Hainan Island, Saigon, Singapore, and Borneo, it only takes a few hours by plane, so if disputes occur in Europe in the future, Japan may take action in various places.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] The "New York Times" recently published an editorial on Japan's annexation of the Spratly Islands, titled "Japan's Old Habits Return," which stated that this group of islands has been incorporated into France. While Japan is committed to issues vital to its survival, it has brushed aside the Spratly Islands, which are extremely important to that country. A few months ago, it forcibly seized Hainan Island in China, and now it has raised its flag on a group of islands 700 miles south of that island. This is another example of Japan's usual tactics.

### The Spanish Civil War Completely Ends; The United States Decides to Recognize Franco; Cancels the Order Prohibiting the Shipment of Arms to Spain

[Haitong Agency, Madrid, 2nd] The Franco government issued a final military communiqué, stating that the Spanish Civil War has completely ended, that the Franco army has achieved its final goal, and that the Red Army has been completely disarmed.

[Haitong Agency, Washington, 2nd] Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull announced that the United States had decided to recognize the Franco government in Burgos.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The American government has decided to legally recognize Franco as the leader of Spain. The government has cancelled its order prohibiting the export of weapons to Spain.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States has now recognized the Franco government of Spain. This decision is unconditional. The U.S. government has telegraphed the Franco government in Burgos, notifying them that the United States will restore normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. As for who the United States will send as ambassador to Spain, it has not yet been decided. At the same time, the U.S. President also signed a declaration in Warm Springs, cancelling the order prohibiting the shipment of weapons to Spain, and said that "there is no longer a civil war in Spain."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] U.S. Secretary of State Hull formally announced today when meeting with reporters that the United States has recognized the Spanish Nationalist government. According to news, the Nationalist government recognized by the United States does not violate its principle of denying aggressors. The United States denies "Manchukuo" and also denies Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Germany's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, but recognizes the Franco government because the actions of German and Italian troops in Spain have not been officially recognized.

### The Czech Republic's Debt to the British; England is Seriously Dealing With It

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British government is seriously dealing with the issue of Czechoslovakia's debt to the British people. The Bank of England, on behalf of the Treasury, is currently seeking detailed reports on bonds, commercial stocks, bank deposits, and all other debts invested in the Czech government or companies, except for commercial debts and debts in the Sudeten region.

Current Commentary

### The Embarrassed Actions of the Aggression Front

Since the painful experience of the fall of Czechoslovakia proved the mistake of the appeasement diplomacy of Britain and France, the prestige of the Soviet Union has increased in the world, and the democratic peace front has begun to embark on the road of consolidation and expansion. Therefore, the actions of the fascist aggressor group of Germany, Italy, and Japan have become embarrassed. On the one hand, as the power of aggression develops, the internal contradictions of the aggressive groups become more acute. On the other hand, due to the severity of the domestic and foreign crises of various countries, they have to strengthen the "axis" to support it. Thus, the newspapers in the past few days have found many contradictory and ridiculous news about the aggressor countries.

At the same time, observing the recent expansion of the anti-Soviet and especially anti-British movements on the Japanese side, Germany has also begun large-scale anti-British activities, such as Hitler's April 1 speech publicly tearing up the Anglo-German naval agreement and scolding Britain. These actions by Japan and Germany are clearly a reaction to Britain's recent closeness to the Soviet Union and the stronger attitudes of Britain and France. It can be said that the aggression front has been passively forced back for the first time.

However, we must recognize that, as far as the current situation is concerned, the fascist aggression front will not only not disintegrate, but will also be strengthened. Mussolini's speech in late March particularly emphasized adherence to the German-Italian axis, and Hitler's speech on April 1 further stated that "the German-Italian axis will continue in all situations and times." The Japan-Germany commercial agreement is indeed in progress, and Germany is once again brewing a plot to induce China to surrender. Therefore, we must say that it is a mistake to emphasize the division of the aggression front today. If we weaken our vigilance against the aggressors as a result, and if we harbor any illusions about a certain country in the aggression front, then it must be considered a crime.

### Agreement Between British and Australian Governments; Australia Supplies Military Aircraft to Hong Kong; Australian Aircraft Factory Can Manufacture 60 Aircraft Per Month, Reaching Over 200 During Wartime; Hong Kong Army Authorities Will Continue to Recruit Chinese Engineers

The British government, in view of the approaching world war, is preparing its army with utmost urgency, allowing no slack. At the same time, it is strengthening the defenses of the colonies as actively as the island of Britain. According to Western reports from Hong Kong, the British government has reached an agreement with the Australian government to build several aircraft manufacturing plants of considerable scale in Australia to supply military aircraft to British Aden, Ceylon, India, Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, Fiji, New Zealand and Australian bases. The details are as follows:

Manufacturing New Aircraft to Supply to British Territories

According to the plan, the Australian aircraft factory will produce 60 aircraft per month in peacetime, expanding its production to 200 to 210 aircraft during wartime. The type of aircraft has been agreed upon by the British and Australian governments, adopting the latest British models. In fact, these latest military aircraft are still being rushed by British aircraft factories and have not yet been delivered to the Air Force Department. These military aircraft are twin-engined, with the highest connection rate and can travel long distances, making them most suitable for defending Australia. Each aircraft is worth approximately 30,000 pounds. Based on this calculation, Australian aircraft production will be worth 20 million pounds in peacetime and can increase to 60 to 70 million pounds during wartime. The Australian government estimates that it can add 40 aircraft each year, costing approximately 1.2 million pounds. The British government hopes that the plan can start as soon as possible, and the British Air Force has recently sent many air force experts to inspect and plan.

Hong Kong Army Authorities Continue to Recruit Chinese Engineers

In addition, the Hong Kong military authorities have spared no effort in constructing Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. Due to the vastness of the construction, the existing British troops are not enough to be deployed. Therefore, the army authorities have recruited Chinese engineers. Up to now, the seventh batch has been recruited, with the number of people reaching nearly 300. According to investigations by reporters, the Hong Kong Army Headquarters needs to use a large number of engineers to build fortifications, and now it wants to recruit again. It is expected that a formal notice will be issued soon. Chinese engineers are responsible for electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering, with electrical and mechanical being the most important. The initial salary for enlisted engineers is 75 cents per day, and they are promoted in five levels, depending on their intelligence or skills. Those who have studied engineering are relatively easy to be promoted. At the fifth level, the daily salary is approximately two dollars. In addition to the salary, a certain amount of pounds will be issued annually for uniform fees. Last year, the army authorities recruited Chinese to join the heavy artillery unit for training, which has been going on for several months. It is heard that the results are not very good, and the authorities currently have no intention of continuing to recruit. However, the current period is a trial period. If it is believed that the personnel are not sufficient for deployment in the future, another recruitment will be held, which is also unpredictable. In addition, a part of the Chinese engineers who have been trained will be assigned to various forts to be in charge of searchlights and anti-aircraft lights, and the results are quite good.

### × Country Summer Fabrics are Massively Transported to Hong Kong; The Amount Currently Arriving in Hong Kong Has Reached Tens of Thousands of Dollars; Disguised as Domestic Products and Other Trademarks for Sale

Recently, the quantity of various goods produced in × country and transported to Hong Kong for sale has increased again. According to reliable sources, in the past one or two months, another large batch of textiles has arrived in Hong Kong, with a value of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In addition to a portion of these × country textiles being rayon, ready to be transshipped to various occupied areas in Guangdong Province, a portion is counterfeit products from other countries, taking advantage of the summer fabric market in Hong Kong for

Mass Sales in Hong Kong, and Some are even disguised as Chinese-made fabrics.

In recent months, many × goods falsely claiming to be Chinese products have been discovered in Hong Kong, transported from occupied areas such as Shanghai, and sold in Hong Kong or transshipped to various parts of the country. Therefore, in recent months, this kind of counterfeit × goods has been sold smoothly in the city. This kind of counterfeit domestic goods is mostly textile textiles. Since our coastal ports have been successively occupied, the domestic handicraft textile industry has become extremely developed. Because the raw materials produced in Europe and the United States are expensive, × has taken advantage of this weakness to

Disguise × goods as domestic products, trademarks, and transport them to the mainland for sale. Mainland merchants take advantage of their low prices to purchase in large quantities. ×

### After the Fall of Jiangmen and Chongqing; Yesterday's Hong Kong-Macau Vessels Carried 3,000 Refugees; Traffic Between Jiangmen and Macau Remains Severed; Hong Kong Merchants Temporarily Suspend Transporting Goods to the Mainland

After the fall of Jiangmen, many Siyi refugees fled to Hong Kong and Macau to avoid innocent sacrifices. The vessels on the Hong Kong-Macau transportation line carried approximately 3,000 refugees yesterday, with very little cargo. According to a refugee who recently escaped from Jiangmen, the traffic between Jiangmen and Macau remains severed. Refugees from Lianhetang outside Jiangmen are taking Xiaohang Road to Shiqi to take the Qiguan car to Macau. Currently, the Qiguan Company is overwhelmed because the demand for vehicles exceeds the supply. Therefore, the black cars from Qi to Macau have raised their prices, charging 30 yuan per person for the fare. Rickshaws also charge 20 yuan, and those riding on the back of bicycles also charge 10 yuan, and there are still many people walking along the way. In addition, the vessels from Hong Kong merchants to Macau in the past two days have transported very few goods to the mainland, because the Jiangmen war has affected the merchants, and all merchants have stopped shipping goods for the time being. Even daily necessities and textiles have been temporarily suspended, fearing that they will be detained by × after being transported in.

The group has received assistance from enthusiastic schools such as Sacred Heart, Ling Tao, and Xin Xiu in the past two weeks, allowing them to shine shoes, and the results have been very good.

### Not Forgetting Patriotism and Love for the Homeland in Distant Lands; Cuban Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Care About the National Crisis; The Disaster Relief Branch Sent Kwong Sau-wok Back Home with Funds; Investigating the Situation of Refugees and Conducting Relief Work

Since the beginning of our country's war of resistance, the Cuban Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Disaster Relief Branch has been promoting donations and bond purchases among local overseas Chinese, sparing no effort, and the results have been extremely satisfactory. It has donated approximately 100,000 Hong Kong dollars to the National Government and more than 2 million yuan in national salvation bonds. The association has recently become increasingly concerned about the protection and relief of the homeland due to the increasingly tense war in South China. Therefore, last month, it specially sent representative Kwong Sau-wok back to China to investigate the recent situation of the county, and brought with him a donation of 11,800 Hong Kong dollars. Half of these funds were allocated by the association to the Hong Kong Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Association to provide relief to refugees, and the other half was entrusted to Guo Quan, Chairman of the Hong Kong Zhongshan Overseas Merchants Association, to handle, and handed over to Zhang Huichang, the county magistrate of the county, to purchase military equipment, strengthen forces, and protect the county.

### Joint Performance by Children's Theater Troupes; Performance Postponed to Mid-Month; Lu Feng Will Perform a Play Tomorrow Night to Raise Funds for Refugee Children

The Hong Kong Children's Theater Troupe's joint performance of "Long Live Children" was originally scheduled to be performed on Children's Day on April 4. Since the preparation, all aspects of the work have been actively carried out.

The repertoire includes "Reconstruction," "Branding," and "Resurrection." The funds raised will be donated to the Children's Welfare Association to provide relief to refugee children.

### Police Detectives Departed in the Rain Yesterday to Search Various Villages in the New Territories; Determined to Strengthen Police Security in the New Territories to Advance the Pursuit and Arrest of Criminals; Link Up with New Territories Gentry and Residents to Eradicate Banditry

The Hong Kong Police authorities, in view of the recent rampant banditry on the Peninsula, with robbery cases occurring frequently almost every day, and the previously tranquil villages of the New Territories also becoming a world of bandits, with frequent reports of farmers being robbed and killed, have planned to strengthen the police detective forces in various districts such as Yaumatei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui, and Kowloon Tong Police Stations, to intensify vigilance and patrol the streets, and have strictly ordered detectives to conscientiously investigate opium dens, gambling houses, and the movements of residents in general buildings, residential areas, and boats on the sea. As for the New Territories side:

New Territories Aspect: The police authorities are also paying close attention. The situation in the New Territories is considered to be more complicated than that of Hong Kong Island because the land is vast, and villages are scattered everywhere. In addition to the original local farmers residing there, many people from the Mainland seeking refuge in Hong Kong have recently rented houses there. Good and bad people are mixed together, and it is easier to hide weapons in villages and mountain huts than in any other area. If not thoroughly and secretly investigated, it would be difficult to detect such activities. Therefore, to eradicate banditry in Hong Kong, the defense of the New Territories and the

Measures for Arresting Criminals cannot be neglected. Under the plan to strengthen the public security forces on the Peninsula, the police authorities have decided to increase the number of Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers and detectives in various districts of the New Territories in a short period. At the same time, they will maintain close contact with local gentry and villagers to assist each other and promote the efficiency of arrests. When necessary, they will take further steps to organize a community defense system based on the Mainland's "Baojia" system to prevent criminals from hiding. Yesterday afternoon, amid pouring rain, more than ten Chinese and Western police detectives from the Peninsula, led by Chinese Detective Chief Shi Dui and British Detective Assistant Superintendent, departed in several vehicles to the New Territories.

Searching Villages in many places, according to reports, prior intelligence suggested that undesirable elements were hiding in certain villages in the New Territories, which were related to the continuous occurrence of robberies in the New Territories. Detective Chief Shi immediately reported the situation to his superiors, who dispatched a team to search the area. They returned to Hong Kong at around 8 p.m. that night. However, after searching many places, they did not find any suspects or contraband. Nevertheless, the police authorities are determined to maintain law and order in the New Territories and will begin implementing various actions based on the newly decided steps, hoping to achieve rapid results.

### Police Chinese Clerks Request Improved Treatment; Earnestly Request Revision of Grades and Salaries

The Chinese clerks in the Hong Kong Police Force, feeling that the cost of living is increasing day by day and their salaries are meager, and for the sake of grades and salary system, have jointly petitioned the Hong Kong government to improve the grades and salary system.

### Overseas × Ships Run Amok Again; 16 of Our Fishing Boats Suffer; After Extensive Search and Robbery, They Seize All the Boats; Another Coal Boat is Burned, and Many Crew Members are Missing

Since the Anti-Japanese War, our coastal fishing boats have repeatedly suffered from the ravages of × ships. Yesterday, March 29, seventeen Yu boats and cargo boats in the waters outside Hong Kong, the North and South Ports, and Ma Yükou, were seized by ×. One of them was burned en route, which was extremely tragic. According to fishermen who narrowly escaped and arrived in Hong Kong, they were fishing in groups on the morning of the 29th of last month, scattering nets in the Chinese territories of Changbo opposite the South Port and Ma Yü, the North Port. Suddenly, a × destroyer, a armed fishing boat, and three speedboats came head-on. They were unable to escape and were captured. A total of three fishing boats were captured. At the same time, a armed submarine of the × Navy sailed from behind South Ao Mountain in the North Port sea area. Seven fishing boats fishing there were also captured. After the × ships seized the boats, they converged at the foot of South Ao Mountain, a total of ten ships, arranged in a row. At about 1 p.m. that afternoon, four more fishing boats and one large sailboat were sailing in the waters outside Ma Yükou and South Port. The × ships spotted them and dispatched three merchant ships to seize them. At the same time, two coal boats anchored near Da Sui were also seized by ×. On the way, × actually set one of them on fire. Of the more than ten crew members, only five managed to escape. The fate of the others is unknown. According to statistics, a total of sixteen fishing boats and cargo boats were seized, and one coal boat was burned.

### Connecting Friendship, Promoting Proper Entertainment: A Record of the Amateur Social Club

— Qi Zhuo

The Amateur Social Club Held an Enlarged Welcome Meeting for New Members Yesterday

Vitality must be developed; what about spare time? Many people feel that they should not indulge in cards, dancing, going to tea houses, and watching movies—poisonous movies. They will not find true happiness in these aspects. Therefore, they stay away from the "licentious and shameless" side and move towards the "serious and lively" side.

Every time the night falls, and the "neon" lights temptingly illuminate the night city, you can see people in Chinese clothes, in suits, men and women, leaving the office one by one, eating their fill, and gathering one after another at the premises at 23 Connaught Road. Although climbing the four-story building without an elevator is strenuous, their excited steps make them take two steps at a time. This is the address of the Hong Kong Amateur Social Club. The sea breeze blows in gusts, looking out at the clouds, they have to throw themselves into the embrace of nature, even though this is "black smoke"-filled Hong Kong.

Reading newspapers, playing ping pong, learning Mandarin, learning Cantonese, improving singing, acting in plays, and there are also reading groups, current affairs forums... Everything that can allow vitality to develop in beneficial ways is available. You can play whatever you like. There is laughter and talk. It is both serious and lively. This is truly a good place for leisure. When the club was officially established at the Confucius Hall, which was on January 8 this year, there were only more than 180 members. As a result of recent recruitment, there are now more than 480 new members. Yesterday, the club held an enlarged social gathering to welcome new members at the Confucius Hall. The grand occasion was even more enthusiastic, and the progress in all aspects was even more impressive and inspiring.

Although the weather was gloomy, with densely overcast skies, when it came to the three-and-a-half sentence skit, the sky was clear and the sun was shining. The Confucius Hall was immediately filled with new and old members of the club, as well as family members and guests, reaching a considerable number of seven or eight hundred people.

The laughter of adults and the shouts of children, calling to each other, filled the entire venue with a harmonious and joyful atmosphere.

After the ceremony, Chairman Yao Jianhou delivered the opening speech. In addition to enthusiastically stating the recent progress of the club's affairs, he particularly pointed out the three points that they should do: (1) To increase knowledge in collective life, (2) To replace improper entertainment with proper entertainment; (3); To contribute all our strength to the motherland and strive for the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

The words were concise and moving. Then came the report of the club's affairs, "The first thing we have done in the past is to establish a library; the second is to respond to various patriotic movements; the third is to establish a theater troupe and a singing team; the fourth is to publish three periodicals on academic aspects, organize reading groups, current affairs forums, lectures, Mandarin classes, Cantonese classes... etc. Fifth, in terms of social events, there are weekly trips, picnics... etc. Sixth, in terms of services for members, we have contacted many shops, companies, bookstores, and newspapers to offer preferential treatment to members."

The speech was given by Mr. Guo Butao, the editor of this newspaper, by prior appointment. He earnestly spoke about the importance of lifelong learning in amateur social groups. He also cited his own experience in the newspaper industry as an example. The more he spoke, the more vigorous he became, talking non-stop for more than an hour.

The "National Covenant" was sworn in a formal ceremony. Everyone stood reverently to take the oath. Mr. Wang Junheng sincerely encouraged everyone to strictly abide by the oath, which is the meaning of the oath. The victory of the Anti-Japanese War also depends on the revitalization of all our people. After Fang Yuansheng awarded prizes to the five members with the best performance in recruiting members, the entertainment began.

Singing, harmonica, dancing... etc. In addition to the club's performances, there were also groups such as the China Amateur School Choir, the Commercial Press Choir, and the Yau Chung Kindergarten participating. The most exciting program was the ventriloquism and dialect performance by Mr. Tu Yunfu, a member of the club. The sounds of various birds and animals, as well as dozens of dialects and tunes from Peiping to Central and Southern China, were vividly and humorously presented, causing everyone to laugh and applaud.

Finally, the club's theater troupe performed the anti-feudal drama "Other Bitter Women," which was quite moving. There was also an anti-× drama "Black Shadow," but because the light was dim, it was announced that it would be seen next time.

### A Casual Talk about Flower Cloth Street

Hong Kong's "Flower Cloth Street" is just like Guangzhou's "Yang Lane." They are both big markets for woolen fabrics and flower cloths. To put it humorously, they can be said to be sisters. However, today's Yang Lane in Guangzhou, one does not know to what extent it has been ravaged and trampled by the ferocious wolf's × people. If Yang Lane, Guangzhou, and even every inch of our lost territory, have not been restored to its original beauty and prosperity, and if our "national hatred" has not been eliminated, then our responsibility cannot be relaxed for a moment, but must be intensified!

"Flower Cloth Street" is located in the Central District, with its two ends connecting the middle part of Queen's Road and Des Voeux Road, only one hundred and several tens of yards away from the Central Market, known as the only one in the Far East. Its original name was Shui On Street. Precisely because the poetic "nickname" was established, the real name gradually became blurred under the influence of metabolism, and almost made people forget it.

"Flower Cloth Street" is such an ordinary market that there is originally nothing worth recording, and people who live in Hong Kong can generally know its outline. However, the enlightenment of facts is that we can always find extraordinary stories in the ordinary. This story is what I want to introduce to the readers.

There are a total of 57 fabric shops and "stalls" on "Flower Cloth Street," but only 21 of them have the "Certificate of Eradicating Inferior Goods" issued by the Fabric Merchant Association hanging in their shops. So, does that mean that those without this certificate are all places selling inferior goods? That was what I was thinking at the time. Later, after some investigation, I realized that those without the certificate simply had not joined the Fabric Merchant Association as members. However, local newspapers in Hong Kong often have records of the surge in the sale of × goods in Hong Kong. Why has the market for × goods changed from dead to booming again? If we explore the root, we will not find it difficult to get an answer.

Many friends who come to Hong Kong from the Mainland want to buy some things to take back with them, because in their eyes, everything here is duty-free and cheap. They only hate that they do not have so much money in their pockets, otherwise they would buy the entire Hong Kong market clean." So flower cloth is also one of the markets that they want to buy.

As soon as you walk into "Flower Cloth Street," you will feel the surging crowds and the mixed sounds, constantly piercing your eyes and ears, "Buy it... it's cheap... one penny and six yards, big... aunt." The glib shop assistants cast greedy eyes, stretched out their necks, and raised their voices, uttering those frivolous and slippery sounds to every female guest. The shop assistants here do not seem to welcome single men or female customers accompanied by men. The most welcomed are still groups of three or five "misses." Although they do not necessarily patronize when they go to the shop, the shop assistants tirelessly pile the fabrics they consider to be "beautiful" on top of the goods. If you are a single man, go there and casually ask the price, and there is no "transaction," at the very least, they will secretly scold you "dou ni gui" ("dou ni gui" means no money in the bag), and may even curse you!

I do not intend to slander them, but the fact is still the fact, and I cannot hide it. But does that mean that all the shop assistants there are like that? Not necessarily. In a town of ten houses, there must be honest people. There are also many who can truly serve customers, work diligently, and keep their eyes on the task at hand. However, we must understand the principle of "a bad apple spoils the whole bunch." Therefore, I hope that they can encourage each other to carry out a cleaning movement, reward the outstanding ones, correct the corrupted ones, and even impose appropriate and due punishments, to maintain commercial ethics. Then, they can still be considered outstanding people who know the times, otherwise, their future will only be gradually heading towards the path of decline and destruction! (New)

### Situation in Northern Guangdong on the Eve of the Storm: Front Lines Have Had Daily Skirmishes; Our Army Is Steadily Advancing and Seizing Opportunities to Attack

(Northern Guangdong Express News) In recent weeks, the situation on the front lines of Northern Guangdong has seen our × and the × still facing each other in their original positions. Although the × in Conghua and Huaxian are constantly violating our alert territories, they are only probing and do not have any major actions. Our Northern Route Counter-Offensive Military has been actively deploying and reorganizing in recent days and will soon be unveiled.

Our Army Monitors the × in Conghua

The × troops coming to Northern Guangdong, seeing that our large army on the northern route is moving south in a steady stream and that a counter-offensive is about to begin, have urgently increased troop deployments to Huaxian to resist stubbornly, attempting to act foolishly. Therefore, in the past ten days, the × troops on the front lines have frequently encroached on our positions. According to reports, the military command has telegraphed orders to our troops stationed in various parts of Northern Guangdong to advance gradually, closely monitor the ×, advance steadily, and seize opportunities to attack. Since our army closely monitors the × troops entrenched in Conghua and Huaxian, the × troops are afraid of our heavy blows and have been confined to a corner, daring not to offend us. Once the troops from each unit have reached their respective goals, they will launch a large-scale counter-offensive against the × in a coordinated manner.

Guerrillas Are Active on the Guangzhou-Huaxian Line

The × troops entrenched in Huaxian, Xinjie, Hengtan, Longkou, and other places have been causing trouble in the surrounding areas in recent days. Therefore, the local people have joined the guerrillas to kill ×. Villagers in Xinjie, Shizi Ridge, Zhanghua, and Changgang have organized commando teams. Therefore, the guerrillas are very active. On the morning of March 27, more than 100 × infantry and cavalry troops moved from Xinjie back to Changgang near the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway for a rotation of defenses. Our guerrilla team from a certain unit detected this and ambushed them at a narrow, strategically important location near Changgang. The × troops were caught off guard and were continuously shot and killed by our troops. The × troops then fired fiercely at our troops with artillery fire. Our team used the terrain to fight back and fought fiercely for a long time. The × troops could not withstand the attack and fled. In this battle, we seized several guns and ammunition, two × flags, and many documents. A field diary found on the body of Kishiyama, a × soldier who was killed, has been handed over to a certain local unit for safekeeping.

Military Dignitaries Complete Patrol of Defenses

According to military news, Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, seeing that the military operations to counter-attack Guangzhou are about to begin, has organized a tour of the defense lines to boost morale. He recently organized an inspection tour of the defense lines. Now that the defense of the northern route is important, he specially dispatched a certain military dignitary to patrol the front lines of the northern Guangdong route. It has been learned that the officer has arrived in a certain area of Guangdong and has separately met with the commanders of the defending armies to inquire about everything and give instructions on combat tactics. It is reported that the task has now been completed. It will return to Shaoguan during the day to report to Commander Zhang Fakui. Furthermore, it has been learned that since the tour of the defense lines by the dignitary, the morale of the armies on the front lines has been boosted, and the strength of the defenses has become more consolidated.

### Our Defenses in Xinhui Are Consolidated; Situation in Zhongshan Is Calm; × Ships Harass Chixi, Taishan; × Planes Bomb Xinhui and Kaiping Extensively

(Macau Express News) Since the sudden capture of Ronggui by the × troops on the 27th, Jiangmen and Shiqi were simultaneously in a state of emergency. That night, the × troops dispatched naval, land, and air forces to attack Jiangmen in three routes. Our team joined forces with the regular army to intercept and engage the enemy. After nine days of bloody battles, the × troops suffered more than a thousand casualties. Later, because the × troops' artillery fire was too fierce, our fortifications were completely destroyed, and we had extracted a considerable price from the × troops, we withdrew from Jiangmen and concentrated near the county seat to continue the war. A fierce battle took place on one evening in the suburbs of the county seat, annihilating many × troops. The × troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Jiangmen. We seized the opportunity to counter-attack Jiangmen and are still engaged in a mixed battle.

The Defenses of Xinhui Are Consolidated

After the fierce battle in Jiangmen, our army shifted its positions and advanced to Xinhui County. The front lines were placed in the Fengshan mountains to block the × troops' advance. When Changjiangdou fell, our army in Tangxia was still fighting with the × troops. Later, with the fall of Jiangmen, the Tangxia line became prominent and has retreated towards Shaping. At present, we have laid out a horizontal and vertical battle formation between Shaping and Xinhui County. The local teams of Heshan and Xinhui counties are jointly holding the line. The regular army units of Chen Zhangyang He and others have also joined forces with the local teams to defend together. There is no concern for the defense of the county seat.

× Ships Harass Chixi, Taishan

When Jiangmen was in an emergency, many × ships sailed to the waters of Chixi, Taishan and constantly fired artillery shells at our coastal villages. There was also a × aircraft carrier in the Huanghai area, flying to the Baisha and Yueshan areas of Taishan to carry out atrocities. The city of Baisha was hit by several bombs, resulting in more than 100 casualties.

Situation in Zhongshan Is Calm

Currently, our guerrilla forces in the county are extremely active and are working with the regular army to surround the × troops attacking Huicheng. In order to save the situation, the × troops dispatched multiple planes to bomb Xinhui and Kaiping extensively. The people in Kaiping have been evacuating one after another, and few people remain. Because telegraphs and telephones are not working, the details are unknown. The × troops did not expect such fierce resistance when they attacked Jiangmen this time, resulting in heavy casualties. It is expected that they will not have the strength to penetrate deeply. Therefore, the situation in Zhongshan has become slightly calmer in recent days.

### Dumping of × Goods: Large Quantities of Guangdong × Goods Disguised and Mixed for Sale

[Macau Express News] Since the × army occupied Guangzhou, their accompanying merchant group has been vigorously seeking to develop commerce in Guangdong and implement their economic aggression. They have recently been dumping goods stored in Huangpu warehouses at low prices. The largest items include kerosene, matches, and raw oil. Furthermore, in the old Nanguo Promotion Center opposite Sincere Department Store on Changdi, now renamed the Military Economic Class Promotion Center, cosmetics, canned goods, etc., are displayed, with young boys employed to sell them. Additionally, the Fuda Company is recruiting agents for wholesale distribution. It is rumored that each case of kerosene is sold for only six military notes, which is one-third cheaper than foreign Eagle brand. Each can of raw oil is sixteen yuan, and each case of matches (120 packets) is sold for ten yuan. Therefore, a group of traitors, seeking profit, are disguising the goods and selling them inland. In recent days, kerosene and raw oil along the West River have been very cheap. Ignorant villagers, attracted by the low price, are vying to buy and use them. Our authorities are now strictly preventing this, it is said.

### Wu Qiqing Actively Deploys: Eastern Route Counter-offensive Imminent. Chi Zhongkuan and Zhai Rongji Appointed as Commander and Deputy Commander. Striving to Coordinate and Correct Past Disorganization.

[Huiyang Express News] Regarding the military affairs of the Eastern Route Counter-offensive, General Commander Wu Qiqing, in addition to ordering his troops to aggressively advance towards the × army strongholds in Dongguan and Zengcheng counties, is striving to enrich all deployments to obtain the most favorable combat results and ensure victory. The vanguard troops have already made contact with the × army and gained a favorable position. The latest military situation is as follows:

Chi and Zhai Inspect Hui and Dong Regions

Wu Qiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Army Group and Commander of the Eastern Route, in order to strengthen the defense capabilities on both sides of the Dong River and increase the chances of annihilating the × army, has appointed Chi Zhongkuan as the Commander of the South Bank of the Dong River and Zhai Rongji as the Deputy Commander, responsible for the operations of the local forces in Dongguan, Bao'an, Huizhou, and Boluo counties. Chi and Zhai, after receiving their orders, have officially taken office. Commander Chi arrived in Huizhou yesterday, the 31st, summoned the guerrilla commanders of the Third District, Luo Fengxiang, Liang Zhu, and Bu Zhiyang, Lin Junsheng, and other branch and team leaders, gave instructions on the offensive plan, consulted on all matters, and inspected the various local forces. Deputy Commander Zhai Rongji has also arrived in Dongguan and met with the guerrilla commanders of the Fourth District, Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, Luo Kun, etc., to make detailed plans for attacking Shilong, Dongguan City, and Taiping. On the 31st and the 1st, he inspected the front lines of the Huizhou-Dongguan Highway and the Kowloon Railway.

Third and Fourth Districts Closely Coordinate

Furthermore, it is noted that after attending the provincial guerrilla conference and returning to their defense areas, the guerrilla commanders of the Third District, Luo Fengxiang, and the Fourth District, Wang Ruozhou, are earnestly following the resolutions of the conference and the various plans instructed by the highest military commanders, prioritizing them according to urgency and implementing them step by step. Considering that the strength of the various local forces in the past did not meet the expected standards, and coordination was somewhat disorganized, which greatly affected combat effectiveness, in addition to making major adjustments, they are now jointly discussing a coordination plan for the local forces of the two districts. They have decided to establish a clear defense line for the subordinate regiments and teams, establish a close communication organization, improve the intelligence network, and mutually dispatch officers, so that they can consult on all matters nearby, coordinate closely, and jointly defend, thereby enhancing combat capabilities.

### Pseudo-Organization Emerges in Zengcheng: Liu ×× Dresses Up as an Official

(Huiyang Express News) The invading × army, adhering to its consistent policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese," is actively establishing puppet regimes. Dongguan, Panyu, Nanhai, and Shunde counties have already been established. Those that have not yet been organized are in active preparation. It is now found that Zengcheng County, under the protection of the × army, also produced a pseudo-maintenance association on the 29th, with ×× as the pseudo-maintenance association chairman. After the traitor Liu dressed up as an official, he flattered the × army in a servile manner. In recent days, he has dispatched henchmen to various villages to search for dozens of young women, detain them and return them to the county town as tributes to the × army for ravaging.

### Guangzhou × Army Fears Our Guerrilla Team's Infiltration: × Headquarters Relocated to Suburbs. City Only Has Consumption, No Production. × Army's Air Defense Capabilities Extremely Weak.

(Shamian Correspondence) The security situation in Guangzhou has been deteriorating day by day. This is partly due to the poor discipline of the × army, and the pseudo-self-defense teams are just a disguised form of bandits. Moreover, a large number of local ruffians are risking danger due to the pressure of life. Therefore, daytime robbery has become a routine occurrence. Although the × people have been trying to attract people from various villages and provinces back to the city in hopes of revitalizing Guangzhou, people are already terrified. As of now, according to investigations by foreign reporters, the city's population still cannot exceed approximately 120,000 and is tending to decrease. The issue of prosperity is unsustainable because all the shops resuming business in the city are consumer-oriented, and there is not a single production factory. Those with slightly more capital are hesitant to move forward. Without production, how can there be prosperity? This is clear evidence of the reality.

× Army Agencies Relocated for Investigation

Since the Zhengjin Bank was attacked by our guerrilla team and further warned by the Iron Blood National Salvation Letter, the × army knows that there are many of our people's armed forces in the city. Fearing attacks, the Southern Branch Dispatch Army Headquarters of the × army, originally stationed in the New Asia Hotel at Xihaokou, was urgently relocated to the suburbs. The locations of the × army agencies have also changed. Investigations are as follows: The Expeditionary Army Headquarters has moved to Zhixin School near Huanghuagang. The Military Police Headquarters is in the former Japanese Police Bureau. The Garrison Headquarters is in the old Security Corps Headquarters opposite the Police Bureau. The Army Special Service Agency is in the Finance Department. The Marine Special Service Agency is in the old Municipal Zhongshan Library on Wende Road. All military supplies, grain, rice, and horses are in the East Parade Ground.

Weak Air Defense, Few Weapons

× has been vigorously constructing defensive works in the suburbs of Guangzhou. There has been fortification near Baiyun Mountain, behind Yuexiu Mountain, and along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway and the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway. However, air defense capabilities are extremely weak. The × anti-aircraft unit, originally located in the Wujia Ancestral Hall in Henan, has now moved to a residential area in Dongsha in the suburbs. The words "Island Artillery Unit Headquarters" are still written in front of Wujia Ancestral Hall as a disguise. Continued investigations have revealed that the high-level units stationed in the Dongsha residential area to protect the command of Zhixin School have only two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns. Other agencies do not have such weapons. On the night of July 30th, gunshots were heard in Huanghuagang, reportedly due to our guerrilla team's night attack on the × anti-aircraft gun positions, but this has not been confirmed.

### Special Maritime News

The D'Artagnan of the French Far East Steamship Company, which arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai earlier, was found to have one of its propeller blades suddenly submerged in the sea about 200 miles from Hong Kong. Therefore, after the ship arrived in Hong Kong, it entered the Taikoo Dockyard for inspection and to refit the original engine before sailing to Haiphong. It is estimated that this project has delayed the voyage by ten days.

The Jinshan of the Hong Kong, Canton & Macao Steamboat Co., Ltd., is currently unable to return to Hong Kong due to the steel cable of the submarine telegraph touching the engine in Macau. A tugboat has been dispatched from the Kowloon Dockyard to tow it back to the dock for repairs. It is reported that this repair project will take about ten days, and the ship will be able to sail between Hong Kong and Macau on the 11th of this month.

### From Huiyang to Chao'an

— Lin Guangjin

1. Walking on the Eastern River Where the Crisis Has Not Passed

I was originally a staff member in the political department of the × guerrilla area. Because the political department received orders from above to temporarily cease activities from the end of January, I ended my work in the guerrilla team, forcing me to leave Si Ling and seek other work.

On the morning of February 9th, braving the piercing north wind, I hired a small boat and set off upstream along the East River. Against the current and the wind, the boat moved like an ant. Crouched in the cabin, after a long two days, I finally arrived at the county town of Xun Yuan. After walking for another three days along the rugged mountain paths, I finally reached the old residence upstream of the East River.

During this journey, I saw many places violated by the × people, sadly and painfully sighing there unattended, with spots of blood still remaining, fully exposing the ferocity and brutality of the × people. I also heard many weak and old people in the occupied areas, survivors of the war, groaning and weeping, having suffered the destruction and trampling of the violent × people, and then subjected to the exploitation of newly emerging exorbitant taxes and the wanton looting of conscienceless local bandits, about to be displaced and unable to survive. At the same time, I also saw many civil movement workers running and shouting all day long, but unable to obtain positive political leadership and practical assistance from the local government, so that work could not continue to be carried out, making them feel that the blood and sweat they shed were falling into the sand, unable to converge into the torrent of resistance, which was extremely depressing. Moreover, I also knew that when Huiyang fell before, there were a few government officials who had already withdrawn from Huizhou City. It was not that they had nothing to eat or wear, but they actually ran to the city to be "good citizens" before the × people had withdrawn from Huiyang, willing to be slaves of the × people, willing to be slaves of a fallen country. This kind of public enemy, despised by everyone, should be eradicated. However, after Huiyang was recovered, they were not only not subject to government sanctions, but some even climbed up the social ladder!

All of this, anyone who has been to the East River can see and hear. The survival of these phenomena fully reflects that the crisis on the East River has not passed.

Originally, the reason why the × people withdrew from Huibo this time was because of their insufficient troop strength, and they felt threatened by our guerrillas, self-defense teams, and the national army all over the mountains and plains. Strategically, they had to retreat temporarily. This was due to the × people's inability to do so, and not out of willingness. The kind of pouncing posture of the × soldiers in the Zengcheng Shilong area towards the East River recently, on the one hand, was a chaotic move to divert attention in response to the battles on various fronts, and on the other hand, it was to defend against our army's encirclement, and to carry out a defensive attack. However, this cannot be said that the × people have completely abandoned their conspiracy to spy on the East River. According to reports, the × people have recently sent many traitors to the area near the East River to carry out political activities, which proves that the × people's ambition has not died, and there is always the possibility of a comeback. At the same time, if the × people are at a disadvantage in their military attacks on various fronts, they may take action on the East River to echo the battle situation on all sides and to create containment, which is the × people's usual trick and good play. We should be especially vigilant.

In order to smash the × people's conspiracy, in order for the East River not to fall into the hands of the × people again, we should bravely overcome all shortcomings, actively foster and lead the youth movement, and mobilize the masses to rise up to defend the country and their hometowns. At the same time, we must earnestly relieve refugees and eliminate all kinds of exorbitant taxes and improve people's lives, and thoroughly investigate and punish bandits who take advantage of the crisis to rob and maintain public security. In particular, we must thoroughly investigate those civil servants who willingly act as submissive citizens and attach themselves to the × people, and eliminate national traitors. This is an urgent appeal, and at the same time, I would like to sincerely request the local government to quickly accept it.

Movies and Drama

### The Chinese Drama Troupe Engaged in Cultural Propaganda in New York: Greatly Welcomed by the People There

The drama troupe engaged in overseas Chinese cultural propaganda, under the leadership of Madame Tang, including musicians, dramatists, and singers, toured the United States this time and performed Chinese dramas for five full nights at the Mercury Theater in New York in early February, with unprecedented success. The news was widely published in newspapers across the United States.

On the last night, Zhao Qixiong. Dr. William, a leader of the American society "Friends of China," delivered a speech, expressing his great respect for the Chinese drama troupe's cultural propaganda tour of the United States. The result of the five-night performance was that it won praise from American drama critics and earned a surplus of approximately US$5,000.

For this performance, on the last night, the United China Relief Association and the American Medical Aid to China also invited the troupe to perform in New York, and then the troupe went on tour to major cities across the United States. Therefore, the performance in New York was actually the first sound of the troupe's performances in the United States.

The New York Times said, "If they come to the United States to perform in order to raise donations for medical assistance, they will receive even greater praise. They have indeed enabled a country with a very rich artistic source to gain many friends overseas. Chinese art has been adhering to Chinese classics for thousands of years. Existing in the realm of ideals, it is pure art."

Among the members of the Chinese drama troupe, the most popular with Americans was Ms. Zhang, who played "Yang Guifei." Her photo was found on American streets, on newspaper and magazine covers, for several weeks in a row. Her fame can also be seen.

### Introduction to First-Run Films: Guiding Girl

"Guiding Girl" is not a great film. This is obvious, because from the title, you can imagine what it is. The story of the whole film, from beginning to end, is like all erotic films, immersed in an atmosphere of erotic and humorous fun. The writers do not want the audience to receive any inspiration from this "educational weapon." Its highest ambition is only to make the audience laugh loudly during the opening hour and a half. In this way, the film can be 100% guaranteed in terms of business, and these audiences, in this amusing love picture, forget the world and forget society. The anesthetic nature of American films is concretely expressed in these places.

The structure of this film is exactly as mentioned above. It is very funny and also makes people laugh. The playwright has arranged a total of five humorous characters in this story: an engineer who is rich but likes to study cooking; his daughter, a spoiled young lady who falls in love with men; a former Russian nobleman, a prince, who works as a cook in the engineer's home; the head of a business agency, a smart and capable girl; and a young man studying mechanics. The whole play uses these five people to play a complicated love comedy. Here, we must admit that the personalities of these characters are vividly and lively written. The engineer's daughter, as soon as she sees the young Bob, shows a "love at first sight" appearance and has been pursuing him, which is a very cute technique. After the "Prince" cook declares that he is the sold-out Russian prince, the engineer's daughter immediately goes to pursue him and quickly marries him. Here, the psychology of a delicate and vain girl is fully expressed. As for the engineer's confusion, the business agency girl's affection, and the young Bob's straightforwardness, they all make the whole play full of laughter.

The actress Lan Li has a strong grasp of the characters' personalities. The stubborn personality of the business agency girl (Kang Sidenfina) is written, and when she receives a call from the engineer asking her to prepare for the wedding of the young Bob and the engineer's daughter, she is so angry that she smashes the telephone receiver and cuts the power cord, then circles around the office in extreme anger. Underneath this quick movement, not only does the female protagonist's angry emotions appear, but it also reveals the stubborn personality of the smart, capable and competitive girl.

As for the engineer's daughter, who falls in love with every man she sees, her appearance of being lost and slow-moving in the business agency cannot help but make you laugh. When pursuing the young Bob in the basement, she is again a petite and charming "little bird relying on others." Her movements and position show its accuracy.

In terms of actors, Ms. Sidenfina, the director of the business agency, is very experienced and pure. This complete urban type actor is very suitable for playing this role. The male lead, Fan Xiupolas, is a newcomer, but he is very calm. The others, such as Mi Xiaaoya's Russian prince and Qiluo Jiluo's engineer, are all humorous and funny. In short, this is a new-style comedy.

### New Makeup Technique

American movie actors now use a plasticizing substance for facial makeup called "No. 6." This makeup material was invented by movie makeup artist Tom Jack. It has three advantages: (1) Regardless of the facial features, it can be transformed as desired. The simplicity of the procedure is far beyond that of previous makeup techniques. (2) This makeup material is applied to the face to form a thin mask, but various facial expressions, such as smiles, laughter, yawns, and frowns, are still expressed as usual, without the slightest discrepancy. (3) This makeup material is loose in texture and can absorb sweat. It is easy to apply, and when removed, it will not damage the skin.

Robin Lorry, who played Louis XVI in the film "Marie Antoinette," was made up by Tom Jack using "No. 6." It was so lifelike and ingenious that if you compared it with the photo of Louis XVI, you would not believe that he was a Hollywood actor, but would suspect that it was the reincarnation of the French emperor at the end of the eighteenth century.

### The Radio War Between England and Italy: The Same Singer Used One After the Other

Radio is not only a tool for listeners to pass the time. Politicians in various countries around the world also regard radio as a powerful tool for political propaganda. For example, political parties' election campaigns, heads of state's political views, and government attitudes all use radio broadcasts to reach the general public, and the effect is far greater than holding public speeches in one city or one place. Not only this, but recently, countries have further regarded it as a tool for international political propaganda warfare.

Here, we can give an example. Italy, not long ago, used a singer to broadcast in various parts of the Near East (including Cairo, Baghdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, etc.), and the purpose was to carry out anti-British propaganda. This singer is Abdul-Wahab, a half-blind Muslim. In his romantic compositions, he himself is the main singer. Italy made use of him because the Arabs liked to listen to his songs.

About a year ago, Britain discovered Italy's conspiracy to broadcast to the Arabs, so it also wanted to use radio to counter Italy. Abdul-Wahab got a great opportunity to make a profit in the situation where Britain and Italy were competing in an international propaganda war. At first, his remuneration for broadcasting for Italy was not very high, but later he wanted to increase it to US$400. Italy said that it could not pay such a price, but Britain, for this singer who enjoyed a great reputation among the Arabs, did not hesitate to pay this sum, hoping to achieve the effect of countering Italian propaganda. Abdul-Wahab was immediately pulled over to the British side to do radio propaganda, and the British even had him broadcast the song "Shakespeare's English Song," and the price was increased to US$625, with the aim of publicizing the background of British culture through this song, making the fascists who previously subsidized this singer feel uneasy and embarrassed.

### The Real and Fake Li Huitang Battle, Jia Shan, the Nemesis of the Hong Kong Interport Team, Defeats Xinghua, Whose Performance Was Slightly Better Than the Day Before

[Our Newspaper Special Report] It's warm and then slightly cold, the wind and rain finally settle in the evening. Parting is most heartbreaking near Qingming. Overseas travelers are often sick these days.

Yesterday afternoon, "Heaven Cried," not only breaking the souls of travelers but also dampening the spirits of football fans. Although the Jia Shan match was not changed due to the wind and rain, fighting in the rain is inevitably clumsy. What's the fun in turning a "good show" into a "bubble play"?

Fortunately, by the afternoon, the sky suddenly "smiled," and this football event began at an auspicious time. However, Jia Shan was muddy and slippery after the rain, and the players' movements were slightly less smooth.

The Xinghua football team crossed the ocean with their skills, arriving in Hong Kong from the Philippines, shaking the football city. This team is famous throughout Southeast Asia, deeply admired by football fans. However, they suffered a defeat in their first match, giving the general public the impression that they were not as good as they seemed.

Yesterday, they fought again, facing the Hong Kong Interport team, and the scene was quite lively. However, compared to the day before, the number of spectators was reduced by half. The reason is very simple: the crushing defeat the day before, plus yesterday's rain, reduced the interest of many fans.

The "New Li Huitang," Xie Qingfu, who attracted much attention, did indeed play. However, he is large and stout, weighing over 110 pounds, and lacks the agility and finesse of Li Huitang. He waits for opportunities like Sun Shun, who recently played in Shanghai, though he jumps higher and is excellent at heading. His passing also has a "method," but his shots are not always accurate. However, because of his powerful kicks, his shots are as dangerous as artillery shells. Xinghua avoided being "shut out" entirely thanks to his one goal.

The Hong Kong team's frontline commander, the "genuine" Li Huitang, is indeed different from the "substitute." Because he has great skills and leadership ability, he is united with the team. This alone sets him apart from others. How can Qingfu be compared to him?

Since the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport match, Jia Shan had been reluctant to show his skills. Yesterday, he participated as a practice player, preparing for his upcoming trip to the Philippines.

The Xinghua lineup was more complete than the day before, as two new players were added to the front line, greatly increasing their attacking power. Zhu Chenggui adopted a third inner defender strategy, which was not very effective, but it avoided the concentrated defense of the previous day. Therefore, the team's overall performance was much more energetic than the day before. Their defeat was simply due to inferior skills.

Tsai Yuehan's performance was inferior to the day before. Wen Guanzong's passing and Xie Qingfu's coordination were good. Although Wen Guanzong had a minor foot injury, he performed quite well. All the other players worked very hard.

The Hong Kong team's lineup differed from the original plan. "Big Iron Shovel" Li Tiansheng and "Vanguard" Hou Chengtuo were both resting, allowing "Tough Guy" Hou Rongsheng and "Little Shi" to play. This affected the team's overall offense and defense. Yi Shi Dulan, who initially played as the left winger, was "stubborn" and missed many opportunities. Feng and Li, the two domestic forwards, one specialized in passing, and the other specialized in finding opportunities, were inseparable. However, Li Huitang hesitated to shoot several times. People said he was lazy, but I say he was "showing mercy."

The entire match was not very exciting, and the atmosphere was tepid. In the first half, the Hong Kong team had more advantages, but because of Xinghua's strong resistance, they only scored one goal. In the second half, both sides had equal opportunities. Therefore, although the Hong Kong team won by two goals, Xinghua also scored one, ending the match with a score of 3-1. (By the Football Field God)

First Half

Two minutes: Jia Shan breaks through and passes the flag, Yi Shi Dulan receives on the wing, enters a corner, and launches a powerful shot. Everyone thought a goal was certain, but Li Bai-tang turned around and made a fierce save, deflecting the ball out of the corner.

Seven minutes: Cheng Zhen and Li Huitang compete for the ball. The "ball freak" is indeed fierce, snatching the line and hooking it to Jingxiang, who is left unguarded. Jingxiang shoots a blank, sending the ball high and out.

Twelve minutes: The Xinghua forwards, unwilling to be insulted, launch an all-out attack. Haizhu crosses to Lie Wu, who heads the ball, but it goes slightly high.

Fifteen minutes: Anbashen gets a pass from Bi Ludo on the right wing. Huitang tries to intercept the ball but slips. Jia Shan happens to be in a perfect position and shoots without hesitation, scoring the first goal. (1-0)

Twenty-eight minutes: Xinghua attacks once. Haizhu cuts in, and although Yuehan manages to get past, his final kick is inaccurate. Then Qingfu heads a brilliant ball in the Hong Kong team's territory, passing slightly over the crossbar.

Second Half

Five minutes: Qingfu chases the ball on the edge of the Hong Kong defense, gets the ball, and passes it to the left of the goal. Yuehan misjudges the situation and misses the opportunity. Shortly after, Yuehan cuts in beautifully, redeeming himself. Jun Qian sees the unfavorable situation and jumps high to save before the opponent's forward arrives, making a graceful pose.

Twelve minutes: The Hong Kong team continues to attack relentlessly. Guan indicates the team to return and defend, wanting to protect the midfield. However, Huitang seizes the opportunity to pass to Jia Shan, who shoots decisively again. Bai Tang tries to dive and block the shot, but cannot prevent the ball from entering the net. (2-0)

Seventeen minutes: The Hong Kong team attacks again like an overwhelming force. Bai Tang rides alone from the city. At this time, "Little Shi" receives a pass from the middle, advances to the side of the goal, and should easily score into the open net. But the result is a shot wide into the wilderness.

Twenty minutes: Lie Wu leaves the field, the situation is gone, but Yuehan is still active, cooperating with Qingfu, sneaking across the blood valley pass, and finally shooting the ball into the net in the confusion, breaking the duck egg. (1-2)

Twenty-two minutes: As the applause for Xinghua's winning goal subsides, Huitang, assisted by Little Shi, dribbles past two defenders and fires a ground ball, flying into the capital, making it 3-1. A moment later, the final whistle blows, and the Hong Kong team wins.

### The Oriental Football Team Marches South Yesterday, a Group of Fifteen Players and Staff

The Oriental Sports Football Team, in response to an invitation from the Vietnam Sports Association, departed from Qingyuan at 4 PM yesterday.

However, they have famous players such as Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuyue. With them, the results will surely be spectacular. Also, the weather wasn't very good when Qingyuan departed yesterday, with sudden rain, so very few people saw them off. Also, in order to increase membership interest, the Fanghui will hold a "Treasure Hunt" game for members starting tonight. All members can sign up to participate, it is said.

### Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Elementary School Physical Education - Daily Morning Exercises to Be Implemented - Implementation Guidelines Decided

(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education considers physical education to be a basic requirement for self-defense. However, training cannot be effectively applied to adults and the elderly. It must be applied to elementary school children first to be effective. Since a person's health is determined during childhood, the importance of physical education in elementary schools should be vigorously promoted, especially during this period of intense war. The Ministry of Education now orders all public and registered private elementary schools in each province and city to follow the Ministry's regulations and implement daily morning exercises before class. The implementation guidelines for elementary school physical education are recorded as follows: A. Based on the school's environment: (1) Location, (2) Equipment, (3) Economy, B. Based on the student's level: (1) Motor ability, (2) Knowledge ability, C. Based on local conditions: (1) Social aspects, (2) Habits, D. Based on the value of teaching materials: (1) Exercise can be done anytime, anywhere, (2) Inspire good behavior in children, (3) Other.

### South China Seeks Champion - Revealed Tonight

The association's current fundraising teams total over twenty, all of whom are working hard. It is said that the teams' scores are equal, and the amount of money raised is very close. It is difficult to predict which team will win this year's championship.

### Open Basketball Tournament - Lefang Defeats Police - South China Wins in Group B - Only Two Matches Tonight

In the open men's basketball tournament, South China narrowly defeated International 37-36 in the first Group B match yesterday.

In the second Group A match, Oriental defeated Police. Based on past records, Police could not be dismissed as a pushover to Oriental. Yesterday, under the tenacious resistance of the Police, although they lost 47-52, they once led 39-37. They were tied several times in the 15 minutes before the end of the game. The Police's ability to achieve this result was not accidental. During the game, the Oriental team was at most one point ahead. If the Police had not lost three points in a row due to a defender's foul in the last two minutes, the outcome would have been hard to predict. However, the Oriental team was greatly affected by Xu Heng's absence due to the football team's expedition. Feng Nianhua and Huang Dingfen also did not perform well. Only Chen Zongqi was outstanding, saving many dangerous balls.

The Police were most indebted to the three Indian players. Because of their height and long arms, they had many advantages. They dominated the rebounding and had several opportunities to score on second chances. However, their shooting form was poor, and they missed scoring opportunities. Their lack of teamwork was also a reason for their failure. Their passing often failed to avoid interception by the opponent, and their receiving was often light and unstable. Therefore, although the players had superior height, they were ultimately restricted by the skills of both sides. With proper training, they would certainly improve quickly.

During the game, Feng Nianhua opened the scoring for Oriental, followed by Luo Zhian. Then Police Nalin scored two consecutive baskets. Afterward, both sides scored alternately, and the score was tied at 10-10 and 12-12. Then Oriental scored with baskets by Huang Dingfen, Feng Nianhua, and Xu Duzhong. At the end of the first half, Oriental led 21-17.

After the change of ends, Feng Nianhua showed his strength. Oriental led 29-26 and 35-32. Then Police Chen Jinkui and Nalin became unstoppable, creating a tense situation with the score tied at 37-37 and 47-47. Until the last two minutes, Oriental took advantage of Feng Nianhua's free throws and scored two consecutive points, resulting in a 52-47 victory for Oriental.

In the last Group B match, Wah Hung defeated Hoi Kwong 75-24.

### Morning Exercise Materials

— Outstanding

Regarding the effectiveness of morning exercises, everyone has gained considerable understanding from this publication. I believe everyone will have developed the determination to practice. From determination comes a kind of restlessness. Although everyone has not spoken to me about this, I can predict it. That is the question of how to exercise. It seems that I have only told people the benefits of morning exercises without guiding them on how to do them. It is like presenting a plate of delicious food in front of everyone but failing to invite everyone to actually eat it, causing everyone to be longing. I am truly sorry. Please forgive me. Now I will introduce the teaching materials for a 20-minute morning exercise, so that everyone can know, can do, and after doing it, can benefit... Regarding the content of the teaching materials, they are based on flexibility exercises and medical exercises. The curriculum is arranged from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, from simple to complex. Each teaching material is used for one week, that is, each issue is changed once a week.

However, after each section is completed, there should be a considerable amount of rest or stepping (or walking) to prepare for the next section.

### Sofa

— Du Ai

"If one could say that a sofa is something that makes people sit down and not want to get up," a friend who had just come from the mainland said to me with a sigh, "then Hong Kong is a sofa. If you sit on it for too long, even the desire to stand up will be consumed!"

I understand what he means. I remember that before he left Hong Kong, he was often tormented by this "sofa problem."

"Honestly," he said with a sense of loss when he left, "living here for a long time is annoying. But when it comes to deciding to leave, I feel reluctant."

I think he was not exaggerating. Relatively speaking, his life was "simply stable." People who choose this kind of life tend to feel like they are sitting on a sofa. However, an intellectual like him, living in a city with a sense of poverty, began to feel uneasy when he encountered the smoke of gunpowder at Daya Bay. Seeing other young people eagerly mobilizing to return to their hometowns, he felt even more the alluring power of this sofa. Yes, although his life made him feel like he was sitting on a sofa, he was still young, pure, and full of enthusiasm. Gradually, he felt that he should move like other people. Two days before he left, he told me that he had decided to stand up from the "sofa." Only then did I believe that he was really going to return to China with the young soldiers to serve the country. I shook his hand tightly:

"That's right."

In the days after he left, I often thought of his melancholy shadow in my spare time. I thought: the fiery life in the mainland would temper him, but I also thought that he might return to the sofa!

Indeed, one day three months later, he suddenly appeared at my house late at night. After sitting down, he said the opening sentence. Although I understood what he meant, I was still doubtful.

"What? Are you planning to fall back into the sofa?"

"No!" he said aggressively, as if resisting an insult.

"Then, what necessary things made it imperative for you to come back?"

He wriggled his head, preparing to say a lot, but in the end, he said only a short sentence seriously:

"I came back for cadres. There is a cadre panic in the mainland!"

"Then, have you contacted your rear support?"

"I have. However, our fellow villagers' association can only provide me with five people, and they are all without any work experience. Why is it that people in your cultural circles seem so unenthusiastic about training cadres and mobilizing people to return to the country?" Because he felt that his attitude was earnest, he finally smiled slightly.

I told him that almost all the good cadres of various groups had already set off with various service teams. There is also a cadre panic in the youth salvation groups here!

In this way, we slowly began to talk about the situation in the mainland. He was really excited. He told me that the work in the occupied areas was arduous and as chaotic as hemp. When they first arrived in the occupied areas, the people had fled, and the food had also been taken away. All that could be seen were burned buildings, dead villages, and flies and rats, ruling the areas destroyed by the enemy. The incomplete corpses of the people who had been murdered were rotting "everywhere." Wild dogs were holding cruel feasts. The bloody smell, mixed with the biting north wind of December, pierced his nerves even more deeply. Seeing this tragedy of human suffering, the desolate wilderness, the intense urgency and sadness, filled the hearts of political workers with deep pain. After many days of effort, the staff gradually brought back the farmers who were hiding in the mountains, constantly holding village meetings, working patiently village by village with the patience that people involved in popular movements should have. Slowly, the foundation of popular armed forces was established, order was gradually restored, and there were many innovations. The people began to consciously support the war of resistance. However, some places were also very bad. The relationship between the army and the people had not yet begun to be newly established. The people were afraid of the army and equally afraid of the bandits. Traitors could still operate openly. The looting of bandits, the rampant smuggling, and the defeatist emotions of the people were everywhere. However, on the one hand, the people were comforted by the enemy, and a sense of peace was born. Once the "Imperial Army" swept through, they became extremely panicked again. The people had no organization and were even more scattered than during the war. His conclusion was that although the situation was like this, the war did change many things. Especially recently, because there was news that the enemy was going to conduct a new "sweep," the stubborn and dark historical sediment also began to change. The people slowly awakened through the lessons of blood. On the whole, everything was beginning to change, beginning to be reborn... He said that he was also beginning to be reborn.

"Then, in your work, do you miss this seaside sofa?" I asked him.

"No, that is already in the past. I have already found another sofa, which is the vast wilderness of the motherland! When I first arrived in the mainland, as soon as I came into contact with that lovely wilderness, a kind of unprecedented warm and affectionate feeling intensely moved me. For the first time, I truly felt the greatness of the motherland. I love the wilderness, even though she is being trampled by the enemy and is in a state of defeat, she is using her hidden infinite power to cultivate the seeds of freedom on herself!"

"Then, after you left, have you never had any nostalgia for the sofa?"

"At first, because the change in life was too difficult to adapt to all at once, I was nostalgic. But soon, I gave up. I want to announce to everyone: return to the mainland, live and fight in the embrace of the motherland. She will make you feel unparalleled happiness, she will make you deeply feel that you are the creators of a world full of glory for your ancestors!" He was a little dazed with excitement. He gazed tranquilly and solemnly at the night outside the window, saying to himself, "In such a great era, only the dying class can sit comfortably on the sofa."

He walked to the table, poured a cup of tea, held it up, and began to ponder thoughtfully, saying:

"The sofa, in certain situations, reasonable situations, it is not impossible to treat it as a moment of rest." He finished the cup of tea in one gulp and sighed happily: "But treating it as a life will wear down people's will; and the person sitting on it will become like a stupid wolf."

I enthusiastically agreed with his opinion. I said:

"For some people, it is accurate to treat Hong Kong as a sofa. However, this sofa is surrounded by gunpowder! However, there are many people who do not treat her as a sofa, people who are not qualified to treat her as a sofa. Not being buried by the sofa, and living a truly solid life, is our iron rule of struggle. As long as people can really do that, this iron rule can be quoted everywhere..."

Looking at the watch, it was almost one o'clock. So, I quickly brought the bed board and arranged a place for him to sleep.

I pointed to the neatly stacked board bed and said to my guest:

"Treat it as a sofa! You deserve to rest now."

He hugged me and laughed like a child. Liu Feng

### "Silent Triumph"

— Liu Feng

Returning home with "silence" and "triumph" seems to be something that doesn't exist in the world. In theory, "triumph" should be so lively—"the whole country is ecstatic," "triumph" will become incredible.

However, our friendly nation has this "thing" called "silent triumph." The reason why I call our "friendly nation's" "silent triumph" a "thing" is not to imply any irony. It is really because this "silent triumph" is a "first creation," and my writing style is very clumsy, and I can't find a suitable term for a while. There is no way, I have to treat "silent triumph" as a "thing."

Forcing the girls in women's schools to hold small paper national flags, gently singing clear and crisp songs, and motivating the "soldiers" who are "going to war," this is touted as very lively news in the "friendly nation's" newspapers. However, when the "soldiers" who "went to war" were put in bottles and brought back as "ashes," the "Kyoto Daily News" in the "friendly nation" called it "silent triumph!"

The "friendly nation's" war to "build a new order in East Asia" on our Chinese territory is indeed victorious every day. This can be seen from the fact that their domestic newspapers have "silent triumph" every day.

"Ashes" will certainly not "speak," but sacrificing one's "life" to complete the "holy war" is called "triumph" by the newspapers, so it is certainly "silent."

However, since "ashes" will not speak, the closest relatives and friends related to "ashes," and by extension, the "candidates" for "ashes," and the supporters of "truth," they will speak. Even in this "silent triumph" published in the "Kyoto Daily News," there is a tragic "language of ashes."

That is, the wife of this "silent triumphant," after taking a bath and dressing neatly, went to the grave of her husband, this "silent triumphant," to commit suicide. Although the wife "committed suicide," it is clear that the "ashes" borrowed the wife's "suicide" to make a "tragic accusation" to the people of the whole country!

In addition, the "anti-war slogans" that are repeatedly found in the streets of Tokyo are also the "silent words" of the "silence" of a kind of "triumph." As for the explosion of the Osaka gunpowder factory, that is a kind of "thunderous joy" because it is "triumphing" every day and cannot bear to "remain silent!"

"Triumph" will never be "silent." Even if there is one in the "Kyoto Daily News," it is just the "silent triumph" of another small part of the "friendly nation," right? If not, it is a kind of "self-consolation" because the "purpose" cannot be achieved in "three months."

"Silent triumph" was created by Japanese fascist warlords, but it is also their only gain in China!

### Departure

— Huang Lu

The stove is burning dry leaves

The four walls are dark and damp

Because tomorrow

I will go far away

Mother! Please

Feed my horse well

When the neighbor's rooster crows

I will set off

I will take down

Grandfather's saber

Grandfather's pistol

And gallop towards the distant dawn

### Spring Mist

— He Chengjiang

Spring mist covers the ocean, spring mist covers the green mountains, spring mist covers the earth, and the people of the earth live in the spring mist.

A gray and hazy mass of gas in the sky hovers over the ocean. Ships have reduced their speed and are sailing slowly. The light of the lighthouse is buried by the gas and is not clear at all.

People hold a "mysterious" mood, looking down, looking up, and looking straight. From this shore, you cannot see the other shore. From the sidewalk under this arcade, you cannot clearly see people's true faces across the sidewalk. However, the sea of people is flowing horizontally...

The sea lies lazily, breathing lifelessly...

I hold a mood of melancholy on the seashore, but I don't feel the "joy" of "the spring sun calling me with smoky scenery." On the contrary, what I am indignant about is the smoke of war everywhere in the motherland!

—Alas!

With a slight sigh, my heart is filled with longing for the motherland. I want to exhaust my vision to look forward to the great face of the motherland, but the misty spring mist on the sea prevents me from seeing the motherland.

Although many people are happy not to see the flames of war in the motherland here, not to hear the sound of cannons in the motherland, and to live in a dull and hazy spring mist, enjoying a curtain of misty rain, listening to the clear sound of flower sellers, and wandering in this paradise, my heart is not here.

I only long for the white sun in the sky to eliminate the spring mist on the sea, or for a heavy rain and strong wind to fall happily, arousing the ocean's awakening, arousing the sea waves' roar, like the tragic songs of the brave men of Yan and Zhao, echoing under the sky. When the rain stops and the wind calms down, we will once again bet that a sky full of white sun and blue is far better than being trapped in a dull and heavy mist.

I am annoyed by the spring mist, I hate the spring mist. The smoky scenery of spring has bewitched so many people, lost so much spirit, and worn away so many lofty ambitions. Annoying spring mist!

Ah! Spring mist, I hate you, I am annoyed by you, spreading on the sea, spreading in the sky, making me unable to see the motherland, but my heart will penetrate your net and return to the embrace of the motherland!

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

He and she are still standing in place. Time has passed. Snow has accumulated on his and her shoulders. Fortunately, there is no third night walker on this road besides him and her. He should be grateful for this dead and silent snowy night, which hides his secret for him. But who can guarantee that there will be no accidents during a long stay?

The white snow, the black sky, are very simple and clear, as if they are the two sides of his body and mind. He feels his own incompetence and insignificance in this universe of white and black. He is deeply troubled by her non-resistance. Kill her? She is innocent, and it is not the original purpose, and, is his work record still the same blank as when he came? Let her go? Of course, that is her wish, to go happily, so is the result of his work just a knife wound? Permanent stay? Staying is without results, right? He shook his head silently, negating everything. But what is affirmative?……

The sigh of the strong is precious. Finally, he sighed softly, and had to put the useless pistol back into his clothes. He knew that it could no longer help him, so he might as well put it away to show respect for the other party. Then, he cautiously walked away two steps, trying to restrain his angry and worried face, and replaced it with inexplicable joy and humility.

If he was the strongest just now, then he is the weakest now. The former is a heavenly horse flying freely in the sky, and everywhere he sees is a smooth road; the latter, although it is him, is because he was carelessly knocked down from the heavenly realm by heavy snow and strong winds. After falling, he was tied with reins. His strong and weak body kept moving back and forth in the short distance. He was like a believer conquered by religion, walking in front of her with a pious mood, and kept saying good things:

"...If I have offended you, please forgive me, forgive the starving and freezing volunteers... The Chinese should help them, guide them... I came this time to ask you to help them, guide them..."

It was like a confession in front of a god, begging; these words were going to nothingness, and the result was no response.

He wronged himself for the sake of work—but there was a limit to it. When it exceeded this limit, suddenly, he grabbed her and dragged her away. (Twenty-six)
