### British Indignation and American Government Concern

Since the Japanese army's brutal blockade of the Tianjin concessions and repeated imposition of embarrassing insults upon British people, the entire British nation has been extremely angry and is becoming increasingly agitated. This is a manifestation of the British people paying attention to the situation in the Far East and urging Britain to adopt a considerably strong policy to deal with Japan. On the other hand, the American ambassador to the Soviet Union recently notified Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the progress of British, Soviet, and French negotiations. This indicates that the American government not only hopes for the early success of the British-Soviet-French mutual assistance agreement but also that the United States itself has a close relationship with it and is willing to cooperate with Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to resist aggressors.

These facts indicate the importance of the Far East's position in the world's anti-aggression efforts. The British government urgently needs to directly and decisively follow this trend and move forward courageously. Before the atrocities of global aggressors, Britain is at the forefront, whether in Europe or the Far East. Britain must not only quickly accept and fight alongside the countries offering support but also give effective counterattacks to the aggressors without compromise. Britain has no reason or necessity to compromise or retreat in the face of aggressors' attacks, whether in Europe or the Far East. British retreat will only encourage aggressors to take advantage, and it will also weaken the cooperation of other democratic countries. If Britain wants to create a leadership position in the anti-aggression front, it must have this demeanor, and the Far East aggressor, Japan, will not dare to attack or bully her. Today, once a British-Soviet-French agreement is successfully concluded, Britain's leading position will be achieved. After the establishment of a British-Soviet-French agreement, there is no question about America's determination to join the anti-aggression struggle. With the United States backing Britain, Japan, which is currently bullying Britain the most, can somewhat reduce its arrogance. Because the strength and resources of the American navy are enough for Japan's hawkish military clique to deeply consider at all times. This is as Lord Beatty said in his long letter to "The Daily Telegraph" ("The Position of the British Navy in the Far East"): "Japan can obviously do everything possible to avoid infringing on the Philippines and strive not to infringe on American rights and interests, which can once again prove that naval power is above all else." It can be seen that the United States has a great role in preventing Japanese aggression.

Since the Tianjin incident, the British people's hope for the British government to complete the British-Soviet-French agreement as soon as possible has become more urgent. According to news from London, the main point of contention today is still the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states. "The Observer" believes on this point that the purpose of the Allied countries is to defeat German aggression. German aggression against the Baltic states will be indirect aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, regardless of whether the Baltic states are willing, the Allied countries will definitely protect them. They do so not for the sake of the Baltic states, but for the benefit of the Soviet Union, France, and Britain. At the same time, "The Sunday Times" also strongly advocated: "Britain must accept the Soviet Union's demands, that is, guarantee the small Baltic states," and said: "Whether the tripartite alliance can be established depends on the extent of British concessions to the Soviet Union." "The Observer" even said, "Regardless of whether the Baltic states agree, Britain must extend the scope of guarantees to the region." These are all reflections of the British people's anger. How the British government should respond is one of the major issues of the day.

### Main Mineral Deposits in Southwest Provinces

— Chen Ligang

[Special Article from This Newspaper] The southwest is now the base for resisting Japan and building the nation. Its core includes Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang, and its outer perimeter includes Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Among these provinces, apart from Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei, which have relatively extensive alluvial plains with abundant rivers and lakes, the rest are continuous mountain ranges with high terrain. The geological strata have undergone significant changes, often suitable for the deposition of mineral beds. Therefore, the development of these inland provinces should focus on operating and exploiting mineral resources. Minerals are the mother of industrial development, and all construction and large-scale manufacturing materials required by industry are based on them. Therefore, in the 19th item of the government's program for resisting Japan and building the nation, it states, "...develop mineral resources, establish heavy industries, encourage the operation of light industries, and develop various handicrafts...", clearly stating the importance of developing mineral resources. Since the outbreak of the war against Japan, the entire country has deeply recognized the importance of building the southwest. Therefore, the government established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to manage affairs, and recently established the Southwest Economic Research Institute. Recently, the central government and the provinces have jointly established mining operations for tin in Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and mercury in Guizhou, which are actively underway. Even business circles, overseas Chinese groups, and private individuals are enthusiastically promoting development, preparing to invest heavily to supplement the government's efforts, in order to increase inland productive forces and lay the economic foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, regarding the main mineral deposits in each of the southwest provinces, which are suitable for investment and development, it is necessary to present the main mineral deposits so that those interested in investing and operating have a guideline. The author, being inadequate, will list the mineral resources based on what I have seen, for the correction of the readers, in order to arouse the close attention of the community and provide a reference for those concerned about investing in the inland.

Yunnan -- Yunnan is extremely rich in mineral resources, with gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and coal as the main resources. Gold is produced in the Jinsha River area, silver is produced in association with lead mines in Huize Xingfang, copper is produced in Dongchuan, Yuxi, Yongsheng, Jianshui, Huize, and other places, with Dongchuan as the production center; tin is particularly abundant, with Gejiu being the most productive, with an annual output of about 7,000 tons, second only to the Malay Peninsula; lead and zinc are produced in Huize, and coal and salt production is also abundant.

Salt is produced in the central Dutong, Yuanmou, and Yanxing areas, with numerous salt wells. Precious stones and amber are produced in the west. The marble produced in Diancang Mountain has excellent texture. The copper, iron, and tin mining industries have rough scales, making it an important area for mineral resources in our border regions.

Guizhou -- Guizhou is known for its rich mineral resources, with mercury, copper, iron, coal, sulfur, and saltpeter as the main resources. The Fanjing Mountain in Tongren County, Baima Cave in Kaiyang County, Dadongla in Shengxi County, Nanmuchang in Tongzi County, Mercury Creek, and Xingyi are all famous mercury mines. The mercury reserves in more than 20 counties including Bazhai, Sanhe, Songtao, Wuchuan, Dejiang, Yinjiang, Jiangkou, Huangping, Anlong, Xifeng, Ceheng, Datang, Qianxi, Houping, Xingjiang, Ziyun, Changzhai, Sinan, Zunyi, and Xiuwen rank first in the country. Copper is produced in Weining, Dading, Zhi'an, and An'nan counties. Iron ore is abundant in Guiyang, Weining, and Longguo counties. Coal mines are produced between Dading, Zunyi, and Xifeng, Tongzi, Langdai, Zhijin, Bijie, Renhuai, Pingyue, Qianxi, Guiding, Guancen, Zhenning, Qingzhen, Longli, Anshun, and Guiyang.

Sichuan -- Sichuan's mineral resources mainly include coal, oil, salt, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. Coal and oil are produced in the central region, Qixian, Gulan, Zhongzhou, Hechuan, Xuanbin, Xuyong, Nanchuan, Guangyuan, and Anxian, with abundant coal reserves. Baxian, Yibin, Nanchuan and other counties produce the most coal. Oil is produced in Fushun, Pengxi, Renshou, and Zizhong counties. Salt is produced in Zigong and Gongjing, with thousands of salt wells and abundant output. Gold occurs in two forms: vein-shaped ore beds and placer deposits. Gold produced in Maogong and Mianning belongs to the former, and gold produced in the Yalong River and Jialing River belongs to the latter. Silver is produced in Tianquan and Lushan, copper is produced in Huali, Miyuan, Rongjing, and Pengxian, with abundant reserves. Iron is produced in Nanchuan, Qijiang, and Bei Pengshui counties. Lead and zinc are produced in Huali, and mercury is produced in the southeastern Youyang area.

Xikang -- Xikang is extremely rich in mineral resources, with gold mines being the most famous, produced in Kangding, Yalong River, Jiulong, Lihua, Dege and other counties. Other minerals such as silver, copper, iron, coal, saltpeter, sulfur, mica, and gypsum are abundant, but little is known due to incomplete surveys.

Guangdong -- Guangdong's mineral resources mainly include gold, iron, tungsten, manganese, coal, salt, and phosphorus. Gold is abundant in Zengcheng Guifeng Mountain, Enping and other places. Iron is produced in Ma On Shan in Hong Kong, Yunfu, Zijin, Lianjiang, Yingde and other counties. Tungsten is mostly produced in Wengyuan, Lechang, Heyuan, and Hong Kong. Manganese is produced on Hainan Island and in the Qinlian and Beijiang areas. Coal is mostly produced in Gaoming Ruyuan, Maoming, Shixing, Meixian, Qujiang, Longmen, Lechang, Hepu, and Qinzhou. Salt is abundant in coastal counties. Phosphate rock is produced on Hainan Island, and bird guano is produced in the Xisha Islands.

Guangxi -- Guangxi's mineral resources mainly include gold, tin, tungsten, manganese, antimony, lead, silver, coal, sulfur, and saltpeter. Gold mines are distributed in the Youjiang River basin in the southwest, in Tianyang, Tiandong, Xiangdu, Tianbao, in the east in Hezhou, Zhaoping, Mengshan, He County, Teng County, in the south in Nanning, Bobai, Rong County, and Guixian Binyang, with Shanglin, Wuming, and Cangwu counties having the richest reserves and output, followed by Tianyang, Teng County, and Zhaoping counties. Tin deposits are distributed in three areas: the Fuchuan, He County, and Zhongshan area in the east is rich, the Nandan and Hechi area in the north is the Danchi area, and the Bobai and Luchuan area in the south is the Bolu area, with the Hezhong area having the richest reserves and output, with more than 200 large and small mining companies and hundreds of thousands of workers, almost all of which are merchant organizations, with dozens of companies with hundreds of thousands of capital. The area of distribution and reserves in the Danchi area are not as good as in the Fuhezhong area, and there are only a dozen or so large and small companies without large-scale company organizations. As for the Bolu area, the reserves and output are relatively small, and only a few locals are mining there. The main producing areas of crane are Gongcheng, Binyang, and Zhongshan counties. There are more than ten tungsten industry organizations in the province, with Gongcheng and Fuyuan Company being the largest and most profitable. The main manganese producing areas are Wuxuan. Antimony is produced in more than ten counties including Hechi, Binyang, and Pingle. Iron ore deposits are distributed in Huai County, He County, Zhongdu, Sanjiang, Tianhe, and Heng County. Silver and lead mines are associated, mostly produced in more than ten counties including Wuxuan, Yongchun, and Guixian. Coal deposits are distributed in Qianjiang, Zhongshan, Tianyang, Nanning, Luocheng, and Xing'an counties, with the Heshan Coal Mine in Qianjiang and the Xixian Coal Mine in Zhongshan having the richest reserves. Sulfur is mostly extracted from pyrite, with Xing'an, Luocheng, Sile, and Mingjiang counties being the main producing areas. The main producing areas of saltpeter are Du'an Nama, Yinshan, and Luocheng.

Hunan Hunan's mineral resources are the most diverse, ranking first in South China, mainly including coal, antimony, lead, zinc, tin, gold, iron, tungsten, manganese, and gypsum. The distribution of coal deposits is very wide, from the Nanling Mountains to the Xiangtan area. The mines that have been mined are Gouyadong in Yizhang, Tanjia Mountain in Xiangtan, Fengguan Mountain in Xiangxiang, Huanggu Ridge in Qiyang, and Huangniutang. Xinhua, Shaoyang, Xiangxiang, Chenxian, Hengshan, Leiyang, Yongxing, Anhua, Xiangtan Changning, Baoqing, Ningxiang, Liling, and Yizhang are all famous coal producing areas. China's antimony ore is the richest in the world, accounting for 80% of the world's output, and Hunan Province produces a particularly large amount, accounting for more than 80% of the country's output. The main producing area is Xizhoushan in Xinhua and its vicinity, accounting for 75% of the province. The second is Yiyang, Anhua, Xupu, Yuanling, Yizhang, Dong'an, Wugang, Xinning, and Shaoyang, accounting for 25% in total. Lead and zinc are most abundant in Shuikoushan in Changning. The minerals produced there are silver-lead ore. In addition to producing lead and zinc, zinc ore also produces silver. Tin is abundant in Jianghua and Linwu. Jianghua has established a mining bureau to manage the mining. Gold is produced in Taoyuan, Qujiang, and Huitong. Iron ore reserves are very large, distributed in Yuanling, Anhua, Xinhua, Chaling, Ningxiang, Youxian, and Xiangxiang. The reserves and output of chicken are abundant, and the production areas are Yaogangxian in Zixing, Yanziling in Linwu, Xiangyunxian in Rucheng Qingdongshan in Guidong, Dengbuxian in Chaling and Lingchuantang in Liuxian. Manganese reserves are abundant, distributed in Shangwubu in Xiangtan, Changjiuchong, the Chunshui coast of Changning Leiyang, and Bawuling in Yueyang. Gypsum is produced in Xiangtan.

Hubei -- Hubei's mineral resources are mainly iron and coal. Copper ore gypsum, well salt are also abundant. Iron reserves are distributed in Tiemenkan, Shizishan in Daye; Shaomaochi, Xiangbishan, Jizishan in Lingxiang, Liudai Mountain and other places, Nancheng and Yidu. Among them, Daye Tieshan, Shizishan, Shaomaochi Mountain, Jijialu, and Xiangbishan have achieved good results. Coal reserves and output are very abundant, distributed and mined in the Yaxi Grand Canyon area of Xingshan, Chepu, Shizishan, Jigongshan, Pulongshan area of Puqi, Kuzhuqiao, Moshan area, and Shenshan. Ma'anshan in Wuchang, Tangxindazhi, between Echeng, the Shihuyao area of Daye and Changyang, Yidu and other counties. Among them, Wuchang Ma'anshan, Daye, Dalugou, and Tanwan in Yangxin have achieved good results. Copper reserves are also abundant, distributed in Niutoushan between Daye and Yangxin and the Jiangchun Town area of Daye. Gypsum and well salt are produced in Yingcheng, and mining has achieved early results.

Conclusion The above list is only the main mineral resources in the southwest. It is inevitable that one example is given to represent thousands. The author does not elaborate on a particular ore bed, nor does he intend to be all-inclusive. New ore beds are discovered from time to time. Here, a general example is given to see the general situation of mineral beds in the southwest. The detailed records of the mineral quality, ore bed, reserves, and output can be found in the publications and reports of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica, the seven geological surveys of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangdong, and the construction departments of each province for reference. In short, regarding the various mineral resources in the southwest, considering individual provinces, Yunnan can pay attention to tin, copper, and other mineral products. Guizhou has the most promising mercury. Sichuan has the richest reserves of coal, iron, oil, and salt. Xikang has the most abundant gold deposits. Guangxi's gold, tin, manganese, tungsten, and other metal minerals have the most value for mining, with the most abundant metal ores such as crane and tungsten. The antinomy coal, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, manganese, gypsum and other mineral resources in Hunan are worthy of attention. The coal, iron, gypsum, well salt in Hubei are capable of large-scale investment and development. Considering the entire southwest, metal is the main product. Minerals such as tungsten, antimony, tin, manganese, lead, zinc, bismuth, and mercury are particularly abundant, with tungsten accounting for more than 65% of the world's total output (Jiangxi produces the most) and antimony accounting for more than 80% of the world's total (Hunan produces the most). These raw materials are all necessary for the arms industry, distributed in the Nanling Mountains area, and its extended area includes southern Jiangxi, southern Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and extends into the Malay Peninsula. This is the Nanling metal ore belt. Therefore, developing the mineral resources of the southwest requires large-scale investment in the above-mentioned metal mineral categories, using technical management methods for mining, and both can obtain substantial profits.

### Our Military Strength Strengthened in Eastern Guangdong × Bombs Chao'an Attempting to Breach Han River Dam Fierce Battle in Jin Still at Stalemate

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shanghai, 26th] According to the French "Shanghai Daily," the Japanese army in China totals more than one million, including fifteen divisions in North China, fifteen divisions in Central China, fifteen divisions in Northeast China, and three divisions in South China, with each division having approximately 25,000 men. Approximately five divisions are stationed in Japan itself, allegedly to suppress popular resistance. Due to the war rate against China being trapped in difficulties, Japan may conscript new soldiers to make up fifty-two divisions. However, the new recruits have no experience in battle, so they are not suitable for actual combat.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 26th] The Southern Pass (southeast of Pingyao) is attacked by ×. Now, more than two thousand reinforcements have come from Taigu Qixian, together with the original ×, totaling more than five thousand. Their main force has fallen into the ancient city of Quan Dian Town (north of Qin County). A part of them occupied Youbi (west of Yushe), and our unit rushed to reinforce it, and then recovered the ancient city and Youbi. On the 16th, 2,000 × from Quan Dian turned to the Jianjia Village area in the southwest and launched a fierce attack, and we are still in fierce battle.

Chaoshan Area

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] Delayed arrival. After × invaded Shantou, our × is now holding against each other across the Han River. Our military strength in eastern Guangdong has been increased.

[Urgent Dispatch from Dalu News Agency, Chao'an] On the 26th, × aircraft reconnoitered along the Chaoshan Railway and bombed Hecao, Fuyang, Wuyang, and Fengxi. According to military information, the railway line is developing clearly. × avoided Huamei (a neighboring station of Anbu) and detoured to attack Xintang due to the difficulty of combat near Anbu. It is still in fierce battle nearby. According to another piece of information, after × landed in Shantou, they had an intention to advance by land and sea. The land route advanced along the railway line, temporarily aiming at Chao'an. The water route took advantage of the rising water and went upstream along the tributary of the Jian River, threatening Heyang. Our army has been on strict guard separately.

[Central News Agency, Yuanweng, 26th] In recent days, × aircraft have bombed various places southwest of Chao'an in batches, hoping to breach the embankment and flood the villages of refugees.

[Central News Agency, Chao'an, 25th] The × on the Da'ao side were repeatedly attacked by us and confined to the Donghu coast, with no progress so far. On the Sijiwei side, our army is still guarding Chencun and Xincun. × launched several fierce attacks, all without success.

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shao, 27th] According to semi-official news, a small squad of our Shantou garrison fought fiercely with × and all died heroically. The rest retreated to Xiaoling Mountain northeast of Shantou and echoed with our army in Anbu, 50 kilometers north of Shantou. × has been surrounded by us and cannot invade. It is heard that the commander-in-chief of a certain group army of ours has arrived in Chao'an to command the counter-offensive military affairs. Da'ao Island in southern Shantou is still in fierce battle. A certain high-level staff officer arrived in Shao from Shantou and talked about the fact that Shantou is easy to attack but difficult to defend. Shantou was once lost at 16:00 in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Today, × people have the help of warships and aircraft, which is even easier to obtain.

[Special News from Wengyuan] (1) The × in Meixi, north of Shantou, was surrounded by our army on the morning of the 24th and hundreds were killed. The rest are being annihilated. (2) At 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd, a joint force of × infantry, cavalry, and artillery, about seven or eight hundred people, advanced towards Xinli and Shenli. The attacking team of Peng's division of our 12th Group Army met and fiercely attacked them. After several hours of fierce fighting, × could not support them and collapsed and retreated along the original road. In this battle, more than one hundred × were killed, one head of × army officer Hua Liangjiashan was captured, and many rifles and ammunition were seized. Our army also injured three soldiers.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 26th] According to reports, after × landed in Shantou, they sent ships to peep at the ports of Shiqi Yangjiang and Beihai in southern Guangdong, posing as an advancing force. In fact, they want to lure our troops to the south so that the × in Jiangmen can invade to the west and break the stalemate of the past eight-star Hu Lai.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 26th) An × aircraft carrier has arrived in Tokyo Bay in the South China Sea and sent aircraft to bomb various places in Guizhou Province. On the 12th and 13th of this month, Nanning suffered fierce air raids, and many incendiary bombs were dropped in the commercial district of the city, causing heavy losses. However, there were not many casualties among the people.

[Central News Agency, Huaqing, 26th] At dawn on the 24th, five × warships were found downstream of Jiujiang, and they were driven to Shuangbing near the fort. Afterwards, they fired more than one hundred shells at the rocks, attempting to seize the opportunity to land. Our garrison firmly defended, and × did not succeed.

Various Guerrilla Areas

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 26th] Huang Zhentai's puppet army in Cangxian County, unable to withstand the oppression of the × army, took the opportunity to revolt on the 5th. Huang led more than 1,300 troops to a certain place to prepare to ambush the × army. The authorities, upon receiving the report, sent personnel to express their condolences and appointed the unit as the Second Guerrilla Detachment.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] According to foreign news, on the evening of the 26th, guerrillas in the suburbs of Jinshi attacked the puppet police station and exchanged fire with the puppet police before retreating.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 26th] According to news, Qingpu, near the western suburbs of Shanghai, was attacked by hundreds of Chinese army guerrillas on Sunday yesterday. A fierce battle broke out at Bianfang for about three hours. After the Japanese side received reinforcements, the guerrillas retreated to the triangular area between the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing railways. According to a report from the Japanese side, only five soldiers were killed in the battle, and they confessed to seizing a light and heavy machine gun each, and automatic rifles, etc. According to a report from Nanjing City, the Nanjing-Hangzhou area striking team has started large-scale activities again. When the Japanese army and guerrillas fought near Yixing on the west bank of Taihu Lake, a Japanese brigade commander was killed.

### No Impact on Overseas Remittances After Fall of Shantou × Propaganda Lacks Common Sense A Conversation with a Financier in South China

[Central News Agency, Shaoguan, 25th] When × invaded Shantou, they widely publicized that Shantou was the hub of overseas remittances, with as much as two hundred million yuan remitted into the city each year, so there was a need to invade. This was to cover up their ambition to drive out British and American commercial forces and militarily threaten Hong Kong. A Central News Agency reporter asked a South China financial authority about this matter. According to his discussion, such propaganda by × is nothing more than an attempt to deceive European and American people, weaken the world's understanding of their invasion of Shantou, and deceive overseas Chinese into cutting off the lives of their parents and wives, causing a blow to millions of overseas Chinese. The amount of overseas remittances into Shantou each year is 70 million yuan of currency. The Guangdong Provincial Bank now has branches in Chao'an, Meixian, Dapu, and Dapu, Songkou, and various important counties and cities in Guangdong and Jiangxi, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. The bank can also transfer remittances to other provinces. The Guangdong Provincial Bank has a well-known reputation. Remittances between Nanyang and the interior of the sparse province can be handled by the bank. Such uneducated propaganda by × only reveals its futile efforts.

### British Residents in Tianjin Severely Humiliated; Japanese Ignore Protests; Ironclad Facts Dismissed as Baseless Propaganda; Kidnapping, Robbery, and Arbitrary Actions by Soldiers

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that the British "falsely accused" the Japanese army in Tianjin of insulting British residents and lodged a protest. This matter is still under investigation, and after this investigation is completed, the Japanese government will respond to the note presented by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. The Japanese claim that the insults to British residents are purely "baseless" propaganda. The "Asahi Shimbun" claims that British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems willing to believe any propaganda from the Chinese side and mistakenly believes that the British nation is superior to the Asian people, which is inappropriate. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" claims that some private radio stations in Tianjin broadcast unfounded news, which is enough to indicate that the British concessions in China are the center of anti-Japanese activities.

Recent Situation in the British Concession in Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that yesterday was the twelfth day of the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions. The important events of the day were: (1) The release of British resident Mr. Smith; (2) The supply of dairy products in the British concession was almost completely cut off; (3) White Russian "anti-communist" members paraded in the former German concession. Also, the day before yesterday, there was an incident of the most brutal search of British residents Mr. and Mrs. Fenler by the Japanese army. Mr. and Mrs. Fenler went to the Tianjin Country Club from the concession on Saturday afternoon. When they arrived at the Japanese military obstruction at the southern end of the racecourse, they were stopped by the Japanese army. Mr. and Mrs. Fenler waited for about an hour for inspection before being led into the inspection room. During the inspection of Mr. Fenler, he was completely naked, holding his coat, standing in front of Chinese and foreign people. His wife was led to an inner room, where a Chinese woman directed by a Japanese soldier performed the search. The inspector first ordered her to take off her hat and examined her hair, then ordered her to take off her clothes. Mrs. Fenler immediately asked the Japanese soldier to leave the room, but the Japanese soldier only turned his head to look elsewhere. After a few seconds, he turned his head back to look at Mrs. Fenler. Finally, Mrs. Fenler was forced to take off her undershirt, wearing only a corset, and the searcher reached into her clothes to inspect. The Japanese soldier standing beside her watched the entire inspection process. The door between the inner and outer rooms was not closed, and the Chinese and foreign people in the outer room could see everything clearly. The British people feel that the Japanese side has insulted them to this extent, so unless forced by duty, they do not easily risk passing through the Japanese military obstructions.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that this morning, two trucks departed from the British concession for use by the British army stationed in Tianjin. Ten minutes later, they returned to the British concession, but when they reached the intersection, they were detained by the Japanese army. The drivers of both trucks were wearing military uniforms, and a British military officer was sitting next to each driver. The British army reported the situation to British military commander Lieutenant Colonel Dalla, who went to the intersection to negotiate with the Japanese military officer. However, the Japanese military officer declined to meet him, claiming to be out. As a result, after fifty minutes of negotiation between the two sides, the two trucks were finally allowed to enter the concession.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the Japanese army blockading the British and French concessions is now also paying close attention to river traffic. Last week, all British steamships and barges traveling on the Hai River were ordered by the Japanese to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for inspection. Each inspection often took several hours. During the inspection of a British resident on a tugboat, he was forced to take off his clothes and socks, and the 15 yuan of legal tender in his pocket was also confiscated. Also, two Chinese passengers were taken ashore and their whereabouts are still unknown.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the anti-British movement by the Japanese side is still very strong. Today at noon, about ten British and Soviet residents were greatly insulted by Japanese sentries and puppet soldiers at the entrance of the International Settlement. After about ten minutes of inspection, they were allowed to pass.

### Massacre by Japanese in Northeast China

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to an official announcement from the puppet "Manchukuo" in Changchun, 114 Chinese patriotic figures arrested in March last year have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five years to death. These patriotic figures were tried in the puppet High Court in Harbin. Ten were sentenced to death, and seven were sentenced to life imprisonment. The charges against them were "disturbing public order."

### Taunts of Chamberlain by Japanese in Qingdao; Demonstrations Carry Giant Statues of Chamberlain; Anti-British Movement by British Residents in Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that some British residents arrived here from Qingdao today. According to them, during the recent anti-British movement in Qingdao, giant statues of Chamberlain were carried during the daily anti-British parades and demonstrations, holding umbrellas, to show their taunts. It is difficult for British ships to unload goods. Every time British ships hire workers to load goods, they are pulled to load Japanese ships instead.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 26th] Four days ago, Chinese people held anti-British demonstrations and parades in Qingdao, while parading the streets with portraits of British Prime Minister Chamberlain holding umbrellas as a joke. It is said that this kind of parade was initiated by the Japanese.

### Further Restrictions by Japanese on Foreign Ships Sailing to Shantou; Barbed Wire Around British Wharf; Loading and Unloading of Goods Prohibited

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that on the 24th of this month, the authorities agreed that British merchant ships could freely enter and leave Shantou. However, the Japanese side suddenly claimed that only one British ship would be allowed to enter Shantou Port each week. The British naval authorities stated that the entry of British merchant ships into Shantou should not be subject to any restrictions. If necessary, British warships will escort them. Currently, the Japanese have set up barbed wire in Shantou to prevent British ships from loading and unloading goods.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong] Although the Japanese army in Shantou agreed on Friday of last week to allow British ships to navigate to Shantou, there have been further complications. They have actually blockaded the British wharves, set up barbed wire around the British wharves, and sent sentries to monitor the British wharves. Anyone passing through the blockade line must be subjected to strict inspections and harassment. All goods are not allowed to be moved to the ships. Goods on the ships, except for mail and passenger luggage, are also not allowed to be unloaded. Although British ships navigating to Shantou are protected by British warships for entry and exit, it is difficult to restore normalcy in passenger and cargo transportation under this tense situation. The Japanese army's blockade of the British wharves will have a great impact on the supply of food to Hong Kong. Food prices in Hong Kong will inevitably continue to rise.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that the British Consul General has protested to the Japanese Consul regarding the Japanese attempt to restrict British shipping in Shantou, stating that the British side cannot recognize the Japanese side's permission of only one British ship per week to sail to Shantou. If the Japanese side intends to interfere with British shipping, the British naval authorities have ordered the British warship "Slaney" to escort them.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 26th] It is reported that the British military authorities insist on the right of British ships to sail to Shantou and will send warships to escort them if necessary. Although the Japanese authorities allowed British ships to sail freely to Shantou on the 24th, they have now notified the British side that only one British ship per week will be allowed to arrive in Shantou. The Japanese army has built obstacles around the warehouses in Shantou, preventing British ships in the port from loading and unloading goods.

### Genghis Khan's Coffin Given Public Memorial in Xi'an; Jiang Dingwen and 30,000 Others Greet It Five Miles Outside the City; The Situation Was Enthusiastic, Unprecedented in Xi'an in Recent Years

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] Genghis Khan's coffin was moved south. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Military Affairs Commission specially dispatched commissioners Tang Jingran and Chu Mingshan to escort it. It departed from Yijin Horo of the Ikhao League on the 11th, arrived in Yulin on the 15th, and traveled south of Yulin on the 18th. The people of the counties along the way greeted and worshiped it enthusiastically. It arrived in Xianning on the evening of the 24th. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Xi'an lined up to greet it five miles outside the city. Provincial Chairman Jiang Dingwen, Deputy Dean of the Military Advisory Council Zhang, and civil servants of various agencies, students of various schools, and people from all walks of life, numbering more than 30,000, participated in the grand occasion, which was unprecedented. The coffin carriage departed from Xianyang at 5 p.m. on the 25th and arrived outside Xi'an at 6 p.m. The first carriage contained the divine spear "Sulde" and some sacrificial instruments. The divine spear was a sharp weapon used by the Great Khan for conquest. Today, the Mongolian people's respect for the divine spear is equal to that of the Great Khan. The second carriage contained the coffin of the Great Khan and his ancestral tablets, all in silver coffins. The third and fourth carriages were the special honor guard of the tomb guards and more than 40 members of the escort delegation sent by Jilin Tu, the sacrificial official of the tomb. The coffin carriage was decorated with national flags and red and yellow silk ribbons. When the carriage stopped, all circles immediately held a welcoming ceremony, presided over by Chairman Jiang Dingwen. After the ceremony, the coffin was moved, with the Daurhat cavalry escorting the spirit leading the way, followed by the full ceremonial guard and the band. The police and military police followed behind the carriage, and the guards and the welcoming people stretched for about seven miles. At 7 p.m., it entered the Anding Gate. Flags were decorated and road sacrifices were set up. The sound of firecrackers shook the sky, and tens of thousands of people lined the streets, vying to see it. The enthusiastic situation was unprecedented in Xi'an in recent years. At 8 p.m., the coffin arrived at the Visual Hall, and at 8:30 p.m., the sacrificial ceremony began. The chief sacrificial officer, Jiang Dingwen, and the accompanying sacrificial officers, Zhou Xinwan and more than 30 others, first held a public memorial service, with tributes from various agencies, groups, and schools. The ceremony was extremely grand and lasted until about 11 p.m. Chairman Jiang specially hosted a banquet on the evening of the 25th to entertain the Mongolian banner officials who had come to escort the coffin.

### British and Japanese Continue to Negotiate Tianjin Blockade Issue

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Yesterday, political circles here confirmed the news reported by the British newspapers regarding the meeting between the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mamoru Shigemitsu, and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, and stated that the British Foreign Secretary's protest against the Japanese's hostility towards British residents in Tianjin was indeed true. It was further stated that the two diplomats discussed the issue of lifting the blockade of the concessions during the meeting. At the same time, the British Foreign Secretary hinted to the Japanese Ambassador that if the Japanese do not repent, the British will take retaliatory measures. Political circles also stated that Japan certainly wants to hold negotiations with the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom must remain strictly neutral towards the Sino-Japanese War at any time, and at the same time, it must recognize the new order in North China after the establishment of the puppet government in Peiping. If the United Kingdom actually takes retaliatory measures, Japan will consider that the United Kingdom no longer hopes that Japan will consider British interests in China.

### Unified Enrollment for the 28th Academic Year; Ministry of Education Announces Measures

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] In order to adapt to the special environment and needs of the war of resistance and to coordinate the enrollment of national universities, the Ministry of Education held unified enrollment for national colleges and universities last year, and the results were quite satisfactory. In the 28th academic year, first-year freshmen (excluding specialized students) of national universities and independent colleges will still be enrolled by the Ministry of Education. After admission, they will be assigned to national colleges and universities. Enrollment for provincial private universities and independent colleges and public and private specialized schools will still be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before they can enroll students on their own. The members of the Unified Enrollment Committee for National Schools for the 28th academic year have been appointed and hired by the Ministry of Education, including Luo Jialun, Wang Xinggong, Gan Tianfang, Qi Fang, Ye Yuanlong, Wu Nanxuan, Tong Guanxian, Xie Xunchu, Zhang Yi, Wu Junsheng, Chen Lijiang, Hao Gengsheng, Huang Longguang, and others, totaling 19 people. Wu Junsheng was designated as the chairman of the committee. This year's unified enrollment will be divided into 15 enrollment areas: Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Guilin, Yanping, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Zhenping, and others. Branches will be established in Hechuan, Baisha, Leshan, Wugong, Ankang, Tongren, Lantian, Hong Kong, and other places. The registration date is set from July 25th to 30th, and the examination date is set from August 7th to 10th. The unified enrollment methods for this year differ from those of last year in the following aspects: (1) The examination questions for this year will be uniformly formulated and issued by the Ministry of Education; (2) In addition to using aspirations and grades as the distribution standards for students, this year, priority will be given to distribution in the examination area and nearby schools. If the quotas of each school in the area are full, or if there are no desired departments, the school will be designated by the Ministry; (3) Students who are not admitted but whose grades are not too poor will be admitted by the Ministry to the university preparatory class; (4) Students who are exempted from the entrance examination are limited to the current year's graduates of middle schools who have passed the graduation examination and are recommended by the provincial education departments for their outstanding performance (the top 10%). National middle schools and provinces that have not held the examination shall not follow the example of recommending students; (5) The number of students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications shall not exceed 10% of the total number of students admitted in each district and shall be limited to the top half of the total number of students admitted in each district.

### Tension in Fujian Sea; Japanese Warships Increase to Eight; We Are Closely Monitoring

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] Six more warships have sailed into the waters outside the Min River estuary, bringing the total to eight, including two transport ships, two cruisers, and two destroyers. We are closely monitoring them.

### The Fall of Shantou; An Eyewitness Account of the Japanese Plundering of Shantou

— Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Lin Gao (1)

On the 21st, before five o'clock in the morning, the air raid alarm sounded, and many people were awakened from their sleep. It was not yet light, and the stars were twinkling in the gaps in the clouds.

The faint sunlight slowly increased, and eleven Japanese seaplanes dispersed and flew low over the city. Farmers in the suburbs, carrying heavy loads of vegetables, hurried to the market. The air raid did not disrupt the lives of the city's residents.

It was past seven o'clock when news came that the Japanese were going to land on the coast outside the port. Since the urban area is only thirty miles from the port, since the beginning of the war of resistance, the Japanese have repeatedly used speedboats to approach the shore. Once our army opened fire, they would flee. In June alone, the Japanese had made such moves on three large scales with dozens of speedboats at the same time, and had even opened fire for tens of minutes. There were mines blocking the sea at the harbor entrance and fortifications of the defense army on the land from the sea to the urban area. Without hearing the sound of Japanese cannons or the sound of the defense army's guns, the landing could not be confirmed. It was thought that this was just another Japanese harassment. If the Japanese really landed, the "evacuation alarm" would sound continuously for five minutes, and it would not be too late to escape then.

On the street, there was a continuous stream of vendors selling mugwort leaves, "Sheganzi flowers," palm balls, cool powder palm, and other festival items. People were preparing for the festival. The Japanese planes had been flying for so long, a vicious bombing was inevitable. (To be continued)

### A Prisoner of War in Northern Hunan

— Peng Hepu

[Special Correspondence from the Central News Agency] Recently, our army captured two Japanese soldiers alive, and the process was quite interesting. After the Japanese invaders expanded into Yuezhou and Linxiang, they never had a peaceful sleep. Not only were railways and highways repeatedly destroyed, and military depots and grain stations burned down, but they were also often subjected to sudden attacks. Even though they were vigilant and heavily guarded, our guerrillas appeared and disappeared unpredictably, making defense impossible. In particular, the telephone lines behind the Japanese army often disappeared for miles. As soon as they were set up, we would come back fully loaded with three or five bundles, which only exhausted the Japanese communication soldiers, leaving them at a loss and complaining endlessly.

When the battle north of the Xinqiang River was in full swing, the power lines between Yanglousi and Pingshuipu were suddenly cut off again. The Japanese, in desperation, came up with a trick. They sent an interpreter disguised as a villager to investigate the matter and find a way to thoroughly prevent it, while also observing our military situation. This guy, carrying out his mission, went from Yuezhou and arrived at Pingshuipu on the 30th. The next morning, he unloaded his "Imperial Army" uniform, disguised himself as a villager, and was outwardly indistinguishable from a Japanese soldier. Moreover, he could speak Chinese. He was accompanied by a local puppet policeman, and two Japanese military police provided remote protection.

South of the railway, the fields crisscrossed. In past years, it was the busy farming season, with rice-planting songs everywhere. The farmers were so carefree, but this beautiful life had been shattered. The brutal Japanese invaders had destroyed their homes and fields, leaving only desolation. Facing them were three ragged villagers. The guy thought to himself that he could get some information from them, and he couldn't help but be delighted. But as he approached to inquire, the three villagers exchanged glances and quickly seized him and the puppet policeman. To put it bluntly, it was simply a kidnapping. The location was only 300 meters from the Japanese military police on the side of the road, and the three warriors only had a few grenades.

The prisoner was short in stature but had a fierce face. I guessed he was not a genuine Japanese soldier. Later, when I interrogated him, I found out that he was indeed Taiwanese. His name was Chen Songquan (also known as Matsuda Tatsuo), born in Nishichō, Keelung. He had studied at Quanzhang Middle School in Shanghai for five years. Later, he returned to Taiwan to do business. On November 16 of last year, he was drafted into the Shanghai Kiucheong Road Japanese special agency as an interpreter. On February 16 of this year, he was transferred to the Ninth Division Headquarters of the Central China Dispatch Army as an interpreter officer. His rank was eighth grade. He was originally stationed in Pu Zhe and came to Yuezhou with Commander Yoshizumi on May 18. He is currently 34 years old and has a wife and three children at home.

I handed him a cigarette, and he was overjoyed. When asked about the losses of the Japanese southward invasion, he admitted that the battles of Caoxieling and Gengkouchong were the most devastating. The four field hospitals are now full of wounded soldiers, totaling about 2,000. From euphemisms such as "Maintenance Committee," "Refugee Area," "Comfort Station," and the disguised brothel "Canteen," he unintentionally revealed that Yuezhou City was full of evil atmosphere, and the men and women who had not escaped were living a ghost-like life, being ravaged and humiliated in their dilapidated homes. It is truly a feeling of seeing familiar scenery and mountains and rivers everywhere!

The war-weariness of the Japanese army can be seen from the homesickness of the soldiers. Although they know that they are fighting an unjust war, they dare not openly oppose the war for the sake of obeying the emperor's orders. For example, after I was drafted, I had to reluctantly close my business immediately, because failing to report within 24 hours would result in "execution." He sighed endlessly. He said that the Japanese government in Taiwan usually levies heavy taxes, and since the invasion of China, it has added many "imperial army consolation" donations, which has increased the burden on the people. Under high pressure, there are still revolutionary undercurrents. The fact that Taiwanese are exempt from military service is why the Japanese are uneasy.

When talking about the puppet army, he was completely unaware. Later, he told me, "Yes, those are just Japanese soldiers who deliberately grow beards to imitate Mongolians and carry out brutal acts." This despicable trick to provoke animosity between our nationalities is both shameful and ridiculous. Mentioning our heroic air force and its expedition to Taiwan last year, he still had lingering fears. When Chinese planes suddenly arrived in the sky, the loud explosions of bombs shook the heavens and the earth, and terror enveloped the entire island. It is said that the losses were heavy, but the authorities kept it secret, and the general public believed that the airport must have suffered a great loss without any preparation.

Japanese war correspondents all follow the headquarters. "Currently, there are special correspondents from the Asahi Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun in the Yuezhou area, but telegrams must be reviewed by the staff department before they can be sent out. Unfavorable news will be suppressed." From this, we can know how the Japanese warlords are deceiving the world. Chen also recounted that his ancestors were originally from Zhangzhou, Fujian, and moved to Taiwan for trade. "My father sent me to Shanghai to study, which was to prepare me to work in China. After my father died and I returned to Taiwan, the Japanese did not allow me to come to China again."

Below are his thoughts written in Chinese, which are reproduced verbatim without any changes: "The prisoner only awaits death, not knowing that your country is benevolent and compassionate. Not only is he not put to death, but he is also treated generously, truly a land of benevolent people. If, at the time of peaceful resolution between the two sides, I can be pardoned and released to return to Taiwan, it would be a virtue of rebirth. If you do not abandon my inferior talent and there is a position to be assigned, I would dare not disobey and would repay your kindness with gratitude!" (Central News Agency)

### Moscow Confirms Mongol-Manchurian Border Conflict: Intense Battles Involving Land and Air Forces, Repeated Japanese-Manchurian Offensives Meet Fierce Resistance

(Special Dispatch) According to a military expert stationed in Hong Kong who spoke to our reporter, the recent Mongol-Manchurian border conflict was entirely a Japanese provocation. The purpose is twofold: (1) to create a new stimulus for the Japanese people, in order to divert their general dissatisfaction with domestic hardships and the war of aggression against China; (2) after two years of Japanese aggression against China, there have been heavy casualties among soldiers. Recently, Tokyo planned to transfer the Kwantung Army southward to participate in the war of aggression against China, but the Kwantung Army opposed this move. Therefore, they created a border incident as a check.

[Shanghai, June 26th (Report from this newspaper)] According to a telegram from Vladivostok, the recent Japanese-Soviet conflict on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border was initiated by the Japanese military to test the strength of Soviet defenses, and thus they challenged the Soviets. The latest challenge took place near Lake Baikal. Currently, the strength of the Outer Mongolian army is 180,000 men, most of whom are concentrated on the southeastern border. The Mongol 6th Division participated in this battle, including two infantry brigades, a mechanized unit, and another mechanized unit, equipped with 300 armored vehicles and 400 tanks, concentrated on the west bank of the Khalkhin Gol River.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, June 25th] Regarding the large-scale land and air force conflicts that have occurred for the past month on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchuria," official circles have now issued a public statement confirming them. It is also stated that between the 22nd and 24th of this month, a total of 56 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft were shot down, while the Soviet and Outer Mongolian side only lost 14 aircraft.

[Reuters, Moscow, June 26th] A communiqué has just been issued here, describing the fierce air and land battles that have taken place along the Outer Mongolian and Manchurian border over the past month. The communiqué concludes by saying that the Soviet and Outer Mongolian armies have now completely occupied all key points east of the Khalkhin Gol River along the Manchurian border.

Soviet Official Report

(Central News Agency, Moscow, June 26th, TASS) TASS has just released an official report stating that since May 15th, some foreign newspapers, based on incorrect reports from the Kwantung Army Headquarters, have widely published news of conflicts between the Outer Mongolian army and the Japanese-"Manchurian" army. Japanese newspapers have consistently lied, claiming that such conflicts were caused by Mongolian troops invading Manchurian territory. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have brazenly exaggerated that their land and air forces have suffered "extreme" losses. According to information received by the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Command, TASS provides the following truthful information regarding the events that occurred on the Manchurian-Mongolian border. The truth about the events that occurred in the Lake Baikal area of the Manchurian border is as follows: On May 11th, a border post in the Mongolian-Mahkanpu-Obo area of Outer Mongolia (located southeast of Lake Baikal, 16 to 20 kilometers east of the Khalkhin Gol River) was suddenly attacked by Japanese and Manchurian troops and forced to retreat westward from the border to the banks of the Khalkhin Gol River. Since May 12th, border conflicts have occurred there almost every day for ten days, resulting in casualties on both sides. On May 12th, Japanese-"Manchurian" reinforcements arrived and attempted to attack the Mongolian army and vainly tried to invade Mongolian territory, but they were repulsed outside the border with heavy losses. On May 28th and 29th, the Japanese-"Manchurian" army again received a large number of Japanese reinforcements from Hailar, equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and a large air force, and invaded Mongolian territory again. The Mongolian army, which arrived at the scene of the conflict, searched for the invaders and dispersed them. The Japanese-"Manchurian" army abandoned many dead and wounded soldiers and a large number of weapons on the battlefield, fleeing back to its own territory in a panic. In this battle, the Japanese-"Manchurian" army suffered more than 400 deaths, while the Mongolian army only suffered 40 deaths and 70 injuries. Three Japanese military headquarters were destroyed, one of which was the detachment headquarters commanded by Dongwu. In these destroyed Japanese military headquarters, many documents were found, including a definitive order issued by the commander of the Japanese 23rd Division in Hailar on May 21st. In his order, he declared to his unit, "This division must use its own forces alone to destroy the Outer Mongolian army in the Khalkhin Gol area." In addition to the land conflict, air conflicts also occurred. On May 28th, a squadron of Japanese fighters and bombers invaded the border and suddenly attacked two Mongolian airfields. Soviet-Mongolian fighters took off late due to being caught off guard, which put the Japanese aircraft in a favorable position. In this air battle, the Soviet-Mongolian air force lost nine aircraft, while the Japanese side lost three. In the end, the Japanese aircraft were forced to flee back to their base in haste. On June 22nd, the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force dispatched 120 aircraft to launch a new offensive. The Soviet-Mongolian air force engaged them with 95 aircraft. 31 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft were shot down, and 12 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down. On June 24th, the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force invaded again, this time with 60 aircraft. The Soviet-Mongolian army also dispatched 60 aircraft to engage them, and shot down another 25 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft. In this air battle, the Soviet-Mongolian aircraft only lost two aircraft. On June 25th, there were no incidents on the border between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria. The Soviet army occupied the entire Khalkhin Gol River. Throughout the conflict, the Soviet-Mongolian army never violated the established border, except when the Soviet-Mongolian air force had to enter Manchurian airspace while pursuing the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force. This was an extremely rare exception.

Japanese Propaganda

[Reuters, Tokyo, June 26th] Today's newspapers here claim that in the air battles on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border since June 20th, 133 Soviet aircraft were shot down. They also claim that yesterday 14 Soviet aircraft were intercepted by Japanese fighters, resulting in three being shot down. The location of the battle was in the airspace near Lake Baikal. It is claimed that a major battle took place there on June 22nd.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, June 26th] According to opinions from political circles here, Japan believes that the recent repeated incidents on the Manchurian border are not isolated events, but a planned action instigated by Moscow. Japanese political circles also claim that this action is a planned effort to aid Chiang Kai-shek, intending to restrain the powerful Japanese army on the western border of "Manchukuo" and prevent it from being transferred elsewhere. Japanese newspapers warned the Soviet Union that Japan's strength is very powerful and that the Soviet Union should not underestimate it and should avoid further incidents, because the "Manchukuo" army can no longer tolerate this situation. Some Japanese newspapers have also called on the government to lodge a strong protest directly with Moscow.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Stalled: Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons, Strang Remains Optimistic

[Reuters, London, June 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax hopes to send further instructions to Special Envoy Strang, who is currently in Moscow, soon. The British government is currently consulting with the French government to consider the Soviet Union's assessment of the recent Anglo-French proposals. I do not believe that sending a cabinet member to the Soviet Union, as suggested by Member of Parliament Tildon, would be of any benefit. Tildon once said that the difficulties in Anglo-Soviet negotiations are very pleasing to Berlin, which will further increase the danger of new German aggression and European war. This may be an accurate fact, and I hope the Soviet government shares this view. Subsequently, someone questioned the Prime Minister and asked him to report on the progress of the talks with the French government. Chamberlain replied, "I am not prepared to release the detailed situation."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, June 25th] Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, came here to assist British Ambassador Seeds in conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities to conclude an Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. It has been twelve days since then, and negotiations have never been interrupted. The British and French representatives have presented two different proposals to Molotov, both of which the Soviet government found unsatisfactory. According to well-informed sources, the British and French ambassadors are about to receive new instructions to present a third proposal to the Soviet government. Personally, Strang does not express any urgency regarding the stagnation of the tripartite negotiations. He repeatedly used the excuse that the time was not ripe to answer questions from reporters and refused to answer. Therefore, no one knows the obstacles to the proposals he submitted to the British government. However, the British side here generally believes that Strang has conducted a thorough study of what the government intends and is rumored to advocate accepting the Soviet side's demands. Even if Britain refuses to provide guarantees to the Baltic countries, the three countries of Britain and France may form an agreement with the three signatory countries themselves as the scope. However, this aspect may not contribute to the movement to form a peace group to resist aggression everywhere in Europe.

[Haitong News Agency, London, June 26th] The foreign affairs correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" commented on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in an article published in the newspaper today. This comment seems to represent the views of the British Foreign Office. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that the British Foreign Office received a telegram and detailed report from British Ambassador Seeds stationed in the Soviet Union yesterday. It is reported that the British Ambassador listed in the report the points on which British and Soviet opinions still disagree and expressed his personal opinions on the rapid completion of this negotiation. People generally believe that the Cabinet will base its research on the report and then submit new instructions to Ambassador Seeds. The "Daily Telegraph" foreign affairs correspondent said that British Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union advised the government to make some concessions to the Soviet Union. The newspaper said that the British and French representatives in Moscow believe that if the British and French governments accept the suggestions made in Ambassador Seeds' report, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will eventually succeed. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Cabinet will reopen today to discuss Ambassador Seeds' report.

### Romania Denies Conclusion of Mutual Defense

[Reuters, Romanian Capital, June 26th] Semi-official sources here have strongly denied rumors that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is preparing to conclude a new Balkan mutual defense agreement. The purpose of Gafencu's recent visits to Ankara and Athens has already been published in a communiqué, clearly stating.

### Spanish Restoration?

[Central News Agency, London, June 25th] Regarding the issue of the Spanish restoration, a visitor from Spain replied to a reporter's question, saying that since the volunteer soldiers from Germany and Italy withdrew from Spain, the possibility of a restoration has greatly increased. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army, often tells people that his belief in monarchical politics has not disappeared and that he firmly believes that Spain can only unify all parties and factions and maintain independence in diplomacy by implementing a restoration. Based on this, on July 18th, the third anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, there may be an important upheaval in the Spanish political system, which is not certain. As for who will ascend to the throne after the restoration of Spain, Prince Don Juan, the son of the deposed King Alfonso (abdicated on April 15, 1938), has the greatest hope. However, there is also talk of Alfonso himself reassuming the throne. In addition, the majority of Spaniards oppose the establishment of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, saying that Spain's military strength is not comparable to that of the Axis powers. If it concludes an alliance treaty with these countries, it will inevitably be completely controlled by them.

### Chamberlain Reports: Tianjin Situation Still Undeveloped, Members of Parliament Raise Questions One After Another, British Public Opinion Increasingly Indignant

[Reuters, London, June 26th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons today, "There is no change in the general situation in Tianjin. Only one-tenth or two-tenths of the usual amount of perishable food and vegetables is reaching Tianjin, and the supply is intermittent. Tugboats on the Hai River must be inspected, which causes obstruction. The local municipal staff and military authorities are paying attention to the food issue at all times and have the right to take appropriate measures. Few British expatriates are using obstacles to defend themselves, but some insults have occurred, which is regrettable. Foreign Secretary Halifax has protested to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain in the strongest terms, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also made the same representations to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita when discussing the overall situation in Tianjin. I have some reason to hope that this conversation will resolve the Tianjin incident, so although I insist that the abuse of British expatriates must be stopped, I am still unwilling to make any statements that would prevent a satisfactory resolution of the dispute with the Japanese government." Chamberlain also answered questions from Members of Parliament Asquith and Henderson, "Although the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have made extensive demands, the Japanese government has not made formal demands." Former Foreign Secretary Eden also asked the Prime Minister whether the current hope for resolving the Tianjin incident is better because of the hope gained after negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo, and reminded him that "What Tokyo promises cannot always be fulfilled." The Prime Minister replied, "I am well aware of this. The hope I expressed was obtained after negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo. I hope the Japanese government can restrain its subordinates in Tianjin." Waldlau and Milner questioned, "Will the Prime Minister's tolerance and protective policy be misunderstood in the Far East, as it was in Germany? This is an extremely serious danger." He replied, "Everything is already in my consideration."

[Reuters, London, June 25th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has learned that London officials are paying close attention to the increasing indignation of the British public over the continuous malicious abuse of British expatriates in Tianjin by the Japanese military. It is expected that if the British proposal to Tokyo to frankly discuss the main points of the problem and the evolution of the incident (which Chamberlain regarded as intolerable) cannot obtain a satisfactory response, the British people's public anger will inevitably affect the government's attitude.

[Reuters, London, June 26th] The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting tonight to discuss the Tianjin situation. It is expected that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie will soon send a report to the British government on the attitude of the Japanese government. Regarding the saying that the British Navy is preparing to hold a demonstration exercise in the Far East, the necessary ships are easy to obtain, but it seems that sending a large force is still problematic. The "Economic Times" stated, "What is the British government thinking and hoping to gain from procrastination? The world is now paying attention to the dispute in the Far East. If we cannot adhere to our inherent position, British prestige will suffer a serious blow. If we want to restore our prestige, it will be impossible. The time for compromise is now past."

[Reuters, London, June 26th] The Times said in an editorial today that it hopes Germany and Japan will listen to Prime Minister Chamberlain's words. The article stated, "Chamberlain has made it clear that Britain will not listen to foreign commands and change its Far Eastern policy. He still hopes that the Japanese government does not intend to condone the excessive behavior of its soldiers, but in any case, the British government cannot tolerate and fail to take appropriate retaliation for the bad and insulting treatment of British expatriates in foreign territories."

### Goebbels' Mad Barking: Bitterly Ridicules British Policy, Leader of German Government's Labor Party Also Gives Speech Insulting Britain

(Reuters, Cologne, June 25th, issued at this country's National Socialist Party conference) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech targeting yesterday's speech by Chamberlain in Cardiff. His words said, "We do not need London's promises, but the expression of concrete facts. In the autumn of the crisis in the international situation, we will risk everything and follow the government. For example, a person who does not take risks will never win. We will not care about the British government's threats, because their threats do not have the strength to back them up. The Japanese army forced the British to undergo naked inspections, but the British government could do nothing. The troops of the German Emperor and the German nation were once defeated, but this is a past fact that cannot be repeated."

[Reuters, Berlin, June 25th] German Labor Party leader Erich discussed the reason for "Britain's suffering of insults in Tianjin" in front of 16,000 political leaders in Potsdam today. Erich said, "No matter from which aspect we observe this world empire, we can only discover the facts of failure. If Britain had not rejected the German leader's invitation to unite with Germany, it would not have fallen into its current situation. The suffering of the blockade that Britain is currently experiencing in Tianjin is no different in nature from its previous treatment of Germany, and the insults suffered by Britain are even worse. The current issue is not the monotony of trivial details in the Far East, but the entire humiliation that Britain must endure."

Spring and Autumn

### "Blood Donation Week"

Yesterday, a telegram from Paris stated that France is holding a "Blood Donation Week" this week. President Lebrun will personally visit various blood transfusion research institutes to observe blood transfusion equipment and give a speech explaining the importance of blood transfusion work in wartime, encouraging people to voluntarily register with doctors and test their blood so that it can be used for soldiers' blood transfusions in the event of a war. The French government cares for its soldiers and plans ahead in this way—in contrast, our country, millions of heroic soldiers, have been fighting for two years, and those who have generously sacrificed themselves have left behind tens of millions of family members who urgently need assistance, and those who have been tragically killed and injured are moaning on the front lines and urgently need to be rescued. Those engaged in national salvation work active in the war zone, behind enemy lines, are not only lacking spiritual and material support, but are also inevitably subjected to various harms from traitors, stubborn elements, and even local evil forces—look at others! Even if we cannot donate blood, we should at least seek peace of mind and provide assistance to these heroic soldiers who are fighting for the country to the best of our ability!

Uprightness

Wang Jingwei and others are committing the crime of deceiving the people and betraying the country in the name of "peace, anti-communism, and national salvation," which not only violates the interests of the Chinese nation, but also violates the moral concepts that have been passed down among the Chinese people for thousands of years. Therefore, whether in the front lines, behind the lines, at home, overseas, or even among international people of justice, all have expressed hatred and contempt. Mr. Liang Shennan of Ipoh recently publicly announced in a newspaper that he was resigning from his position as director and withdrawing from shareholder relations because the newspaper echoed Wang's rebellious remarks; at the same time, Mr. Liang Kuanzhong also published a formal statement because his translation of "The Recent Naval Strength of the Great Powers" was published in the "Era Anthology" alongside traitorous articles by Wang Jingwei, denouncing the illegal actions of the publication; and Hong Kong's Siwei Company also solemnly declared that it would "never recognize" Wang's newspaper because it was unwilling to have its advertisements placed in it; yesterday, newspapers also published announcements from overseas Chinese groups in Malaya protecting the National Government and ordering the arrest of Wang Ming, and newspapers in Poland and the Netherlands also unanimously and fiercely criticized Wang for his heinous crimes. When we see these facts, we feel all the more that "justice lies in the hearts of the people" and that uprightness is inviolable! I wonder if the general shameless opportunists and those who speak in the words of traitors dare to face this squarely!

### Difficulty in Collecting Debts

Do you owe someone a dollar?

My friend Major Du owes me a dollar. It has been twelve months now, and I'm afraid there's little hope of getting it back. Every time I meet him, I remember that he has forgotten he owes me a dollar. When he meets me, he still has that frank and sincere attitude, he has completely forgotten about my dollar, and I know I will never get that dollar back.

On the other hand, I will remember all my life that Major Du owes me a dollar. I believe it will not hinder our friendship in any way, but I will never forget this matter. I don't know how others are, but if someone borrows a dollar from me, I always remember it firmly, remembering it until I enter the grave.

Let me tell you the story. On April 8th last year—I specially write the date because Major Du may see this article—Major Du was going to Ba Tai and borrowed this dollar from me. At that time, he needed a dollar for pocket money to rent a car, so I lent it to him. The matter happened simply and naturally, and it was not until after the matter was over that I felt a little that he just said, "Give me a dollar, okay?" I said, "Sure, is one dollar enough?" I knew that when Major Du took that dollar, he originally intended to return it.

He sent me a letter from Ba Tai. I thought when I opened the letter, the dollar must be inside. But it wasn't. He only said that the temperature was close to one hundred degrees. I don't know if he meant that he was so dizzy from the heat that he even forgot that he owed me a dollar.

Three weeks later, Major Du came back. I went to the train station to pick him up—not because of the dollar, but because I really looked up to him. I thought that after he came back after three weeks, he would be very happy to see someone picking him up at the station. I specially said, "Let's rent a car to go to the club." But he replied, "No, let's walk."

That night, we were together all the time. Watching Ba Tai. I thought of that dollar at the time, but of course I didn't mention it. How could I mention it! I asked him what currency system was used in Ba Tai, and whether the market price was the same as American silver dollars—I deliberately said American silver dollars a little louder—but in the end, I still couldn't make him remember that dollar.

Soon after, I met Major Du at the club almost every day—I realized that he had completely forgotten about that dollar. One day, I asked him how much travel expenses he spent this time, and he said he didn't keep accounts. Later, I asked him whether he could settle down and live a stable life, and he avoided the question, so I knew it was all over.

I don't hold any grudges against Major Du. I just added him to the list of people who owe me a dollar and forget to return it. There are already quite a few people on the list now. My attitude towards them has not changed. I just hope I can forget about it.

I often meet Major Du. The night before yesterday, I met him while eating. He naturally talked about Poland. He said that Poland would never repay the debt it owed. You always think that this kind of thing would remind him of owing money, right? But it doesn't.

However, at this time, a rather painful thought often comes to my mind. I think, if Major Du owes me a dollar and forgets about it, then theoretically speaking, I should also have the possibility of owing someone a dollar and forgetting about it. Maybe someone also has a list to write down. The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel, because if I forget that I borrowed a dollar from someone, I will never repay it in my whole life.

To those who have ever lent me money in the world, I hope they will speak up, not all at once, but in parts, preferably in alphabetical order. I will immediately write their names on paper, but I have to declare that I don't include those who lent me a dollar when playing poker, and I don't even think about—I deliberately don't think about—the person who lent me thirty cents to buy soda at the sports club last month. But if someone lends me a dollar to pay for a car when I want to go to Ba Tai, I will definitely return that dollar to him.

Not only that, but I want to launch a big movement, a movement to "restore honesty," to get everyone to pay back the money they borrowed. We must remember that the most powerful countries are built on the foundation of absolute honesty.

Finally, I would like to ask the readers not to throw this newspaper away randomly, lest it be seen by Major Du at the University Club. However, if he really sees it and is willing to return the dollar he owes me, then I would also like to thank the person who threw this newspaper away.

### Weather Station

The day before yesterday, the Japanese side announced that in the border area of ​​Manchukuo, they had an air battle with the Soviet Union and shot down 49 Soviet warplanes. The Soviet side denounced it as absurd and not worth a laugh. Now the Soviet communiqué has come out. Fifty-six Japanese planes were shot down. I wonder if the Japanese side will also say that nothing happened. This may be the advertising technique of the 20th century.

Speaking of advertising, I was still saying the day before yesterday that Hong Kong people don't know how to do it. But the color is coming. A female guide actually falsely reported a theft and hoped to see her name in the newspaper. What a skill. Oh dear, I said it, and I'm actually advertising for her.

Yesterday, there were two things in Hong Kong that you can't help but pay attention to. First, the Japanese will run an English newspaper in Hong Kong, investing 260,000 yuan. Second, the secretary of the Japanese consul was taking pictures in the military area.

The epidemic in Hong Kong seems to be quite fierce, but the prevention work doesn't seem to be very good. Many citizens and students have not yet received vaccinations. And the procedure for going to Macau to get vaccinated costs as much as two yuan. This seems to be worth considering and discussing.

### One Person a Day

Everyone should also remember that not long ago, Goering went to Italy for a cruise. Fat Goering also made a special trip to Tripoli Island to visit Italian Air Force Marshal Balbo.

The two air force giants sat together, and they inevitably talked about flying, flying, flying. After Goering blew a ton of German bragging, Balbo was not to be outdone, and talked about the Italian Air Force:

"We have recently invented a light airship that is fast and agile, just like an airplane. General Goering, would you like to try it?"

The opportunity to show off must not be missed. Goering readily agreed to try it, and insisted on driving it himself.

So, the two boarded the ship, Goering drove, and Balbo sat aside. They went into the air.

After flying for a quarter of an hour, everything was fine. The two praised it incessantly. So, they decided to descend, 10,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 3,000 feet, 1,000 feet, 500 feet. Balbo took a look and felt that something was wrong below. It wasn't the sea, it was the airport.

"Old Go, that's not right! This is a ship, it should be on the water..."

"Nonsense! Can I still make a mistake about this? I'm just looking around here."

Saying that, Goering raised the airship again and flew to the sea. Balbo was a little embarrassed.

Finally, it stopped on the sea.

Goering had to praise it again:

"This ship is really good, just like an airplane, it's just a pity that it can't land on land."

They pushed it open, stepped out with one foot, and splashed into the water.

"I told you, this is a ship!" Balbo murmured to himself.

"Thank you, General, this way everyone is more comfortable!"

### Answer:

Yesterday's eight eights are the addition method below. Did you guess it?

### Aphorisms

I hate war, not only because war is dangerous and inconvenient, but also because war sacrifices many young people, among whom there may be a Newton, Einstein, Beethoven, Shakespeare, or even a Shaw Bernard. - Shaw Bernard

I hate funerals. If I can escape, I really don't want to attend my own funeral. - Robert Morley

### Tidbits

Mr. Zhang is the number one advertiser in a major newspaper. He is eloquent and fluent in languages. He is always successful in soliciting advertisements. However, Mr. Zhang is not skilled enough in love affairs.

One day, perhaps because his girlfriend turned him down, Mr. Zhang became disheartened and ran to the beach to join the wave god.

"Hey! You can't jump!" A fat police officer just walked by and grabbed him.

"Why can't I jump?" Mr. Zhang unfolded his silver tongue and talked freely about the reasons why he had to jump.

Five minutes later, guess what, the fat police officer went into the sea with Mr. Zhang.

### 

Previous excerpt In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" loaded with six million gold bars, went from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the CHUKS Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship for a trip. On the ship they received a message saying war had been declared, and that an English warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship started to run wildly aimlessly. Soon, another message came from the wireless saying that there were icebergs nearby. Fortunately, the icebergs soon slipped past, but soon, another British warship came to intercept and started firing, hitting the stern of the ship, but fortunately, fog descended...

At this time, the ship had sailed into the fog. The cruiser knew that the Kaiser Wilhelm II already had a talisman. The hope of reaching her was already very slim. However, they still worked hard to speed up. The smoke in the chimney kept rising, showing that they still wanted to fight with the "gold transport ship" that was fleeing.

The guns on the cruiser Brock fired again, one shot at the stern of the ship, hitting the ship's name inlaid with gold flowers.

"They want to hit the rudder." Jack said, "This is actually a good way."

"But, if they hit it, it won't be good for us." Nanno smiled bitterly.

Two more shots were fired, one from the second cruiser, all hitting nearby. At this time, the fog gradually surrounded the ship, and in just five minutes, it was so thick that you couldn't see your fingers.

So, the blind collision game started again. Captain Locke ordered to open full power... The passengers asked for guarantees and were able to change the method, so that the heat was only within the possible range.

"Under this treatment, Bill cheered up again, hey! Is there anything coming again!"

Outside the fog, it was not known from which direction, a sound could be heard, it seemed like the sound of a heart beating. This was the sound of another ship's engine. What was previously feared was being captured, but now it was feared of collision, because, even in the fog, the captain did not allow the sound of the whistle.

There was simply no way to tell which side it was coming from. It seemed that it could be on either side. Could this be another mail ship, or a warship? This question was a bit troublesome.

In less than a moment, a huge, black ship could be seen vaguely passing by them. In the fog, at a glance, the deck was full of cannons and bullets. It was another British cruiser. Good, just escaped from the tiger's mouth, and sent to the hunter's hand again.

"It's a British warship, it's over!" Bill shouted.

Escaping Death Eight Times

However, the Kaiser Wilhelm II did not just end there. Although, the British on the strange ship, in the midst of the confusion, they did not have time to issue orders, and did not have time to see what was going on. Before they could take a look, they were enveloped in thick fog again.

"My life! If this kind of hardship continues, I really have to go to the mirror to see if my hair has turned white in a hurry." Jack said.

"I'm surprised they didn't take any action." Bill said, "Although, I quite like them not moving."

"They are either too surprised and forgot to fire." Garo said.

"I guess so too." Jack agreed, "No matter why, it's always our lucky star shining."

### The International Exchange Center Remains Unchanged, Shanghai Still Holds the Financial Hub, Industry and Commerce, and Real Estate Are Quite Active, Funds from the Mainland Return to the Shanghai Market

The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Preparation Committee's business report for the Republic of China in 1927, the New Sound News Agency summarized it as follows: This year, the battle line spread, and Shanghai's environment was unprecedentedly difficult. Shanghai, which has always been the financial hub of the country, its position and situation have undergone a change. The reasons why it can still maintain its traditional importance to this day are: First, international exchange is still centered on Shanghai, and transactions are still prosperous; second, the authorities of the two special zones spare no effort to maintain the city's safety and welfare; small industries, commerce and real estate within the boundary are quite active; third, refugees from all over the world come one after another, the population within the boundary increases, and the funds that flowed into the mainland in the previous years are now concentrated in Shanghai again.

(A) Department of Joint Preparation

The Hengli Bank temporarily suspended business on August 9 last year and withdrew from this association.

After the previous settlement, due to the current situation, the regular meeting of bank representatives has not yet been convened.

2.  Prepared Assets

The total amount of prepared assets deposited by the banks, according to the year-end settlement this year, is 57,715,043.56 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 1,932,560.16 yuan compared with the end of 1926. The total amount of all prepared assets was 62.01% of the total valuation in the previous settlement, and 62.44% of the total valuation in the next settlement.

This year, because a small number of colleagues borrowed continuously, the total amount increased greatly compared with last year. The average interest rate of public certificate loans was 30% in national currency and 20% in exchange in the first half of the year, and the average interest rate was 25.8% in national currency and 20% in exchange in the second half of the year.

### Confusion Theory

— Bian Luo

"Confusion" is generally considered a not very bad shortcoming in modern society, which seems to be better than "doing evil"; for example, if someone says that someone has gambled away all his money, that is a temporary confusion, if he holds a knife to rob money, it is a bit "doing evil", but there are also confusions that are praised, "reading does not seek thorough understanding", "not seeking thorough understanding" is a bit of "confusion", but after Tao Yuanming's leisurely way, it has won everyone's praise. It seems that confusion also has art. Like the so-called alcoholics, most of them are a bit confused and criticized, but Li Taibai is not. Zheng Banqiao said something like "hard to be confused", which can be said to be advocating confusion, and now some people are still pursuing it with relish, which shows that things in the world are originally different in their ingenuity.

Confusion also has true and false distinctions. The confusion of so-called celebrities and hermits is mostly not "true stupidity", but "feigned madness". In addition to drinking, Li Taibai can also hum something like "clouds want clothes and flowers want faces", so even today, liquor stores still want to use "Taibai's legacy" as a slogan, while Liu Adou is a practitioner of "life is happy and must be done". And this same "happy not thinking about Shu" is also his honest words, but he has been laughed and scolded to this day. In fact, no matter whether your confusion is true or false, if you hope to use "purity", "hermitage" or other beautiful names to cover up your confused ease, it will be in vain. Liu Adou is a confused egg that should be laughed and scolded, but in modern times, trying to escape through confusion can only prove one's own decline.

The most in the world are confused eggs who think they are smart. They are not only confused themselves, but also hope that others will be as confused as they are. "Seeking skin from a tiger" should be the ideal fool, but some people kowtow to the tiger for mercy, or send some pork, beef, or their own arms and legs, hoping to give the tiger satisfaction. When they know they have been fooled by the tiger, they should sincerely ask the hunter for help, but they are afraid of killing all the tigers in the world, making the world too peaceful. There are many such confused eggs in the world. As for their own clay feet are already unstable, but they still hope to beat others to kneel down, their courage is commendable, but in reality, it is a confused incompetence.

Also, if you put on a mask of peace, and utter a set of lose-lose nonsense, regardless of the right and wrong, and want to use surrender as a way to survive, these kinds of people still cannot escape their guilt with confusion. There are many precedents in history, but what is the result? It is said "stink for ten thousand years!"

There is such a joke: "A nosy person felt pity for the Qin Hui and Wang Shi statues kneeling in front of the Yue Wang Tomb, and dismantled them and threw them into the river, so as not to be insulted all year round. Who knew that he had a dream that night, dreaming that Qin Hui and Wang Shi came to thank him. When he woke up in the morning, he thought: Qin Hui is so effective, if Yue Wang is effective, what will happen? He hurried to the river to fish them up and repeatedly asked them to kneel there, and no one ever dismantled them again, making them eternally destroyed." The joke is absurd, but the love and hate are very obvious. Qin Jian looks very not smart, and that nosy person is not confused to the end, and finally wakes up and understands the so-called right and wrong of the common people. I hope today's good-hearted people will not be so confused!

### On the Longhai Railway Line (Part 2)

— Le Huan

——From Shangqiu to Lanfeng——

Four or five carriages were filled with comrades who had been wounded while fighting for justice, enthusiastically discussing their triumphant experiences at the front lines. Some were vigorously waving their injured arms, forgetting the pain in their flesh, and constantly bursting into loud laughter. Although it was midnight, they showed no signs of fatigue.

Not wanting to infringe on their space and to avoid crowding them further, we decided to move our luggage and briefcases onto the roof of the carriage. We then lay down on the arched rooftop.

As the train slowly moved forward in response to the stationmaster's whistle, we passed through gaps between trees, lying flat on the roof, enjoying the silvery sky, the twinkling stars, and the hazy countryside. The fatigue of the past few days was conquered. We thought of taking a ferry to cool off in Shanghai during the summer and resigned ourselves to our current situation. It almost felt like we were on a night ferry again, being tossed about.

In the gentle night breeze, we felt a bit cold and covered our chests with the army blanket beside us. The comrade leaning on the briefcase had already started snoring softly. The train continued straight through the gaps between the trees.

The special "rooftop" train life for several hours passed comfortably. When we woke up from our sleep, the train had stopped at a small station. The sun was rising in the sky, and the sky was filled with colorful clouds. It was morning.

"Crunch... Crunch..." A very slight tremor was heard. The comrades were scattered around the east side of the station, washing their faces. No one paid much attention to the sound.

The tremor became clearer and clearer. Two black dots were spotted in the red glow in the distance. "It's a plane!" someone in the carriage shouted. The station sounded the alarm, and the comrades with minor injuries quickly scattered into the surrounding wheat fields. Only a few seriously wounded comrades stayed in the carriages, feeling secure.

We first brought our briefcases down from the roof, but because they were too heavy, we couldn't run far. We took cover under a large tree about a hundred meters from the station. A lightly wounded comrade nearby was calmly chewing on a large piece of bread.

The plane gradually approached, circled once, and aimed at the station. But the surroundings were empty, with only a few half-empty carriages lying silently. The locomotive had already moved away when the alarm sounded.

It accelerated and flew over the tracks, dropping two silver "iron eggs" from a high altitude. The iron eggs rubbed against the air, creating a sharp whistling sound. We watched it descend until it was almost overhead before closing our eyes tightly.

"Boom!" The sound finally came. In the roar, we only felt many things falling on us, but they didn't weigh much. The air was filled with gunpowder and dust, and our nostrils were about to be blocked. We couldn't open our eyes at all. A few minutes later, the quiet station began to stir again. We opened our eyes and, through the gray mist, saw the comrade chewing on his bread, muttering to himself, blowing away the dirt and ash from his bowl. He seemed to regret that the dirt had ruined his good bowl of noodles.

Less than fifty meters away, a crowd had gathered around the spot where the bomb had landed. No one was killed or injured. Only a small tree was split. The distributors of destruction and chaos gave people not worry, only rage.

Twenty minutes later, the train continued on, but soon stopped again at Minquan Station, supposedly to change the dressings of wounded comrades. It happened once every day. We took this opportunity to go to a nearby small town to replenish our stomachs.

The town was surprisingly lively. The shops seemed to be temporary structures. Many people were selling things on the streets. Although the sounds of cannons and machine guns were getting closer, they said they would rather die than leave their homes. Every family had one or several Mauser rifles. When the opportunity arose, they could rely on them to fight back.

The dressing change for the wounded comrades ended before eleven o'clock, and it was time to leave at noon. We returned to the train and saw that three more "Overseas Chinese Relief Team" cars had been added to the rear. More than a dozen young men and women in their twenties, wearing uniforms and red cross armbands, were sitting and standing by the train. They were led by a foreigner over forty years old and were a very active group.

We immediately wanted to visit them in their car.

After explaining our intentions, the foreigner greeted us warmly. He spoke fluent Mandarin.

He was born in Nanyang. His father was Chinese, and his mother was British. Although he was an older man, his patriotic zeal was no less than that of the young people in the motherland. After the war started, he raised funds in Nanyang and led more than a dozen enthusiastic young people who were studying there back to the embrace of their motherland. The old gentleman introduced us to these young men and women, who were just as young as we were. We shook hands warmly and reported our past experiences to each other in an orderly manner. They all spoke fluent Mandarin. New friends showed the same affection as old friends. We were already on fire with each other.

When it was about to depart, they earnestly asked us to join them in their car. We did not decline and moved our boxes and luggage over. Because the sun was scorching, we went into the ambulance.

"Sitting in a car on a train is also a very rare thing!" Sizheng said in a humorous tone, which made everyone laugh.

We talked and sang all the way until the train arrived in Lanfeng at night.

### Expectations for the Readers of the Supplement

— Shangqing

This is not me being mysterious, nor am I deliberately exaggerating. If it is right to say that the importance of contributors to a supplement is greater than that of the editor, then it is especially right to say that the importance of readers is greater than that of contributors. The reason is very simple: the editor is the distributor, the contributor is the supplier, and the reader is the consumer. According to general principles, demand can determine everything, so readers can also influence editors and contributors. In addition, readers are the absolute majority, readers are the public, and editors and contributors must obey them.

Since readers wield supreme authority over a supplement, I especially want to express my hopes to them.

Many readers, especially young students, think that editors and contributors are always talented people, their articles are always good, and their opinions are always right. Therefore, when they see works that are really inexplicable or contrary to their wishes, they vaguely accept them and dare not ask questions. This is wrong. They should recognize that editors and contributors are by no means perfect geniuses and that they will always have shortcomings. Therefore, I hope that such readers will not be humble.

However, there are many readers, mostly older but also some younger, who are the opposite of the former. They think that editors are always fools and contributors are always mediocre. They don't even bother to look at their supplement. They seem to expect the editor to ask them for advice and other contributors to wait for them to join before they are satisfied. This is also wrong. After all, the establishment of a supplement must have its reasons for existing. You cannot simply dismiss its editors and contributors. Therefore, I hope that such readers will not be arrogant.

Readers who are neither humble nor arrogant are proper readers. I hope that they will express their opinions about a supplement, in other words, about the editors and contributors of the supplement, if they have any. The way to do this is to write a letter to the editor or become a contributor themselves and submit an article. In this way, the editor and other contributors will certainly benefit from your opinions, and all readers, including yourself, will be positively influenced by you.

When you express your opinions in this way, you will naturally know that you should say what you do not agree with and what you hope for. You will naturally also know that you should not be long-winded or overzealous, but speak calmly and frankly. This is the attitude you should take. You know this, so I don't need to say more. But when you use this attitude to express your opinions, especially when writing a letter to the editor, I hope you will have the following two resolutions:

Accept good: If you express your own mistakes, you will be willing to withdraw your opinions and will certainly not argue irrationally or become angry, causing unnecessary and harmful trouble for both parties. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will certainly not allow you to indulge in selfishness.

Reject evil: Conversely, if you find that you are not wrong, I hope that you will persevere and repeatedly state your case to achieve your goals, or at least make the supplement you are concerned about revise to a slightly satisfactory point, because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will naturally support your legitimate claims.

Of course, I know that the difficulty is that you do not know whether your own opinions are wrong. Therefore, I hope that you will not express your opinions for the time being until you have a good grasp and fully understand a problem. Wait until you have true knowledge and insight before you put your attitude and resolution into practice.

In short, I hope that every reader of a supplement will regard the supplement you are reading as your own property and imagine that you are the editor and the contributor. You must cherish it: If it is good, you must promote and enhance it; if it is not good, you must correct it and help it. Every proper supplement is always willing to hear the opinions of readers. I hope that you will fulfill your responsibilities as readers and satisfy it.

It is true that supplements can guide readers; however, it is especially true that readers can promote supplements. Supplements must cooperate with readers, that is, cooperate with editors and contributors, so that both supplements and readers can benefit.

Think about it: Which supplement should be promoted and enhanced? Which supplement should be corrected or helped? I hope that you will put it into practice once you have thought about it!

### Expectations for Photojournalists

— Wang Jiesheng

No one can deny that photography is an important part of propaganda. Since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident opened the prelude to the war, and the August 13th Songhu Battle, comrades engaged in photography have been active in the torrent of the great era, working very hard under the enemy's artillery fire. Both the front and the rear have their footprints, giving us a lot of stimulation, a lot of understanding, and even giving the world a confirmation, exposing the evildoings of the × people. It has played a very important role in propaganda. Don't underestimate these few pieces of glass, they are the demon-revealing mirror of the East Asian fascist bandits.

However, since the Battle of Xuzhou, we have rarely seen the tense work and active posture of photography comrades. For this reason, in the fierce battle of De'an on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway line, the ferocious enemy released poison gas regardless of humanity and international law. We can only see the strange appearance of our loyal soldiers after being poisoned in the text of newspapers, but no photography comrades took pictures of these enemy's criminal evidence to give us a deeper understanding of the rear people and lost good materials for international public relations. In the past, the great victory of De'an on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway line and the defense of Wuhan and other battles, and the recent counter-offensives in various war zones. The activity of the guerrillas, these many real situations of the war of resistance, the commendable and moving feats of the loyal soldiers, are of unknown importance to propaganda. It is very able to inspire everyone's spirit and deepen the people's Liu "the most shifting victory is our confidence", but we rarely see it.

In the second phase of the War of Resistance, no matter what aspect we have accelerated to meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance. Can you abandon the photography comrades who bear a heavy responsibility for propaganda? Can you lag behind? And recently, the government has issued a general order to the commanders of various war zones to provide as much help as possible to reporters and give the greatest convenience in transportation and various aspects. Here, comrades should know how much the government is expecting and encouraging. Comrades, hurry up and work hard, catch up quickly!

Photography comrades, we must have the determination to sacrifice. We are not afraid of hardship and difficulty, go to the front line and the enemy's rear, and even meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance. We must arm the camera!

### Plunged into the Motherland

— Zhan Yi

——Still a Story of a Girl——

"I said I was a dancer from the metropolis, my name is Lili, I came to Hong Kong to do business, I..."

"Forget it, I don't want to listen anymore, hurry up and change clothes and wash your face."

They stood up in a hurry, one washing her face and the other changing clothes. Soon, they both returned to their original appearance as young female students.

"We shouldn't keep these clothes with us, it will be troublesome when we get there, why not wrap them up and throw them into the sea."

"That's fine, I also want to see what the sea looks like."

They put the clothes they took off in a cloth bag, said they were opening it, and walked towards the deck.

They both felt their footsteps were light, as if they were in a dream. Everything that touched their eyes was so unfamiliar that they had to ask themselves: "Could it be that this is still a dream?"

When they walked to the deck, they suddenly felt that it was not a dream. The winter sea breeze blew sharply through their clothes, making them feel cold and wet. The dampness was the easiest to cause people discomfort; but they felt very refreshed. Except for two or three sailors washing the deck, there was no one else. They arbitrarily sang wordless songs from their hearts, as if all the terror and depression were closed and the song was spat out and dissipated above the vast sea.

Walking closer to the side of the ship, they looked at the sea more carefully. The sea was still calm, but as the ship rushed past, it angrily shouted, rolling with snow-white foam, and roaring unevenly.

They threw the package down, as if the sea had opened its mouth waiting for it, and swallowed it in one bite. Then it turned out again, but it had retreated a little. After sinking again, it was left far away with the foam.

### "July 7th" War of Resistance Commemorative Flowers: Circular to Overseas Chinese Organizations to Start Accepting Orders, Limited to Three Days, Registration Deadline on the 29th; Women's War Relief Association Donates Standard National Flags to Raise Funds

The "July 7th" Vegetarian Flower Sale Campaign launched by the United Federation of Relief for Refugees in South China is intensifying its various tasks. Yesterday, registration for flower collection began at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. In view of the fact that some groups last year actually embezzled the flower money without following the methods of the conference, arbitrarily distributed it, or even concealed it without reporting it, the conference will strictly handle it this year. The circular for flower orders will only be sent to registered overseas Chinese organizations and schools with verifiable addresses. Those who have not registered must provide an official letter from their respective organizations, businesses, or schools to apply, and then the conference will review and approve them to receive the flowers, in order to prevent abuses. The flowers this year are also specially made, using white flowers sprayed with violet, which is not easy for outsiders to imitate. The circulars sent to overseas Chinese organizations totaled 594 letters, which began to be distributed yesterday. All overseas Chinese organizations and schools must first register the number of flowers they wish to order with the office within three days (until the 29th), so that they can be compiled and customized. The estimated number of flowers to be customized is 350,000. The conference also issued an outline of the flower sale campaign, notifying all organizations to comply with it properly.

Outline of the Vegetarian Flower Sale Campaign

(1) Name: "July 7th" Vegetarian and Flower Sale Campaign Conference. (2) Purpose: To commemorate the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots and raise patriotic donations for national salvation. (3) Organization: Jointly responsible and assisted by all Hong Kong overseas Chinese organizations. (4) Responsibilities: (A) Leaders of all overseas Chinese organizations should notify all members of their respective organizations to follow the central government's order to implement vegetarianism. The association will also hold indoor flower sales to raise funds. (B) The savings from the vegetarian meal and the money raised from the flower sales by each overseas Chinese organization may be used for refugee relief or other patriotic donations, but all the funds raised by each association, regardless of the amount, must be handed over to the conference, which will allocate them. (5) Methods: (A) Commemorative flowers will be collected by each overseas Chinese organization from the conference with funds (priced at two yuan and fifty cents per thousand). (B) Each overseas Chinese organization may adapt to its own environment to sell commemorative flowers, seeking to promote convenient and effective methods. (C) Flower sales are limited to indoor sales and should not be hawked outdoors. (D) The commemorative flowers are not priced, and the flower purchasers are free to donate as much as they wish. (E) Each overseas Chinese organization should notify all members of the association to wear flowers on the "July 7th" anniversary to commemorate. (F) Regarding the money from flower sales, each overseas Chinese organization should provide its own storage containers, properly seal them, or use other fraud prevention methods to emphasize the relief funds.

Letter of Notification to All Colleagues from the Organization

To Whom It May Concern, Since the Lugouqiao Incident, it has been two years now. Our government has designated July 7th as the Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. All Chinese people should have a grand commemoration to mark this day and not forget it. Our association intends to follow the central government's order to observe vegetarianism and hold indoor flower sales on this day to commemorate our loyal soldiers and deceased compatriots, and to awaken the deep awareness of our overseas Chinese. We believe that our colleagues love the country and are never behind others, and they will definitely express sympathy for this initiative. We are writing to ask you to subscribe to commemorative flowers and persuade your colleagues to sell them, and be sure to wear them on the July 7th anniversary to mark this day and not forget it. However, the association urgently needs to know the exact number of subscriptions in advance so that it can collect them from the conference. The subscription notice is enclosed with the letter. Please fill in the quantity of subscriptions as soon as possible and return it to the association for reporting to the conference. Thank you. The gist of the methods is excerpted below: (1) Practice vegetarianism for one day. (2) Hold indoor flower sales and wear them on the July 7th anniversary. (3) All savings from vegetarian meals and flower sales will be handed over to the directly affiliated organizations to be submitted to the conference for distribution. (4) The flowers sold are not priced, and people can donate as much as they wish. Even one cent can buy them. (5) Because the flowers are not easy to manufacture temporarily, all flower recipients must fill out the flower subscription form on the day of receiving the circular and return it to the association.

War Relief Association Donates National Flags to Raise Relief Funds

The Women's War Relief Association, in order to commemorate the second anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance, is taking the opportunity to carry out practical disaster relief work, and has launched a campaign to donate standard national flags to raise funds and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. It has decided to start sending out teams from the 28th of this month, carrying letters to donate national flags to shops and residences in Hong Kong and Kowloon, soliciting relief funds, and hoping that overseas Chinese will actively accept them so that small contributions can add up to a great amount. The statutory standard national flags will be displayed during the "July 7th" anniversary to fully express the patriotic and national preservation enthusiasm in the fluttering flags, and the thousands of refugees will also share the same grace and benevolence.

### Quarantine Between Hong Kong and Macau: Western Doctor's Certificate is Valid, But Must Be Stamped by the Department of Health; Handling Fee of Two Yuan Per Certificate

Regarding the issue of preventing the spread of cholera, the Hong Kong health authorities have cooperated with the Macau authorities to prevent it. All passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Macau must have been vaccinated against cholera within six days to six months prior and have a certificate in order to land. Since the two governments announced this regulation, the general public has flocked to Western doctors licensed by the government to get vaccinated and issued a certificate by the doctor. However, it was later heard that the health authorities announced that this type of certificate that has not been signed by the Hong Kong Port Health Department is invalid, so the Hong Kong Port Health Department has been extremely crowded with people waiting for the certificate to be signed in recent days. However, whether this announcement by the Health Bureau is true or not has not been confirmed. However, the Chinese Medical Association of Hong Kong heard this and was very surprised, because there are no less than one hundred Western doctors in Hong Kong who have government licenses. According to precedents, when the Hong Kong government promulgates new regulations that are related to health issues, it must first notify the Chinese Medical Association to inform all Western doctors. What is the reason why the Health Bureau implemented this regulation without notifying the association in advance? If the truth is to be stated, then all Western doctors in Hong Kong will be greatly affected by this. Therefore, the association specially sent a letter to the health authorities yesterday, raising this issue and requesting an explanation, but as of yesterday, the association had not yet received a reply from the Health Bureau. According to a Western doctor who spoke to the reporter yesterday, there may be some misunderstandings among the public regarding this matter, because anyone who is vaccinated against cholera at a Western doctor's office will be issued a certificate by the doctor, proving that the person has been vaccinated on a certain day. However, the certificate must be submitted to the Hong Kong Port Health Department for a handling fee of two yuan, and the medical officer of the department will stamp and sign it before it can be valid. There is no need for the Hong Kong Port Health Department to administer the cholera vaccine again. With one certificate, you can travel between Hong Kong and Macau within six months without having to obtain another certificate.

### Cartoon Exhibition

The Youth Association has been running a cartoon class for more than a year and has cultivated many talents.

There were many visitors, which shows the public's deep understanding of the War of Resistance.

### Flashback: The Dispute Over Gas Masks - Henry Keswick & Sons' Appeal Rejected Yesterday, Original Ruling in Favor of the Fourth Route Army Upheld

Yesterday at the High Court, Justices MacGregor and Trisaw presided over the appeal case concerning the HK$190,000 gas mask dispute. The appellant was Henry Keswick & Sons. Messrs. Deacons retained barristers Sir Athol McGregor and Macnamara to argue the appeal. The respondent, the Fourth Route Army, retained barrister Mr. Woo Siu-how who in turn retained barrister Potter to defend. The details of the hearing are recorded below.

Background to the Dispute

The dispute originated back in 1937 when the representative of the Fourth Route Army stationed in Hong Kong entered into a contract with Henry Keswick & Sons to purchase 100,000 gas masks, valued at HK$190,000, and 8,000 highly explosive bombs, valued at £42,000, equivalent to over HK$670,000. Part of the gas masks arrived in Hong Kong around November 1937. However, the Fourth Route Army found that the masks did not match the samples and sued the company in the District Court, demanding the return of the HK$190,000 already paid. The company refused and counter-sued the Fourth Route Army for the £42,000 owed for the bombs. The District Court ruled that the counter-claim was unfounded and should be withdrawn. The company disagreed and appealed yesterday. This is the origin of the dispute.

Contract Contents

After the court was called to order, barrister Sir Athol McGregor spoke first, detailing the purchase agreement and the primary reasons for the lawsuit, as described above. McGregor added that the District Court's ruling was incorrect and that the £42,000 owed for the bombs should be included in the claim, as the goods became the buyer's responsibility as soon as they left the factory. Barrister Potter, representing the Fourth Route Army, then argued that although the bomb contract stipulated a BAG (Buyer Assumes Guilt) arrangement (meaning the seller is responsible for all costs, insurance, and freight), the goods had not yet been shipped from Europe and the transport documents had not been delivered to the Fourth Route Army. McGregor countered that the company had already allocated the goods for the buyer and intended to ship them, but the buyer refused. Potter responded that while McGregor's argument had some merit, he did not fully understand the true nature of the matter. The nature of C.I.F. (Cost, Insurance, Freight) is not a conclusive contract, meaning simply instructing the manufacturer to allocate the goods to the buyer does not complete the process. Rather, the seller must deliver all shipping documents to the buyer before there is a valid claim to take possession of the goods. Since all documents had not yet been delivered to the buyer, even if the contract included a statement that the factory had delivered the goods, it still could not be used to counter-claim that the Fourth Route Army had breached the contract.

Appeal Rejected

Potter continued, stating that the case was invalid purely because all documents had not been received by the seller, and the Fourth Route Army was therefore justified in refusing payment. He also refuted McGregor's claim that although the appellant did not intentionally demand payment from the Fourth Route Army, appealing on this basis was completely irrelevant. Justice McGregor then spoke, stating that whether the appeal was legitimate or not, it should be concluded promptly and not dragged on. In his opinion, the case required further study. At this point, Justice McGregor ruled to reject the appeal, stating that the case had been vigorously debated and had reached its conclusion. He still considered the District Court's ruling to be appropriate and would release his written judgment in the coming days.

### Chaozhou Community Relief Association Representative to Meet Xu Shiying Today to Request Funds for Chaozhou and Shantou Refugees; 500 Refugees Concentrated in Jiaoshi in Shantou

The Chaozhou community in Hong Kong has been extremely busy preparing relief efforts for their homeland. The association had already issued telegrams to government authorities and Chaozhou organizations overseas. Yesterday, association directors Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei, Chen Yongzhai, Chen Zizhao, Hong Heyou, and others held a meeting at the Si Wei Company office, deciding to nominate Lin Zifeng to approach Xu Shiying, representative of the Central Relief Committee, to request funds to aid Shantou. Lin is scheduled to meet with Chairman Xu today to discuss the matter. Lin Zishi, responsible for drafting the association's relief plan and outline, has already completed it and will present it for discussion at a meeting tonight at 7:30 PM. The plan's fundraising methods are broadly divided into two points: issuing donation registers to wealthy Chaozhou individuals and launching a "One Dime Campaign" to encourage all Chaozhou people in Hong Kong to contribute. Regarding the refugee situation in the affected areas, current reports indicate that only 500-600 refugees remain in Shantou, concentrated in the Jiaoshi area, urgently in need of assistance. Further information is still awaited. Additionally, the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Association for South China War Refugees held a regular meeting at the Women's War Relief Association yesterday at 3:30 PM. Attendees included Ye Lanquan (Chairman), Li Jianfeng, Shan Dexin, Lu Guomian, Liu Qingxuan, and others. The meeting resolved to: (1) allocate HK$2,000 to the Foshan Refugee Relief Association; (2) have the Red Cross Society's rescue department take charge of sending an ambulance to Shantou; and (3) for the relief group and auditors to expedite their examination and report on the group's annual accounts.

### × Switches to Piracy Tactics Against Our Fishing Boats, Resulting in HK$60,000 Losses This Month

Since the outbreak of war in South China, the barbarous acts of × against our fishermen have been commonplace. According to the Fishermen's Progressive Association, losses incurred since last year total over HK$600,000. While the last few months have seen a slight decrease, × has now adopted even more sinister methods than simply looting goods and burning fishing boats. Formerly, burning fishing boats served only to satisfy ×'s 　　　　　 momentary impulse and yielded little profit. Recently, × has shifted to piracy tactics. When looting, × now orders the fishermen to steer the boat to shore, allows them to disembark, and then steals the boat. Twelve such incidents have been reported to the association this month, with losses totaling over HK$60,000.

### New Advertising Technique: Tour Guide Accuses Tourist of Robbery - The Inside Story Revealed, the Goal Was to Get the Story Published in Newspapers, the Drugging and Theft of Rings Were All Fabricated

Wong Hei, a young man, was accused of stealing two gold rings belonging to Li Qiyun, a female tour guide from Hollywood Tour Guide Service on Bonham Strand East, from the New China Hotel last month, the 24th. This case was further examined yesterday afternoon by Magistrate Edwards at the Central Magistracy. Although the crime was a common theft, the plaintiff stated that after chewing the gum given to her by the defendant, her spirit gradually became disturbed, making the case more complicated. During yesterday's hearing, the government chemist, Mr. Tai Tsang, was called to court to analyze the effects of narcotics on consciousness. He stated that narcotics must be bitter, and it would be difficult to mix them with gum without a special taste. He also stated that a person would become unconscious fifteen minutes after chewing the drugged gum. Afterward, the defendant testified that he was a student at a school in Macau and had known the plaintiff for over a year. When he came to Hong Kong last month, he called the plaintiff to his hotel to talk. He was short on cash and asked her to lend him thirty dollars. The plaintiff replied that she did not have enough money on hand. He then asked her to get the money from her company, but she said she could not. She then suggested that she could give him the rings to pawn. He repeatedly asked her to give him her watch, but she said the watch was very important to her work and she could not part with it. He did not press the matter further. She then said that if her colleagues at the company found out, they would criticize her. She suggested going to the police station to report the theft so that the newspapers would publish the story and make her more famous. The two agreed that he would return the items in a week. On the 20th of this month, he met her near the Datong Restaurant, and she demanded the items back. When he could not produce them, he fled. The magistrate then offered his opinion, stating that according to the hotel manager, the plaintiff did not appear to be in any unusual state, so her testimony was not credible. At the same time, the defendant had fully disclosed the details of the case, but the prosecution had offered a considerable rebuttal. He then judged the defendant innocent, and the defendant was released.

### Chinese Art Troupe to Hold Sixth Performance, Three Consecutive Days Starting on the 28th, Mandarin and Cantonese Groups Performing Simultaneously

The Chinese Art Troupe, led by Ouyang Yuqian, is scheduled to hold its sixth major performance at the Central Theatre in Hong Kong for three consecutive days starting on the 28th. To adapt to the current environment and local needs, the troupe has established a Cantonese group. The actors in the Cantonese group are all well-known movie stars from South China who feel that the current South China film productions are not aligned with the war of resistance and national reconstruction. They have therefore dedicated part or all of their time to the iron theatre movement under Ouyang Yuqian's leadership. In this performance, the Mandarin and Cantonese groups will perform simultaneously. The Mandarin group will perform the matinee. On the 28th, they will perform "The Righteous Song," a national defense drama collectively created by the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Shaanxi. On the 29th, they will perform "A Moment of Pride," a three-act satirical play written by Chen Baichen. On the 30th, they will perform Ouyang Yuqian's "In the Green Gauze Tent" and the one-act play "Dawn." The troupe has performed these three national defense dramas before with great success. This revival aims to achieve widespread publicity. Ticket prices are only one, two, three, and four dimes. The Cantonese group will perform "Flowers Splashed with Tears" for three consecutive nights starting on the evening of the 28th. The play has been performed several times in Shanghai, drawing huge crowds. The play depicts the various forms of oppression faced by women, and the plot is very moving. The Cantonese group performance will feature talent such as Zhu Jianqin, Li Danlu, Li Youci, Yu Liang, Hu Meilun, Hu Dieli, Zhang Chong, Chen Tianzong, Zhang Jingyuan, and Feng Feng.

### Island Scenery! "Mahjong" "Teen Gow"

By: Yu Man

Special Feature in This Newspaper

The setting sun kisses the western mountains. Scale-like flowing clouds, clusters of red, clusters of yellow, purple and blue, are colored especially movingly. The sea breeze blows in the evening, ruffling the thin silk garments of the rich.

--At this time, the bustling city seems to whisper to people in private: This wonderful time is not right without "Mahjong"... Women and children, if you are not proficient, you always have the familiar "Teen Gow" [a Chinese domino game]!

Mahjong and Teen Gow are our national essence, we have this charming national essence! Walk on the long street, walk in the alley, whether it is the villa of the rich or the home of the poor. Simply, there is not a place that is not a crazy clamor of clattering and banging!

It is a villa: On the streamlined copper railing, brightly reflects a three-headed electric lamp, the fan is waving on the top, the crimson silk lampshade, unusually magnificent, expensive furniture, the yellow orange shines brightly on the women sitting on the sofa dressed in red and green. Fan-tailed palms sway elegantly in the wind, the ladies’ “cloud whiskers” are also full of smiles in the wind! Rustling, clattering—their “gambling life” starts like this. It is the home of the poor, beside the stone mercy, hung tattered clothes, a dirty and broken awning made of burlap, drooping down--is the corner of the arcade, rustling, clattering, they are the beginning of gambling.

Hotels, restaurants, the authority of the night dominates the souls of the metropolis! Elevators, hauling up batches of pleasure seekers, listening rooms, seats, are full of an atmosphere of drunken life and dreaming death! Second floor, third floor, up to the top floor. There are no seats, ah, rustling...clatter! “Red Middle” “White Board” “Get Rich” mixed with arguments and debates, debts and clear wins, the atmosphere has a deep smell of cigarettes, as well as the fragrance of tea, coffee, especially the fragrance of rouge!

Clubs, are also dissolving pleasantly, here, there are no ball games, no ping-pong games, and no music or books. Most of the clubs in your country are happy to "gamble"! Gambling, and everyone is happy, as the name implies, this is the "club." Because participants in entertainment often have disputes, almost all club walls conspicuously hang "Mahjong Rules"—"…nine cards on the ground…play again… to cover…sea bottom fishing, limited to夭筒, the rest is counted as three fan…”. Such complexity is unbelievable, losing money, rules, regulations, damn it! Are you still afraid of the limitations of regulations when you lose money?

People, people who are addicted in the circle. In short, in every space, even if it is so crowded that water cannot leak through the two-story building, they have to "fight spleen"! On the bed, in the corner, even, next to the threshold of the kitchen, they also sat or stood five or six friends of Mahjong or Teen Gow. In terms of time, regardless of day and night, almost the painting is their time. All-night, people with illnesses must also sacrifice for gambling! Cerebral hemorrhage is the cause of their death, but, one after another, they seem to be striving for the final victory with an "immortal" determination?

As for Mahjong and Teen Gow “yes,” their gambling spirit is really astounding! A shop with no windows, has more than ten square tables horizontally and vertically. People sweating, almost more than fifty people gathered, suffocating air filled the entire shop, however, they also forget to eat and sleep, and fight each other to go to "war," for the body? Or for the soul" This, I do not know.

Statistics, this is a shocking statistic: How many "Mahjong Teen Gow lending agencies" are there in Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula? One thousand, good! At a minimum, on average, each has at least five sets of Mahjong and ten sets of Teen Gow. Fifty percent are rented out every day! The total number of Mahjong is two thousand and five, and the total number of Teen Gow is five thousand; side generals, at least four people, Teen Gow, may well discuss with four people, multiplied by four, there are 10,000 people playing Mahjong, and 20,000 people playing Teen Gow. (—Mahjong halls are not yet included.) And the "time" that these 30,000 people spend in "gambling" is only left to smart readers to accurately calculate.

The motherland is in the smoke of war everywhere, the soldiers in the front are bleeding and breaking their heads, today, when 450 million people are suffering a great disaster together, people of all Chinese children have a position to save the country. If there are these 30,000 people in Hong Kong every day, what would the situation of the motherland be like if they spent the time in "four circles" "eight circles" "twelve circles" ... to rescue the motherland? When Schlander was quiet, under the pen of this astonishing statistics, we had such an estimation!

### Japanese Consulate Secretary Violates Order, Takes Photos in Military Zone, Detained at Police Station for Questioning Before Release, Truth Likely to Emerge from Film Processing

Hong Kong's military areas prohibit photography by outsiders. During this emergency period, the ban is enforced even more strictly. On the afternoon of the 25th, two Japanese nationals, a man and a woman, defied the order and took photographs in the restricted area near Davis Battery on Pok Fu Lam Road. While they were taking the photographs, they were discovered by reconnaissance officers, who intervened and sent the two Japanese nationals to the police station for questioning. The Japanese man identified himself as Matsumoto, a long-serving employee of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong. The woman with him was his sister. After a brief interrogation, the police released both of them without bail. At the same time, they declined to comment on the matter. The Japanese national was using a small camera with a 2.8 lens, which could capture everything clearly regardless of weather conditions. The police authorities have confiscated the camera and are processing the film to determine the area that was photographed. The future disposition of the matter is still unknown. The reporter from the Hong Kong Telegraph later visited Matsumoto to inquire about what happened. He said that he was the secretary of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong and the woman was his sister. At the time, they were taking photos of each other on the Peak. Later, the police intervened and sent them to the police station for questioning. All that can be said is that, in addition to taking personal photos, they did not photograph any other houses or buildings. The film is currently being processed by the police station, and the truth will emerge soon.

### Victoria Swimming Club vs. Intercity Swimming Competition - Discussing Going to Shanghai to Participate - Intending to Use Proceeds from Water Skills Association to Allocate Travel Expenses - Army Representative Greatly Interested in Intercity Competition

Yesterday afternoon at 5:45, the Victoria Swimming Club, in order to discuss the matter of participating in this year's Intercity Swimming Competition to be held in Shanghai, specially convened the entire swimming community to hold a meeting at the club. The attendees only included Jie Choushi of the Victoria Club, Robes, Shili, Balidu, Gao Luwen of the YMCA, Colonel Wen of the Army Club, and Huang Shaoxiong of the Chinese YMCA. Chairman Jie Tian Shi first read the letter from Shanghai inviting the Hong Kong team to go to Shanghai in early September, saying that according to precedent, this Intercity Swimming Competition should be held in Shanghai. If we do not go this time, the Intercity Competition between the two places in the future will be interrupted. Therefore, after receiving the letter, the club had no choice but to temporarily accept Shanghai's proposal. In previous years, Victoria Club members who were selected to participate in the competition received travel subsidies from their parent club, but this method cannot be generalized. Therefore, the club proposes that in the future, the surplus from the Intercity Competition should be allocated to a reserve fund as travel expenses for athletes between the two places. This time, the expenses for going to Shanghai are planned to be raised by the Water Skills Association.

Robes said that the travel expenses to Shanghai are about 150 to 160 yuan per athlete, which is a considerable expense.

Army Representative Wen said that we military personnel are very interested in participating in the Intercity Competition and will definitely work hard to make it happen in the future.

Jie Tianshi finally said that in previous years, the Hong Kong Open Swimming Competition hosted by Victoria was mostly held in late autumn. If this Intercity Competition can be held in Shanghai in early September, the Hong Kong Open Championship will be held in August, and the team can be selected from this. Currently, only one person from the Chinese Association is participating in this meeting, making it impossible to have in-depth discussions. A second meeting will be convened in two or three weeks.

The items for the Intercity Competition are as follows: 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 220-yard freestyle, 440-yard freestyle, 880-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, 100-yard breaststroke, 180-yard three-person three-style swimming, 240-yard four-person relay swimming, fancy diving, water polo competition.

### Public Water Polo Competition - Zong Sheng Actually Overwhelms South China - Chinese A Also Wins West YMCA Three to Zero

The first evening of the Hong Kong Public Water Polo Competition, held at 8:30 last night, was held at the Chinese Association and South China Association venues respectively. The match at the Chinese venue was between Chinese A and the Western Youth YMCA. Chinese A is the best of the Hong Kong water polo teams, with strong strength and overlooking everything. However, the opponent is not weak, but compared with Chinese A, in terms of technology, it is slightly inferior. As a result, the Western Youth YMCA succumbed and was miserably defeated by Chinese A by a score of three to zero. As for the Zhong Sheng team versus South China team match held at the same time, it was held at the South China venue. The South China team has strong strength and won the water polo championship last year, dominating North Point. Last night, the entire team went into battle, but the Zhong Sheng team was tenacious, not long in strength, and worked hard to fight, striving to frustrate its vigor. As a result, the ambition was achieved and they won with a score of two to zero.

### Important Local News in Southern China - The Guangdong Industrial Management Office Actively Plans - To Develop Provincial Industries - Convening Factory Directors to Shaoguan to Discuss Implementation

[Qujiang Airmail] After Li Han-hun took over the provincial government, he devoted himself to planning the development of rear area production and construction, and paid special attention to the organization of wartime industries. The Industry Office was specially restored. From then on, the development of wartime industries. The office has moved to northern Guangdong for many days. On the 18th, the reporter visited Deputy Director Zhang Zhongxin to inquire about various matters. According to the conversation, the following is the case.

Past Situation of Provincial Industries

After the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, the aggressors continuously tried to sabotage the Guangdong provincial industries. In order to support the long-term resistance war and maintain the original industries, we actively maintained them in a difficult environment. And last October, the aggressors launched the South China War. After Guangzhou was trampled on by the aggressors, the provincial factories were forced to completely shut down. The Industry Office also moved to Xijiangnan Road after the fall of Guangzhou, and was in the process of winding down. Chairman Li returned to govern Guangdong, believing that industry is of utmost importance to wartime production, and that it is necessary to adjust and restore it in time. He specially ordered the office to move from Xijiang to northern Guangdong, and to actively develop our wartime industries in accordance with the construction department of the wartime administration program.

The Entire Development Plan Has Been Set

After the office moved to northern Guangdong, in addition to implementing the construction part of the recently approved wartime administration program of the provincial government, it will also implement the support of local private industries, welcome overseas Chinese to return to invest, and move coastal private factories to the interior according to the results of Director Zhu Xiaori's inspection tour. Currently, we are starting to convene the former factory directors and managers of provincial factories to Shaoguan to make a general settlement of the past factory operations and matters to be organized. Reviewing the past and encouraging the future is currently a period of reorganization.

Both Human and Material Resources are Valued

The five issues that should be paid attention to in the future are financial resources, human resources, raw materials, transportation, and management. Since the provincial industries were destroyed by the aggressors, production has been suspended, funds are not available, and there are many debts. First of all, in terms of finance, we rely on overseas Chinese investment and the support of all parties. Second, in terms of human resources, such as technical professionals and workers, we must also find ways to recruit them. Third, in terms of raw materials, because the coast has been blockaded by the aggressors, the source of raw materials is often interrupted or unsustainable. Therefore, inland industries must find places to produce raw materials themselves in order to achieve self-sufficiency. The fourth and fifth transportation and management items should not be ignored. Because inconvenient transportation will make it impossible to sell the products, and poor management will also hinder the entire plan. The office is currently planning in detail to solve the above major problems.

### East River Floods - Agricultural Harvests Have Been Hopeless

(East River Express) In recent days, there has been continuous heavy rain in Longchuan, Laolong, Heyuan and other places in the upper reaches of the East River. The river water has risen again, and all low-lying villages along the river have been submerged again. All agricultural products and fruits and vegetables have been flooded three times, and the harvest is hopeless. The general farmers have suffered three floods in a row, and they are all complaining. It is found that in Huizhou, the village roads attached to the city are all submerged, and the transportation is all by boat. It is now the evacuation period, and the general old, weak, women and children go out in the morning and return in the evening. Because of the water, the general boatmen are raising prices three times as much during this period. It is found that since the 23rd, the weather in the upper reaches has cleared up, and the East River water has slowed down and gradually receded by more than a foot. It should be able to completely recede within one or two days. Fortunately, this time the East River flooded again, but it did not cause a disaster for long, but the losses should also be significant.

### Large-Scale Armed Fighting in Boluo - Still Not Ceased - Both Sides Are Going to Extremes - It Will Inevitably Be a Lose-Lose Situation

[East River Express] Dozens of villages in Su Village, Boluo County, including Pushang and Puxin, have recently experienced an unprecedented large-scale armed fighting, with deaths and injuries everywhere. The authorities of Huizhou and Boluo counties sent teams to suppress the fighting, but it has not yet ceased. It is found that on the 19th, Huang Zhongyu, the county magistrate of Boluo County, led a team to mediate separately. When they arrived at Dingling, the red flag boundary of the Red Flag Township, the red flag villagers mistakenly thought it was a white flag squad and opened fire with machine guns at the Huang County magistrate's troops. Later, the shooting stopped after County Magistrate Huang blew his whistle to signal. County Magistrate Huang is now trying to suppress the fighting. If the two sides still do not stop, they will only ask their superiors to implement a military solution. It is found that the grievances between the Red and White flags are getting deeper and deeper. Now, the teams are in place to suppress the fighting. On the surface, it is still relaxed, but in fact, both sides are secretly planting their own forces and recruiting villagers from several counties to enlist in the army. The movement is frequent. If villagers nearby are willing to join the armed fighting, each person will be given 50 yuan of national currency. Judging from this point, it is enough to prove that the two sides are preparing for a decisive battle, and there is a trend that they will not stop until both sides are scattered and injured.

### Fierce Fighting Rages Anew

Our Army Attacks Wen Ge

[North River News] The Guangdong-North Conghua-South Shengang Datong aggressor army has been busy mobilizing within the week, and has joined the aggressors in Zengcong to attack the Republic-sent Tan and other places. According to reports, our Peng Division attacked the aggressors in Wen Ge on the morning of the 21st. There were about a thousand aggressors there, stubbornly resisting by relying on fortifications. After confronting each other for several hours, we rushed into the aggressor position, killed dozens of people, and withdrew to the original position. By noon on the 22nd, our army again launched a surprise attack on the aggressors. The aggressors, relying on their powerful artillery fire, indiscriminately fired at our positions. Our army is still firmly grasping favorable terrain and calmly advancing. The aggressors, having suffered heavy losses, transferred more than 300 people from the 22nd to Taipingchang for replacement.

Fierce Fighting at the Edge of Xin Jietang

Also, the aggressors in Xin Jie, on the morning of the 22nd, sent more than 100 infantry artillery soldiers to the Tangbian Zhucun area west of Xin Jie, and encountered our Zhao Division's assault team, and then launched a fierce battle. The position was repeatedly retreated and advanced. Our fresh troops were continuously reinforced from the Maxi area, and a unit was sent from the Bicun area to attack the aggressors in Xin Jie. The aggressors were contained and retreated from the original road, abandoning a lot of ordnance. Our army took advantage of the momentum to advance, fighting fiercely for three or four hours, annihilating many aggressors. The remaining aggressors in Xin Jie can be wiped out with one drumbeat.

### Wounded Soldiers in Guizhou Request - To Return to the Battlefield - Commendable Loyalty and Patriotism

[Guilin Airmail] Deng Lin, Xie Mingshan, Yang Qingfeng, Wu Yinting, Tang Bofan, Liao Shibaobao, Tao Yucheng and 29 other wounded soldiers of the Eighth Army Hospital in Guizhou Province, recently, with the aggressors increasingly eager to invade us, in order to fulfill their military duty and defend the country and nation, either their injuries have just healed, or they have not yet recovered, have all voluntarily requested to be reorganized into a team to go to the front line to kill the aggressors. Their loyalty, courage and patriotic enthusiasm are commendable.

### The aggressors attempt to confuse the audience, impersonating our logo, and the war zone issues a strict order to prevent it

[Shaoguan Express] The Fourth War Zone Command yesterday ordered the various army groups, guerrillas in various districts, and administrative commissioners of various districts, saying that according to reports, the southward invading aggressor army has failed miserably, and has exhausted all kinds of conspiracies, not only has it made no progress, but it has been checked by us everywhere, and the date of its collapse is becoming increasingly obvious. Recently, they have even impersonated our army flags and logos in an attempt to disturb the audience, confuse our people's hearts, and there are a total of three types, one is the Chinese Revolutionary Army, one is the Guangdong Revolutionary Army, and one is the National Revolutionary Army. It should immediately order its subordinate units and people to strictly prevent and avoid falling into the aggressor's poisonous scheme.

### Preventing Aggressors from Releasing Poison, Gu Dinghua Issues a General Order to Various Counties

[Changsha Express] The Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of the First District yesterday telegraphed the various county magistrates, saying that it has now been forwarded to Bai Zhuren Dian Kai, according to which, the aggressors are using the early summer climate to send traitors disguised as refugees, carrying thermos bottles containing infectious disease bacteria such as cholera, plague, diphtheria, dysentery, and typhoid fever, and sneaking into Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan and other places, designing to distribute them in our military positions and water quality, and also investigating our army and air force reserve conditions. Those sent to Chongqing, Xi'an, Guilin, Jinhua, Shaoguan and other places have already departed from Nandao, Xiamen, Shantou, Langzhou, Hankou and other places on April 16. The second batch is now practicing in the Immigration Hospital and will soon be sent from Nantong to Jiangbei, etc. Due to this, it is necessary to be strictly vigilant, Commissioner Gu (14th) bowed.

### Various Places in the East River - Tragically Bombed - The aggressor aircraft rampages for days

[Boluo Express] For days, the aggressor aircraft have continuously bombarded Huiyang, Boluo, Haifeng, and Zijin counties, paying special attention to the waters off Jiumenma of Haifeng. Zijin and other county towns were bombed on the 21st. The aggressor aircraft dropped a total of sixteen bombs, killing more than thirty men and women, and the disaster situation was quite serious. At 7:30 on the morning of the 23rd, an aggressor aircraft flew from Zengcheng towards Boluo, Huiyang, Pingshan (affiliated to Huizhou), and Haifeng, distributing leaflets, which were nothing more than words urging our soldiers and civilians. At noon on the same day, 27 aggressor aircraft, in three batches, spied on Heyuan, Zijin, Haifeng, Lufeng, Huiyang, and Boluo counties, dropping more than ten bombs over Haifeng, destroying dozens of civilian houses and causing many casualties. Detailed disaster information is under investigation.

### The Department of Education Sends Personnel - To Supervise the Graduation Exams of Hong Kong and Macau Secondary Schools - And Sends Inspectors to Various Counties to Supervise the Exams

[Shaoguan Express] The Department of Education has decided to stop holding the graduation examinations for secondary school students in the province this year, and has decided to send inspectors to various schools to supervise the exams in order to eliminate abuses. According to sources, Minister Xu believes that since the retreat from Guangzhou, many secondary schools have moved to Hong Kong and Macau to hold classes. The graduation exams of the students this year should be strict so that the graduation results of the students can meet the original standards. Yesterday, he specially ordered Zhang Zimo, the inspector stationed in Hong Kong by the department, to strictly supervise the graduation examinations of the schools in Hong Kong and Macau, to strictly review the exam questions for each subject, and to order the schools to hold them on schedule. Also, in order to strictly carry out the graduation examinations of secondary schools in various counties, the Department of Education, in addition to deciding to send inspectors to supervise the exams in various counties at the time, also ordered the educational institutions of various counties yesterday to send inspectors to supervise the exams together at the time.

### Our Army in Hainan Island - Implements a Blockade of the Occupied Areas - Those Who Transport Enemy Goods Will Be Severely Punished

[South Road Express] It is found that using war to support war is the aggressor army's means of economic aggression. The aggressor army invading Hainan, because military progress is impossible, has recently transported a large number of inferior goods to Hainan for dumping. At the same time, they also instigated traitors and ignorant people to go to our rear areas to buy large quantities of grain, minerals, and various agricultural products to supply their lack of resources. The plan is extremely poisonous. Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, and Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, reported that in order to smash this conspiracy of the aggressor army, they specially ordered the blockade of Chengmai, Qiongshan, Lingao, Wenchang, Anding, Yaji and other nine counties and cities yesterday. All items that can support the aggressors are prohibited from being transported into the counties. Those who transport and sell aggressor goods will be punished for undermining the War of Resistance. We must completely smash the aggressor army's conspiracy.

### Sino-Western Tennis Charity Match - Will Soon Become a Reality - Xiao Linzhen and Wang Wenzheng Collaborate in Doubles

The Sino-Western North-South Tennis Charity Match being organized by the South China Association has moved from the brewing stage to the solidification stage. Yesterday, Huang Zhibin, the director of the tennis department of the association, told reporters that the original order was for a total of three matches, (1) Wang Wenzheng vs. Xu Weipei, (2) Diao Zuqian vs. Luo Wenhui, (3) Wang Wenzheng Defu vs. Xu Brothers, but now Luo Wenhui is too busy with official duties to participate. Therefore, the association decided to urge Ling Daoyang or Ao Linzhen to make a cameo appearance. Defu, the former Shanghai champion, has the same difficulty as Luo, and cannot help. Fortunately, Xiao Linzhen took the initiative and decided to collaborate with Wang Wenzheng in doubles. In the Kimura tennis world, Xiao Linzhen's technique is second only to Xu Weipei, and he and his brother have won the Hong Kong Doubles Championship for eleven consecutive years. Past achievements can be said to be unprecedented. This time, although the collaboration with Wang Wenzheng is the first time, it can be determined that there will be a solid and wonderful performance. A few days ago, the original suggestion for the competition venue was the club's tennis court in Kowloon Royal Park, but the transportation there is inconvenient, which has a great impact on the income from the charity. Therefore, it was decided to change the venue to the Chinese Recreation Club. The time is still July 1st (Sunday) at 3:00 PM. Tickets are divided into two yuan, one yuan and five cents. Then Huang said to the reporter that Wang Wenzheng's name may seem very unfamiliar to people in Hong Kong, but four years ago, Wang defeated the famous Carson in Shanghai and won the Shanghai Hard Court Championship. Three years ago, he defeated Gavia in Manila, and cooperated with Qiu Feihai in doubles, defeating Sanmona and Aragon, sweeping the Philippines. Over the years, he has gone deep into Chongqing and has no opportunity to practice, but his "cowhide essence" technique still has great power.

### Jianquan Cup Table Tennis Charity Match - Women's Group Finals Tonight

The Jianquan Cup Men's and Women's Team Table Tennis Tournament sponsored by the Jianquan Tai Chi Quan Association, the men's championship, has been won by the Confucius Society. The women's championship will be held tonight at the Confucius Society's gymnasium, at 8:00, South China Athletic Association Women's A vs. Xinxiu. Both sides are the top players of the moment. South Women's A has even strength. Since its debut, it has never lost. The team has warriors Yang Weibin, Shi Baolian, Su Yanxiang, Mo Huanqiong, which are especially called the top choice. Xinxiu team has seemed unfamiliar in recent days because of the examination. The main players are the Chen sisters, Lu Zhaoyi, Wen Peizhen, and Zhu Jiaoxin. The technology is relatively pertinent. It is expected that Nan Women's A can win. According to the previous Nan A victory over Xinxiu, the score is one point higher, but if they take advantage of the victory tonight and defeat the opponent again, the championship throne will not be shaken. Otherwise, the two teams will have a final. The list of players for the two teams is listed below

(South Women's A) Yang Weibin, Shi Baolian, Su Yanxiang, Mo Huanqiong, Lu Qunying, Luo Xiubing, Lu Ruiping,

### Discussing the Ancient Greeks and All Aspects of the Olympic Games—A Precious History of Education—

— Ding Lao

When the conference in January 1894 had not yet opened and was in the preparatory stages, Dr. Albestsbow and Professor Williams Miliicans Oane, in their writings, generally said that the revival of modern life and the Olympic Games was a very interesting event. However, at that time, the attitudes of various countries were quite pessimistic. The German sports league did not pay attention to this matter. The French sports organizations did not approve of this kind of organization. The British were also very indifferent. The Belgians simply expressed their opposition clearly. The general public believed that gymnastics and athletics were mutually exclusive events, and most were unwilling to see the success of the meeting. Only Italy, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland sent formal representatives to participate. The assembly was full of solemn celebratory spirit, the attitude was also amiable, and the atmosphere was very serious. Couberrin's intense opening speech, O Sicard's pastoral poetry, and the hymn to Pallo recently discovered in Delphi, as well as the closing banquet, were all unforgettable. Therefore, in just one week, the result of the discussion was the unanimous passage of the revival of the Olympic Games, deemed necessary for the revival of the body in the 20th century.

When the Greeks first heard about the opening of the games, they were very opposed. Fortunately, the Crown Prince was an enthusiastic advocate for the revival of the games. The general royal family also supported the meeting and declared that this undertaking would be supported in terms of both material and spiritual resources. In 1895, funds were raised for the games. Within two months, over 130,000 Brochmae were donated. According to M. Biblas' opinion, Greece should send a committee member who is a person of high moral character and renowned for their literary achievements, to sincerely welcome the President of the International Committee. G, a merchant from Alexandria, Avesaff, donated one million Drachmae silver coins to revive the ancient stadium. The entire building was made of marble with seating for 80,000 people. Furthermore, for the purpose of promoting physical education, the Zappas brothers donated a vast legacy. M. Artonopaule and Alcxandec Mescatil also did their best to help with Greek policy. At that time, it was rumored that many American expeditions would attend, so the magnificent and beautiful original arena in Athens was built, and the entrance tickets were sold very cheaply. However, the overall construction aimed for the original flavor and did not consider convenience for practice, focusing on ancient models. Therefore, although a lot of money was spent on the stadium in Athens, there were many unsatisfactory points. However, in the competition, even the ancient and little-known Marathon race was included as a type of competition. Originally, Marathon was the ancient battlefield of the war between Greece and Persia in 490 BC. During the fierce war, when the Greek citizens were preparing for the departure of the second batch of soldiers, a man named Phldippides ran from the battlefield, over 216 miles and 385 yards, from the fields of Marathon to the capital to announce the victory to the surrounding citizens. He shouted, "We have won!" Due to exhaustion, he died. The result of opening the first Olympic Games caused the Greeks to become very excited and they wanted to hold the meeting in Athens again. Later, they learned that each country would take turns being the host nation. In 1896, Athens, Greece; in 1900, Paris, France; in 1904, St. Louis, USA; in 1908, London, England; in 1912, Stockholm, Sweden; in 1916, originally scheduled for Berlin, Germany, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of war; in 1920, Antwerp, Belgium; in 1924, Paris, France again; in 1928, Amsterdam, Holland; the tenth time, in 1932, is scheduled for the United States. Of the above nine Olympic Games, the second in Paris was overshadowed by the World's Fair, and the seventh in Belgium was solely for doing business, neither of which was the international Olympic Games in our ideal. But the spirit initially hoped for in the international Olympic Games was originally the All Sports For All of all mankind. Therefore, the committee members from both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres organized the games from a moral standpoint. It is not only an individual competition but also a national competition, allowing both men and women to display courageous behavior and a gentle attitude before humanity. Observing from the current situation, the International Olympic Games will probably gradually be approved of!
