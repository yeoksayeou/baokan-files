### The Urgent Task of Expanding the Dramatic Movement

— Lu Chun

Amidst the escalating aggression of Japanese fascism, everything in China is developing and growing within the anti-aggression movement. The newly emerging dramatic movement is also developing and growing within this anti-aggression national liberation movement. Beginning in 1930, with the deepening of the national crisis brought about by the "September 18th Incident," the "January 28th Incident," and so on, the dramatic movement increasingly took on a combative stance, assisting in the development of the national liberation movement. After the full-scale War of Resistance began on "August 13th," driven by the fervor of national salvation, dramatic activists armed themselves with theater, forming a vast iron army of dramatic combat teams. Under the rapid transformation of content and form, they closely coordinated with the needs of the War of Resistance, bravely shouldering the great tasks of the new era!

Hong Kong, this secluded paradise, requires us to awaken its more than one hundred thousand compatriots, many of whom are living in a drunken stupor, and to raise their patriotic fervor for national salvation. Drama is, of course, a very important central task, the most ingenious and suitable propaganda tool in this unique environment. Over the past year, through the efforts of various parties, Hong Kong's spoken drama movement has gradually become active from a state of silence that was almost suffocating, establishing a considerable foundation. Now, the central issue is how to promote and expand this work, how to expand and consolidate this foundation, so that it can manifest itself in the most suitable and highest degree of effectiveness, break through the shackles of this special environment, which is cloaked in the guise of a capitalist society but harbors deep-seated feudal remnants, and establish a genuine drama for national salvation!

Of course, in this unique environment, launching any progressive cultural movement is a difficult and arduous task, especially for the newly emerging spoken drama. Because it lacks the lively interest of traditional opera, which has a long history, and the magnificence of grand foreign films, not to mention the magical sensuality and authoritative appeal of Cantonese films. Thus, in this cultural desert, it can only circulate among a small segment of the higher cultural strata, unable to win over a broader audience, especially due to economic and other various reasons, making it impossible to have frequent performance opportunities, and failing to meet objective requirements in terms of both quality and quantity. This is certainly due to the extraordinary difficulties of the objective environment, but the biggest reason lies in the weakness of subjective forces and insufficient effort. This future is fraught with hidden dangers!

Now, we have entered an even more arduous and greater stage of the War of Resistance. The enemy's artillery fire is pressing even closer to our side. We must intensify our efforts to mobilize and educate the countless compatriots here and those who have fled from various places, and step up efforts to contribute their strength to the motherland in distress, to strive for the freedom and liberation of the entire nation. Therefore, for the most subtle and effective propaganda tool with the greatest political influence and appeal—spoken drama—we must intensify our efforts to correct past weaknesses and mistakes, strive to overcome the difficulties and blows of the objective environment, and actively launch our urgent tasks, producing good "countermeasures" in a planned and step-by-step manner. Here, I would like to offer a few relatively important opinions, based on my observations in Hong Kong's drama movement circle over the past year, with the utmost sincerity, for the joint efforts of drama comrades:

First, Establish a Dramatic Theory – We must quickly establish a sound and correct theory of national salvation drama to overcome the difficulties of the objective environment and the weaknesses of the subjective, correct the erroneous and dismissive views of the society in the past, make them understand the artistic status and power of the drama and the contribution to the national salvation movement, and arouse their broad sympathy and help to the dramatic movement. On the one hand, strengthen the education of the drama workers themselves, instruct and discuss the lines of all work and the use of technology, in order to cultivate their own strength. We hope that the leaders of the cultural and drama circles and the drama workers themselves will regularly write and publish theories and criticisms of national salvation drama, and establish and expand this movement!

Second, Strengthen the United Front – Only unity has strength, and only under a large and unified organizational system can the highest efficiency of work be produced. This is the highest principle of all work, and drama is certainly no exception. Hong Kong drama, which is just budding, is most lacking in this important basic work. In the past, because of inconsistent steps, unscientific division of labor, and inability to match the advantages of the people to make up for each other's shortcomings - the inability to break the boundaries between various groups and the disadvantages of each governing their own affairs as much as possible, I do not know how much objective obstacles have increased and how much subjective force has decreased. Although the "Hong Kong Drama Association" had once actively prepared for organization in August and September last year, the result was lost, which is a pity; Although the "Hong Kong Kowloon Youth Drama Association" has recently been established with the efforts of several small theater companies, the waiting is still small, and those with more powerful theater companies have not participated, which is also not perfect. In the future, in order to seek the development of work and enhance our own strength, we must quickly establish a center with close contact, and use the spirit of collective habit and collective criticism to improve our own education, on the one hand, and use collective action to concentrate the effectiveness of the work - whether it is a dramatist and a dramatist, or a drama and a theater troupe, and further to various departments in the cultural field, they should all unite under the banner of the national united front to exert the great power of the collective!

Third, Improve Artistic Standards – Now, although we are not in a time of art for art's sake, art is always art; we use drama to promote doctrine and express ideas, precisely because it has a unique artistic power. Therefore, whether it is anti-feudalism, anti-×, or praising the War of Resistance, we must skillfully and skillfully use artistic forms in order to express the correct content as much as possible, and win the love and belief of a large number of audiences. Therefore, the various departments of drama, such as script, rehearsal, decoration, lighting, sound, and the actor's acting skills, etc., should be given great attention and improvement. Even if due to economic constraints, we must use brainpower and spirit to fill this deficiency, and try to make the content of each work full, so that each role has pure blood and excellent acting skills, and each device is realistic and beautified. Severely abandon the past rough and hasty pit-playing doctrine, and seriously make this budding drama a sound and powerful art, sweep away the past social people's contempt for it, and fully and correctly give play to its positive effectiveness!

Fourth, Practice the Popularization of Drama – The formal staging of Hong Kong spoken drama and the attempt to professionalize drama is a recent progressive stage. However, because of the concentration of power in the performance of multi-act long plays, I am afraid that the performance of mass plays and one-act plays will be ignored, the function of going deep into the masses will be ignored, and the crisis of going into the first doctrine of business will be ignored. Now, because of the difficulty of renting theaters and the current needs of the masses, in order to expand the influence of the national salvation drama movement, we should not only perform large plays, but also small plays, and do not forget to look for schools that can be performed to the public theaters or public places. We must eradicate the error of art-firstism, and work hard to demand new forms and small-scale regular performances that suit the taste of the masses, in order to win a wide range of mass audiences.

In addition, there is a very serious problem, that is, every drama worker, in addition to humbly striving for the study of general stage art and the coping of performance affairs, should also strive to learn the theory and practice of national salvation, and should not simply be art for art's sake, but should temper himself into a fighter for the liberation of the people. Seriously arm your thoughts, strictly organize your life, correctly recognize the positive line of the drama movement and the urgent tasks at hand, and strive for the absolute seriousness of the play with a faithful attitude and a fighting posture, and truly dedicate the drama to the motherland in hard struggle; To overcome all the difficulties of the objective environment by fighting through the unremitting spirit of collective learning and work. Bravely shoulder the arduous mission entrusted by the times - only in this way can this art approach the ideal development and growth!

Comrades! Keep working hard and fighting hard for the future of the national salvation drama movement and for this sacred and great national liberation struggle!

### In the Past Year: The Active Hong Kong Drama Movement

— Fan Chu

A Review of the Past Year

The Hong Kong drama movement has a history of seven years. From its beginning until a year ago, it roughly went through two stages. The second stage began around 1932, spreading from mainland China to Hong Kong. However, its scope of activity was very narrow, limited to cultural circles, and its performance capabilities were also very weak. Apart from appearing in cultural organizations' entertainment events, there were no opportunities at all. This period of theater was "for the sake of drama," and could also be said to be a movement to establish the foundations of dramatic art.

This period of the drama movement lasted a long time, until the July 7th Incident occurred, and then there was a big change. At this time, the drama movement in the mainland had already begun following the national salvation movement. The drama movement in Hong Kong could not stand still either. So, on the one hand, it inherited the existing skills and made more progressive explorations; on the other hand, it added new content, and when these were combined, it became a more complete drama. The most notable expression of this work was the "China Art Association Drama Research Society," which, shortly after the "July 7th" Incident, performed "Protecting Lugouqiao" and "Thunderstorm" at the "Ko Sing Theatre." Although the performance results were not very successful, the high level of audience emotion was unprecedented.

What I have said above is the general situation of the Hong Kong drama movement a year ago. It can be said to be the precursor to the later drama movement, because the later drama movement developed along the previous line. In the year or so since then, the general drama movement workers have not only been people who are "for the sake of drama," but also brave warriors who are fighting for the independence and liberation of the country and the nation. The drama movement is not only developing on its own, but also a national salvation movement.

The Drama Movement is Developing

In the first half of this year, the Hong Kong drama movement has been gradually developing. Here, we must first mention the efforts of the Drama Group of the Chinese Arts Advancement Association. The Association is a general organization for Hong Kong youth cultural workers, and the Drama Group is just one of its departments. The initial talents of the group can be said to include the middle and main figures of the Hong Kong drama scene. After the outbreak of the July 7th War of Resistance, they once publicly performed national defense dramas such as "Wu Gui Bridge," "The Sack Team," and "Black Hell" on a large scale at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon in the name of disaster relief. The South China Drama Research Society was also organized by some of their main members in cooperation with Guangzhou drama comrades. In the second phase, which is the first half of this year, because of the special difficulties of the objective environment, they had to change the positional warfare to guerrilla warfare, and try to find performance opportunities as much as possible, and move the spoken drama to schools, to the Yau Ma Tei, and several times to the docks, and to the neighboring small villages. Later, the Shanghai Customs National Salvation Long March Troupe and the Shanghai August 13th Chorus came to Hong Kong. Because of the needs of the objective environment, they joined forces. On May 8th of this year, they publicly performed the national defense drama "The Storm on the Frontier" at the Yau Lok Theatre to raise funds for the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association to comfort the soldiers in front. The success was quite good; at the same time, because of the effective publicity, the entire drama scene was stirred up a huge wave - soon on May 24th and 19th, they combined to publicly perform "The Storm on the Frontier" and "Blood Spattered on a Sunny Sky" at the Taiping Theatre and the Central Theatre one after another, so the Hong Kong drama scene was stimulated to commotion. - and the formal rise of Hong Kong National Defense Drama can also be said to be the arrow of this.

At this time, the Hong Kong school drama movement also showed an abnormally vigorous attitude. The "July 7th Drama Society" of South China Middle School can be said to be the most diligent member. Later, it staged more than ten plays, such as "Spring Breeze Autumn Moon," "Flying General," "Protecting Lugouqiao," and other one-act plays. During the wanderings, it appeared the most in front of the audience in Hong Kong, and, during the spring vacation, it once promoted in the four rural areas, because it made the Hong Kong school drama movement and the other small theater companies gradually rise up, and later, they felt that it was not enough to perform in the theater alone. In order to truly cooperate with the national salvation movement, at the end of the first half of 1938, they heroically returned to the mainland to participate in a more difficult and more meaningful work.

A Sudden Rise in Professional Theatre Companies

At about the same time, the "Era Theatre Company," which suddenly rose up, was produced. It was organized by a part of the main figures of the past Union Association Drama Group (that is, a group of comrades from the China Drama Research Society) and the previous actors from Hong Kong and Guangzhou. It appeared in the posture of a professional theatre company, ready to make a long fight. After its establishment, it immediately set a plan for regular performances, performing once every week, hoping to make long-term regular performances. After a lot of effort, the performances went on one after another. The plays performed include "The Eve," "The Roar of Chamcheng," "The Luminous Cup," and "The Paint is Not Dry." The box office results were quite good. On the anniversary of "September 18th," "The Roar of the Ancient City" was re-performed, and all the proceeds were donated to relieve refugees. On November 7th and 8th, "Thunderstorm" and "The Paint is Not Dry" were performed at the "Po Hing Theatre" to raise funds for the Women's War Relief Association to relieve refugees. Their efforts aroused great sympathy from the society, especially the news media gave a lot of help. Now, under the guidance of Ouyang Yuqian, they are stepping up the rehearsal of new plays, preparing to go to Macau in the near future for a large-scale performance!

The Arrival and Dissolution of the China Travel Theatre in Hong Kong

The China Travel Theatre also arrived in Hong Kong in July. The "China Travel Theatre" is a famous theatre company in the mainland. The organization of the performances, the richness of the experience, and the purity of the stage technology really gave the public a new feeling. After arriving in Hong Kong, it did give the Hong Kong drama scene a great stimulus. They performed many plays: "Spring Breeze and Rain," "Thunderstorm," "The Luminous Cup," "The True Story of Ah Q," "The Death of Li Xiucheng," "Sunrise," etc. They have made a great contribution to the Hong Kong drama movement.

However, the professional spoken drama groups have a great crisis lurking. Because of the imperfections in the internal organization, the laxness of the economic structure, the inequality in the treatment of the members, and the unclear line of work, the "China Travel Theatre" was manipulated by one or two people, resulting in many malpractices, and unfortunately, it was dissolved on November 24th!

After the dissolution of China Travel Theatre, most of the members still held the determination to work for the sake of drama, and another Chinese Art Theatre Company was established on October 26th. With the help of Ouyang Yuqian, they had performed "Song of Righteousness." Now, they are actively rehearsing "A New Official Takes Office" and "The Inspector," preparing for a large-scale performance.

In addition to the Customs Long March Troupe, the August 13th Chorus, and the China Travel Theatre, there are many other foreign theatre companies: such as the China Puppet Theatre Company, which performed "The Pigeon Girl," "The Luminous Xuan," "Blood Spattered in the Sky" here; The Masses Theatre Company, which performed "The Luminous Cup" and

A scene from the Era Theatre Company's performance of "The Night Before." "Mount Tai and Goose Feather"; The National Theatre Company, which performed "The Storm on the Yangtze River"; and the Xiamen Children's Theatre Company, which went abroad and passed through Hong Kong, performing "Who is Our Father" and "Little Hero." Recently, there is also an Art Flower Theatre Company, which interspersed with thigh-style singing and dancing, and performed "Blood Spattered in the Sky." These theatre companies are all foreign or combined with local theatre people to form an organization, and they perform in Mandarin. Although the results are all ordinary, they do stimulate the theatre movement here.

The Active Lower-Level Theatre Movement

In addition, the performances lurking in the lower-level small theatres and various school organizations have also been very impressive in the past year. Among them, the most hardworking is the Sheng Society Performing Troupe, which has performed "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain" and "The Night Before." The Drama Group of the Student Relief Association has performed plays such as "General Zhang." The rest are the Progressive Theatre Company, the Drama Group of Zhenguang Girls' Middle School, the Drama Group of China Bookstore, the Theatre Company of the Youth Association, the Ant Music Children's Theatre Company, the Ding Chou Theatre Company, the Drama Group of the Yixun Training Class, the Drama Society of the Huiyang Youth Association, the Modern Theatre Company, the Stubborn Struggle Theatre Company, the August 13th Theatre Company, the Bee Theatre Company, the New Star Society, the Self-Improvement Society, etc., all have had a lot of work performance. More than a month ago, several small theatre companies in Kowloon grandly held a "Joint Grand Performance of Major Theatre Companies in Kowloon," performing many one-act plays. Recently,

A scene from the China Travel Theatre's performance of "The Death of Li Xiucheng." They further organized a "Hong Kong Youth Theatre Association," which was officially established on New Year's Eve last month. In the future, this aspect of work will certainly have a better development.

Some Opinions and Prospects

In summary, the Hong Kong theatre scene in the past year has been quite active and lively. In terms of quantity, there have been more than 100 performances, almost two or three performances every star. In terms of quality, almost all of the creative plays in recent years have been performed. There are various types of performances: one is for public propaganda in the four corners of the world, one is the Ai Mei performance of cultural groups: one is the disaster relief drama, and the other is professionalization. Of course, there are also common goals among them, that is, the mission that Ai Wei should bear to the times and to the nation.

In the theatre's own movement, there are also very obvious characteristics. The former interest-based theatre performance has now become a thing of the past. Although Ai Mei still exists, it is not so much Ai Mei in theatre as it is loving the motherland and loving the nation. Professionalized theatre organizations have also been produced. Although they are not yet mature, they have indeed taken the first step towards professionalization. Due to the progress of stage technology and the increase of the audience, it can be determined that the time distance from the real professionalization period is not far, in other words, it has already embarked on the path of gradual maturity.

No one can make an accurate prediction of what the state of the theatre movement in the coming year will be, but with the foundation completed in the past year, the achievements can certainly be estimated. I hope that the theatre workers here can recognize the correct goal, improve the level of art, and work harder and more painstakingly to overcome subjective weaknesses and objective difficulties, and push this year's theatre movement in Hong Kong a step further!

Editor's note: In this issue, there is a very detailed "Statistical Table of Hong Kong Theatre Performances in 1938" by Mr. Zhu Baishui, which gives us a powerful reference. Unfortunately, due to space limitations, it could not be published, and we have to keep it for the next issue. We would like to express our apologies to the author and readers for this!

### Hong Kong Film Industry in the Past Year (Continued)

— Lu Dun

What we must first clarify is whether those so-called national defense films that do not sell are genuine national defense films. On this point, we cannot help but be skeptical about the many so-called national defense films in the past: First, many so-called national defense films in the past were either monotonous and formulaic in terms of themes and stories, or too idealistic; Secondly, the techniques were incomplete. Because the stories were too exaggerated and idealistic, and were too far away from the lives of the audience, they were not understood by the audience and did not generate empathy. Also, because the stories were formulaic, the audience felt that they were dull and boring, and they could not arouse interest. Therefore, these so-called national defense films lost the trust of the audience, so how could they be effective?

Because the general naive national defense films lost the trust of the audience, the low-level folk story films, erotic films... naturally became very popular. This is a very simple principle.

So, the focus of the problem is: national defense films are not unable to sell. The reason why this phenomenon has occurred in the past is simply because the so-called national defense films in the past were naive and incompetent.

The complete realization of the beneficial nature of weapon art cannot be achieved by simple slogans, but must be conveyed with the best technology and the most artistic means.

The question then develops, saying that the reason why current folk stories, pornography, and other toxic films sell is only a temporary phenomenon. It is only because the national defense films in the past were naive and lost the trust of the audience, and at the same time, because there is a lack of real national defense films.

Cantonese film audiences are mostly lower-level masses, and this class of people are most concerned about and enthusiastic about the motherland. The unprecedented enthusiasm of the Hong Kong hawker relief movement in the past can be taken as evidence, and because of this proof, it can be determined that national defense films are not what the audience does not want to see. On the contrary, the general audience is thirsting for real national defense films – the emergence of excellent and well-deserved national defense films!

Another year has passed, and the sacred national self-defense war has entered a new stage. Similarly, we also hope that our film industry will enter a new stage. We must overcome the weaknesses of the past, liquidate the mistakes of the past, and strive to sweep away all the rotten things, re-establish the credibility of national defense films, stand firm in our posts, and shoulder the tasks that we must bear during the War of Resistance!

The dawn of final victory has already appeared in front of us, and a real and perfect national defense film should also appear! (End)

### A Sad History of Chinese Commerce (Continued)

The "Toyo Tobacco Company" was established in Tokyo in the eighth year of the Taisho era, receiving special permission from the Japanese government to engage in the import and export trade of Japanese tobacco leaves, and handling the export business of the Japanese Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. It also directly manages the manufacturing of cigarettes, and its capital has now increased to 10 million yen, in order to strengthen its entry into the Chinese tobacco market.

The company established a branch in Shanghai early on, and its tasks were limited to collecting and purchasing Chinese-produced tobacco leaves, and promoting its cigarettes. At first, it did not directly engage in manufacturing, but now it has leased two Chinese-owned tobacco factories and one Chinese-owned printing factory in the guerrilla zone, and is engaged in establishing three cigarette manufacturing plants. The first and second plants have already started production, and it is reported that the production capacity reaches 3.3 billion to 4 billion cigarettes per year. The third cigarette factory, converted from a printing factory, was largely completed in mid-October and is scheduled to officially start production this month.

Repeatedly Seizing Shanghai's Water and Electricity

The Japanese are even more deliberately trying to seize the water business, which is the mother of industry and commerce and essential for daily life, constantly making propaganda in certain parties and their instigators' Chinese-Japanese newspapers, inducing "cooperation." If they don't get their way, they threaten with "confiscation." If "confiscation" doesn't work, they demand "registration." However, Chinese water and electricity businesses are as firm as a rock and remain unmoved. Recently, it was heard that the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company was pondering a way, and on the 24th, it blew its own trumpet and unilaterally held a shareholders' meeting, while also threatening to completely take over the water and electricity companies on January 1st. In fact, these water and electricity companies have long been garrisoned by certain parties' troops, and have been roughly repaired by the Japanese to barely function. According to the reports of various Japanese newspapers, the so-called Huazhong Water and Electricity Joint Stock Company was first established by the Japanese to make Chinese businesses "cooperate." Nominally, the authorized capital is 25 million Japanese yen, with the Japanese contributing 10 million yen in cash, and various Chinese water and electricity plants contributing 15 million yen in kind (this is also a Japanese term, borrowing the Chinese expression of using productive assets as equity). The Japanese 10 million yen cash contribution is made by the Central China Revitalization Enterprise Company contributing 7.5 million yen, and the Central China Electricity Industry Association contributing 2.5 million yen. The in-kind contribution from the Chinese water and electricity plant side is estimated and determined by the Japanese, as follows (unit: thousands of Japanese yen):

Guanbei Water and Electricity Company 7,300

Huashang Electric Company 3,800

Inland Tap Water Company 2,553

Pudong Electric Company 800

Pudong Tap Water Company 45

Xianghua Electric Company 70

Zhenru Electric Company 18

Among them, the assets of the tap water side are estimated by the Japanese as 6 million yen of equity, and the electricity side as 9 million yen. Regardless of whether this estimate is true or false, the total assets of the two Guanbei Chinese companies alone are worth 50 million national currency, while the Japanese estimate only 11 million. It would be more straightforward to say "what's yours is mine," which would not lose the original intent. The president of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company is Aoki Sekimon, and the president is Kimura Heiemon. The only one who colludes with him is a certain party and the so-called Water and Electricity Business Integration Committee, which is originally its government-sponsored agency.

After the Huajun withdrew from Nanshi and Zhabei, they adhered to the scorched earth policy. After being burned by a certain army for more than ten days, the essence was burned to ashes. The damage to the Zhabei water and electricity plant was relatively minor, but the machinery and components of the Huashang Electric Plant were also lost. The Japanese had already been generating water and electricity in these plants, but now the residents of Nanshi and Zhabei are helpless, poor, and struggling to survive. Water is indispensable, while electricity can be saved, so there are few users. The Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, located at the original site of the Areli Water and Electricity Company on North Sichuan Road in Zhabei, and at the Shanghai Bank branch on Ximen in Nanshi, sends people to persuade households to use electricity and collect deposits. Initially, there was still coal stored in the plants to burn, but recently the coal has been burned out, expenses are increasing daily, and losses are unsustainable. The threat of confiscation has arisen again. However, Chinese businesses see through this situation, understand the big picture, understand the principles, and remain consistent, refusing to be subdued.

### Heavy Casualties in Huibo Danjian Disasters Over 300,000 Refugees Awaiting Relief After Robbery The Villages and Towns Along the Huidan Road Have Been Turned into Scorched Earth Compatriots in Distress are Displaced, Hungry, and Cold

With the outbreak of the Southern War, Huiyang was the first to be ravaged by the * cavalry. Wherever they went, houses were turned into ruins. In the occupied areas, there were refugees everywhere, displaced and suffering unprecedentedly cruel disasters. At the moment, major towns such as Danshui, Huizhou, and Boluo have been successively recovered. After the robbery, the refugees are crying out for relief, reaching more than 200,000 people. The local government is busy handling local post-disaster affairs and relief work, relying on the support of philanthropists and relief organizations. The Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce Refugee Relief Committee quickly planned relief efforts at the beginning of the recovery of Huiyang, decided on a relief plan, and first allocated 35,000 yuan to purchase materials for relief. Relief workers carried them to various towns and villages in the war zone to conduct on-site investigations and provide emergency relief. Fourteen relief stations have been established in Huiyang Dong* Shian counties. Yesterday, reports were received from Huizhou Bo Nan, Danshui Yazi Village, and other stations on the relief work, and the investigation of the disaster situation along the Huidan Highway was very detailed. The Huiyang Relief Committee is now carrying out relief efforts based on the report, and the disaster situation in Huibo is recorded as follows:

A total of 702 houses were burned and bombed in Danshui City and nearby villages. About a hundred people were killed by bombings in the city and outside the market. Several hundred people died from starvation and illness while fleeing. About three thousand people are displaced and homeless. At the beginning of the relief work, due to the lack of all materials after the robbery, iron pots, stoves, and all utensils were inconvenient. Therefore, only rice is provided daily for the refugees to cook. The disaster situation in the villages and towns along the Danhui Highway is very serious. Villages such as the Fushan, Tonghe, Zhenlong, and Yazi Village markets have become a scorched earth. Stores and refugees have been burned. There are so many refugees that they cannot be counted. The New Market Pig Trade Street and other places have been burned, totaling 539 houses. The disaster situation in Yazi Village is particularly serious. Refugees are everywhere, and the number is still being investigated. Emergency relief is being carried out first, and the sick are being rescued. In the affected areas, 1,000 houses were burned in Pingle South. More than 130 houses were burned in Pingle North. More than 270 houses in Ganghe Township. More than 490 houses in Zhenlong Township. About 100 houses in Zhong* Village Market. About 80 houses in Zhenlong Market. About 30 houses in Puzai Market. About 40 houses in Liansheng Market. A total of about 3,000 houses.

80% of Huizhou City Stores Burned

Huizhou City is an important military location, so it suffered the most. Before it fell, it had been bombed by * aircraft, and nearly half of the city's businesses had been bombed. After the occupation, * people set fire to it. The stores on Shuidong Street in the county town have been burned to 80%. Half of the stores on Wanshi Lane and Dashi Street in the prefectural city have been burned. Residences in the attached city, such as Shangxia Tangxia and Shaibu Ground, have all been burned. Dongxin and Tieqiang, which connect the prefectural city and the county town, have been destroyed by bombing when the * army withdrew. In addition, many villages near Huizhou City have been looted. There are currently about 4,000 refugees in the entire city. The Huiyang Chamber of Commerce provides porridge at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, twice a day. Due to the large number of people, the food supply is extremely problematic. Currently, refugees are scattered throughout the city, and the resettlement problem has not yet been resolved.

Boluo is the Most Miserable, Nine Out of Ten Empty

The location of Boluo is as important as Huizhou. The disaster situation is even worse than Huizhou. The stores in the county town have been almost completely burned. Nine out of ten businesses are empty. More than half of the civilian houses have been destroyed by bombing. The population has scattered in all directions. Although it has been recovered, very few people have returned. The resumption of business is even rarer. The county magistrate has returned to the county to preside over post-disaster work. Although the * army has withdrawn, * aircraft still fly over the territory from time to time to spy. In terms of transportation, only the wooden boats between Huizhou and Boluo have resumed traffic. Among the disaster areas in the attached city, Paiwei Ying, Qi* Lake, Lianan, Zhonglu, Tang, Xiangshui, Lianan, Tianpai, Yihe, Xinzhaotang, Biaohua, Guanghe, Guoshi, Futian, Lianhe, Shuibei, and other places are the most tragic. In the above-mentioned areas, there are an estimated 130,000 to 150,000 refugees, urgently awaiting relief.

### Hong Kong Becomes the General Station for National Tea Exports 600,000 Boxes Shipped Last Year Valued at Over 25 Million Yuan

National tea is one of China's special products, and its foreign trade is very large. Shanghai has always been the general export station, with sales to the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, and other countries. Since the war of resistance, tea areas in eastern China have been ravaged by * people, which has greatly affected exports. According to a reporter's investigation, the general export station for national tea has been moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Before the fall of Guangzhou, all tea from central China, such as Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, was transported to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Railway, and then shipped for export. Since the fall of Guangzhou, this railway transport has been interrupted. It is understood that national tea is now mostly transported from various provinces in the mainland to **, from ** to **, via Hanoi to Hong Kong, or from Guangxi to Guangdong to Guangzhou Bay to Hong Kong, whichever is convenient. In addition, there are many exports from Yunnan via * Guang. According to reports, the output of national tea has not decreased in the past year. 599,030 boxes were transported from the mainland to Hong Kong for transshipment and export, valued at over 25 million yuan. At present, a large quantity of national tea from various provinces in central China is still being shipped to Hong Kong. In the past year, Pingshui green tea accounted for the largest proportion of tea exported, about 250,000 boxes, while in previous years it was only 200,000 boxes. There is also a lot of Qining black tea, about 120,000 boxes in about twelve months, while in previous years it was only 70,000 to 80,000 boxes. Last year, national tea was mostly shipped to Russia, the United States, and * other places, all breaking previous records. It is expected that this year's export volume will also increase. Hong Kong has now become the only export station for national tea.

### Today's Weather is Getting Colder The Observatory's Weather Report

In the past November, the coldest weather of the year was at 3:00 AM yesterday (the 6th), when the thermometer suddenly dropped to 49.9 degrees. By noon, it rose back to 54 degrees. The average temperature from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM that day was 50 degrees. This time the weather turned cold suddenly, and the temperature was very different from the past few days. According to the Observatory's report, the weather on the 6th was foggy and rainy. The weather on the 7th will continue to be hazy and foggy, with more rainfall than the previous day. Northeast winds will blow. The weather today will be even colder.

### The Resident's Association Hosted the Press Yesterday Explaining the Association's Purpose

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Resident's Association hosted the Hong Kong press at the St. Francis Hotel at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Liao Bingquan reported on the association's preparation process and the general idea of its work: (1) The residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon total more than one million, and businesses and residents account for 97%. However, the general landlords take advantage of the increase in Hong Kong residents and the superficial prosperity of the market to take the opportunity to raise rents, which makes residents uneasy and affects social order and tranquility. It is necessary to form a group to protect the interests of residents. (2) The government's regulations to protect residents are about to expire. The association will request the government to continue its effectiveness. Also, since businesses are not protected, it will also petition the government to enact regulations to protect them.

### Hong Kong's Foreign Exchange Fund Increased Significantly Last Year Worth 700,000 Pounds

Several years ago, the Hong Kong government implemented currency control, following China's nationalization of silver policy. At the same time, in order to stabilize exchange rates, it sold the collected silver and established a foreign exchange fund, and appointed Qi Libin, general manager of Shanghai Bank, etc., to organize a foreign exchange fund committee to be responsible for it. According to the Gazette published yesterday, the Hong Kong government's foreign exchange fund assets increased to 13,012,871 in the first half of the year. On December 31, 1937, it was 12,313,938 pounds, an increase of approximately 700,000 pounds. As for the debt amount in the first half of the year, it was 191,034,887 yuan, converted at the exchange rate in mid-June last year (each yuan is equal to one shilling, two pence, and thirty-one thirty-seconds), equivalent to 11,914,166 pounds. On November 30, 1937, it was 11,394,969 pounds.

### There are Still 5,000 Refugees in the New Territories The Situation is Very Difficult in the Cold Weather

More than 10,000 refugees scattered throughout the New Territories have been relocated to Shenzhen by the Relief Federation and rescue teams for centralized relief. For ten days, the refugees in Xia Village, Shangbing, Wenjin, Shatoujiao, and other places in the border area have been relocated, totaling more than 3,000 people. Today, the refugees in Ping Shan Station will be relocated, followed by the refugees in Yuen Long Station, etc. It has been decided that all will be relocated within a few days. The barracks in Shenzhen have been completed one after another. In addition to accommodating the refugees in the New Territories as much as possible, there is still room to accommodate others who come voluntarily. However, the refugees who have not yet been relocated are in a miserable situation in this cold weather and urgently need relief. There are still 5,000 refugees who have not yet been relocated to Shenzhen, mostly women and children. A week or two ago, most of them were still sleeping in the wilderness, with nothing to protect them from the wind and rain. Fortunately, during this week, the refugees also knew that in this winter season, the wind and rain are unpredictable, and they have each built small thatched huts to provide temporary shelter. In these one or two days of snow and rain, the refugees can finally have a place to live.

### Tao Xingzhi Talks About Mobilizing 14 Million People I am Absolutely Optimistic About the Future of the War of Resistance

Councilor Tao Xingzhi has inspected various battle lines and met with various commanders in the past few months. Recently, he went to Guangxi for inspection. He was deeply impressed by the anti-Japanese spirit of the people of Guangxi, especially the training of the strong and the enthusiasm for joining the service. Recently, he came to Hong Kong from Guangxi and gave a speech to a reporter from this newspaper. Tao attended a certain emergency meeting that night to report on the observations on various lines. According to the speech, Guangxi's mobilization achievements are very significant. If Guangxi is taken as the standard, China can immediately mobilize 14 million people. With such a large force, coupled with appropriate training, it is more than enough to deal with the * people in wartime. Tao expressed great optimism about the future of the war of resistance.

### Four Fishing Boats Off the Coast of Hong Kong and Off the Coast of Dotou Were Burned and Robbed by * Fishermen Were Beaten and Lost More Than 10,000 Yuan

* Warships have repeatedly burned and robbed fishing boats outside the port, which is extremely rampant and happens almost every day. Yesterday, four more fishing boats were burned and robbed outside the port, losing more than 10,000 yuan in property. Fortunately, the boat owners and others survived and returned to Hong Kong to report to the Fishermen's Progressive Association. The situation is as follows:

Two Boats Robbed and Then Burned

Boat owner Zheng Caishun of boat number 161HM and Zhou Lai, the owner of another boat whose number is unknown, both registered in Hong Kong. Zheng set sail from * Jiwan on December 24 last year to fish. Zhou Lai set sail on the 26th of last month. The two trawlers sailed to the side of Luwan Mountain off the coast of Macau to fish. Just as they were working, they saw a * warship in the distance coming towards them. They tried to escape, but the * warship accelerated. The two fishing boats could not escape and were caught by the * warship. The * warship was angry that they had escaped. When they caught up, they first threatened them and beat them. Then they drove the people into a small boat, looted them, and searched the boats empty. They burned the two trawlers and left. After they saw the * soldiers leave, their expressions calmed down slightly. They paddled back to the boat but could not put out the fire. Fortunately, it was not completely destroyed. They towed the boat back to Hong Kong. Each boat lost about 5,000 yuan.

Two Fresh Trawlers Robbed of Property

Another two fresh trawlers, one owned by Zhou Deshi and the other by Zhou Deren, set sail from Hong Kong on December 21 last year to fish. They sailed to the sea off the west coast of Pinghai in Huiyang, Doutou. Just as they were fishing, a * warship suddenly came towards them at lightning speed. They first threatened them, forbidding them to make a sound, and ordered them to hand over the property on the boat. Even the women's slippers were robbed. After the * soldiers put all the property on the * warship, they shouted and left. Before leaving, they told them not to report to the police station when they returned to Hong Kong. The property robbed was about 700 yuan. They returned to Hong Kong yesterday and reported to the Fishermen's Progressive Association.

### Xu Shiying Promised to Subsidize the Student Relief Association 20,000 National Currency

During this national crisis, compatriots from various places have come to Hong Kong one after another. For a time, they are unfamiliar with the place and urgently need relief. The student department of the Hong Kong YMCA has united various teachers, schools, and groups to organize a student relief association.

Yesterday, it was learned that Xu Shiying has come to assist the association, stating that regarding the matter of the subsidy, the association will obey the order and specially allocate a subsidy of 20,000 national currency for relief. The attached letter has been sent to Chongqing by airmail. Once the funds arrive, they will be notified. The association's office is located in the YMCA, and many people have been going to the association to register in recent days.

### Hong Kong's Various Sectors Have Launched a "One Yuan Movement" The Labor Union and Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Will Hold Meetings Today and Tomorrow The Five Trades Guilds are Proceeding

Since its launch, the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been responded to by various overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong. Now, the Five Trades Guilds of Hong Kong's restaurants and tea rooms have decided to send letters to the leaders of the Five Trades within two or three days to discuss the progress. Also, according to Liu Moxi, chairman of the Women's War Disaster Association, the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been held by the association for many days. The Women's Christian Association, the Labor Association, and the New Movement Association are all starting to raise funds separately under the banner of the Women's Federation. It is believed that the results in the future will be better than the flag donation on Double Eleven last year. The Chinese Machinery Association plans to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss the progress after it is planned to be held. The meeting date of the Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce is set for Sunday. The Joint Committee for Disaster Relief of the Christian Church will hold a meeting to discuss and promote the holding of various churches. Also, it is reported that the faculty and students of Guangzhou University and its attached middle school also decided to launch a response to this matter yesterday, and decided to send representatives to contact student groups from various schools in Hong Kong to proceed together, in order to enhance the strength of the war of resistance and achieve final victory.

### Du Yuesheng Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday Wang Xiaolai and Others Traveled Together

Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Xinzhi, celebrities from the industrial and financial circles, went to Yunnan, Sichuan, and other southwestern provinces to discuss the development of industries. The affairs have been completed, and they arrived in Hong Kong by Shuishun wheel at 11:00 am yesterday. Xu Shiying, Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Mao Heyuan, and others, deputy chairmen of the Central Relief Committee, went to welcome them.

### Hong Kong News Briefs

The Kowloon Chinese Amateur School was founded by Tao Xingzhi, Wu Hanzhen, and other educators who are enthusiastic about social and cultural undertakings in Hong Kong. It has been more than a month since the school opened, and it has achieved good results. Recently, in order to improve the cultural level of overseas Chinese and widely disseminate knowledge, it is planned to establish a public library to serve the community. It is reported that the school has decided to hold a drama and singing fundraising event at the Kowloon Peace Theater at 10:00 am on the 15th of this month. The program is very rich. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support it. The Hong Kong Amateur Friendship Association has been working hard on the development of cultural services to the community since it was approved by the Hong Kong government to prepare for it, which has been well received by all sectors of society. The number of members has reached more than one hundred. The association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Confucian Temple on Caroline Hill at 1:00 pm this Sunday (the 8th), and Mr. Tao Xingzhi will be invited to give a speech. The "Night Song" will be performed by the Yelian Theater Troupe established by the association. The amateur singing group will participate in the performance. The association has sent out invitations to various circles in Hong Kong to attend the conference.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... Soul Adrift on the Edge of the Sea Alglerg

The story is set in a mysterious and strange place, like one described in "Arabian Nights," called Algiers. Although it is now a French territory, part of the city is quite modern, while another part, inhabited by indigenous people, still retains the mysterious colors of ancient Orient. In this place, lawlessness reigns, a gathering place for thieves and outlaws. The director has handled such a setting with utmost gloom and brutality, further highlighting a moving story. The insidious and cruel actions of the bandits fill every inch of the film with mystery, horror, and intense stimulation.

The story tells of an international thief, a fugitive mixing in this place. Betrayed by his accomplices and pursued by detectives, he manages to escape, only to succumb to a beautiful French woman—and lose his life.

Charles Boyer gives a very profound portrayal of the bandit's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, who starred in "Ecstasy," also demonstrates excellent acting skills. Xue Lie Jiali, in her first film, "The Adventures of Marco Polo," where she played Kublai Khan's daughter, left us with a very good impression. In this film, she plays an indigenous woman who passionately loves the bandit, and her superb performance is worthy of our special praise.

Queen's Peace... Wings of the Army Men Wfth Wfngs

The entire film narrates the development of the American aviation industry over the past three or four decades. It can also be said to be a systematic narrative of mankind's conquest of space. At the same time, we often acknowledge it as a great and valuable work in the history of cinema.

The story seems to draw from too broad a range, resulting in a somewhat lengthy plot that may leave viewers feeling a slight lack of dramatic tension. However, the various tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming. Scenes such as flight emergencies, aerial dogfights, death-defying test flights, and the heroic feat of the first transatlantic flight, along with escaping from burning planes with parachutes, are all extremely stimulating. There are also people full of enthusiasm, embracing a spirit of fearlessness and lofty ambitions, performing magnificent deeds. Behind them, there are women who encourage, help, and silently endure worry and tears. All of these elements possess the power to manipulate the emotions of the audience.

The use of color in this film is exceptionally appropriate. The beauty of the scenes, from the initial scenes of wild scenery to the various brightly colored airplanes soaring in the blue sky filled with colorful clouds, adds greatly to the aesthetic experience of the audience.

Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland's acting skills are highly refined. The female lead, Louise Campbell, is a rising star who previously played roles in some rather ordinary films, receiving little attention. In this film, we discover that she is an extremely promising talent.

East... Song of the Condemned Sfng Your Sinners

A musical film interspersed with comedy, rich in laughter. The races within are both tense and humorous. Starring Pinky Thuss Berry and Fred MacMurray.

Great China—Blockade Blockade

This film depicts the activities of traitors during wartime, but on the other hand, it exposes the cruelty of war. This is a point that the creators particularly emphasize. The director uses lively camera angles to reflect various insidious tactics such as bombing and blockades. Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also give decent performances.

Central... Woman

Mandarin Film

This is a silent film from three years ago, now adapted. The film's message is very correct; the writer is entirely advocating for the plight of women in the past few years who are not well understood.

Overall, it is not necessarily more advanced than when it was a silent film. The writing is more lively, and the rising star Lu Ming and the other actors all perform well.

Lee Theatre... The Four Heroes

Starring Wang Yin and Zhang Cuihong

New World... A Good Woman Marries Eighteen Times

### The Power of a Bowl of Rice

— Ling Mo

What can be written? Lately, my mind is filled with numbers. One that stands out is about the origin of Robert Ripley's "Believe It or Not!" What amazed him was the sheer number of Chinese people. According to his calculations, if the Chinese people were to walk in rows of four, it would take a year to pass a certain point, and only 29,840,000 people would have passed. Even if the population only increased by one-twentieth each year, they would never finish walking. This amazement was originally just a numbers game, but another newspaper in the United States turned it into a cartoon titled "The New Great Wall," which revealed a great significance.

At the same time, I recalled what Hendrik Willem van Loon told us in his geography book about the insignificance of mankind. He calculated that the total volume of all 1.9 billion people in the world is less than one cubic kilometer. This static calculation is naturally too imaginative. But if we generously allow every seven-foot-tall person space to move around, then each person would need no more than five square meters. The entire world's population could easily fit on the small island of Bali in the South Sea Paradise. If we housed them all in 200-story skyscrapers, then a plot of land seven kilometers long and seven kilometers wide would be enough.

Human housing requirements are not great. For clothing, in the tropics, a piece of cloth or a banana leaf is sufficient. The biggest problem is food. Assuming that each person needs one kilogram of water and one kilogram of food per day, then each person's monthly consumption is equal to their body volume, and half a year's consumption is equal to the space they need. If it were possible to stockpile a lifetime's supply, each person would need 500 cubic meters of space to store it, not to mention how much land would be needed for production.

Neither millionaires nor billionaires have enough money to feed the world's population for three months. Food is calculated at very low prices in some places, but if it is sold on the international market, even the cheapest sweet potatoes would cost two dimes per kilogram. This means that the world's population would spend at least 146 billion yuan on food each year, exceeding the total global trade volume in recent years. China's population accounts for one-quarter of the world's population, meaning that they consume 100 million yuan of food per day. If Chinese land were controlled and not allowed to produce food, but only produce raw materials such as cotton and hemp, then the rest of the world could specialize in handling food business for the Chinese, and the Chinese could exchange for countless wealth if they could go without food.

However, the people's food, although not exchangeable for money, has a latent power that is extremely noteworthy. Three consecutive years of bumper harvests have already set the stage for victory. Most of our compatriots have not even heard of the term "wartime food rationing," and we are fortunate not to need it. Not long ago, General Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, said: "China's current difficulties are not great. If compared with the difficulties faced by Germany and Russia during the First World War, we can simply say, 'We have no difficulties!'" Given such favorable circumstances, and facing a country where even primary school students usually eat "Rising Sun meals" and even go hungry, and where all people are now living under food rationing, how can we not be confident?

However, this blessing of not being subject to food rationing should not be fully enjoyed in such times. We are promoting conservation, but it seems that no one has yet calculated the massive amount that this conservation will amount to. Let's calculate based on the above assumption of each person consuming one kilogram of food per day. If it is rice, that is about four bowls. By eating one bowl less, the entire nation can save one-quarter of 100 million yuan per day. Even at the lowest price for the cheapest food, it cannot be less than five million yuan per day, which is more than 160 million yuan per year. Let us calculate this power in detail.

### Boat

— Yang Yanqi

Because I live on an "island," I think of boats.

Among transportation vehicles, I like boats the most; because boats sail on the sea, and I love the vast and boundless sea; and appreciating the sea view requires being on a boat, so I love boats, for no other reason.

In summer, the summer of my imagination, sitting on the deck looking at the sunset reflected on the sea surface. How flavorful—but now it is winter. Winter, cold winds, heavy winds. Winds that sting the face, maddening winds, on the sea surface, blowing up waves, making the waves jump, jumping in the air, like ping-pong balls falling on marble. This is also a sea scene, a living sea scene, and only by lying on a small boat can one appreciate the fun of it.

Boats, steamers, sailboats, lifeboats are all things on the water, and water, you can't catch it, you can't hold it tight, listening to it, the sun shining on it, the moon reflecting the light of the sun, the stars twinkling, mankind forever crawling on the ground, and boats forever swimming on the water, swimming, swimming until the end of time.

Isn't life just a boat? Crossing from this side to the other, that's a lifetime. If the boat capsizes halfway, then it can only perish forever: if there is flesh and blood, life, then struggle, overcome the wind and waves, tighten the sails, hold the rudder firmly, and bravely squeeze out of the difficulties.

The sea is calm, the water surface is flat, waiting for the light on the other shore.

Heaven? Hell? Without a boat to ferry us, how can our feet stand firm on that day? Swaying east, swaying west, staring blankly at the lights on the other shore, waiting in vain, waiting in vain for a lifetime.

If the oars are raised, the boat will move, will float on the water, and will proceed to the harbor ahead.

Charles Baudelaire of France said: "The harbor is a pleasant place for those weary of life's hardships. The distant sky, the changing clouds, the uncertain sea colors, and the light of the lighthouse, form a beautiful scene, enough to make the eyes delight in it. The slender boat, with its intricate rigging swaying with the waves, is enough to keep the soul in love with the beauty of rhythm. And for those without ambition or curiosity, there is a mysterious and noble pleasure. Sitting quietly in a tower, or leaning on the railing of the shore, quietly watching the activities of those people: some are setting sail, some are sailing back, some still have the will to travel, or to get rich."

This "beautiful scene," this "mysterious and noble pleasure," is on the sea, in the boat, also before our eyes, and even more in our minds.

We also have the "will to power," not to travel, not to get rich, but to prop up the human boat, overcome the waves, defeat all harmful magical waves, and destroy all unjust demons; let a small boat float quietly on the Pacific Ocean, watching the sun sink into the beautiful scenery in the west.

### Wind

— Ping

Wind! You desperately

Roll! Blow! Howl! Set East Asia, ...

The flames of revenge of the oppressed burning fiery red!

Wind! You desperately

Roll! Blow! Howl! Sow those seeds of sky-red

Flames of revenge, into the hearts of the world's righteous friends Wind! You desperately again

Roll! Blow! Howl! By next spring, the seeds will sprout, leaf, and burst out

Beautiful, brilliant, sparks of revenge for the oppressed!

Let the sparks

Burn! Burn! Burn out the executioners of mankind! Burn off the slave shackles of the oppressed;

### On Excretion

— Ding San

Our defecating, urinating, and sweating are originally the excretion of waste materials from the body. If these waste materials accumulate, then they will not only prevent the absorption of nutrients, but will also become toxins, weakening the entire body.

Toxins in the body sometimes lurk internally, causing internal diseases; sometimes they erupt externally, causing external diseases. To treat internal diseases, one must promote bowel movements and sweating; to treat external diseases, one must cut and treat sores and boils; in short, it is first of all about relying on excretion.

The institutions of political society are somewhat similar to the institutions of individual physiology, although they cannot be mechanically regarded as the same. There are nutrients—healthy components, and waste—corrupt components. To strengthen the nation, it is natural to start with the institutions of political society. Ruthlessly eradicate the corrupt components, and introduce healthy components.

Waste in the institutions of political society will similarly prevent the absorption of nutrients; and if allowed to grow and develop, the result will inevitably become toxins. These toxins sometimes lurk in the dark, carrying out their destructive role, causing the nation to develop hidden diseases; sometimes they erupt openly, carrying out their ulcerative role, causing the nation to develop external diseases. To treat this kind of disease, the entire nation must have acute awareness, and wage an unyielding struggle against those toxins that have become waste, eliminate them, cut them away!

However, perhaps some will ask, won't doing so split the unity of the nation? Then, I will also ask in return: Does your defecating, urinating, sweating, or cutting away rotten flesh after developing sores split the unity of your body? Does such a question make sense? It doesn't! Because if waste and toxins are not excreted, they will not only fail to strengthen unity, but will instead destroy unity; excreting waste and toxins is precisely eliminating the components that harm unity, so as to absorb more and enhance the components of unity, and make the nation stronger!

Therefore, we must not overthink the fact that some corrupt components entrenched in the institutions of political society are being successively eliminated as a split in unity, but rather should rejoice in the strengthening of unity.

Our country's resistance against Japan this time, from an internal point of view, is a general excretion, which is also called a general liquidation. In the war of resistance, the waste and toxins that had accumulated in the institutions of political society over the years—separatist warlords, corrupt officials, and traitors—were revealed in their original form and eliminated; at the same time, those progressive elements who resolutely resisted Japan, were courageous and active, and were hardworking and enduring, were absorbed and employed; making our country's united war of resistance stronger and stronger due to the change in quality!

The more tense the war of resistance, the easier it is for those wastes and toxins to be exposed, and the easier it is to excrete them. This is by no means a bad phenomenon, but rather a good phenomenon. This is by no means splitting unity, but strengthening unity. We must not be pessimistic because of this, but should instead be optimistic, and should also step up the excretion work, so that our strength in the war of resistance becomes stronger; only then can we win the final victory in the war of resistance and national construction!

### [Wheat and Soldiers]

— Lin Youru

Written by Hino Ashihei, translated by Zhei Fei

In the current Japanese "war literature," "Wheat and Soldiers" can be considered a relatively noteworthy work. Although neither ideologically nor artistically does this book give us any deep impressions, nevertheless, as the translator says: "To some extent, he can still objectively record the facts... and can provide some insights that are beneficial to our resistance." If we can read it with a correct perspective, we can see some useful things from it.

The author, Hino Ashihei, is considered a typical figure in the "Imperial Army." This "Wheat and Soldiers" is his war diary from the Battle of Xuzhou, his personal battle record. However, the entire situation of the Battle of Xuzhou cannot be seen from within; perhaps the author intentionally avoided this record, in order not to expose their failure in this great battle. However, in the short eighteen-day diary, what deserves our attention first is that the author has repeatedly narrated the bravery of Chinese soldiers in battle and constantly praised them, and unintentionally admitted and revealed the difficulties faced by the Japanese army in its operations in China, such as "War is indeed difficult, not as easy as imagined," "The future of the war is infinitely distant," and along the way there are guerrilla attacks, and the Chinese people's assistance to the Chinese army in combat. The author faithfully recorded all of this in his diary. Among them, the description of the bravery of Chinese soldiers, such as the situation of the fierce battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies on May 11, states: "The tenacity and bravery of the enemy (referring to the Chinese army) is truly astonishing. They are absolutely unwilling to retreat, sometimes even leaning out of the walls to shoot and throw grenades... The Chinese army is truly brave, and even after the Japanese army occupied it, they launched two counterattacks." Another example is the Battle of Zhao Erzhuang: "The Chinese army is truly fierce, and shows no sign of retreating; although smoke was used to cover and launch assaults, it still did not succeed." [May 18] He also wrote that Chinese soldiers would rather commit suicide with grenades than surrender; and those who were captured also calmly met their deaths without fear, which the author himself could not help but "respect." Since the war of resistance began, the bravery of our army has long won the praise of people at home and abroad, but when it is said from the mouths of the Japanese, it is even more moving.

In contrast to the bravery of the Chinese soldiers is the Japanese soldiers' weariness and terror of the war. "The soldiers are all filled with homesickness, longing to return home as soon as possible. However, just a single bullet can instantly ruin everything... I don't want to die, I don't want to die here... Although I believe I am not without courage, I don't want to die here now, and who can be sure that they won't die here?" This is such a painful confession. For example, Saito and his brother (they are the only two brothers) were ordered to come to China to fight. The brother had already been killed in Shanghai, and Saito was very worried about his own fate and the two elders at home. The author sympathizes with him and writes his own opinion: "Even though we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives for the country, lives that can be saved should not be sacrificed innocently... We should still value life" (May 11). Since they want to "value life," they should not have war at all, but who drove them to the line of death to "make unnecessary sacrifices"? Isn't this the crime of the Japanese fascist militarists? Unfortunately, the author's political consciousness limited him, so that he could not have a further understanding of the root of this crime. As a result, apart from sighs and sighs, he could not think of any other way.

However, the author, who is considered a typical figure in the "Imperial Army," has not lost his own conscience after all, and sometimes still has a vague sense of justice. Therefore, he could not help but feel uncomfortable about the aggressive atrocities of the Japanese army. "Whenever I see Chinese soldiers and villagers, I always feel a little different, they are simply too similar to the Japanese. Moreover, I can often find the faces of my friends among them. Sometimes it's so similar that it's annoying. This may be nothing more than my own sentimentality, but after all, we are of the same culture, the same race, and the same Asian nation, and our ideas are not far apart in a broad sense, but now we are actually cruelly killing these neighbors as enemies, and I really feel a little unbearable." (May 14) This is the author's heartfelt repentance, his suspicion and dissatisfaction with the war of aggression against China.

This kind of psychology, which is universally present in Japanese soldiers - weariness, terror, suspicion and dissatisfaction with the war - is extremely important for our resistance. It makes us firmly believe that strengthening propaganda to Japanese soldiers, prompting them to wake up, and striving for them to come to our side and jointly oppose the Japanese fascist militarists is not only necessary but also possible.

Secondly, looking at the vigor of Chinese morale and the withering of Japanese morale, we also firmly believe that the inevitable defeat of the Japanese militarists' reactionary war of aggression and the inevitable victory of the Chinese nation's progressive war of resistance against aggression is by no means an empty fantasy, but a fact in the development of history.

The above are some of the correct understandings we have gained from "Wheat and Soldiers" - "Insights that are beneficial to our resistance."

Asano Akira, a Japanese fascist literary "critic," once pointed out the failure of Japanese "war literature" in recent years, saying: "The works that have always been considered great in the Japanese literary world, after being translated and published in Chinese newspapers and magazines, Chinese readers simply find them to be good materials for 'anti-Japanese' and 'insulting Japan.'" Indeed, we also feel this way after reading this "Wheat and Soldiers," which is still very popular in Japan. It is not only a good material for "anti-Japanese" and "insulting Japan," but also has done some good publicity work for our resistance!

Of course, we cannot give Hino Ashihei's diary too high an evaluation. Whether in terms of the meaning of the content or the writing technique, it is far inferior to Tatsuzo Ishikawa's "Living Soldiers." But compared to some works by Japanese soldiers (such as "Diary of an Enemy Soldier in the Trenches" translated by Tian Han and Xia Yan, and some texts searched from Japanese soldiers), it is indeed an excellent work. The description of the attack on Sunping City and the march in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is vivid and the language is concise and clear, which shows that the author is not without literary talent. In addition, there are many other wonderful parts in the book. We cannot lightly dismiss it as "inevitably too trivial" (the translator's words). (January 5)

### Today's First Division Football League: Kwong Wah Club Faces Long Odds; Likely to Lose After Previous Draw with Scots

[Our Special Report] Bitter winds and cold rain, turning cold overnight; football players are downcast. The reason is that although they are not afraid of the wind, they are afraid of the rain.

Today, there is only one First Division football match: Kwong Wah versus Scots, at the Kowloon Cricket Club ground. Let's hope that the heavens are kind and smile upon us, and not ruin the good football match.

In the first round of matches, the two teams drew 5-5. At that time, Kwong Wah was full of vigor and showed promise, unlike their current state of decline. On the other hand, Scots' performance had not yet returned to normal, just like Kwong Wah's current situation.

Now that they are facing each other again, it is predicted that Kwong Wah faces long odds. In addition, the rain makes the field slippery, which is even more unfavorable to Kwong Wah. It is feared that their quick passing in the front line will be difficult to execute, and short passing will be even more impossible. Because on the Kowloon Cricket Club ground, using short passes is tantamount to suicide.

Although Scots' strength is not particularly abundant, their fighting spirit is excellent. Their ability to defeat South China the other day was entirely due to this. They are particularly good at that kind of fierce passing and sudden attacks. Even Bao Jiaping, the experienced South China goalkeeper, is somewhat afraid of them.

Given Kwong Wah's increasingly poor record and Scots' gradual improvement, the outcome will inevitably follow the natural law of the survival of the fittest. However, we have no extravagant hopes for Kwong Wah; we only ask that they lose less often than they win, and that will be considered a satisfactory outcome. The lineups of the two teams are as follows: (Football God of Misfortune)

### Marching in the Rain: Eastern Football Club Floods Hong Kong Football Club, Winning 3-2

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Hong Kong Football Club and Eastern Football Club had a water battle at the Hong Kong Football Club ground. All the players were covered in mud, like plantain leaves beaten by the rain, sometimes falling to the ground head over heels, sometimes sliding more than ten feet, as if ice skating. Although marching was difficult, it brought constant laughter to the audience. Under these circumstances, the progress of the battle could not be controlled by skill. Therefore, although Hong Kong Football Club's lineup was not complete, their desperate fight often made it difficult for Eastern to cope. In the 25th minute of the second half, they finally won 3-2.

Yesterday, except for Song Lingsheng who could not play, Deqi and Chengtuo both played with injuries, contributing to the victory. Wu Qixiang and Yu Qiaxing played two consecutive matches (Eastern's Second Division also played Hong Kong Football Club, and at that time Eastern was short of players, so Wu Yu joined the battle), which was quite tiring. The "short-legged tiger" Liu Shizuan ran all over the field, frowning and glaring in the entanglement, but always smiling, getting more and more energetic. He and Xu Luo formed a line of defense, like a copper wall and iron barrier, especially showing their edge in the second half, truly a good general with both courage and strategy.

After the start of the match, Hong Kong Football Club was short of players, starting with ten men. In the third minute, center forward Wilson dribbled the ball bravely forward. Zhong Yun was about to intercept, but because the battlefield was wet and slippery, he fell and flipped over. Wilson took the opportunity to shoot, and the ball went straight into the net, taking a 1-0 lead. After the restart, Eastern immediately counterattacked. Chengtuo started an uprising on the wing, passing out a brilliant ball. Deqi did not fail in his mission, scoring with one kick, tying the score 1-1. In the seventh minute, Hong Kong Football Club's left center back joined the battle line. In the 25th minute, Guoqi passed the ball to Chengtuo. Chengtuo dribbled past the defender, creating a one-on-one advantage, and tried to score, but was blocked by goalkeeper Gao Na, losing a good opportunity. After a while, Chengtuo made three consecutive close shots, but unfortunately the force was not strong enough, so Gao Na caught them one by one. Soon, the halftime whistle sounded.

Changing sides to fight again, Hong Kong Football Club worked hard to strengthen their attack. In the fourth minute, Di Pailu squatted down in front of the goal and passed a perfect ball. When the ball flashed past the goal, Wilson nodded his head, and the ball went into the net, taking the lead again with a score of 2-1. In the seventh minute, Eastern's forwards charged into Hong Kong Football Club's hinterland like an overwhelming mountain. Goalkeeper Gao Na came out of the city to defend. Deqi passed the ball to Yu Qiaxing to avoid his attack. Yu Qiaxing gently swept the ball into the goal, tying the score again 2-2. In the 25th minute, Hou Chengtuo launched a solo sneak attack. Hong Kong Football Club's defenders chased in vain. Finally, Chengtuo kicked one in from close range in front of the goal, making the score 3-2. The score remained the same until the end of the match, and Eastern won. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Eastern Football Club)

Xu Heng

Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun

Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizuan

Hou Chengtuo, Yu Qia Yu, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu

(Hong Kong Football Club)

Gao Na

Mei Lingdun, Ge Yun

Yi Shidulanqi, Tu Da Liezhi, Ban Di

### Kowloon Cricket Club Defeats Middlesex Again, Maintaining Unbeaten Home Record

[Our Special Report] Yesterday, the cold wind was piercing and the drizzle was continuous. The field was wet and slippery, making it difficult to gallop. The football league was inevitably affected by the weather, making it difficult to stage a good match. At the Kowloon Cricket Club ground, Middlesex and Kowloon Cricket Club met again. After a water battle, the players turned into mud ducks, making it difficult to distinguish between people and ghosts. As a result, the British army lost again with a score of 2-1.

Yesterday's battle was difficult to control due to the wet field and slippery ball, so there was no brilliant performance. The British army's defeat was due to the lack of good players and the messy formation. Crow, who was originally the soul of the front line, could not play due to an unhealed foot injury. Watson, who was originally a good defender, was forced to serve as a forward due to the lack of people in the front line. With talents not being used properly, it was difficult for the generals to give full play to their strengths.

Kowloon Cricket Club is accustomed to fighting on this field (having never lost in home matches), and has the advantage of terrain. The generals are also willing to work hard, passing and charging as soon as the ball arrives, and advancing without delay. Zuo Zhi, Billy and Belo performed well, and their strict defense repeatedly rejected the enemy's attack. Heli made the greatest contribution by tightly guarding the city. The others were competent.

After Middlesex defeated Kowloon Cricket Club 4-0 in the Second Division match, the First Division match kicked off. The two teams faced each other, and the British army began to attack, surrounding the city on three routes. Kowloon tightly tied its formation, gathering heavy troops at the important passes, and intercepting along the way. Billy commanded the army, fiercely charging and fighting hand-to-hand. The British army was forced to give up the occupied positions and return to defend.

Kowloon Cricket Club took advantage of the victory to pursue. Little Norris spied along the side and fired a shot at the goal. Hanibolo responded in front of the formation, intending to rush the ball into the net. However, the field was slippery and difficult to run on, and he stumbled, missing the opportunity. Little Norris refused to let go, rushed forward and swept the ball towards the goal, but unfortunately he acted too hastily and the ball went over the goal, missing a good opportunity.

The British army survived the disaster. Jackson sent the ball into the center of the field. The field was wet and the ball was heavy, and it fell to the ground 30 yards from the goal, landing right in front of Zhiweidi. Zhiweidi took advantage of the goalkeeper's failure to return to defense and quickly passed it to the front line. Zuo Zhi shot from 20 yards away. Jackson did not expect this move and was caught off guard, losing the goal, and Kowloon Cricket Club opened the scoring 1-0.

After losing the goal, the British army tried hard to chase, and took the offensive. They approached the center several times, but because the connection was sparse, it was difficult to achieve success. After ten minutes of melee, there was no progress in the competition. Yihualishi moved to support, leaving his post without permission. Unexpectedly, Mala Balu broke through the siege and dribbled the ball in a counterattack. Yishiwen was forced to abandon his defense and meet him, falling into a trap. Watson stole into the center and broke the duck egg, tying the score 1-1.

After the restart, Kowloon Cricket Club, unwilling to just draw after winning, attacked again, and the British army's goal was in danger again. Everyone was on edge, and the defenders worked together to resist, repeatedly saving dangerous balls. However, Gao Ba performed abnormally, making frequent mistakes, giving the enemy an opportunity. He Wozhi got the ball, passed Jullidi, and handed it to Liao Yachen, who rushed up alone and shot diagonally from the side. The angle was beautiful, and Jackson could not save it, losing the goal again. The first half ended with a score of 2-1.

After the break, the two sides changed sides and fought. The British army's offensive became stronger, launching a large-scale counterattack. Kowloon Cricket Club's position was surrounded and impenetrable. The five guards resisted desperately, and Heli turned the tide, performing well with Billy and Belo, winning applause and praise.

The two sides exchanged shots and fought fiercely. The British team lacked a person with the skill of piercing the willow leaves on the front line. Although they were able to gain the offensive, they could not score again. At the end of the match, Kowloon Cricket Club won again with a score of 2-1. The lineup is as follows: [Solid Foundation]

Kowloon Cricket Club

Heli

Yishiwen, Yihualitu

Belo, Billy, Maxwell

Liao Yachen, Zhiweidi, Hanibolo, Zuo Zhi, Little Norris

Middlesex

### Huaqiao Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Mei Fang's Chance of Winning the Championship is High; Pui To Also Defeats South China 28-13

[Our Special Report] The drizzle continued, and the biting cold wind made people's souls almost break. However, the basketball hall attracted a lot of male and female fans, crowding it. This is because the girls are showing their heroism and forming an inextricable bond with the ball. The writer has had a great time and will record the battle situation.

In the first match, Pui To faced South China. Most people already knew the outcome, because Pui To is an undefeated team in this tournament, while South China can't even beat Southwest, which has mediocre strength. How can they defeat her? Therefore, from the beginning of the first quarter, South China was at a disadvantage. However, at this time, South China's generals were still full of energy. Until the end of the first quarter, the loss was still minimal, only a difference of 2 to 4.

At the beginning of the second quarter, South China's weaknesses were gradually revealed after the fierce battle. Pui To took advantage of this excellent opportunity and pressed hard, making South China's girls sweat profusely. At the end of this quarter, the score was 15 to 6.

The fierce battle started again, and South China showed some improvement. Yu Fen and Mei Wei worked very hard. In this quarter, Pui To only added two points by Yiyin and then gained nothing. So until the third quarter break, Pui To only led by a few points with a score of 17 to 10.

At the beginning of the continuation of the battle, South China still had some chances, but they all failed in the throwing action. Looking at Pui To, Yiyin was as nimble as a swimming dragon and Yinghua was as fierce as a tiger. However, South China did not shake its morale due to the increasingly lagging behind and fought hard against each other. The battle was tense, and Mei Wei made many endearing moves, causing the male and female fans to laugh. Soon, this scene ended in laughter, with a score of 28 to 13, and Pui To won.

The final match was Mei Fang against Huaqiao. Before the battle began, most people thought that a fierce battle would be necessary to resolve the final victory. However, after the contact, Huaqiao was lagging behind and in a disadvantageous position. In fact, looking at last night's battle situation, Huaqiao's Shouguang performed the best, and Rongtang and Huizhen were barely satisfactory. The rest were not worth mentioning. How could they beat this most powerful Mei Fang? And with this victory, Mei Fang's chance of winning the championship is even higher.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Mei Fang first used Yuemei to temporarily replace Meilian. The strength was relatively weaker. At that time, Huaqiao's morale was high, so they fought fiercely and inextricably. After tying the score 3-3, Meibao replaced Yuemei from the applause as dense as military artillery. As expected, after this replacement, Mei Fang's morale was boosted. Until Meilian scored twice, Mei Fang took the lead with a score of 12-5. That was the end of the quarter.

In the second battle, Mei Fang was still brave. This little girl Meilian was like a freed rabbit when she moved. Huaqiao could not stop her even with the strength of Huizhen and others. It was indeed worthy of the name. At the end of the first half, the score was 22 to 0. Huaqiao was even more behind.

After eating oranges, they returned to the battlefield. In this quarter, except for Shouguang's consecutive successes and Rongtang's addition of one point, it was Mei Fang's world. Mei Fang alone scored six points by Meilian alone. Therefore, at the end of this quarter, the score was 30-16. Huaqiao's heroines were short of breath.

In the last quarter, Huaqiao still thought about recovering the lost ground. However, with only the strength of Rongtang and Shouguang, how could they succeed? Therefore, after the continuation of the battle, Huaqiao was still in a disadvantageous position. Until the end of the match, Mei Fang returned with a victory song with a score of 42-26.

### Roosevelt Formally Announces: Atlantic Fleet Permanently Stationed; Drafts Special Defense Plan; To Submit to Parliament Early Next Week

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] After issuing a warning to dictators, US President Roosevelt announced the permanent stationing of 35 warships in the Atlantic Ocean to strengthen national defense. It is an unprecedented move for the US fleet to be divided into two teams, stationed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Eastern and Western Fleets are assigned to guard certain locations to prevent foreign forces from approaching. The new fleet stationed in the Atlantic includes eight first-class battleships, eight new-style destroyers, four battleships, fifteen old destroyers, and many submarines and aircraft of undisclosed numbers. According to senior officials, this fleet is only the initial deployment to defend the Atlantic maritime power. According to President Roosevelt's plan, he is determined to build the United States into a country with sufficient first-class maritime power. The naval defense strength plan submitted to Congress for review has a budget of 200 million yuan, which can build more than 100 warships of all sizes. There are currently two battleships, two destroyers, eight destroyers, eight submarines, two aircraft carriers, and one repair ship under construction. The battleships currently planned to be built will be 45,000 tons.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Roosevelt's request to approve a public utility budget of 815 million is being carefully considered by a congressional review committee. According to observers, President Roosevelt's request and the 900 million budget for 1940 will cause heated discussions in Congress. However, it is expected that the number will not change much as a result of the discussion.

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] President Roosevelt told reporters today that he is currently drafting a special national defense plan and preparing to submit it to Congress early next week.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] British newspapers expressed no surprise at the large figures published by President Roosevelt for the US budget, saying, "Economists 30 years ago, seeing this huge budget, declared that the country must go bankrupt. However, the resources of modern powerful countries are extremely scalable and can cope with financial problems. Therefore, although the United States has a huge budget, there is no risk of bankruptcy. Moreover, the United States' national debt is only slightly larger than that of the United Kingdom, and the difference in its income is also negligible. The United Kingdom's national debt is almost twice as large as its income, so its financial situation is not as good as that of the United States."

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 7th] President Roosevelt denied to the press that he or other government officials had received Colonel Lindbergh's secret report on the German Air Force.

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Officials announced today that the US Department of Justice is investigating the Nazi Party, the Communist Party, and other parties for violating the country's criminal law. This move was triggered by someone submitting evidence of "anti-American activities" to the House of Representatives committee.

[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 7th] Canada's new national defense budget totals 50 million yuan, the largest number since the European War. Most of this budget will be used to train air force personnel. Aviation schools will be established in Toronto. All air force personnel training will be conducted under the guidance of the Canadian Department of National Defense.

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] The local newspapers generally expressed their support for President Roosevelt's foreign policy and national defense plan. However, the newspapers criticized President Roosevelt's domestic unemployment relief and recovery plans. The Morning Post said that President Roosevelt claimed that the size of the preparations for work in the United States in the past six years was unprecedented in American history. In fact, during the implementation of the New Deal, only the money of taxpayers was indeed a huge number. The New York Times said that President Roosevelt still needs to make greater efforts to dispel the concerns of businessmen. The Los Angeles Times said that President Roosevelt's speech had an air of dictatorship.

### French Prime Minister Arrives in Toulon Yesterday; Holds High-Level Military Meeting After Returning to Paris; Delivers Speech Resolving to Maintain Territorial Integrity; Refuses to Discuss Certain Legal Negotiations

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French Prime Minister Daladier arrived in Toulon today. After returning to Paris, he will convene a high-level French military conference. The decision to convene this meeting was made after yesterday's important military conference in Algiers. The conference was presided over by Daladier, and senior French military officials and North African authorities participated. In view of Chamberlain's visit to Rome, the French high-level military conference to be convened is particularly important.

[Reuters, Algiers, 6th] Daladier said in a speech at a banquet hosted by the Governor of Algiers today, "France wants to maintain peace with all countries in the world and is willing to solve all major modern problems without the method of war, but with constructive efforts. If anyone thinks that this attitude is a symbol of France's weakness and retreat, then I will shout 'Stop!' I do not condemn all violent remarks. On the contrary, I want to thank those who publish such remarks, because from outside the French defense line, the French people have recognized the true face of France. I say that I am determined to maintain the integrity of the whole of France. This not only means that I will never cede an inch of French territory to others, but also that I will not discuss certain legal negotiations proposed by certain parties."

[Haitong News Agency, Marseille, Day] Yesterday, another 1,000 men of the Senegalese troops took the French transport ship "Ados II" to be stationed in French Somaliland. The case of British officials being falsely accused is currently under investigation.

### Government Troops Retreat; Case of British Officials Being Falsely Accused; Currently Under Investigation

[Central News Agency, Lagos, 7th] The Spanish Nationalist Army has occupied the city of Vivin, five miles from Lana, and stormed into the town of Vinoser, five miles west of Vivin, yesterday afternoon. The Nationalist Army is now actively advancing. Although the government is resisting fiercely, it is ineffective and has begun to retreat. The Nationalist Army's artillery is doing its best to bombard the government's transport team.

[Reuters, London, 6th] In order to avoid misunderstandings within the British Foreign Office, it intends to clearly state that the recent events in Iran did not involve the opening of "British diplomatic postal packages." The British have launched an investigation into the Spanish rebel authorities' false accusations against British officials. The relevant official documents will be delivered by the British Vice-Consulate in San Sebastian to the British Embassy in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

### American Labor Representatives: Defend Democracy; Ban Exports to Japan, Germany, and Italy

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] The American Congress in Support of Peace and Democracy, representing five million Americans, held a three-day conference with the support of most workers. The purpose of this conference is threefold: to defend democracy in North and South America; to advocate lifting the blockade of Spain; and to ban the export of goods to Japan, Italy, and Germany. Latin American and European comrades may join later. The 2,000 representatives of the association can represent all labor groups in France and Spain.

### Tumulty Pardoned; Will Go to Sacramento

[Reuters, San Quentin, 6th] Tumulty, who was sentenced to life imprisonment 20 years ago for being involved in the San Francisco bombing case, was in high spirits today, packing his bags, and preparing to start his new life of freedom.

### British Cabinet Attention to Far East Situation; Considering Active Measures Against Japan; British Merchants Uphold Trade in China

[Reuters, London, 7th] A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" states: "As Japan refuses to maintain the 'Open Door' policy and takes unfair steps against the interests of Britain and other foreign countries, we have reason to believe that British cabinet ministers have been closely monitoring the Far East situation caused by these steps in recent days. They are now carefully considering active measures to deal with Japan. I understand that the Treasury has been asked to report on effective methods to change the minds of the Japanese. We have learned that the United States has also considered similar actions to protect American interests," he said.

Seward continued, saying that the transportation routes in China, which are commercially important, have been completely monopolized by Japan. Once the Sino-Japanese war ends, the issue of British trade with China will become even more serious. This chamber will not neglect its duties regarding British trade rights in China. The chamber will continue to cooperate closely with the United Association for Chinese Affairs, which is organized by the China Association and chambers of commerce from London, Bradford, Manchester, and other places (with its headquarters in London).

### Situation Eases After Clash Between Hungarian and Czechoslovak Armies; Artillery Fire Suspended the Night Before Last; Both Sides Investigating Responsibility

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] According to reports from here, the conflict between Czechoslovakia and Hungary will be resolved directly by representatives from both sides. There were no new battles overnight, and Czechoslovak and Hungarian troops have retreated to their respective borders.

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] According to dispatches from Budapest, serious clashes have occurred between Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is reported that Czechoslovak troops attacked a town recently ceded to Hungary, and both sides exchanged artillery fire, resulting in numerous casualties.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Hungarian envoy here said that Hungary's protest to Czechoslovakia was "very strong," expressing regret that Hungary's efforts to improve Hungarian-Czechoslovak relations had been thwarted by this incident, and stated that Hungary could not be held responsible for subsequent events.

[Reuters, Prague, 6th] The Hungarian chargé d'affaires in Czechoslovakia protested to the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry today, stating that Czechoslovakia should be responsible for yesterday's border conflict. A communiqué was issued here stating that the border war was still ongoing at 5 PM and was caused by an unprovoked attack by Hungary on three Czechoslovak policemen. The policemen immediately returned fire. Hungarian troops then launched an organized attack on Czechoslovak defense positions. The communiqué also stated that the Czechoslovak government would respond to the Hungarian government's protest only after investigating the cause of the incident. The Czechoslovak side has notified the Hungarian chargé d'affaires that Czechoslovakia has sent a senior military officer to Mukachevo, where he has agreed with Hungarian officers to form a joint committee of Czechoslovak and Hungarian officials to investigate the matter.

[Reuters, Prague, 6th] According to reports from the capital of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, there was no gunfire on the Czechoslovak-Hungarian border at 8 PM tonight.

### New Japanese Finance Minister Announces Fiscal Policy; Develops "China-Japan-Manchukuo" Economic Bloc; First Issues 400 Million Yen in War Bonds

Brief Commentary

### Activities of a Traitor

After Wang Jingwei's plan to oppose the central government's policies was exposed, he fled Chongqing in haste and went abroad, already losing the qualities of a statesman. After going abroad, he then issued the so-called "Awakening Telegram," openly violating the central government's established policies, following the declaration of the Japanese prime minister, advocating national surrender to Japan, further exposing that his so-called opposition to the central government's policies was a conspiracy to betray the party and the country. The central government's resolution sternly pointed out that Wang Jingwei was colluding with Japan, betraying the party, and endangering the country. However, Wang was only limited to being expelled from the party and removed from his duties, which can be said to be lenient. All military and civilian officials and people from all walks of life, in addition to sending telegrams denouncing Wang's madness and supporting the central government's resolution, still retain some hope for Wang, because Wang is still regarded as a Chinese and a former Chinese politician. From Wang's perspective, even if he cannot commit ritual suicide to apologize to the people of the country, he should also consider the situation, retreat in the face of difficulty, and await punishment. This is precisely the ideal of those who cherish Wang, and can be said to be the minimum hope of the general public.

However, according to recent news from various sources, it proves that Wang has no intention of repenting and is secretly intensifying his activities. On the one hand, he is using his propaganda tools to fabricate false news and spread shameless rumors, either saying that the National Government is leaning to the left and that the Communist Party is surrounding Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, or saying that the government will issue an order to confiscate private savings, including banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Their absurdity is not worth discussing, but their attempt to alienate cooperation between our parties and the unity of officials and people is malicious and the same as the tactics of Japan. On the other hand, he also plans to organize a new party as a preparation for organizing a puppet government. This behavior, in terms of the degradation of Wang's personal political morality, is not worth mentioning. But for the insult to the Chinese people, even those who cherished Wang and advised Wang in the past will probably no longer tolerate it!

According to a telegram from Chongqing, telegrams from generals, troops, administrative heads, and civil groups from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Nanyang, and other places supporting the central government's punishment of Wang are flying in. Among these telegrams, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, and others advocated that the central government arrest Wang and bring him to justice. Governors of various provinces and civil groups in North China requested to strip Wang of his nationality and confiscate Wang's property and real estate. Various circles in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Nanyang, in addition to the above requests, also expressed that they do not recognize Wang as a Cantonese and requested that his propaganda tools be immediately banned. This news further proves that if Wang does not repent and reform, and continues to resort to his old tricks of confusing right and wrong and disturbing people's minds, then even if the world is vast, Wang will have nowhere to stand. Offending the people cannot be atoned for. Repentance has a limit!

### A New Factor in the Evolution of the European Situation

— (Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in London) Uncle Didi

In the development of the general European situation in recent days, especially in the future steps of Britain and France in foreign affairs, a new factor has been added; this is the sudden activeness of the American attitude towards the world situation recently.

If we analyze the psychological reaction of the British government and the public to this new factor, the components are clearly threefold: First, naturally, a feeling of relief is emitted, and the speech increases strength and courage; second, based on the idea of ​​appeasement, some people in Britain are also slightly worried about it - they are afraid that the open conflict between the United States and the three aggressive countries of Germany, Japan and Italy will involve Britain as well.

Although there is such a contradiction in psychology, at least before the so-called "Four-Power Pact" is formed, the foreign steps of Britain and France are indeed under great pressure from this attitude of the United States. Of course, Chamberlain and Daladier's cabinets, which took advantage of the possibility of American aid and attempted to conclude a "Four-Power Pact" with Germany and Italy in one fell swoop, now feel greatly troubled and have to consider the steps to adapt to this new factor.

According to what is known here, the main reasons for the sudden outbreak of this attitude of the United States are: First, the recent complete cracking of the secret organizations of the three aggressive countries of Germany, Japan and Italy in the Americas, as a result, Germany's major joint conspiracy against Canada, Japan's against countries near the Panama Canal, and Italy's against countries in South America were discovered. Second, the current British and French cabinets stubbornly alienated the Soviet Union, losing the power to deal with Germany and Italy. The diplomatic policies pursued by the Chamberlain and Daladier cabinets aroused deep unease and suspicion in the United States. Another factor that induced the outbreak of this attitude was the mutual recrimination between the United States and Germany caused by Germany's abuse of Jews.

However, so far, the United States has not put forward its specific line to the British and French authorities. According to all open and behind-the-scenes actions, this positive attitude of the United States seems to have only reached the point of urging British and French public opinion to restrain the British and French authorities.

First, the obstacles laid down by the United States on the road to the so-called "Four-Power Pact"

In a previous telegram, the reporter pointed out the temporary shelving of the so-called "Four-Power Pact" in Europe. Now, if we look at it from another perspective, if the four countries of Britain, France, Germany and Italy are sincerely implementing this pact, then, on the road to its achievement. The first step must also overcome the obstacles laid down by the United States. The biggest obstacle is the cession of colonies. Probably in the latter part of last month (November), it was when the issue of ceding colonies was most clamorous. According to the plans of some people in the British government, they intended to cede a part of West Africa to Germany. This unofficial plan was immediately blocked by the United States. As a result, President Roosevelt immediately asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to meet and put forward a relative request: If this plan is realized, then the United States must also demand from Britain and France the same rights as Germany in colonial rights. For some British and French territories within the sphere of influence of the United States, the United States is prepared to propose the establishment of naval bases, or complete cession. The reason is that if Germany establishes a base in West Africa, then the American Atlantic route will definitely be harassed by Germany in wartime. For safety, the United States can only demand equality with Germany. The same notice was also sent to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the same time. As a result, the authorities of Britain and France discussed the results, coupled with other considerations, and decided to temporarily shelve this plan. Following this, the British Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and the French Foreign Minister Bonnet formally issued statements separately but simultaneously denying the existence of such a plan. The second obstacle is the tension in diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany and Italy due to the abuse of Jews. Now, the United States and Germany have each recalled their ambassadors to each other. At this time, if Britain and France were to actively carry out the "Four-Power Pact," then the trend is very possible, the United States would immediately declare a complete severance of diplomatic relations with Germany, giving the "Four-Power Pact" a fatal blow. Of course, the Chamberlain cabinet, which decided to temporarily stop the "Four-Power Pact" from proceeding, could not be happier about the tension in diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, because it could use this opportunity to devote itself to the construction of military mercenaries and temporarily postpone Germany's proposal to limit armaments. Here is the source of Chamberlain's avoidance of meeting with Schacht, the president of the German National Bank, during his visit to Britain not long ago, and even further, in the House of Commons, he actually said that Anglo-German relations cannot be improved further when Germany does not further express its desire for "peace."

Second, the hints given by the United States in the foreign policy of Britain and France towards Japan

In the past few months, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and others often dragged the United States into the explanation of concessions to Germany and Italy, saying that the United States did not cooperate with Britain in the Far East, so Britain was caught between the enemy. However, this week, the United States suddenly publicly expressed its attitude towards the Far East. The clearest, as far as we know, has been three times in the past two months: The first time was when the European crisis was tense. The US Secretary of State Hull officially guaranteed to Britain that when the British Navy was dealing with Italy in Europe, the US Pacific Fleet would definitely cooperate with Britain to deal with Japan. The second time, after Guangzhou, Hankou and Chongqing were captured, a small number of wavering people in Britain were secretly planning to start negotiations with Japan and establish a local compromise in southern China. The United States suddenly proposed to Japan to abide by the "Nine-Power Treaty." At the same time, it requested that Britain take the same steps. The third time; it is the recent decision to grant credit loans to China. As Chinese compatriots living here, when we witnessed that a few people in Britain were still dreaming of "mediation" and "compromise" and were unwilling to help China completely defeat Japan, we suddenly saw the resolute action of the United States, and we could not help but feel an indescribable emotion. Therefore, the American reporter for the Times immediately reported the fundamental significance of this move by the United States to the British people, which was: (1) The United States has absolutely no possibility of recognizing any so-called "fait accompli" declared by Japan; (2) The United States especially does not believe that Japan's aggression has produced any "fait accompli". Immediately afterwards, the US reporter of the Daily Telegraph, which is one of the two major intellectual newspapers of the British Conservative Party, also immediately reported to the British people that the US officials believed that Japan's economic situation was already very dangerous; and time is on the side of China. As long as China always maintains its current strong morale, it will definitely be able to defeat Japan in the end. Therefore, in order to express its consensus with the United States, Britain immediately agreed to a part of the long-awaited credit loan. However, the reporter's personal view is that this move by Britain was actually mostly a passive response to the United States, and did not actively abandon her "compromise" and "mediation" ideas and further thoroughly help China, although British public opinion praised this move for once. However, the trend has become very obvious recently, the United States has regained the traditional leading role in diplomacy in that regard in the Far East diplomatic policy. At this time when Britain and France are voluntarily unable to do anything in Europe, Britain and France will only follow the lead of the United States in the short term in the Far East.

On the Spanish issue. The United States also has deep disgust and unease about Italy's demand for Franco's complete victory. According to the discovered Italian secret plan, it is planned to wait until Franco establishes his regime and then use Spanish blood ties to extend its power to South American countries. The United States has sent a notification that is difficult to ignore to the British and French authorities on this point. Therefore, Chamberlain's upcoming talks with Mussolini in Rome is a major difficulty. It was rumored here some time ago that Britain and France might be able to meet Mussolini's requirements on the condition that Mussolini agreed to leave the German-Italian axis, but in the past two days, it is said that a new plan is being drafted. This new plan is to stop the current civil war in Spain under international auspices, and then, after a year or two of truce, invite representatives from both sides again. The international community will convene a meeting to seek a "reasonable" solution.

In short, the role of the United States' active attitude in British and French foreign policy has already begun.

### Exposing Traitors

The Three People's Principles, the program of resistance and national reconstruction, the Five Guidelines of the Hengshan Conference, and recently Chairman Chiang's refutation of the Konoe Declaration are the right path to saving the nation, and no deviation is permissible. If someone outwardly complies but inwardly opposes, what methods can be used to systematically uncover them? This is an important question worth considering. I now propose five avenues for identifying traitors, as a basis for discussion among the people. I hope everyone will offer their guidance on whether they are appropriate.

(1) He pretends to do what should be done sincerely. Hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat falls into this category. Previously, a certain place hung a sign promoting mass movements, while simultaneously buying off beggars for parades and arresting those genuinely serving the people. At that time, I wrote a four-line poem to record this event, saying: "Fake work, two mao; real work, thrown in jail." Wang Jingwei uses the banner of all-out resistance to write articles opposing guerrilla warfare, which is simply mixing dog meat into lamb.

(2) He spends lavishly on what should be done frugally. China is a poor country, and even poorer since the war began. Everything must be done frugally to succeed. If someone spends lavishly on one thing, leaving no money for other things, it is tantamount to squeezing out other important matters. Only frugality can ensure that all important matters are considered and addressed. If one only cares about squandering money like dirt on one thing, causing other matters to be delayed, it is very suspicious.

(3) He separates what should be done together. For example, the final victory of the war of resistance depends on the unity of the entire nation, which depends on cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It requires everyone to work together to succeed. Japan does not like this, so it proposes the conspiracy of joint anti-communism. Japan's aim of anti-communism is to use us to fight the Soviet Union on its behalf. If we fall into its trick, it is simply national subjugation. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot be separated, and will not be separated. Japan and the traitors are wasting their efforts. We, the common people, are not only the matchmakers for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, but also the priests of the Catholic god of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. We only wish them to live together in harmony until old age, and will not allow them to divorce. However, Japan always wants to use Chinese to control Chinese, and the traitors, relying on its support, always want to sow discord. At one meeting, more than a dozen people said: "If this war continues, victory will not belong to Japan, nor to the Kuomintang, but only to the Communist Party." These people are simply speaking as Japan's representatives. What I want to say is: if we unite to the end, victory will belong to the entire Chinese nation. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will have a share. Now, anyone who wants to separate China's strength and weaken China's unity is someone who should be investigated.

(4) He does slowly what should be done quickly. China has two big hands: one is the Southwest Railway; the other is the Northwest Railway. These two hands must reach out quickly and bring things quickly, so that they can quickly drive out Japanese imperialism. Have these two hands already reached out quickly? Who is holding them back??

(5) He does small what should be done big. Recently, the United States wants to train 100,000 airplane pilots. According to population proportion, China should have 400,000 pilots. Even a 10% cut would be 40,000. Another 10% cut would be 4,000. However, the former Italian consultant advocated that pilot training should be "rather lack than waste," valuing quality over quantity. What a good shield this is! Even Mr. Hu Shi has been advocating this kind of traitorous theory. This time, I met a physical educator in Haiphong. He said that he and 162 physical education students applied to aviation schools, but only two people were admitted. Although the pilots are skilled, few are not enough for combat, so we only see foreign planes coming to China, but not Chinese planes going to Japan. We have been deceived by traitors in many things, resulting in big things being done small.

These five ways to identify traitors should be closely followed and investigated. If he pretends to do what should be done sincerely, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely, but spends lavishly on what should be done frugally, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely and frugally, but separates what should be done together, he is suspicious. If he does it sincerely, frugally, and together, but does slowly and small what should be done quickly and big, he is suspicious. If there is suspicion, follow the trail to investigate and verify, then the traitors can be eliminated. Sometimes traitors and mediocrities are confused. But it is intentional to be a traitor, unintentional to be a mediocre. In this time of life and death, small talents cannot be used for great purposes, and mediocre people cannot be retained for long.

### The New Task of National Assistance in the War of Resistance: A Commando Team for Developing the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement!

— Pan Lang

There are three optimistic phenomena in the current situation: first, the exposure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy of colluding with and betraying the country can reduce major obstacles and traps on the road to national unity and sustained resistance in the future. It has also blocked the cliff and dead end of running to the fascist anti-communist line of Germany and Italy to become an accomplice; second, the fall of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan and the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet more clearly expose the Japanese fascist invaders' determination to destroy the entire China, and their determination to establish a "New Order" in East Asia. This has strengthened China's determination to resist to the end, and also determined that the only way for democratic and peace-loving countries to defend themselves is to unite to aid China and contain Japan; third, the policies of Britain and the United States towards the Far East are gradually becoming more active, and the establishment of huge credit loans from Britain and the United States to China is a pioneering move by peaceful and democratic countries such as Britain and the United States to more actively implement aid to China and contain Japan. Taken together, these three recent facts prove that the future of our united resistance is very optimistic, and the future of world peace has faintly revealed the dawn of light. In particular, the credit loans from Britain and the United States to China, on the one hand, prove that our heroic resistance in the past year and a half has not been in vain. We have glorified the excellent and great traditions of the Chinese nation, and we have enhanced the international status of the Republic of China; on the other hand, it has especially promoted our national self-esteem and self-confidence, overcoming pessimistic emotions, smashing compromise psychology, and moving towards a bright future of heroic struggle.

Because we understand, why do Britain and the United States lend to our country? First, it is due to our year and a half of heroic resistance and our firm determination to resist to the end. Second, it is due to the progress of the united front of all parties and circles in China against Japan. In a year and a half, we have successively overcome the conspiracies of the Japanese invaders and traitors to alienate, divide, compromise, and mediate. We have successively overcome many difficulties in military, political, and even economic matters, so that the great powers of Britain and the United States recognize that the power of the Chinese people united is infinitely great, recognize that the Chinese National Government is fully equipped with the power to unite the whole country and persist in the war of resistance, and recognize that China has a future; third, it is due to our government's national policy of self-reliance and striving for foreign aid. Because of self-reliance, all external debts are planned and methodical, which can further strengthen the trust of the great powers; because of striving for foreign aid, the great powers are unwilling to let go of the priority, glorious opportunity to benefit others and themselves; fourth, it is due to the development of Japan in the Far East, which has gradually proved that its conflict of interests with European and American powers, especially the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, Belgium, and the Netherlands, is irreconcilable, and Britain and the United States have also begun to cooperate based on their own and mutual interests. Britain and the United States have gradually advanced their steps to aid China and contain Japan for the above four reasons—at the same time, it cannot be ignored that, due to American aid to China, it will inevitably affect France more, and especially provide the Soviet Union with more convenient conditions to further aid our country—the recent situation between Japan and the Soviet Union caused by the fishery negotiations, of course, makes people miss the socialist Soviet Union as a "true friend", and in the construction and strategic counter-offensive preparations in our western rear, it goes without saying that the Soviet Union is doing its utmost to provide the most loyal and enthusiastic legal aid!

Under this new situation, especially under the situation where international friendly nations are helping us in the war of resistance and national reconstruction, how should we encourage each other to do our best to help the government in the war of resistance and national reconstruction! The "One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement" that was published by Mr. Xu Jun in the Shanghai Da Mei Wan Bao and is gradually spreading to various places can be regarded as the best answer to the question raised by the people above—on February 17, the Shanghai Chinese Da Mei Wan Bao published that the reader Xu Kehe, in view of the serious national crisis, and the fact that the United States and Britain have provided loans to help China, was overjoyed and initiated the "One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement" to show the sincerity of the Chinese people in supporting the government, and to strengthen the international community's determination to help China. Later, Zhang Wanxin, a reader of the newspaper, contributed her opinions on the debt repayment movement, believing that "this donation can be presented to the central banks in various places, and before the British and American loans are due, the government can use this donation to expand the work of resisting the war and building the country. This is of great benefit to the government's finances, and there will be no shortage of resources for the war of resistance and wartime construction." Later, not only Shanghai citizens responded enthusiastically, with considerable results, but also as far as this port, this one-dollar repayment movement has also been enthusiastically launched. Now various overseas Chinese groups in this port are working hard on this. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to celebrities to raise donations, and the Teachers' Union is leading students to participate. This is truly a gratifying phenomenon. Even a certain foreigner was moved by hearing about it and donated two yuan out of righteousness—however, we should also especially point out the important significance of the one-dollar debt repayment movement here. First, vigorously launching this movement can improve the enthusiasm of the people across the country to help resist the war; it can prove that the people across the country consciously and resolutely support the war and support the government; it can make the vast masses who are unwilling to be slaves become an irresistible tide of assistance to the war of resistance. The Japanese fascist aggressors will not be able to withstand the washing of our upsurge—secondly, vigorously launching one yuan can also strengthen the relationship of close cooperation between the government and the people, and break the alienation and separation of pro-Japanese traitors, national traitors, and Trotskyites. If the people trust the government and the government relies on the people, then we can truly say: "The enemy cannot be destroyed"—Third, more obviously, this movement can increase the government's determination to persist in the war of resistance and enhance the government's prestige in the international arena; especially at this time when the conspiracy of traitors such as Wang Jingwei has been exposed and they are using all kinds of conspiracies to weaken the government's prestige, the vigorous progress of this movement has its great significance—Fourth, the development of this movement can also enhance the friendly assistance of international peace-loving people and peace-loving democratic countries to China, especially the Soviet Union. We should be very clear here that our vigorous launch of the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement is a sacred and urgent task to help the government solve difficulties and strive for the early arrival of victory in the war of resistance!

Every Chinese citizen who is unwilling to be a slave should be invigorated under the call of the sacred and urgent task. We hope that the public opinion circle will strengthen this call and develop the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement as the most important work at present, awakening, organizing and guiding our compatriots with blood and backbone around us to enthusiastically participate in this movement; at the same time, we hope that all sectors will recognize the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement as the new task of national assistance in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. For this sacred and urgent task, we should each establish and develop a commando team for the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement from all groups such as workers, peasants, youth, women, businessmen, freelancers, students, cultural figures, children, and fellow villagers' associations, etc., and participate in it with great excitement and enthusiasm, and hold glorious competitions regularly—we want every sector, every group, and every region to produce the most glorious era heroes who win the championship!

All soldiers and civilians share the same hatred and are determined to never waver. However, Wang Zhaoming, bearing the heavy trust of our party, and at a time of military tension, has abandoned his post without authorization, hidden himself in a foreign land, violated national policies, and spread fallacious theories. Your department has already resolved to permanently expel him from the party and dismiss him from all positions. The people of the country are greatly pleased. Under the leadership of our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, we have been fighting on the battlefield for a year and a half, avenging our shame and repeatedly defeating the enemy's advance. Now that the invaders are sinking deeper and deeper, we will fight even more bravely to sweep away the enemy's atmosphere, revive the nation, fulfill our responsibility to defend the country, and realize the Three People's Principles. We hereby appeal to the military and civilians of the entire country to unanimously support the sanctions against Wang, and to unite sincerely, adhere to national policies, and support our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, to resist the war to the end.

### Chen Bijun Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday (7th), a Guangdong ship arrived in Hong Kong from Haiphong. Reporters boarded the ship for investigation. According to a crew member, the ship carried more than seventy Chinese and Western passengers. However, after the ship set sail, it was discovered that Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun, was also among them. She remained hidden in her cabin all day long, never taking a step out, as if afraid of being discovered. She even ate her meals huddled in a corner of the room. After the ship docked in Hong Kong, only a few women were seen arriving by motorboat to greet her, and they disappeared in an instant. Their whereabouts were extremely secretive. The crew member spoke of this vividly. Reporters continued to investigate at the purser's office, but did not find Mrs. Wang's name on the passenger manifest. Therefore, it is suspected that she must have used an alias.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing on the 7th] Political sources say that there are four major reasons for Wang Zhaoming's departure this time: (1) His consistent policy of seeking peace was not adopted by the highest authorities, so he would rather risk universal disapproval and directly contact the Japanese to issue absurd telegrams. (2) He attempted to use some of the councilors to attack a certain president of the Yuan, wanting to expand his influence and replace the president, but was severely corrected by the highest authorities at an expanded memorial week at the front. (3) When the central government decided to transfer a certain provincial chairman, Wang immediately telegraphed the authorities to recommend his long-time subordinate, Mr. Mou, to concurrently hold the post. As a result, he did not receive a reply, and the appointment of Mr. Mou, who was famous throughout the country for the Battle of De'an, had already been announced. (4) Wang advocated the death penalty for Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of Hunan Province, and issued absurd remarks on the Changsha fire, severely criticizing the scorched earth policy he had previously advocated, which greatly dissatisfied the military.

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Since Wang's telegram was issued, newspaper vendors in Hong Kong have regarded Wang's mouthpiece as a traitorous newspaper and unanimously refused to sell it. The public, incensed by righteousness, , , . In addition, the ×× Weekly and ×× Editorial Department, which are affiliated with the newspaper and were originally run by Fan ×× and Mei ××, etc., received a monthly subsidy of 6,000 national currency from the central government. After Wang's telegram was issued, the central government immediately ordered them to cease operations and await orders for a resolution. After receiving the order, Fan and others immediately distributed the December funds as severance pay.

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Foreign reports state that Wang Zhaoming is scheduled to issue a statement yesterday. According to sources, the matter was still under consideration yesterday, and it is uncertain whether it will be issued.

The national policy of continuing to resist Japanese aggression will not waver in the slightest. Chairman Chiang highly praised the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. Regarding Wang Jingwei's peace proposals, Chairman Chiang was completely unaware of them before his telegram was issued, as Wang never mentioned this to Chairman Chiang when he was in Chongqing.

### Fierce Battle in Hangzhou; Our Troops Cross the Qiantang River and Launch a Fierce Attack; Enemy Troops Surrounded

[United Press, Shanghai, 7th] According to unconfirmed reports, Chinese troops attacked Hangzhou during the New Year and crossed the Qiantang River at Liangjiaqiao (transliteration), ten miles from Hangzhou, and attacked Hangzhou from all directions. The Japanese side admits that Hangzhou's connection with the outside world has been almost cut off. The Chinese army launched this offensive with a total of 8,000 men, including 6,000 shock troops. The Japanese army countered with three regiments, so the battle at that time was extremely fierce and is still raging. The Japanese army also dispatched planes to bomb the Chinese army's lines.

### Zhao Baoyuan's Puppet Troops Telegraph Defection: Three Thousand Brave Soldiers Harbor Lofty Aspirations; Weapons Carried Sufficient to Terrify the Enemy

(Special Chongqing Airmail Dispatch) According to a Shandong radio dispatch on the 2nd, Zhao Baoyuan's troops, stationed in Jiaodong, were originally from the Northeast Army. Recently, they were ordered to enter the pass and were dispatched to Shandong to fight. Zhao's troops, totaling over three thousand men, had long harbored the determination to serve the country. On December 18th, taking advantage of their deployment to Jiaodong, they resolutely defected, and all Japanese personnel in their unit were shot. They immediately telegraphed Shandong Province Chairman Shen Honglie, requesting permission to defect, and in the name of the defecting army, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all military and political circles in the country, as well as overseas Chinese, expressing their determination to save the nation and kill the enemy. Chairman Shen replied approvingly and awarded them five thousand yuan as encouragement. (Already noted in this newspaper's special dispatch). After Zhao's troops defected, the military strength of Shandong Province greatly increased, and many puppet troops contacted them about defecting. The enemy was extremely panicked. The full text of Zhao Baoyuan's telegram is recorded below: To Chairman Shen, forwarded to Chairman Chiang, and all national military and political leaders, organizations, and overseas Chinese: Since our army fell into the puppet state of the Northeast, we have always harbored hatred and animosity towards the enemy, and always harbored the ambition to restore our homeland. However, due to the harsh environment, although under the iron heel and subjected to repeated trampling, we had to endure and wait for the opportunity. Fortunately, this spring, we were transferred into the pass. With the nation in distress and the great task of saving the nation at hand, we have an unshirkable responsibility. Therefore, on December 18th, we raised the banner of righteousness and resolutely defected. Three thousand brave soldiers harbor lofty aspirations, and the weapons we carry are sufficient to terrify the enemy. We will restore the descendants of the Yellow Emperor and reveal our true faces. From now on, under the leadership of our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, our troops will be determined to save the nation with our lives and thoroughly annihilate the enemy. We will sacrifice ourselves for the country and fight the war to the end. As long as we have a breath left, we vow to fight the Japanese to the death. We still hope that our comrades across the country will provide absolute assistance. Then, our army will surely bravely kill the enemy and restore our homeland as soon as possible to thank the people of the country. With an urgent telegram, we await your orders. Shandong Defecting Army Commander Zhao Baoyuan, leading all officers and soldiers, respectfully bows. (Sent on January 2nd)

### On the East Bank of the Yellow River, the Enemy Troops Collapsed and Retreated; Cities Were Recaptured One After Another

[Central News Agency, with Jihe, 6th] On the 4th, all enemy troops on the east bank of the Yellow River moved eastward. Our defending troops on the west bank immediately pursued them. At dusk, they attacked Wencheng Town, engaging in fierce fighting. Zhongshi and Jingcheng were successively recaptured by us. From there, they fired artillery at Wencheng. The enemy immediately returned fire, killing each other, and suffered heavy losses. By nightfall, our troops had advanced and stationed in Wencheng Gu, Bijialing, Gaoshan, Gaolouhe, and other places. The remaining enemy troops fled in disarray. Our troops are now advancing in separate formations. This time, the enemy troops wore the armbands of our certain army during their westward invasion. When retreating, they burned Zhongshi, Jingcheng, and other villages, and massacred many civilians.

### The Enemy's Military Personnel Speak Arrogantly, Vainly Claiming to Transform the World; Their Advocacy of a Hundred-Year War in Various Newspapers Is Shocking to the Public

[Reuters Tokyo, 7th] The newspapers of the Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article today signed by Lieutenant General Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Army, entitled "Japan's Hundred-Year War," which greatly shocked the public. The article stated that the China Incident has entered a period of long-term war, but after this war is resolved, there will be an epoch-making political change in the world. The completion of this task will require a century or two. Therefore, Japan is now preparing for a hundred-year war to transform the world according to the methods of the Japanese Empire. Japan sacrifices for peace, eliminates the power of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and replaces it with Japanese military preparations to deal with the Soviet Union. Japan's great victory over Russia in 1905 was the starting point for transforming the world's new order. The weaknesses of Western culture led to the World War and the emergence of Bolshevik Russia. The ideas of Germany and Italy are the dawn of the revival of Western culture, and the Anti-Comintern Pact is an extremely strong driving force for transforming the new world. Historically and factually, Japan is the only country in the world that can save the misfortunes of various countries. How to transform the world can be seen in Japan's handling of international affairs. New history cannot overshadow new brilliance.

### Yunnan-Burma Military Transport Runs Smoothly

[Local News] The enemy's interference with the transportation of military supplies on the Burma Road has failed, and a large number of special agents have gone to Burma to bribe local tribal people. British authorities have dispatched a regiment of troops to protect the line along the way, so at present, the Burma Road is running smoothly.

### Cabinet Changes in Japan Closely Watched by the United States: If New Cabinet's Policies Do Not Change, Resolve to Consider Harsher Steps

[Central News Agency Washington, 7th] Officials here have declined to comment on the new Japanese cabinet but are still watching it closely. The Japanese methods of monopolizing Manchuria and mainland China discriminate against the interests of American residents. In addition, Japan refuses to return the property of many American residents. This clearly violates the principle of the Open Door Policy, which Japan claims to respect, and the Nine-Power Treaty. The observers here are deeply impressed by President Roosevelt's statement in his message to Congress that the United States should take stronger steps, in addition to verbal protests, to deal with aggressor nations. It is believed that although President Roosevelt did not explicitly mention Japan, in fact, this statement is another hint to Japan. There have been frequent changes in the Japanese cabinet recently, but there has been no significant change in Japanese policy as a result. Therefore, the authorities here have very little expectation that relations between Japan and the United States will improve during the Hiranuma cabinet. Although successive Japanese governments have had different political views, in fact, apart from the increasingly strong tendency of successive prime ministers towards dictatorship, there has been no benefit to improving relations between Japan and the United States. According to impartial observers, if the new Japanese cabinet continues its past policies or its attitude towards the United States becomes even more rigid, then the American government will consider retaliatory measures.

### New Year's Day in Xindu

— Yu

[This Newspaper, Chongqing Special Airmail Dispatch] The hardest thing to see in Chongqing in winter is the sun. On New Year's Day of the 28th year [of the Republic of China], the weather was clear and like early spring, and the sun shone brilliantly. Bright red national flags fluttered in the wind in front of or in the windows of every household. The pedestrians on the road, shoulder to shoulder, puffed out their chests and were full of smiles, all celebrating our New Year's Day of resistance, which also symbolizes the bright future of our nation's resistance and nation-building!

At ten o'clock in the morning, the open-air music concert in the park's tennis court opened. The concert was hosted by the China Film Studio. In addition to all the male and female actors of the studio performing songs, the military band of the Xingying was also invited to participate in playing military music. In the center of the court was a stage that could accommodate twenty or thirty people. The participating crowd was about ten thousand people. The chairman was Mr. Guo Moruo. The main point of his speech was, "Today, there are 700,000 people in this city, 70 million people in the entire province of Sichuan, and 450 million people in the country, all enthusiastically celebrating our New Year's Day of the 18th year. In this enthusiastic celebration, we should complete at least two tasks: First, overthrow Japanese imperialism; second, build a peaceful and happy new China. How can we complete these two tasks? That is to dedicate everything we have to the country. Now, the Japanese are at the end of their rope, and we can take advantage of this opportunity to give them a 'Surrounded on All Sides' situation." "Next year, we will celebrate New Year's Day in Nanjing." After a brief pause in the enthusiastic applause, the singing began.

First was military music. The program performed was the German Cavalry March. The tone was melodious and contained a solemn atmosphere in the calmness. Next, all the actors of the China Film Studio began to sing according to the scheduled program, including "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Crimson Earth," "War for the Motherland," "Go to the Front Line," "Artillery Song," "Recover Our Lost Land," "The Great Wall Ballad," "Go to the Battlefield," etc. After each section was performed, the crowd around the court shouted in unison, "Again!" "Again!" However, time did not wait for us. Noon had already arrived, and the conference closed with the melodious military music.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, a conference with a dual meaning—celebrating the New Year and promoting resistance and nation-building—began at Fuzichi. The square was divided into distinct areas, and the participating groups were assigned their respective positions. The civilians and schools were on the left, and the party and government organs and military police were on the right. As early as two o'clock, the groups had come one after another in a mighty manner, preparing for the torchlight parade following the end of the conference. Each team held lanterns in their hands, and the styles of the lanterns were colorful: dragon lanterns, pagoda lanterns, lanterns in the shape of various fruits, and lanterns in the shape of characters. When the lanterns were combined, they formed complete slogans, such as "Military-Civilian Cooperation" and "Resist to the End." When the dragon lanterns arrived at the square, they beat gongs and drums and danced into the square. Those who acted as the dragon dancers were dressed as Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie. Although it was already the cold winter season, they were still waving large banana leaf fans in their hands as they led the dragon, and their excitement was unprecedented in Sichuan Province. This proves that the Chinese nation has been invigorated under the enemy's artillery fire and has grown stronger in the process of striving to resist the war.

The conference opened with the sound of artillery and music. Mayor Jiang led the ceremony as chairman and reported the significance of the meeting. Then, a representative of the Central Propaganda Department raised two points for everyone to pay attention to: "One is to strengthen your belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and the other is to intensify your own work, that is, those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength." In addition, Guo Fu representative Lu Canjun stated, "The result of eighteen months of resistance has laid a solid foundation for our nation-building. On the foundation built with flesh and blood, we must make three resolutions at the beginning of this year: First, everyone must take on the great cause of nation-building; second, we must do our best to promote the revolutionary spirit of the Prime Minister; and third, we must increase the efficiency of our work in the future. Only in this way can we shorten the distance to our final victory." (To be continued)

### A Record of the Bloody Battles on the Nanxun Line in April (Part Two)

— Zhuangju

East and West Guling: Transforming the Enemy into Graveyards

After our army retreated from Majieling, Xingzi successively fell into enemy hands, and the focus of the war on the west bank of Poyang Lake shifted to East and West Guling. East and West Guling are located between Xingzi and De'an. The enemy's attempt to attack from this direction was twofold: first, to cut off the retreat route of the Majieling troops to Nanchang; and second, to join forces with the enemy troops in Majieling to attack De'an from both sides. However, our military authorities had long seen through the enemy's cunning plan and ordered General Ye Boqin to repel the enemy in the area between East and West Guling and Jinlun Peak, preventing the enemy from advancing an inch.

On September 7th, an enemy regiment attacked our army's position at Guling, engaging in a fierce bloody battle, killing countless enemies. Unexpectedly, the enemy became enraged and, at dawn the next morning, used a large amount of poison gas. After our army suffered this major blow, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, it retreated from East Guling to West Guling.

The terrain of West Guling is about 200 meters lower than that of East Guling. After the enemy occupied East Guling, they constantly posed a major threat to us. However, our loyal and brave soldiers, advancing one after another and regarding death as returning home, held out for twelve days, annihilating two enemy regiments. Our army, having completed its mission, then moved to a new position.

After retreating from East and West Guling to Aikou, the enemy repeatedly reinforced their troops and attacked with their superior weapons. We fought fiercely with the enemy in Shanjia Mountain, Guizong Temple, Jinlin Street, Husizui, Zhaoxianguan, Rongjia Mountain, Huzhuang, Jinlong Temple, Jinlun Peak, and other positions. Among them, the battle of Jinlun Peak was the fiercest. On September 27th, the enemy concentrated their main force to attack Jiaojian, the northern end of Jinlun Peak. However, the area was about "a thousand feet" from the sea. The enemy had to climb step by step to advance, while our army was hidden around, and as soon as the enemy arrived, they launched a fierce artillery attack and formed a dense fire blockade on the enemy's retreat route. At this time, the enemy was at a loss whether to advance or retreat, and the enemy soldiers fell one after another as if they were fallen leaves in the west wind. Jiaojian became the enemy's graveyard. After resisting for half a month, the Aikou position of our army lost its military value and there was no need to defend it to the death, so on October 9th, our army automatically retreated to the rear.

On the Ruiwu Line: A Great Annihilation War

The areas of Shuijie and Wanjialing are located between the Nanchang-De'an and Ruiwu lines, starting from Minshan in the north and ending at Xiuhe in the south, all of which are mountainous areas. The war started on September 25th and ended on October 16th. The most amazing performance during this period was the annihilation war near Wanjialing.

Since the end of August, the enemy had been using Ruiwu as a base and had been advancing south along the Ruiwu Highway with a part of their forces. By September 25th, the vanguard had reached the vicinity of Baishui. It was found that the enemy forces were the 123rd and 145th Regiments, the 52nd Mountain Artillery Regiment, the Miyazakitomio Regiment of the Fengjiu Corps, the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the China Garrison Army, and a part of the so-called North China Dispatch Army, totaling about 23,000 people.

Qilinfeng was the key to this position, and the enemy's main force first attempted to attack it and used poison gas, causing the position to be lost and regained twice, but the enemy suffered four battalions of casualties, especially the Miyazakitomio Regiment, which was almost completely annihilated. At the same time, our army intercepted the enemy at other locations such as Fuxueshan, Ma'anshan, Lishan, Wanjiacao, and Hejiashan, beheading a total of 2,000 enemies, and the captured military supplies were piled up like mountains.

In order to rescue the critical situation in Baishui Street, the entire 106th Division of the enemy attempted to break through our position in the area of Wanjialing, Changling, and Zhanggushan west of De'an, using a roundabout tactic to capture De'an, the vanguard of Nanchang, and then annihilate our entire force of resistance on the Nanchang-Xunyang Line, in order to relieve the state of Baishui. Unexpectedly, our side detected their conspiracy. Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue immediately convened a meeting of senior generals on the front line, and after careful planning day and night, redeployed the entire line, dividing the troops into several routes, tightly surrounding the two brigades led by the enemy General Matsuura (one was the Aokibrigade and the other was the Yamajibrigade, totaling about 10,000 people) in Wanjialing, Laohujian, Shimakang, Zhoujia, Jincun, Bijijie, and other places. Attacking each other, the sound of guns and cannons and the sound of killing shook the valleys. Especially the brave troops organized by each division charged forward, making the enemy feel even more overwhelmed. At this time, although the enemy planes came in groups to fly low and provide support, and sprinkled poison gas, they could not reverse Matsuura's tragic defeat.

The completion of this annihilation war was just in time for the Double Tenth Festival last year. The news of the great victory in De'an, which was printed in special large font headlines in newspapers across the country, refers to this, and it can be said to be worthy of the name "Second Taierzhuang."

The Great Victory in De'an: Transferring the Position to Xiuhe

De'an is a small city on the Nanchang-Xunyang Line. After being repeatedly bombed by enemy planes, it has become a dead city of scorched earth. The streets are desolate and sparsely populated, and even travelers cannot find food to fill their stomachs.

The enemy had been painstakingly planning to seize De'an as a stronghold for attacking Nanchang for several months, but because our army resisted effectively in Majieling and other places, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, the battle for De'an did not begin until October 24th. According to intelligence, the enemy's attacking forces were one regiment of the 101st Division, and the remnants of Matsuura's 106th Division.

On the 24th, the enemy repeatedly used planes and cannons to coordinate with infantry to forcibly cross the river north of De'an, but they were all defeated by our army's heavy blows. When the enemy could not do anything, they heavily used poison gas to attack, causing our river-guarding troops to suddenly lose their resistance. Taking advantage of the gap, the enemy crossed the river, and our army immediately launched a fierce bloody battle with the enemy in the area of Xiong Zhuang, Xin Fo Temple, Ni Shi Cliff, Tiger Mountain, and Yi Feng Mountain. The enemy abandoned corpses and weapons, filling the mountains and roads, but our side also suffered many casualties. Regiment Commander Chai Jingzhong and two or three battalion commanders also heroically sacrificed their lives.

Street battles were launched in De'an city from the 27th to the 30th. Because the enemy army used planes and cannons to assist in the battle, and released poison gas smoke, they were able to repeatedly break into the city, but they were driven out by our army like rats. All the soldiers and officers embraced the purpose of coexisting with the city, and would never easily give up an inch of land unless it was absolutely necessary, and they had to demand a great price from the enemy. One day, our army lured dozens of enemy soldiers into a large house, and at the same time, in the gaps between the adjacent wall and the roof, violently threw dozens of hand grenades down. Only a burst of explosions was heard, followed by a burst of shouts, and enemy soldiers fell one by one into a pool of blood. Our army took the opportunity to rush out and斩斩斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩 斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斩斩斩斩斩斩斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斩斬斬斩斬斩斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斩斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斬斬斬斬斬斩斬斬斩斬斩
