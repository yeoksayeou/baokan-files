### On Soviet Diplomacy

— Shen Zhiyuan

Regarding the question of "Soviet Diplomacy," I would like to divide it into three parts:

1.  The objective basis of Soviet diplomatic policy.
2.  The achievements and significance of Soviet peaceful diplomacy in recent years.
3.  The past and prospects of Sino-Soviet diplomacy.

1. The Objective Basis of Soviet Diplomatic Policy

(I) Observing from the socio-economic system, the Soviet Union has no need for foreign aggression.

1. The Soviet Union's production is not for private profit; the Soviet Union is a socialist country, different from capitalist countries. Socialist production pursues not the interests of a few, but the welfare of the masses. Capitalist countries do the opposite; their sole goal is to pursue the profits of capitalists. Based on this difference, the two diverge in their foreign policies. Capitalist countries, in order to pursue profits, have to strive for foreign markets to sell their goods; have to seize the resources of other countries to supply their raw materials; have to develop foreign investments to utilize their capital, and directly exploit the masses of backward nations. In short, for the sake of profit, under their continuous exploitation, the domestic market shrinks day by day, so they have to expand their influence abroad. Country A expands abroad, and Country B also expands abroad; Country A excludes Country B, and Country B also excludes Country A; in the end, they are bound to resort to force, causing war! Look at the tense situation in the international arena today; what is it for? It is for capitalists to compete for greater sources of profit! Soviet production is not for private profit; the development of Soviet wealth and production is accompanied by the improvement of the welfare of the entire people, and the continuous growth of the purchasing power of the masses, so there is no need for foreign aggression. Its relationship with other countries does not have the kind of contradiction that exists between imperialist countries in their competition for colonial markets. Therefore, it does not need to use war to deal with other countries; it only needs to maintain equal economic relations with other countries through peaceful and friendly means. This is a theoretical basis for analyzing that the Soviet Union does not need foreign aggression from the socio-economic system.

2. The Soviet Union has no contradiction between production and consumption. The purpose of Soviet production is to improve the enjoyment of the masses and increase the material construction. Everyone in society enjoys the same protection. Capitalist countries do the opposite; they sacrifice the happiness of the majority for the profits of a few. Their national wealth increases day by day, and the pockets of their oil magnates, car magnates, and whatnot magnates are filled day by day, but their people become poorer day by day. That is to say, on the one hand, a few are rich, and on the other hand, the majority are poor; on the one hand, machines and factories increase, and on the other hand, unemployment and bankruptcy are widespread. The result is a sharp increase in production but a sharp decrease in purchasing power. This contradictory phenomenon forces capitalist countries to invade abroad. The Soviet Union is completely different; their national wealth increases, and their social welfare also increases with it. The third five-year plan, as recorded in the newspaper, has already told us that the living standards of the Soviet people are progressively improving along with their productivity. The sharp increase in wage rates, the addition of universities, the prevalence of nurseries, public hospitals, and maternity convalescent homes all prove that the increasingly affluent lives of the people and the rapid development of productivity have achieved a balanced speed, which cannot but be attributed to their planned economy. We look at the world economic panic from 1929 to 1933. In imperialist countries, there was overproduction, soaring unemployment, bankrupt shops, and a plummeting purchasing power of the people. However, in the Soviet Union, there was no unemployment phenomenon before 1932. In the world economic panic, it not only did not suffer any blows, but also continued to prosper. During the first five-year plan period, the feeling of a shortage of goods was indeed due to the fact that industry could not be fully developed, but the increased purchasing power of the people was also a major factor. In short, the Soviet Union has no contradiction between production and consumption; sometimes demand even exceeds supply, so it has no need for aggression. In the Soviet Union, from the highest leader to the lowest-level ordinary people, are all laborers. Although there is still a distinction between mental and physical labor, raising the national cultural level will surely break the gap between mental and physical labor, and surely make everyone an engineer and a scientist. At that time, their working hours will be reduced, and the time for research and entertainment will be increased. In other words, the consumption of the general public will gradually increase. Consumption increases with the increase in production, and the phenomenon of contradiction between production and consumption will not occur at all, and therefore foreign aggression is not necessary. This is another theoretical basis for analyzing that the Soviet Union does not need foreign aggression from the Soviet socio-economic system.

(II) The dictatorship of the proletariat is also an objective basis for the Soviet Union not needing foreign aggression. The socialist economic system is inseparable from the dictatorship of the working class. If the capitalists of the Soviet Union still exist and still hold the power, then the socialist economic system of the Soviet Union will not work. Because the Soviet Union is ruled by the working class, it can protect the current socio-economic system, and the socialist labor regime and the socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible with aggression.

(III) Observing from the objective basis, the Soviet Union's foreign aggression is impossible: First, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has been embraced by the entire people because it is in the interests of the entire people. If there were a madman in the Soviet Union who wanted to invade China, I think the entire Soviet people would definitely execute him. The people's opinion is like this, and the Soviet government is elected by the people, so of course it cannot violate the will of the people. This is the first impossibility. Second, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has been sympathized with by the international community because it is in line with the requirements of all just people in the world. If she changes this policy, she will definitely lose the sympathy of anti-aggression people all over the world, and the Soviet regime will lose the support of international just people. This is the first impossibility. Two, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy is one of the fundamental national policies of a socialist country. Fundamental national policies are by no means deceptive. Foreign policy can never be separated from the entire fundamental national policy of the Soviet Union—the national policy of realizing socialism and even communism—and exist independently. It cannot violate the fundamental national policy. This is the third basis for the impossibility of aggression.

The above is from the theoretical aspect, explaining the reasons for the Soviet Union's implementation of peaceful diplomacy. The following will further prove it from the factual aspect. We see that after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's foreign trade has been highly reputable, and it trades with various countries on an equal footing. The purpose of the transaction is to regulate the domestic supply and demand, and it is by no means to seize spheres of influence, and it has no ambition for aggression. The treaties between China and the Soviet Union, and between the Soviet Union and Turkey, are the most powerful ironclad evidence.

Why does the Soviet Union adopt a peaceful diplomatic policy? This question has already been answered. Now let's talk about the characteristics of Soviet peaceful diplomatic policy.

The first characteristic is that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy is not unconditional peace. The Soviet Union's peace is not the peace of world pacifists. She does not need China's Jingwei-style peace, nor does she need America's isolationist peace. She is not an Ah Q-style peace, but a Sun Yat-sen-style peace. She does not invade others, nor does she allow others to invade her. Stalin said, "When other people's pig noses stretch into our Soviet garden, we will use the iron fists of the workers and peasants to beat them out." This is just like our country's war of resistance. Before the behavior of aggressive robbers stops, there is no talk of peace. This is the contradiction in the essence of peace. Although on the surface, the war of resistance itself is an unpeaceful move, in essence, this is the only means to seek true peace.

The second characteristic is that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy does not exist independently. The Soviet Union's national policy, economic policy, worker-peasant alliance policy, and monopoly foreign trade policy are all linked to diplomatic policy. Now let's talk about the national policy alone. The Soviet Union's national policy is national self-determination internally. All ethnic groups are equal. Any ethnic group in the country has the right to freely withdraw from the Soviet Union in the Stalin Constitution. With national self-determination developed to this point, it will of course not cause international disputes due to ethnic issues. The Soviet Union's national policy is to support all small and weak nations externally. Based on this principle, the Soviet Union, in its diplomacy, automatically abolished all unequal treaties of the Tsarist era in the passive aspect; and opposed the imperialist aggression against weak behaviors in the active aspect. The past support for China's Northern Expedition and the current assistance to China's war of resistance are all manifestations of its national policy, which is also the implementation of diplomatic policy.

2. The Achievements and Significance of Soviet Peaceful Diplomacy

Soviet diplomacy can be divided into three periods.

The first is the period of no diplomacy (1917 to early 1921). During this period, the Soviet Union had counter-revolutionary rebellions internally and imperialist intervention externally. The Soviet Union was so busy seeking survival that it had no diplomacy at all. The second is the period of lifting the imperialist encirclement and restoring international status (1921 to 1932). The outstanding achievements of the first five-year plan completely lifted the imperialist encirclement. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, it expelled the imperialist intervention countries from the territory externally, and openly interrogated the cases of the Peasant Party, the Realization Party, etc. internally, exposing the conspiracy of imperialism, especially France. In addition, the expulsion of Trotsky, the international anti-Soviet vanguard, gave imperialism a serious warning.

In the active aspect, the Soviet Union strengthened their proportion in the League of Nations. Since 1928, they have progressed from the economic policy to the socialist economic construction. Their production has increased, and their national strength has been enriched. Based on this self-reliance, the Soviet Union's proportion in international relations has increased day by day.

The third is the period of defending the entire world peace (1932 to the present)

The Soviet Union, except for Germany and Japan, tried its best to sign non-aggression treaties with her neighbors. In 1933, it resumed diplomatic relations with the United States, which had been severed for sixteen years, which greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's defense of peace. In September 1934, more than 30 countries invited the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations; they no longer regarded the Soviet Union as a flood beast; they all welcomed the Soviet Union's sincere peaceful policy. After the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, the nature of the League of Nations changed. The League of Nations, which had deceived small and weak nations in the past, has since played a somewhat active role as a peaceful institution, because the Soviet Union is an extremely brave and extremely determined protector of peace. In 1935, the Franco-Soviet agreement was established, and she further launched the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, calling for collective security in Eastern Europe. Although it unfortunately aborted midway, this proposal is always meaningful. In 1935, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia signed a mutual assistance agreement, and resumed diplomatic relations with Belgium. The resumption of diplomatic relations between Belgium and the Soviet Union showed that Belgium was unwilling to be used by Germany and unwilling to be a victim of Germany. In August 1937, the Soviet Union and China also signed a non-aggression treaty. These many facts tell us that the Soviet Union is actively defending world peace and leading the anti-aggression collective security system.

3. The Past and Prospects of Sino-Soviet Diplomacy

The past of Sino-Soviet diplomacy can be divided into four stages: The first is the period of Sino-Soviet abolition of unequal treaties (1917 to 1924). After the Soviet Revolution, according to her national policy, she automatically abolished the unequal treaties of the Tsarist era. China, following Turkey, established a reciprocal and equal diplomatic relationship with Soviet Russia. In 1924, an equal treaty was signed in Beijing, declaring the old treaty invalid. The second is the period of further cooperation between China and the Soviet Union (1924 to 1927). During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen strived for the National Revolution. He actively advocated alliance with Russia, and alliance with Russia was one of his three major policies. At that time, Tiao Lian also actively assisted China and promoted China's National Revolution. The close cooperation between the two countries at that time is worth writing about. The third is the period of Sino-Soviet severance of diplomatic relations (1927 to 1932). During this period, many misunderstandings occurred between China and the Soviet Union, and diplomatic relations fell sharply. Sometimes, the border between the two countries belonged to the side. Conflicts occurred, which can be regarded as a dark period of Sino-Soviet diplomacy. Finally, the period of Sino-Soviet military reconciliation (1932 to the present). From the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union to the present, the friendship between the two countries has been rebuilt. From the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1932 to the non-aggression treaty in 1937, it can be called the first stage of this period. In this stage, both sides have achieved preliminary harmony. From the non-aggression treaty to the present, it can be called the second stage. In this stage, the Soviet Union has assisted our war of resistance. Helping us resist fascist robbers is obviously greatly activated.

The past of Sino-Soviet diplomacy has been roughly described. What about the future of Sino-Soviet diplomacy? We all hope that the Soviet Union and we can have further cooperation, that is to say, we hope that the Soviet Union will send troops. Will the Soviet Union send troops after all? Our answer is that the time for the Soviet Union to send troops has not yet matured. The Soviet Union's dispatch of troops can only be implemented if it has one of the three premises mentioned by President Sun. The first premise is that if the Soviet Union had signed a mutual assistance pact with China before the war of resistance, then of course it would have the obligation to send troops once the war of resistance started, but in fact, China and the Soviet Union have never signed such a treaty in the past. The second premise is that the League of Nations passes a resolution that member states can use force alone to assist China. If there is such a resolution, the Soviet Union can use its status as a member state to send troops to aid China. There is a legal basis. But in fact, the League of Nations does not have such a resolution. The third premise is that Japan attacks the Soviet Union at the same time. If Japan invades the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will of course send troops. But in fact, since Zhanggufeng met a nail, she no longer dares to offend the Soviet Union. None of the above three premises have matured, so the Soviet Union has no basis for sending troops. In short, we must know that the Soviet Union is not a guard or a general employed by us, and cannot be driven by us. It has its own position, national character, and special international status. We cannot have excessive expectations and dependence on others. We must hope for ourselves, and our own strength must be as solid as a fortress. We must have the belief of victory. We have the best leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the successor of the Premier, just like Stalin is the successor of Lenin. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, we will use our own strength to deal with Japanese imperialism. Although the Soviet Union cannot send troops immediately, its assistance to us is not a problem. In short, the Soviet Union, whether in this righteousness or in terms of interests, is always our permanent and loyal good friend. The higher stage of Sino-Soviet cooperation will finally come, as long as we persevere in resisting the war to the end.

### One Week of World Trends

— Pan Lang

From April 16th to 22nd, Year 28

The third week of April has passed amidst an atmosphere of extreme tension.

This week, both globally and within China, there have been many heartening news items.

For example, the consultations on military cooperation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the U.S. President's proposal for a peace plan, the calls for extending the anti-aggression front to the Far East, the return of the American fleet to the Pacific, the British government's strengthening of its Far Eastern military presence, and the Soviet Union's active support for democratic and peace-loving nations and aid to countries under aggression—all of these demonstrate that the peace front is developing rapidly. Conversely, the aggressive nations have already exhibited even more embarrassing and panicked appearances.

Speaking of our homeland, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered an important speech on the 17th, pointing out that all the "anti-communist" and "peace" propositions and actions of Wang Jingwei and his cohorts are entirely "responding to the × people's plan to destroy China through surrender and selling out the nation." Therefore, the distinction between loyal and traitorous subjects is clear, and right and wrong are evident. The nationwide anti-Wang movement has expanded, political progress has been made in various regions, and the military at the front has also achieved even greater victories, making it known to all under heaven that Japan has already been reduced to a second-rate nation or lower, while the strength of the Chinese nation has further become a major force in the world against aggression and for the preservation of peace!

(1) Development of the Peace Front

In order to oppose the intensified expansion of a world war by fascist, German, Italian, and Japanese aggressor nations, the movement among democratic and peace-loving nations to organize an anti-aggression front has experienced even faster development this week. First, regarding the issue of military cooperation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, consultations have continued over the past week, leading to more harmonious developments. A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 16th stated, "Negotiations between France and the Soviet Union and Turkey regarding the peace front have made satisfactory progress." An Havas dispatch from London on the 17th stated, "France is preparing to conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union, and Britain is also preparing to establish an air force agreement with the Soviet Union." On the same day, a Reuters dispatch from Paris also stated: "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are about to announce guarantees for Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey." Second, several small countries are supporting the anti-aggression front. An Havas dispatch from Paris on the 18th stated: "Negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey to establish a collective security system in the Eastern Mediterranean are proceeding very smoothly." On the same day, an Associated Press dispatch from Athens stated: "Turkey and Greece have agreed on measures for military cooperation in wartime." A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 17th also stated: "Romania has agreed to the measure of providing assistance to the Soviet Union when necessary." And a Central News Agency dispatch from London on the 19th also stated, "Britain and Turkey have concluded an agreement in the Turkish capital for Turkey to join the collective security organization." Third, U.S. President Roosevelt proposed a peace plan to Hitler and Mussolini on the 15th, requesting a guarantee for the safety of thirty-one countries, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, Ireland, France, the Soviet Union, Portugal, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iran, for a period of ten or twenty-five years. Roosevelt's peace plan immediately received the support of all peace-loving nations around the world, and even his opposition unanimously supported it, having a tremendous effect on the United States' active participation in and development of the anti-aggression front. Fourth, the Soviet Union expressed its determination to unite with Britain and France, putting forward four suggestions on the 21st: (1) Eastern and Western European countries should organize an anti-aggression bloc, and participating countries must conclude agreements to unite with each other; (2) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an unreserved mutual assistance pact, supplemented by agreements established by the general staffs of each country; (3) The security guarantees offered by Britain and France to Poland should be revised to target Germany; (4) Romania and Poland should first establish a military pact specifically to defend against German aggression, and then the Soviet Union would provide guarantees to those countries. And a Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd stated that "the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the anti-aggression front does indeed raise the issue of the Far East." The same dispatch also stated, "The 'Daily Telegraph' says: The Soviet proposal is not limited to Europe, and it is a system for guaranteeing resistance to aggression in Asia." This is the only "possible answer" to the collective security system, and the British cabinet is studying its acceptance. Fifth, the demands of Chinese public opinion, the strong advocacy of our ambassadors to Britain and the United States, the assistance of friendly nations such as the Soviet Union, and the international attention garnered by our country's new victories in the War of Resistance have further launched a movement to expand the anti-aggression front to the Far East. In fact, the United States continued to send seventy ships and recently dispatched them to the Pacific. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th even reported on Britain's plan to strengthen its Far Eastern power, indicating that the anti-aggression movement must advance simultaneously in the East and West. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd also said: "Xinglian proposed collective security measures to Britain and France, extending them to the Far East, and all countries and parties view this with great importance, as China can thereby obtain more material assistance."

(2) Embarrassment of Aggressor Nations

The ultra-rapid development of the anti-aggression front has caused Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries, already suffering from internal difficulties such as famine, rebellions, and insignificant territorial gains, to face external counterattacks that cannot be resisted. Thus, the "embarrassment of the Axis powers" has become a "universally acknowledged" fact. For example, the speech by Hitler, the head of the German aggressors, originally scheduled for his birthday on the 20th of this month, has been postponed. The speech delivered by Mussolini, the head of the Italian aggressors, on the 20th, while forcefully arguing that the U.S. President's proposal was inappropriate, also had to "leave the door open for peace." Moreover, the large-scale depletion of Japanese power in China has greatly disappointed the German aggressors. As stated in the "Münchner Neueste Nachrichten" editorial on the 21st: "When Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany was overjoyed, believing that Japan would be a reliable help against Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Little did they know that after Japan's invasion of China, its strength was greatly reduced. The most obvious thing is that Japan's assistance to Germany is far less than it was two years ago!"

Of course, the fascist aggressor nations will not simply "go downhill" like this! They must struggle and use every possible vicious weapon they can. The facts that we cannot ignore this week are: First, Germany and Italy are attempting even closer collusion. German Aviation Minister Göring arrived in Rome on the 14th to meet with Mussolini, discussing ways to deal with the U.S. President's message and the development of the anti-aggression front. Göring returned to Berlin on the 17th and discussed countermeasures with Hitler and others. Second, the activities of the Japanese aggressors. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th stated: "The Japanese cabinet plans to exert strong diplomatic pressure on Britain and other pro-China countries. Japan also plans to provide spiritual assistance to Germany and Italy." Third, Germany and Italy are intensifying their intimidation before the anti-aggression front is fully established. According to dispatches from Europe on the 14th, 15th, and 16th, Germany and Italy have concentrated large numbers of naval forces in the Mediterranean and other areas, while "Germany currently has troops advancing towards Poland and Yugoslavia from both sides," "Italy has decided to build more ports in the Lirida Sea," "The amount of German military supplies being transported through Switzerland to Italy is increasing daily," "German planes have invaded Polish territory," "Italy and Germany are increasing troops in Spain," and other news items are filling the international pages of various newspapers. Fourth, Hjalmar Schacht, the former president of the German Reichsbank, is touring various countries in the Near East and has now penetrated into India, with news of his coming east, which certainly has its economic conspiracy role. Fifth, Germany is making every effort to woo Romania and Turkey, while Italy is coercing and enticing countries such as Bulgaria and Hungary to incite Bulgaria to make territorial demands on Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Germany is also exhausting its means of enticement and coercion towards Poland.

The future of these recent conspiratorial activities of the three aggressor nations, Germany, Italy, and Japan, depends on the sincerity and determination of Britain, America, and France in organizing the anti-aggression front. If Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union unite without reservation, then the wavering of the smaller nations will become a thing of the past, and the submission of the aggressors will be an inevitable fact.

(3) New Victories in the War of Resistance Against Japan

Over the past week, our country's War of Resistance Against Japan has continued the large-scale counter-offensives launched on various fronts in the previous week, achieving new victories.

The focus of the war is moving towards northern Hunan, but this week the battles in Jiangxi and Guangdong remain the most important. On the northern Jiangxi front, we are persisting in guerrilla warfare on the Jiangxi-Hunan border, we are further holding onto the guerrilla base at Kuling, and we have successively recovered Gaoan, Xiangtang, Dacheng, Gaoyou City, and other places. In particular, the sieges of Wuning and the encirclement of Nanchang have inflicted considerable blows on the enemy's attempt to attack Changsha. On the Guangdong front, we captured Zengcheng on the 14th, Conghua on the 19th, and briefly captured Xinhui on the 20th, actively pressing towards the Japanese in Guangzhou, preventing the Japanese forces in South China from calmly preparing for new offensives.

Guerrilla counter-offensives on various fronts in the north and south have brought news of victories this week. In Shanxi, the enemy's plan to sweep through the Zhongtiao Mountains was crushed, and the Japanese forces in southern Shanxi suffered heavy casualties. The Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Railways were again cut off by our forces, and the Japanese forces in western and even northern Shanxi suffered particularly heavy blows. In Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, and along the Longhai Railway, new progress has also been made under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army. For example, an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th stated, "Our army of 70,000 is besieging Xuzhou, and part of it has broken into the city. The Eighth Route Army has also reoccupied Shijiazhuang." In addition, Ningjin, Qingyun, Hejian, Xinhua, Renqiu, Cangshan, Nangong in Hebei; Tongxu, Guanchang, Kequan in Henan; and Sishui, Xintai, Changyi, Feixian in Shandong have all been successively recovered. The Beiping-Suiyuan, Beiping-Hankou, Beiping-Tianjin, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways have all been reported to be cut off. Major victories have also been achieved in various regions of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang this week. In eastern Anhui and northern Hubei, our army captured Yuwang Temple, pressed Huang'an, occupied Jiuliguan, and pressed Hefei. The Japanese forces in central Hubei are also unable to act due to our counter-offensive. The counter-offensive in northern Jiangsu began with a major battle at Huai'an and Huaibei on the 15th. On the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, our army also launched surprise attacks while the enemy was redeploying to cope with our counter-offensives on various fronts, achieving considerable gains. In addition, our air force has been cooperating with counter-offensives on various fronts in recent days, inflicting heavy blows on enemy positions, enemy troops, enemy warships, and enemy airfields in the vicinity of Taiyuan in Shanxi, in northern Jiangxi, Gan River, Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, in the vicinity of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, and in Baiyun Mountain in Guangdong!

Under the comprehensive implementation of our new strategy, the Japanese have fallen into a passive position and suffered great losses. Although their main force is still moving towards Hunan Province, attempting to seize Changsha and control the Yuehan Railway, and at the same time are stirring along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, in the Chaozhou-Shantou area, and in the southern route, they have strategically lost the initiative to win. They have had to consider our new strategy in determining their military deployments, and even these deployments have been met with the strikes of our counter-offensive.

The "Manchester Guardian" editorial on the 21st was correct in saying: "China's belief in the War of Resistance is becoming stronger day by day, and its strength is increasing. And currently, even the most optimistic military leaders in Japan cannot foresee the end of the war!"

(4) Expansion of the Anti-Wang × Movement

Under such an international situation that is advantageous to us and disadvantageous to the enemy, and under such a war situation, to advocate using "anti-communism" to divide domestic unity, using "peace" to stop the War of Resistance and nation-building, and using responding to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's declaration to destroy China to implement peace talks and surrender to Japan, it is of course not surprising that they are opposed and hated by the entire Chinese populace.

The important speech delivered by the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to Chinese and foreign journalists in Chongqing on the 17th, was another reiteration of the public will of the entire Chinese people. He once again declared that "the purpose of China's War of Resistance is to defend the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. As long as this goal is not achieved, our struggle will not stop for a single day." "There is absolutely no room for peace talks, and absolutely no cunning, hypocritical, or surrendering theories can shake the determination of our entire nation in the slightest!" He further addressed the "anti-communist peace" movement advocated and promoted by Wang Jingwei and his cohorts who had been bought off by the Japanese, and loudly denounced them, saying: "Some people argue that Konoe's declaration is not a condition for the destruction of China, and think that it is still possible to make peace. What is this if not seeking surrender and selling out the nation? Frankly speaking, such people not only do not hesitate to regard themselves as traitors, but are simply willing to be slaves of Japan!"

After the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, once again designated the anti-communist peace movement of Wang Jingwei and his group as a traitorous act of seeking surrender and selling out the nation, and as an act of being slaves of Japan, the anti-Wang movement of all Chinese people in China and overseas has unfolded like a raging torrent. All Chinese generals and frontline soldiers had long denounced Wang Jingwei and his cohorts, and now reiterate their views. In Guilin, Shanghai, and other places, all parties, groups, newspapers, schools, and people from all walks of life are indignantly demanding severe punishment for Wang Jingwei and his cohorts. Overseas Chinese in various places are not willing to lag behind. Apart from those that cannot be published, Mr. Chen Jiageng of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese has already sent a letter on behalf of eight million overseas Chinese, first requesting the central government to severely punish Wang ×; Overseas Chinese in the Philippines have also launched a rally to oppose the × country × Wang Jingwei; In addition, one hundred and fifteen trade associations in Shanghai have jointly telegraphed the central government to express their hatred for Wang and other × country activities. The Central News Agency has also, starting today (23rd), stopped sending telegrams to the Nanhua Daily, which Wang Jingwei runs in Hong Kong. The angry tide of anti-Wang sentiments across the country and among overseas Chinese has surged up.

Currently, opposing Wang is one of the practical tasks of raising national self-esteem and self-confidence to implement a spiritual mobilization. It is one of the practical tasks of preserving the personality of the Chinese people and enhancing the international status of the Chinese nation. It is also one of the practical tasks of mobilizing national strength and promoting the Far Eastern anti-aggression front to achieve victory in the War of Resistance and nation-building. Every compatriot with backbone, who values personality, and loves the motherland must take opposing Wang and opposing the anti-communist and equal ×× rhetoric ×× behavior promoted by Wang and others as the practical work of saving oneself and saving the country at present.

We have repeatedly pointed out that the anti-communist peace promoted by Wang and others in accordance with the will of the × people has no future. Now that the conspiracy of anti-communist peace has been frustrated again, they can only openly become traitors and slaves of Japan! For days, news has been carried that Wang Jingwei has secretly arrived in Shanghai, and it is also rumored in Shanghai that former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and others have also arrived in Shanghai to organize a puppet central government. This will not just be a rumor, and their future conspiratorial activities will surely have even more vicious performances. We must remain vigilant: "Letting go of the × people is tantamount to killing ourselves!"

(5) Progress in Chinese Politics

Along with the new military victories, along with the angry tide against Wang × and against anti-communist and equal traitorous words and deeds, China must obtain more glorious victories and successes from greater political progress, and make even more glorious and greater efforts for the cause of world democracy and peace.

The establishment or preparation for the establishment of temporary councils in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and even in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan is a signal of China's future political progress. This week, we have also seen plans to improve party affairs and reform people's movements in Zhejiang Province and Guangdong Province, and policies to intensify the mobilization of the people's strength for the War of Resistance. We have also seen an outline of the administrative plan for Guangdong Province in the 28th year, which particularly emphasizes promoting local autonomy and establishing the foundation of democratic politics. I have also seen the joint order from the military, political, internal affairs, and education departments regarding the nationwide salute to wounded soldiers; and we have further seen the promulgation of the regulations on construction public bonds and military supplies public bonds, which are necessary to promote the great cause of the War of Resistance and nation-building. In particular, we have also seen the enthusiastic response of various regions across the country and overseas Chinese communities to the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. However, for all of these to achieve complete success, the most important prerequisite is only to coordinate with the greater political progress in the international situation and the war situation, the necessary improvement of the people's livelihood during wartime, and the necessary implementation of democratic politics during wartime. We must use greater political progress to welcome the implementation of the general counter-offensive and the arrival of the final victory in the future. The Central News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 20th conveyed the genuine expectations of international figures for China, saying: "International figures in Geneva are increasingly hopeful about our country, and hope that China can strengthen its democratic forces, so that the strength of totalitarian countries can be balanced in the future." And the Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th conveyed "the Chinese Communist Party reiterated its basic policies: (1) cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan, to build an independent, free, and happy China; (2) obtaining the cooperation of countries that sympathize with China, especially obtaining the cooperation of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France." This is not only of extremely important significance for China's War of Resistance and nation-building today, but also for the anti-aggression movement worldwide.

### Zhejiang · Unveiling the Curtain of Political Offensive: The Process and Gains of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Conference (Part 1)

— Fen

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to intensify the political offensive in the guerrilla areas and combat the political aggression of the puppet regime, needs a concrete and proactive plan under the correct policy to grasp the center of the War of Resistance and strive for final victory. Therefore, an administrative conference was convened at the location of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office. This administrative conference is of great historical significance not only in Zhejiang but also in the entire country. If the establishment of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office was the front-line command organ for implementing the political offensive policy, responsible for strengthening the political power in the guerrilla areas, implementing the political offensive, and strengthening the anti-Japanese work in the adjacent areas to ensure the safety of the political offensive, then the administrative conference convened this time is a movement to complete the mission of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office and launch the political offensive. It will lay the foundation for the War of Resistance in Western Zhejiang, lead the military counter-offensive in the Southeast Theater, and play a leading and exemplary role in the strategic offensive of the second phase of the War of Resistance nationwide.

Because this conference had such great significance, it was prepared for more than a month in advance. It was originally scheduled to hold a party, government, and military symposium immediately after the conference, so in addition to the commissioners and county magistrates of Western Zhejiang, there were also party headquarters, anti-Japanese defense committees, and military leaders from various counties. Also, because the opening date of the conference was originally set for March 10th, most of the attendees arrived before the 10th. Those days were filled with continuous spring rain and muddy roads, which was really hard for the gentlemen who came to the meeting. Not only were they covered in mud, but the problem of accommodation could not be solved after they arrived. All the hotel rooms were full four days in advance. Later arrivals were so anxious that they could only ask the conference secretariat for help. As a result, some borrowed dormitories from schools, and students lent fifty quilts to keep warm. Everyone made do as students in the upper and lower bunk dormitories. The hard bunks and thin quilts were not a big deal for the first couple of days, but later when the weather turned cold, they couldn't sleep at night due to the cold. They still had to attend meetings during the day, but everyone was excited and full of hard work.

The convener of the conference, Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was unable to arrive on the originally scheduled opening day due to the long distance, so the 10th and 11th were changed to group reviews and preparatory meetings. The first group reviewed proposals related to civil affairs, finance, and construction; the second group reviewed military proposals; and the third group reviewed proposals related to mass organization and training, education, and culture. On the 12th, rumors spread that the chairman was about to arrive, and the welcoming staff gathered and set off at 10:20 AM. A sudden air raid alarm gave people a strong stimulus. As a result, the enemy plane did not come to participate in the welcome, but the chairman arrived from the rear in the middle of the day amidst everyone's anticipation. In the evening, the wartime staff training class and the Second Political Work Brigade directly under the Zhejiang Provincial Government held a grand recreational performance to welcome Chairman Huang and the attendees.

The official opening of the conference was on the 13th. On this day, an expanded memorial week and opening ceremony were held at 8:00 AM. All schools and institutions near the administrative office participated, and Chairman Huang personally delivered the opening speech, explaining the mission of the administrative office and the important tasks of the administrative conference. The main points can be summarized as follows: A, The mission of establishing the administrative office: (1) To be the front-line command organ for political offensives, (2) To be the pioneer in strengthening the political power in guerrilla war zones and implementing political offensives, (3) To strengthen various anti-Japanese war efforts in areas close to the occupied areas to ensure the safety of political offensives.

Every word was cautionary, and he spoke for two or three hours.

On the 13th and 14th, the conference listened to reports from various units, and the weather was slightly clear. The atmosphere in the spring chill conference hall was lively and tense, giving people infinite excitement. The reports from various units were concise and detailed.

The formal discussion of the conference was supposed to be held on the 15th, but because the previous review of proposals was not completed, Chairman Huang instructed that the key points should be discussed and the review should continue. Thus, the 15th was spent in small group discussions again. In the evening, Chairman Huang hosted a dinner, and of course, everyone was very enthusiastic to attend. There was no wine on the table, and the dishes were not abundant, but the entire venue was filled with everyone's excited emotions. The attendees wore red and yellow symbols, which looked interesting and fluttering under the gas lamps. During the dinner, the host spoke, first repeatedly explaining the precious opportunity of this gathering, and then pointing out that what supported the national War of Resistance and national construction after the "September 18th Incident" was the "Lushan Spirit", and hoping to use the "Tianmu Spirit" to support the political offensive in the Southeast. Finally, he recited his own poem "Feeling of Westward Tour of Tianmu Mountain (Man Jiang Hong)". The meaning of the poem is: (To be continued)

### The Death of a Peasant Soldier

— By Agnes Smedley, translated by Jiancun of the News Agency

This article was recently sent to Mrs. Situ Yongjue, Director of the Hong Kong Health Bureau, by Miss Agnes Smedley, who is full of justice. She asked the Western doctors living in comfort to temporarily put aside their happiness and rush to the front line to treat the countless wounded soldiers who are fighting for the country and the nation. ——Translator.

Today I saw the death of a Chinese peasant soldier. In China, there are more than a million soldiers who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered country and have dedicated themselves to justice. This peasant is one of them. This person's death is not of world importance. He did not leave unfinished work that others could not do. When he died, he did not have any last words or exhortations to the country, family, or friends. He just quietly closed his eyes. Even the wounded soldiers next to his bed hardly knew that he had died.

This man was about forty years old and was a voluntary soldier in the New Fourth Army. He was a farmer, and his body was very thin due to prolonged hunger. His face was dark, and two of his front teeth were missing. This was purchased by another wounded soldier. He and his comrade attacked the Japanese army's position together. They did not know they were injured at the time. Later, after the battle was over, they returned to headquarters and felt that they could not move. Both of them had a foot pierced by bamboo nails tied on the Japanese army's defense line.

This peasant soldier lay silently in bed and only said once that his surname was Hu and that he was a farmer. Every line on his face and body symbolized his pain. He seemed to be constantly thinking about something.

The doctor said at night, "He can't live anymore. He's too malnourished and has no resistance at all. It's too late to give him nourishment." At noon on the third day, he passed away peacefully.

He was about forty years old. The New Fourth Army rarely recruited old soldiers. People of this age have to support their families, and the army can recruit young people every year. Moreover, the New Fourth Army does not use conscription. They are all voluntary soldiers who voluntarily join the army. Therefore, it is certain that this person volunteered. Is he a farmer who has already lost his family and been destroyed? Has his village been leveled by the enemy? It must be.

The place where he fought has been abandoned and uninhabited by the enemy. According to people in the same team, he had only recently joined. He had obviously been hungry for a long time. His silence, his hard face, and the concern that radiated from his eyes all indicated that he had lived in suffering for a long time, which cannot be described in words.

I have continuously visited the hospital where this deceased soldier lived, and I have also mourned him and the graves of many other soldiers. I think it is easy for a person to embark on a journey with the farewell of family, friends, or a crowd of people cheering and applauding. It is also not difficult to go to justice with glory and light, knowing that the country will remember the merits in the future, and my death will be an example for the people of the country. But the death of this soldier surnamed Hu, like the deaths of millions of others like him, is dark. No one shed tears for them. Mourn for them. In the future free society of China, they will have no part—did they consider these things when they picked up their guns?

His death is ugly—but also beautiful—the Chinese people, their country has given them nothing but sorrow and hunger. But they can still dedicate their lives to the country.

Thousands die on the desolate battlefield, and thousands of wounded people stumble and stagger, staring at their wounds, looking towards the mountain roads or plains highways, hoping that someone will come to rescue them. Some who cannot support themselves fall under the leafless trees and rest forever. Those who are finally taken in and given some care are already very lucky!

Chinese Western doctors and foreign Western doctors—these people are dying for them, turning their lives into cultural struggles, can you sleep peacefully at night? Are you not disturbed by nightmares? Don't you blush with shame when you look in the mirror? If these people are defeated, are you not afraid for yourself and your descendants? You sit in the city, using your intelligence to make money. I want to ask you: Try to compare your lives with this nameless soldier surnamed Hu and millions of others like him—I am now appealing to you: Please put down your caresses temporarily and go to the front lines of China, where you can deal with various problems, various difficulties, and various heartbreaking matters, fight for justice, and take care of the strong men who die for your son and your country, and do not leave a shameful sign in history!

### Northeast Henan Counter-Offensive Proceeds Smoothly: Three Attacks on Kaifeng are Victorious; The Enemy Greatly Reinforces Kaifeng and Taiyuan; Our Army Takes the Initiative in the Hubei Battle

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 22nd] Our army in eastern Henan launched a third attack on Kaifeng at 2:00 AM on the 20th. Although the enemy was heavily guarded, they were unable to stop our army's brave advance. After our fierce attack, they once broke into the city. The enemy's puppet organs and warehouses were all set ablaze by our army. On the same day, by dawn, our army, having achieved its goal of destruction, safely withdrew.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] The enemy commander in North China recently ordered the Pinghan and Zhengtai railways to suspend passenger transport for three weeks. During this period, they will transport batches of enemy puppet troops transferred from the three northeastern provinces to reinforce Kaifeng and Taiyuan, respectively. This proves that since our army began its counter-offensive in Henan and Shanxi, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, and they have had to transfer reinforcements from the northeast.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] Starting on the 18th, the county magistrates of various counties in eastern Henan led local teams, in coordination with the guerrilla units, to simultaneously attack the enemy in Suixian, Qixian, Tongxu, Chenliu, Minquan, Kaocheng, and Lanfeng counties, and to destroy transportation. According to intelligence received from various counties here, fierce battles have broken out near various counties. Because the teams are familiar with the terrain, the counter-offensive is progressing smoothly.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] There are about a thousand enemies near Shiyi Town, northwest of Qixian in northern Henan. Our army launched an attack on the 17th, taking advantage of their lack of vigilance, and besieged them on all sides. After four or five hours of fierce fighting, more than two hundred enemies were killed. The remaining enemies could not hold on and fled towards the Xiaodian River (north of Jixian). We are now pursuing them.

[Central News Agency, Yicheng, 22nd] (1) In the Yingshan area, our attacking troops destroyed the Tianmen-Zaoshi highway on the morning of the 20th, and ambushed on both sides of the Ying River. More than 300 enemies passed through the river from Zaoshi in the evening. We launched a surprise attack and engaged the enemy in a fierce battle for two hours, killing two enemy officers and eleven soldiers, and capturing seven boxes of ammunition, more than two thousand cans, and many other military supplies.

[Central News Agency, Shashi, 21st] The enemy on the east bank of the Xiang River occasionally shells our positions and fires randomly with machine guns to prevent our attacks. Yuekou's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Tianmen for days, Tianmen's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Zaoshi, and Zaoshi's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Yingcheng, appearing to be retreating in general. According to a certain commander, we have the initiative in the Hubei battle, while the enemy is in a passive position. In the past week, the enemy's casualties in various battles have been over two thousand, and we have seized countless spoils of war. The enemy regards the Xiang River as the gate to Wuhan and is struggling to defend it. Recently, they have added nearly three thousand reinforcements along the river. In order to maintain the plan to fight the enemy decisively on the east bank of the Xiang River, we have also increased the number of elite troops to hold the line. There will be new progress soon.

### He Long's Wife Released from Prison: Shanghai Court Finds Communist Party Member Not Guilty

(Shanghai Correspondent) Xiong Youwu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xiang Shi (alias Wang Xiangshi), the wife of Eighth Route Army leader General He Long, and He's younger brother Gan Chen, (alias Wang Wenming), were arrested by the Shanghai French Concession Police in 1933 and prosecuted by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for endangering the Republic of China. In this case, all the defendants were originally sentenced. Xiong Youwu was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed to the Supreme Court because he did not accept the judgment. He Long's wife Xiang Shi was sentenced to five years in prison and has now been released after serving her sentence. However, He's younger brother Gan Chen died in prison due to illness. During the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, Xiong Fenglun handed in a document. Regarding Xiong's case of endangering the Republic of China, the Supreme Court later sent it back to the Third Branch of the Higher Court for a new trial. The Third Branch of the Higher Court followed the order and summoned him several times, but he did not appear and his whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, the court legally served a public notice on the 11th of this month, and the case was heard by Judge Wu Tingqi, the chief of the criminal court, accompanied by Judges Wang and Chen. Xiong did not appear. At that time, Judge Wu appointed a pro bono lawyer for the defendant Xiong Youwu and defended him based on the three reasons given by the Supreme Court for sending the case back. He then announced the conclusion of the trial. Because the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China has been revised, there are no provisions for punishing Xiong's behavior. Therefore, Judge Wu took his seat in the Third Court at about 2:00 PM on the 14th and announced the main text of the judgment, that Xiong Youwu was acquitted of the charge of endangering the Republic of China.

### Front Line, Rear Area, Home and Abroad, Unanimously Demand Severe Punishment for Wang Jingwei: Shanghai City News Employees Declare Condemnation of Wang; Central News Agency Stops Supplying News to South China Daily

[Chongqing, 22nd] The anti-Wang movement in various circles here is now in full swing. Newspapers and periodicals carry airmail letters and telegrams sent from home and abroad and from the front lines, unanimously requesting the government to severely punish Wang Jingwei and others, thoroughly eliminate compromising and enemy-collaborating elements, and demand the elimination of all pro-peace newspapers and publications that violate the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. The anti-Wang and anti-traitor movement has a feeling of being in full swing. Also, according to Yu Dian, the head office of the Central News Agency here has telegraphed the Hong Kong branch to stop supplying news to the Hong Kong traitorous newspaper, South China Daily. Also, according to the news, the 21st was the Shanghai Spiritual Mobilization Cultural Circle Propaganda Day. News employees from all over the city issued a joint declaration, denouncing the fallacies and reckless actions of traitors, and calling on citizens to block all activities of Wang and his party members.

[Chongqing, 21st] The 115 trade associations in Shanghai once submitted a telegram to the central government, the original text of which reads: All Shanghai businessmen have a firm and unwavering belief in the established national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and will never be tempted by their heretical sayings and false deeds. Because there are rumors that Wang and his party members have secretly come to Shanghai to prepare to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization, Shanghai businessmen have heard the news and hate them to the core. Therefore, they send a joint telegram to express their intentions and beg for your approval. Shanghai Four Yan Trade Association, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Association, Shanghai Department Store Trade Association and other 25 trade associations bow their heads.

### Counterfeit Currency Prices Plunge: The Enemy Puppet Regime is Extremely Panic-Stricken

[Reuters, Beiping, 22nd] The exchange rate of counterfeit currency issued by the "United Reserve Bank" suddenly plummeted, and the local Japanese puppet regime felt quite uneasy. Previously, the value of national currency was often around 108 yuan of counterfeit currency per 100 yuan. Since the 15th of this month, it suddenly rose, and on April 19th, it once rose to 122 yuan per 100 yuan. After that, it shrank slightly, but it is still around 117 yuan. There are two reasons for the sharp decline in the value of counterfeit currency: (1) The "Reserve Bank's" plan to sell foreign exchange at a fixed price of 14 pence failed, (2) All sectors need national currency, and those who want to buy foreign exchange from foreign banks must buy it with national currency.

### Spiritual Mobilization: Qinghai Enthusiastically Promotes; People's Teams in Northwest Taikang, East Henan, Bravely Kill the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Ma Bufang, Chairman of the Qinghai Mobilization Committee, recently telegraphed President Jiang of the General Association, reporting that Qinghai Province has followed the program and held a general mobilization meeting of people from all walks of life, and held official oaths for civil servants and citizens in the provincial capital, with more than 40,000 participants. The situation was extremely exciting. President Jiang immediately replied to Chairman Ma, hoping to promote it and encourage morale. Also, according to Luoyang Dian, more than a hundred enemies entrenched in Fule City, west of Taiyuan, were surrounded by our local people's team a few days ago. The team was angry at the enemy's cruelty and took the initiative to attack, so they were doubly brave. After a fierce battle, one-third of the enemy was killed and they fled to Taikang.

### China's Voroshilov: General Shide

— By F. Stakhov of the Soviet News Agency (Special Feature of This Newspaper)

A tenant farmer was born in Ma'an Village, Yilong County, Sichuan Province in 1886.

Many years later, under the oppression of landlords, the tenant farmer's family was scattered due to economic difficulties.

It was not until the tide of the anti-dictatorship revolution in China surged in 1907 that the tenant farmer had an opportunity to go to Yunnan and enter the military academy at that time, the Yunnan Military Academy.

Today, this tenant farmer is the famous commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, leading more than 100,000 strong soldiers in North China to block the advance of the Japanese invading army.

This person is Zhu De.

After the Great Revolution of 1927, the Communist Party of China was officially established, and Zhu De was one of the leading comrades of this party. At that time, he led his troops, and because of the superiority of the organization, they were like a "crane standing out from the flock" among the various armies in South China. But at that time, no one thought that there was a revolutionary organization in his troops, and it was led by their commander Zhu De himself.

According to the Communist Party's opinion, Zhu De once left his motherland. He spent several years studying foreign languages and military science in Europe. He could speak several languages fluently, including French, Russian, German, and English. And he devoted himself to studying the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Later, when he returned to his motherland, he once said to his comrades who were close to him: "Now I have learned new knowledge, and I will dedicate it all to our revolutionary cause."

At that time, China's Communist Party sent him to the South China region. Fan Shisheng, the famous Yunnan warlord at the time, immediately appointed him as his staff officer. Fan Shisheng was trying to rule South China, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and become the "master of the Southern Kingdom," with Zhu De as his leader in military command.

Zhu De seemed to agree to his plan, but he never abandoned his plan to organize and prepare for the first revolutionary ambition. Later, Zhu De finally led his elite troops and set off to Jiangxi. In April 1928, the first "historical meeting" between Zhu De and the heroic Mao Zedong was held—

Mao Zedong led his guerrilla team composed of miners and ordinary workers from Hunan, and hired peasants and poor peasants from Jiangxi to Jinggang, and peasant and worker guerrillas from surrounding provinces rushed like water!

These revolutionary soldiers began to fight for their beliefs with sticks, hoes, and bayonets. At this time, the famous Red Army Fourth Army was formed there. The Central Committee of the Communist Party appointed Zhu De as the commander-in-chief of this army, and Mao Zedong as the political commissar.

Since then, "Zhu Mao" has become a special term in all Chinese newspapers, but the troops under their leadership have never suffered a serious defeat.

When his troops rested during marches, Zhu De himself would sit among those tired soldiers and tell them about the history of the places they passed through and the general social conditions. During the march, he slept with the soldiers in the same camp or trench. In his spare time, he lectured his subordinates on strategy and tactics. They also discussed the experiences of the Soviet Russian revolution and civil war at any time. His heavy and loud voice was familiar to his subordinates and the Chinese revolutionary masses.

After a period of civil war history, today, Zhu De and his loyal companions are carrying out the great task of fighting for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the people behind the Japanese army in North China. The Red Army—that is, the current Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army—although they have suffered great casualties and losses in the cruel struggle of the past year and a half, there are still more than 100,000 fighters who are accustomed to fighting, and their ranks are growing and strengthening day by day!—It is the soundest army in the Chinese Anti-Japanese Army.

Zhu De is one of the true national heroes among the Chinese masses. Like Voroshilov's efforts for the Soviet revolution, he is known in the ranks as China's Voroshilov.

### Anti-Aggression Negotiations Making Satisfactory Progress; Britain and France Studying Soviet Proposals; US Approves Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] The international situation is tense on the surface but strained within. Diplomatic activities continue behind the scenes. The proposals submitted by Soviet Russia to Britain and France are currently under careful study. French Foreign Minister Bonnet reported to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today that Franco-Soviet negotiations are proceeding actively, and the government hopes to achieve satisfactory results in the shortest possible time. Franco-Turkish negotiations are proceeding simultaneously with Anglo-Turkish negotiations. Discussions on security issues have been satisfactory, which is a good omen. Complete agreement has been reached on the Sanjak of Alexandretta issue. There were previous concerns that Turkey might forcibly occupy the Sanjak, but Turkey has now assured France that no such action will occur.

[Associated Press, London, 11th] According to reliable sources here, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov has notified the British side, suggesting that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union send representatives to hold negotiations to discuss taking concrete steps to assist victims of aggression. It is reported that Litvinov also pointed out that the representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should accurately determine the aid capabilities that each country can allocate.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Correspondents stationed in Paris for the "Daily News" and the "Daily Express" both stated that the Soviet Union's proposals regarding an anti-aggression front mentioned the Far East issue. The "Daily News" correspondent in Paris stated, "The Soviet Union's proposal includes a system of mutual guarantees to resist aggression, not limited to Europe, but also extending to Asia." The "Daily Express" correspondent in Paris stated, "I understand that the Soviet Union's counter-proposal indicates that if the Soviet Union fulfills its obligations in Eastern Europe and is attacked by Japan, it will require assistance from other countries." Furthermore, the diplomatic correspondent for the "Times" expressed opinions on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations that were similar to the general views in London, but specifically pointed out, "The Soviet Union's proposal has far-reaching and constructive insights, and it makes a significant contribution to expanding the principle of jointly resisting aggression."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky arrived in Moscow yesterday afternoon and immediately reported to the government on the British position regarding the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Seeds visited Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov again yesterday. According to information from here, although neither side has announced the details of the Soviet-British talks, the talks are indeed progressing satisfactorily.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, diplomatic figures here stated that the Soviet government submitted a counter-proposal on the 18th of this month, the content of which is a beneficial basis for negotiations and can prove the country's sincerity in cooperation. The two sides are continuing negotiations, hoping to create a compromise between the British original proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal so that achievements can be made before the 28th of this month (the date of Hitler's speech).

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are paying close attention to reports of an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. They clearly approve of this move, but US-Soviet relations may not be strengthened. This is because the authorities here believe that the United States becoming particularly friendly with the Soviet Union will prompt Japan to strengthen its relations with Germany and Italy, and a conflict may increase in the Pacific.

### France Prepares for Wartime; Cabinet Approves Increased Military Spending; Will Formulate Laws to Limit Income Tax; Finance Minister Calls on People to Return to Work Tightly

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The French cabinet held a meeting tonight that lasted for two and a half hours and passed the following resolutions: (1) Increase funding for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Colonial Departments; (2) Expedite the payment of various expenses, especially those related to national defense; (3) Regarding various issues of wartime organization and supply. The second category of resolutions includes cases of direct management of finances, such as preventing tax loopholes, limiting the profits obtained by various factories and commercial organizations from manufacturing national defense goods, and levying certain income taxes that are not yet stipulated.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] A method of levying income tax totaling 170 million francs will be proposed at tonight's cabinet meeting. The meeting will decide to limit the profits obtained by factories and commercial organizations engaged in national defense affairs. The working hours of all public institutions and factories manufacturing national defense goods will also be stipulated by laws formulated at the meeting.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech to the nation today, calling on the people to make greater sacrifices to cope with the new situation. Reynaud said, "We have recently realized the greatness of France's efforts for the international community. Without France, what could Britain do? What could even the great United States do? The policy of isolationism has come to an end. Today, peace can only be restored by restoring the balance of power among European powers." The government has temporarily decided to increase normal working hours to 45 hours per week. Those who work overtime will be compensated. The national defense laws passed today include measures to resolve the issue of arms dealer profits. The state will levy taxes of 58% to 100% on these profits.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 21st] Three French cruisers and five destroyers departed eastward from here today. Eight French ships are still stationed here.

### Improve Armaments; Roosevelt Asks Congress for Another $6 Million

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Roosevelt sent a letter to the Speaker of the House yesterday, requesting Congress to allocate $6 million for defense expenses, stating that the funds are intended to be used to improve naval equipment and add machinery. In addition, a squadron of US battleships has arrived at Guantanamo Bay (Cuba) from various South American ports. It is reported that they will stay there briefly before heading to the Pacific.

US Monetary System Law Extended for Two Years

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] The House of Representatives passed a bill today to extend the authorization for the President to devalue the dollar and the Treasury Department to consolidate the value of the fund (including the authorization to subsidize new silver (item)) for two years. The Republican Party had proposed an objection, which was ultimately rejected by a vote of 225 to 158, and the extension bill was passed.

### Britain Announces Reinforcement of African Rifle Brigade

[Reuters, Dar es Salaam, 22nd] The Central Government has recently announced the reinforcement of the 6th Battalion of the Royal African Rifles, stationed at the important military stronghold of Tanga, to strengthen the defense of Tanganyika.

### Observers Predict Roosevelt May Run for Re-election

[Washington, 21st] Observers say that based on recent developments, Roosevelt may have hopes of being re-elected for a third term in 1940: (1) After Mr. White gave a speech on the "Pan-American Governing Committee," it is generally believed that the situation in South America is critical, so it is necessary for Roosevelt to be re-elected to make full use of his experience. (2) Roosevelt's new policies have not yet been fully implemented. (3) The world situation is tense, and a major war may be inevitable. Roosevelt must remain in the White House to cope with it. Note: Roosevelt has been re-elected for two terms. According to American practice, no president has been re-elected for three terms. If the observer's view is realized, then President Roosevelt will create a new record in history.

### French Foreign Ministry Denies Talk of Franco-Italian Negotiations

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] According to a report in London's "Standard Evening News," French Foreign Minister Bonnet has begun negotiations with Italy, which are proceeding satisfactorily. The French Foreign Ministry has denied this report.

### Germany Again Propagandizes that Poland is Anti-German, Saying Serious Consequences Have Occurred

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The German news agency has recently listed many new incidents of abuse of Germans in Poland, saying that according to reports from the Oliewitz area, the Polish Western League is fiercely anti-German, and serious consequences have now begun to occur. So far, the steps taken by the Polish authorities are inappropriate.

### Axis Powers Actively Threatening and Enticing Both Balkan Nations, Seeking to Undermine Balkan Entente; Italian and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Will Visit Berlin

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 22nd] Sources well-informed here say that the German Foreign Ministry has been very active recently, and foreign ministers from three countries will arrive in Berlin one after another soon. The first will be Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković, who will stay in Berlin from the 25th to the 26th of this month. The second will be Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky, but the exact date of their arrival in Germany is not yet known. Finally, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also arrive in Berlin at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. According to reports in foreign newspapers, the German government has asked the countries listed in President Roosevelt's telegram whether they feel threatened by Germany. This report has not been confirmed or denied.

Bulgaria Demands High Price

[Associated Press, London, 21st] According to political circles here, the Axis powers are currently exerting their pressure on Bulgaria. Turkey is currently working for the British and French groups, and the Balkan Little Entente is also trying its best to pull Bulgaria into the anti-aggression group. However, Germany and Italy will use the restoration of lost territories before the 1913 Balkan War and World War as bait to make Bulgaria join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Bulgaria is raising its price at this critical juncture, simultaneously contacting both sides to demand the highest price. If the benefits given to Bulgaria by Germany and Italy are realized, in other words, Romania must cede about 3,000 square miles in the south, Greece about 3,000 square miles in the east, and Yugoslavia about 1,000 square miles in the west for their return to Bulgaria. General observations in London believe that Bulgaria's desires are not great, so even if it is given less than the above, it will satisfy its demands.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 21st] Well-informed sources here recently declared that Italy is currently working hard to establish close cooperative relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary. Whether or not this can succeed depends on whether Yugoslavia and Hungary can reconcile. Foreign Minister Ciano will go to the port of Venice tomorrow to hold talks with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, advising the country to join hands with Hungary. Hungary has agreed to give up its territorial demands on Yugoslavia after being persuaded by Italy, so the estrangement between Yugoslavia and Hungary has disappeared. If Italy can obtain close cooperation between Yugoslavia and Hungary, then the country's plan to organize an alliance in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula (including Bulgaria) will be easier to realize. In addition, it is also reported that the two foreign ministers must also discuss the two issues of Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and withdrawing from the League of Nations. In short, Foreign Minister Ciano is currently making every effort to persuade Yugoslavia to truly join the German and Italian groups. If this can be done, then the Danube Alliance under Italian leadership will not only have a great impact on Turkey, Greece, and Romania, but also fundamentally undermine the Balkan Entente.

Italian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

[Reuters, Rome, 21st] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will begin a two-day meeting in Venice tomorrow. This is undoubtedly further evidence of Italy's determination to support its political, strategic, and economic position. In addition to doing its utmost to make Yugoslavia deeply believe in its sincere assistance, Italy especially hopes that Yugoslavia's political disputes will not give other countries the opportunity to interfere and forcibly provide "protection." Regarding this point, Italy is concerned about more than just Britain and France. Strategically, Italy's greatest concern is the Adriatic Sea, and it has carefully considered the dispute between the Yugoslav capital and the Croatian people over the entire Dalmatian coast. As for economic matters, it is reported that Yugoslavia is very welcome that Italy can grant it trade loans. If a satisfactory agreement can be concluded, Yugoslavia will be able to obtain a free trade zone in the port of Trieste.

[Reuters, Yugoslav Capital, 21st] According to authoritative sources here, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister will go to Berlin on May 3. It is said that this trip is at the invitation of the German side. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to depart for Venice tonight to hold talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. At that time, they will discuss the existing treaties between the two countries and issues of common interest.

Italy Will Force Yugoslavia to Join the Axis

[Associated Press, Rome, 21st] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will participate in the Rome-Berlin meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice tomorrow afternoon, so Yugoslavia's adherence to the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Rome-Berlin Axis seems inevitable. Ciano carries Hungary's promise to Yugoslavia to sign a non-aggression pact, but it must be conditional on Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern group. According to reports from Budapest, Yugoslavia will accept this condition when the Italian and Yugoslav foreign ministers have completed their negotiations. If this matter is realized, then Yugoslavia will abandon its intermediate position between the democratic countries and the Axis powers and formally join the totalitarian group.

### Fishing Boat Mistaken for Submarine; Canadian Authorities Issue Clarification

[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 22nd] Regarding the discovery of a submarine of unknown nationality in the sea off Halifax, Canada, it has now been verified that it was not a submarine, but a fishing boat. Prime Minister Mackenzie has reported the truth to the outside world yesterday. The authorities had previously dispatched warships to patrol near the port, but no traces of a submarine were found.

### Hitler Prepares to Respond to US Proposal; Poses Questions to Neighboring Small Countries for Answers; Attempts to Disrupt British and French Security Plans

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Roosevelt said at a press conference today that he had discussed the military aircraft of various countries with Colonel Lindbergh yesterday. The President did not comment on Mussolini's speech, only saying that he had not yet received a reply from Mussolini or Hitler.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] According to reliable sources here yesterday, Hitler is now "collecting materials" to prepare to respond to Roosevelt's proposal in his congressional speech on April 28. Hitler is now compiling two questions and asking neighboring small countries of Germany to answer. The two questions are (1) Are you afraid that Germany will infringe upon your country's independence or security? (2) Have you requested assistance from the United States or President Roosevelt? It is reported that Hitler has received answers from several countries, some of which said that they are not afraid and have not asked anyone for assistance. Hitler will use these materials to present counter-evidence, proving that Roosevelt's proposal is superfluous. Hitler's move is extremely cunning and can even disrupt the British and French security chain plan, because Hitler can say to the small countries, "Since you are not afraid of Germany, there is no reason to join the British and French encirclement policy."

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 22nd] German Ambassador Blow recently asked the foreign affairs authorities of this country, based on the telegram recently sent by US President Roosevelt, whether the country believes that its independence has been threatened by Germany. The reply stated that Belgium's neutral status will be automatically guaranteed by Britain, France, and Germany, and it does not believe that it is subject to any threat. Regarding this matter, the officialdom has not issued a public statement.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to a report from the "Daily News" correspondent in The Hague, the Dutch government has already replied to Hitler's question about whether Germany's attitude makes the Netherlands feel threatened. The Dutch government refuses to publish the reply, but it is learned that its general meaning indicates that although the Netherlands has not suffered direct threats from Germany in the past month, if the current tense situation cannot be eased, it is feared that war will inevitably occur in the future.

### Mussolini Sends Telegram to Congratulate Hitler on His Birthday

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] In a telegram celebrating Hitler's birthday, Mussolini said that the enemies of Germany and Italy will never be able to separate the unity of the Axis. "The Italian people participate in this axis with firm confidence and a spirit of friendship. This is also where the beliefs and revolutionary spirit of the two countries lie. The spirit of friendship between the two countries has been tested repeatedly without being damaged. One day, our enemies will realize that the paths taken by the Fascist and National Socialist parties are both based on justice and peace."

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] According to the decree promulgated today, all sixth-level people aged 33 and above must receive short-term military training, with a training period of four months.

### Madrid German Parade; Italian Newspaper Reports Extension to End of Month

[Associated Press, Madrid, 21st] General Franco's headquarters in Burgos issued a public statement saying that the official decision regarding the extension of the Madrid victory parade has not yet been made.

[Associated Press, Rome, 21st] The "Italian Daily" correspondent in Burgos said that General Franco's Madrid victory parade will not be held before May 30, so the date has been extended by another fifteen days compared to the original date (May 15). The reasons are not detailed.

### British Cabinet Discusses Conscription Issue; Ministers of Supply and Transport Will Both Obtain Seats in Cabinet Meeting

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to reliable sources, the issue of implementing mandatory conscription will be submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting to be held on the 24th of this month.

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] Official news, British Transport Minister Leslie Burgin has been appointed as Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet. Once the newly established Ministry of Supply has completed the legislative process, he will be formally appointed as Minister of Supply. Former Treasury Secretary Wallace has been transferred to Minister of Transport. Both of them can obtain seats in the cabinet meeting. Wallace's vacancy will be filled by Minister of Mines Crookshank, and Crookshank's vacancy will be filled by Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department Lowther. The latter two have no seats in the cabinet meeting.

### Ambassador Guo's Speech: Stop Japanese Aggression; All Countries Should Unanimously Boycott Japanese Goods; Our Resistance Strength is Growing Stronger

[Reuters, London, 21st] Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the Manchester Reform Association tonight that if Japan cuts off the supply of imports from all directions, it will not be able to continue to support the war for half a year. Therefore, if Western countries can unanimously boycott Japanese goods and not trade with them, the war can be ended. Japan's daring to make trouble in the Far East is actually caused by the connivance of the great powers. The hesitation and self-preservation of the great powers are Japan's only guarantee. Japan can be regarded as the world's largest liar, able to safely carry out its deception at a time when the world is in turmoil. China has been trying the policy of tolerance for more than six or seven years, and finally realized that this kind of enduring humiliation to seek survival is only enough to win the smile of tigers and wolves, and a policy of peace is suitable to increase the desire of aggressors. In the past twenty-one months, Japan's international status has dropped to a second-class country. On the contrary, China passed through difficulties in 1938, but this year, its position is stronger than before, whether in military, internal affairs, or diplomacy. Although China's coastal cities and towns have fallen, the authorities have formed a strong and self-sufficient country in the southwestern provinces.

Brief Commentary

### The Harvest of the National Christian University Conference

The National Christian University Education Conference was held in Hong Kong from the 17th of this month. This newspaper respectfully extended its congratulations and offered some encouragement in an editorial on the 19th. The conference closed yesterday morning on the 22nd. Summarizing the results of the six-day conference, 33 resolutions were passed, all of which are important cases for adapting the direction of Christian education during our national crisis. Generally speaking, they have not failed the expectations of all parties and can indeed be regarded as a great success of the conference. We should pay our respects to all the attendees.

The basic spirit of the various cases passed by this conference is, first, to cultivate the personality of Christianity. We believe that the most important aspect of the personality of Christianity is the spirit of struggle to sacrifice for the sake of defending truth and justice and saving human morality. This spirit is no different from the spirit of struggle of our Chinese nation today to resolutely resist Japan for the liberation of China and the salvation of world peace. Therefore, we dare to expect that the Christian education community can cooperate in improving the self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-confidence of the people in the future, and cooperate in the promotion of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The second is that education must be free, which of course refers to education in the areas occupied by × people. We hope that the Christian education community must abide by this resolution in the future and carry out a tenacious struggle against × people, traitors, puppets, and all evil forces in × people-occupied areas and other special environments, in order to complete the principles of educational freedom and educational dignity, and to continue to maintain education and never stop the education business. The third is loyalty to the country. This should be loyalty to the central government, adhering to the national policy of unity, adhering to the war of resistance, and building a national platform, and loyalty to the concrete decision of the supreme leader "to make the Three Principles of the People of the revolution the highest principle of education in the future." We further hope that the Christian education community will faithfully abide by this decision to cooperate in promoting war resistance education, building a new China, opposing fascist aggressors, and defending world peace and human culture.

In addition, the conference also specially decided to establish a Rural Construction Committee to promote production and construction, which is an urgent need in our country's current war of resistance and national construction. We sincerely hope that the Christian education community will truly and sincerely do its best to help the government cultivate this kind of talent and promote the cause of production and construction.

We express great satisfaction with this conference. Therefore, we have to have sincere expectations for the national Christian education community, and at the same time, we hope that it will make greater contributions to the cause of war resistance education, to the relief of unemployed youth in various places, to the elimination of widespread illiteracy, and to the assistance of all youth salvation education propaganda movements. We know that the resolutions of the conference and the implementation of this kind of assistance are extremely difficult. In addition to sincerely hoping that every Christian educator will display the Christian spirit of saving the world and the confidence that struggle will succeed, we dare to assert that the public opinion circles of the whole country and even the whole world will be your loyal supporters!

### European Absence of War

— Dong Ping

I.

In recent days, news from Europe has been filled with the heavy scent of gunpowder: "436 warships concentrated in the Mediterranean," "German and Italian troops massing on the Franco-Spanish border," "The situation in Gibraltar is critical," "Germany and Italy will attack Southeastern Europe," "Italy plots to establish a Macedonian protectorate." All of this has brought the world back to the eve of 1914, as if the European situation has reached its final critical point, and the outbreak of war is imminent.

Fear and panic fill every corner of the world; people are restless and insecure. Yet, many people are also wondering: Has the European situation really reached the final critical point? Will war really break out at any moment? We are among those who doubt. We doubt, and then we consider and analyze. Through consideration and analysis, we arrive at our conclusion: war will not break out. At least, we dare to assert that in this year, 1939, there will be no war in Europe.

Below, we would like to provide our reasons.

II.

We do not deny some undeniable facts. Such as: German young men and women are popularly drinking and saying: "Germany is ours now; soon, the world will be ours." Hitler said: "Our desire for colonies must be fulfilled." Italian people shouting: "Give me back Tunisia, march on Paris." Mussolini also said: "Our unfulfilled wishes will eventually be avenged."

Similarly, we have not ignored the possible consequences that these facts will bring about. However, we must say that what these facts express seems to be only the naked exposure of Germany and Italy's ambitions, and cannot be regarded as confessions that the Axis powers will take drastic actions in the short term.

We generally know that the Axis powers are not very "fond" of war. Their policy of aggression is not through force, but through "bluff"; not real war, but "the threat of war." The standard method of "the threat of war" is to station troops on the border, exert extreme coercion, seize the opportunity, and issue an ultimatum with lightning speed, leaving the other party at a loss and forcing them to concede and submit. The application of this method has been seen repeatedly. Especially Hitler's methods are clever, always successful, and always effective.

Although the aggressive arrogance of Germany and Italy is already very prominent, we believe that their aggressive actions are not 100% certain. Because, at least, they have to wait, hesitate, assess the situation, and seize the opportunity each time they act. This, we can see from the past history of aggression by Germany and Italy.

The cooperation between Germany and Italy is only four years old. In the autumn of 1935, Italy began its long-planned invasion of Abyssinia. Mussolini's luck was not very good. Under the resistance of the Abyssinian people, the opposition of Britain and France, and the sanctions of the League of Nations, Italy was miserably trapped in a situation of being attacked from all sides. At that time, the younger brother Hitler was still very weak and obviously could not help. But in the end, because of the lack of initiative and inconsistent steps of the democratic countries, Italy still annexed Abyssinia.

By March 1936, the Italian-Abyssinian war had reached its final stage, and when British and French diplomats were preparing to take a slight rest, Hitler seized the opportunity and launched his debut. He sent troops to the Rhineland and resolutely tore up the Locarno Treaty. Britain and France were caught off guard and suffered a silent loss, opening the door to great convenience for the future.

Soon, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Germany and Italy openly transferred troops and weapons, becoming the behind-the-scenes bosses of the Spanish war. Speaking of the Spanish affair, it was always a joint action of Germany and Italy, but in fact, it was Mussolini who was the mastermind. Unfortunately, Mussolini's luck was indeed not very good. The Spanish Civil War could not be resolved quickly and dragged on for thousands of days.

If we attribute the Spanish war to Mussolini, then in the early stage of the Spanish war, for almost more than a year, Hitler was very quiet. Of course, that was because Britain and France were giving Mussolini trouble because of the Spanish war.

By March 1938, Germany and Italy's position in Spain had been established, and Britain and France had become cold and indifferent because of their hesitation. Therefore, Hitler saw a good opportunity and did not want to give it up. On March 12, he took Austria into his hands in one day. Austria was originally a forbidden area for Germany and Italy. Mussolini had grievances he could not express, and Britain and France naturally kept silent. (To be continued)

### Continuing to Strive Amid Hardship: The Closing of the All-China Christian University Conference; A Decision on Wartime Educational Policies; Thirty-Three Resolutions Passed to Adapt to National Crisis Needs; Upholding Educational Freedom and Serving the Nation to Build a New China

The National Christian University Education Conference, which began on the 17th of this month in Hong Kong and lasted for six consecutive days, concluded yesterday morning. A total of thirty-three resolutions were passed, which can be summarized into three major areas. In the future, the Christian universities, which account for 10 to 13 percent of the total number of students in public and private universities across the country, will follow the established policies and strive to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance in order to build a new China. It has been learned that the presidents (Huaxi University was absent due to circumstances) and professors of twelve universities, including Yenching University, are scheduled to leave Hong Kong today after the closing of the conference. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended the conference, released the results of the conference to the reporter. According to Dr. Miao, the National Christian University Education Conference was originally scheduled to be held once a year. It has been held for the first time after the war of resistance since February of the 26th year of the Republic. This conference demonstrated the spirit of unity on the one hand, and on the other hand, it exchanged experiences gained during the war of resistance and opinions on current issues. The thirteen Christian universities currently have approximately 6,000 students, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of students in public and private universities across the country. The reason why the universities have been able to maintain themselves after the war of resistance is entirely due to the fact that the faculty and staff understand the greater good, reduce their salaries and endure hardship, and the huge special subsidies granted by friendly countries (approximately one million yuan last year). At this conference, which lasted for six consecutive days, thirty-three resolutions were passed, all of which are wartime Christian education policies adapted to the national crisis.

Wartime Educational Policies

The resolutions passed at this conference can be summarized into three main points: A. (1) Cultivating Christian character; (2) Education must be free; (3) Loyalty to the nation. We would rather make the greatest sacrifice; these three principles are extremely important. The reason why each university has relocated repeatedly is purely because education cannot be carried out in accordance with these principles. This is the first major point of the resolutions of this conference. B. Implementing Christian higher education to build a new China. We must be prepared in advance for the great mission we bear for the nation and the country during the war of resistance and after the end of the war. Therefore, we hope that each university that cannot implement the above principles and has to move elsewhere will study the entire problem of the location in order to contribute to the locality, to the country, and to the people. We must not be content with temporary ease, harbor a psychology of escape, and even more so, we must not hope to move back to the original school in the future. This is the second major point of the resolutions of this conference. C. Establishing a Rural Construction Committee to concentrate the efforts of the universities and implement cooperation to build rural China. In the past, the universities' contributions to rural areas were inconsistent in their steps and scattered in their efforts. Each school spent approximately one million yuan on agricultural sciences each year. In the future, in order to promote agriculture, increase production, and build rural areas, there must be a unified organization to coordinate all plans in order to be effective. Therefore, there is the organization of this committee. This is the third major point of the resolutions of this conference.

Overcoming Difficulties and Serving Education Faithfully

Dr. Miao also stated that the Christian cause in our country is divided into three types: one is evangelism, the second is medicine, and the third is education. After our country's war of resistance, the first two tasks continue to be carried out to the greatest extent possible in the occupied areas, adapting to the needs of the times and engaging in relief work with the greatest effort. As for education, there are only two paths to follow: one is to suspend operations, and the other is to continue operations. I have already stated before that if education can be free and the lives of faculty, staff, and students can be guaranteed, we will continue to operate regardless of how difficult or how great the sacrifice may be. Under this principle, eleven of the thirteen Christian universities before the war of resistance have continued to operate. For example, Huazhong University initially moved from Wuchang to Guilin, then to Dali in Yunnan, and finally to Western Sichuan. Soochow University moved to Huzhou after ____, then to Hangxi in Anhui, and finally to the Shanghai Concession, so the losses were great, but it is still continuing in difficulties.

### British Military Authorities Strengthen the Defense of Hong Kong and Singapore; 100,000 Sandbags Shipped from England to Hong Kong; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Will Also Arrive Successively

International events are becoming increasingly ominous, and all countries are busy building defensive fortifications to prepare for emergencies. According to Western news, the British military authorities have recently stepped up efforts to strengthen the defense of Hong Kong and Singapore. Each transport ship arriving in Hong Kong and Singapore has brought large quantities of military supplies and military equipment. The most recent shipments to Hong Kong and Singapore were large quantities of sandbags and helmets. No less than 100,000 sandbags have been shipped to Hong Kong, and they are still arriving successively. It is reported that a batch of military supplies will also arrive on the large cruiser arriving in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month.

### Du Yuesheng and Others from Shanghai in Hong Kong Organize the "Shanghai Society" to Connect Emotions and Promote Thrift

In view of the increasing number of people from Shanghai gathering in Hong Kong, and the lack of an organization in peacetime, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng and other prominent figures from Shanghai in Hong Kong have initiated the establishment of a "Shanghai Society" to connect emotions and promote the new lifestyle of frugality, inviting Shanghainese people in Hong Kong to participate. It is reported that the initiators have already recruited more than thirty people. Anyone who is from Shanghai and familiar with the initiators can participate. The society has a kitchen for banquets, but each table is limited to no more than ten Hong Kong dollars in order to comply with the purpose of frugality. It is reported that the society will soon be fully prepared and ready to be established.

### Under the Tense Situation in Eastern Guangdong, the Relationship between Hong Kong and Shantou is Greatly Affected; The Exchange of Goods between Hong Kong and Shantou Will Be Greatly Reduced and Will Come to a Standstill in the Short Term; Strengthening Domestic Production and Moving Shantou Factories Inland Rather Than to Hong Kong and Macao

Since the shift in the situation in South China, the coastal line of Chaoshan in eastern Guangdong has invisibly become the main center for the exchange of goods between our country and abroad. Freight transport between Hong Kong and Shantou is frequent, and the relationship between the two is becoming increasingly close, which is not insignificant in benefiting Hong Kong's industry and commerce. Moreover, the continuous supply of grains and vegetables from Shantou to Hong Kong is especially helpful for the food supply of Hong Kong residents. How long ago was it that suddenly smoke and fire erupted in the counties of Zhongshun and Xintai, and the bandits eyeing eastern Guangdong were also ready to move, causing the situation in Chaoshan to suddenly become alarming. Our local military and political authorities, in order to implement the national policy of resistance against Japan, have issued orders requiring the people and property of Chaoshan to be evacuated and transferred inland within a limited time.

The Chaoshan Crisis Affects the Relationship between Hong Kong and Shantou

As a result of the evacuation of all the people from Shantou, the Hong Kong-Shantou relationship, which was developing rapidly, was greatly affected, and the agricultural, mineral, and local products of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces that were shipped from Shantou to Hong Kong have completely stopped. The supply of staple vegetables, peanuts, soybeans, sesame, potatoes, wheat, chickens, ducks, and livestock from the Chaoshan area to Hong Kong is decreasing day by day. The amount of the above-mentioned miscellaneous grains and vegetables brought by each ship arriving in Hong Kong from Shantou has decreased by about six or seven tenths compared to before. If the situation continues to be tense, these staple grains and vegetables will inevitably disappear completely, which will have a huge impact on the food supply of Hong Kong residents. As for the products of Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and the factories of overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong that are transported to the inland provinces via Chaoshan, they have also been greatly reduced. According to people in Hong Kong-Shantou businesses, each Hong Kong business is stopping orders because the Shantou merchants have completely evacuated. It is expected that the goods shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou will come to a complete standstill in the short term. At the same time, the thriving Hong Kong-Shantou shipping industry has also suffered a fatal blow and has suddenly declined.

Strengthening Production and Moving Shantou Factories Inland Rather Than to Hong Kong and Macao

Yesterday, the Hai Cheng Wheel of the Delitz Company on the Hong Kong-Shantou route arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou. There were only a dozen or so first, second, and third-class passengers, and the number of staple grains, vegetables, and livestock was also extremely small. According to the crew members of the ship, since the situation in eastern Guangdong became tense, all the elderly and weak residents in the city have moved inland before today (yesterday), and very few have evacuated to Hong Kong and Macao. As for the shops and factories, etc., in view of the importance of strengthening domestic production during the war of resistance, they have all moved to safe areas inland to engage in production and will never move to overseas locations such as Hong Kong and Macao.

Building Fortresses and Preparing to Annihilate the Bandits

Hua Zhenzhong and other commanders of the Chaoshan Garrison Command have stepped up the construction of all defensive fortifications. Solid fortresses have been built around Shantou City and at the main transportation hubs within the city, and complete arrangements have been made along the coast to prepare as a basis for defense. The measures within the city are all designed to prepare for street fighting. Obstacles such as sandbags have been piled up in front of the doors of important buildings. What is even more, all the trained young men in Chaoshan have generously risen up and joined the defense forces, preparing to fight the bandits to the death. Although the situation in Chaoshan is extremely tense, the sea is still calm. Although the bandit ships are constantly coming and going, they have not taken any action. When the Hai Cheng Wheel left Shantou (on the 21st), there were no bandit ships outside the port of Shantou. It is expected that they have been patrolling the coast near Xiamen in Fujian.

### Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to the Tragic Incident of Abusing Refugees; Additional Managers Appointed to Each Refugee Camp; Residence Times for Refugees Staying in Camps are Also Specified; Incidents Can Be Reported to the Management Authorities

The incident of a pregnant woman being beaten to death in the Kam Tin Refugee Camp a few days ago caused a public outcry. The Hong Kong government authorities are also paying close attention to it. In order to prevent future occurrences, yesterday, additional managers were specially appointed to each refugee camp, and the rules and regulations for refugee camps and the regulations that refugees should abide by were re-promulgated. It was also stipulated that if an incident occurs in the camp, it can be reported to the highest management authority, and no disputes can be started in order to prevent disputes. All regulations were published in this morning's Hong Kong Government Gazette. It is briefly stated that the government refugee camps now have many appointed managers, and a timetable for refugees' daily life has been promulgated. The refugee camps include Yau Tong, King's Park, North Point, Kam Tin Cha Keng, Fanling, North and South Stations, and San Uk Ling. The new regulations designate the Director of Medical Services and the Commissioner of Police as the highest managers. In addition to the Kam Tin Camp, one manager is appointed to each camp. In the Kam Tin Camp, one "manager" and one "deputy manager" are appointed. In addition, refugees in the camp must hang their badges on their chests for identification, and spitting and smoking are prohibited. Residences and toilets must be kept clean, and the orders of the guards must be obeyed, regardless of whether the guards are soldiers or police. If a dispute occurs, the civilians may also file a complaint with the manager. The parties concerned must abide by the manager's final judgment and must not cause disputes on their own. Gambling and wasting water are strictly prohibited in the camp. Non-refugees may not move into the camp without the consent of the Director of Medical Services, the Commissioner of Police, and the camp manager.

### Automatic Nationality Registration for Chinese; Implementation Can Begin During the Day; A Commissioner Is Appointed by the Chinese Affairs Department to Be Responsible for Handling It

The Hong Kong authorities will implement automatic nationality registration for Chinese in the near future. Registration forms are being printed, and their format is no different from that used by the British Civil Registration recently. Chinese members of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council have agreed to be responsible for the distribution of registration forms. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs has specially appointed a commissioner to be in charge of this matter. All British Chinese or Chinese nationals who are willing to serve the United Kingdom in times of emergency may fill out the forms according to the regulations.

### Under the Monopoly of Firewood Merchants, Firewood Prices Soar; Only 40 Catties Can Be Obtained for Every Dollar

Firewood merchants in Hong Kong have recently taken the opportunity to hoard and monopolize, resulting in a sudden increase in firewood prices in the past two days. Those who could buy 45 catties for every dollar before can now only get 40 catties, and the price once sold for 36 catties a few days ago. Judging from the current situation, it is still possible for it to continue to rise. The lives of ordinary lower-class residents are invisibly affected.

### Hong Kong Student Relief Association's First National Service Corps: Pioneering and Sowing Seeds in Southern Guangdong

— Qi Zhuo

A Glorious Page in the History of Hong Kong Youth and Students

Special Feature by This Newspaper

… Not Bowing Down Before Difficulties

"Hmph! They're just some young masters and young ladies from Hong Kong. I heard they can sing and dance, men and women together, turning the world upside down in this day and age!"

"Do you know? They're a group of refugees carrying a lot of foreign money. If they come to our village, we'll be doomed! Ruined!"

When the first corps of the Student Relief Association's National Service Corps set off from Hong Kong on December 27th last year to serve in Gaozhou, southern Guangdong, this was the kind of misunderstanding they encountered from our compatriots, a serious blow.

The backwardness of culture in the interior is an inevitable phenomenon. Not bowing down before difficulties is the progressive attitude of youth workers.

The entire corps consisted of twenty-six people (six of whom were women). The leader was the astute and capable Liu Tanfeng Guang-sheng. They worked under the leadership of General Zhang Yan, commander of the 12th District Guerrilla Force. Apart from a portion who stayed in Maoming city to work, the majority went to the countryside to establish a base for their work. They wore the same clothes as the villagers, helping the farmers with planting and other labor. The men approached the men, the women approached the women, and gradually their lives became integrated with the farmers. They set up a clinic, curing many cases of festering heads and feet. Everyone in the village knew to come to them when they were sick. Two deaf-mutes with throat problems had sought help from gods and Buddhas without improvement. Finally, they were cured by the corps.

"You are truly living Bodhisattvas!" The villagers' misconceptions about the service corps gradually changed.

… Farmers' Schools and Children's Literacy Classes

During the day, they helped the farmers with their farm work, and in the evenings, they set up farmers' schools in the ancestral halls to train the farmers. Their slogan was "Learn to read and write." The content included current affairs reports, wartime readers, and songs. Later, in response to the farmers' requests, they also taught them abacus arithmetic and how to write letters.

What about the rural children? During the day, they taught them collective games and told them patriotic stories, teaching them songs. The children's bad habit of gambling was also gradually eradicated. In the evenings, they opened children's literacy classes in the ancestral halls. In addition to literacy and songs, the main purpose was to teach the children how to do intelligence work when war broke out in the future. In this ancestral hall, adults were trained on one side, and children were trained on the other, with families of all ages coming to learn together. After class, they happily returned home together. The ancestral hall was a new school that didn't cost any money, a center for the national salvation movement. The friends in the service corps were the teachers of the farmers, as well as their brothers and sisters. How delightful this sounds!

……Unfolding Women's Work

As for the rural women, because feudal ideas were still very strong in the countryside and they were mainly doing kitchen work, mobilizing women did not achieve as good results as mobilizing farmers and encouraging children. However, the female corps members did not relax their efforts in individual visits and the dissemination of first aid knowledge. On March 8th, they also led the women into the city to participate in the March 8th Commemoration Rally, and a representative gave a speech on stage. This was an unprecedented miracle in Gaozhou. During the rally there was an air raid, and the venue was emptied, except for this group of "country girls" who remained solemnly still. Firstly, they had just arrived in the city and didn't know what to do. Secondly, the female instructor (a female member of the Student Relief Association Service Corps) told them to keep order, and they obeyed. The simple and honest nature of the country girls greatly facilitated "education."

……Bonfire Meetings and Guerrilla Warfare

The annual "New Year Example" was the most joyous occasion for the villagers. The Student Relief Association Service Corps followed the old tradition and held a village-wide party once a week, lighting bonfires in the countryside. Every farmer happily brought two pieces of firewood to participate.

Once, on a moonlit night, they organized more than fifty capable farmers to practice guerrilla tactics on a high mountain, dividing them into two teams to compete for a flag on the mountain peak. They feigned attacks in the east while striking in the west, performing with great seriousness and speed. Every farmer knew that protecting their hometown was protecting their country, and they were very excited to request more instruction in guerrilla tactics, wanting to practice once a week.

……Destroying Roads

The villagers were still hesitant to destroy the roads. After the service corps persuaded them and personally started wielding hoes, the farmers followed suit.

They helped the farmers with their farm work, treated their illnesses, taught them to read and write, and led them in many interesting activities. The farmers not only completely overcame their past misconceptions, but also sincerely admired them. The gentlemen in the village said, "If you stay here for another two years, our village will be so much better!" Because the propaganda teams and work teams of the past were very impractical and could not integrate with the farmers.

……Spiritual Comfort, Priceless Reward

During the Lunar New Year, every household competed to invite them to their homes to celebrate the New Year and drink wine. If there was any celebration such as "paying homage to the gods," "hanging lanterns," etc., they were sure to invite them as honored guests.

In addition to often sending many sweet potatoes, vegetables, cakes, etc. to the group, the farmers also secretly sent some to the individuals they were particularly close to and particularly fond of. If they politely declined, the farmers would think that they were "not giving them face" and would be very unhappy.

They initially lived in the low, damp basement of the ancestral hall, their bodies covered in spots from mosquito attacks. Later, the farmers were so moved by their work that they apologized, saying, "You have traveled thousands of miles to come here for our sake, we are truly too sorry for you!" Then they collected a lot of planks and mosquito nets to provide for them.

When several female students were ordered to transfer to work elsewhere, many villagers cried. When Mr. Yuan left the village due to an incident, many farmers surrounded him and asked, "Have we offended you in any way?"……

This kind of spiritual comfort, a reward that money cannot buy, is something that the young masters from Hong Kong could never have dreamed of.

……A Great Mission

In accordance with the wartime organization regulations of the Commissioner's Office, the farmers' school in the village will be changed to a self-defense work team. The children's literacy class will also be changed to a children's singing team. This is the glorious history of Hong Kong students returning to the motherland to pioneer and sow seeds. They plan to make this central village even better, so that it can serve as a model and be extended to other villages.

As for the work in the city, it is also being done very well. When the authorities train new cadres for the self-defense teams in various villages, they are assigned to take charge of political work. The Dianbai County government also retained three of their comrades to help there. Under the sacred mission of defending southern Guangdong and consolidating the southwest, the Student Relief Association Service Corps is a brave and hard-fighting vanguard.

The corps members are progressive students, teachers, and staff from Hong Kong. Currently, the Student Relief Association only gives them six dollars a month, which includes food, shoe money, pocket money, everything. This time, the corps specially sent representatives Yuan Hong and Huang Sha to Hong Kong to raise about two thousand dollars for the corps' second six-month living expenses, and to replenish medicines and personnel. General Zhang Yan also sent a letter to the Student Relief Association and various organizations, expressing his gratitude to the service corps and asking for continued assistance with manpower and resources. When the reporter listened to Mr. Yuan's report yesterday, I was truly filled with endless emotion. I believe that patriotic overseas Chinese and organizations will be happy to extend a warm hand to the hardworking youth and the Southern Guangdong authorities who are responsible for the great mission of national defense, providing them with practical assistance!

### The Creation of Scripts

— Xia Yan

——Lecture Manuscript for the "Hong Kong Youth Drama Association," recorded by Zhu Baishui

A problem that is commonly felt in the current drama circle is the "script shortage." How should this problem be solved? Let's talk about the creation of scripts.

It is undeniable that the existing playwrights in China are writing too little. Although there are many young playwrights, the programs on stage are still very poor and in urgent need of remedy.

I feel that in the past we seemed to place too much responsibility for the drama movement on the playwrights, thinking that only scripts written by famous playwrights can attract audiences and please audiences; that we must only stage good scripts; and that everything else, such as directing and acting, is of secondary, tertiary, or even negligible importance.

However, I believe that this way, there will never be new directors and good actors, and at the same time, it hinders the growth of new playwrights.

Taking new playwrights as an example, if they painstakingly create a script, even if it originally had the value of being staged, it will forever lose the opportunity to be staged because they are not famous enough or not "exciting and intense" enough, and they will become very discouraged.

At the same time, because many people want to describe the "plot" of the script as tense and pleasing to the audience, they vigorously encourage young playwrights to empty-headedly fantasize about tense and lively stories, and to construct unrealistic legends in a hollow manner. As a result, it is very tense, very interesting, but also very formulaic!

Young people who seriously write real scripts never have the opportunity to be staged. And only farces can exist in the "market." With scripts of farces, directors and actors become unimportant.

Therefore, we should allow new young playwrights to create as much as possible. As long as their consciousness is correct and the story is true, the shortcomings in the script's technique should be supplemented by the performers.

Originally, a large part of the responsibility for the art of drama lies on the directors, actors, and stage designers, etc.; but in China today, the requirements for the script are eighty percent, or even ninety percent. As a result, actors and directors have no opportunity to develop, no opportunity to study and learn with their hearts.

As a result, every performance imitates others in the same way, and just gets on stage. This is not the way to go.

So, how should we create scripts?

First of all, the attitude of everyone preparing to write must be sincere and diligent. Don't fantasize, but create a typical character from many complex and intricate phenomena, and seek a good theme from a wide range of trivial subjects.

For example, in the War of Resistance, how should we praise the light, how should we expose the darkness, how should we observe the materials we need, how should we criticize the impact of a certain event……

If you write with such sincerity and passion, you will definitely have good achievements. Even if it is not very successful, it will definitely not be a complete failure.

Now, we want to give the scripts of new playwrights more opportunities to be staged.

Every young playwright must write about what they hear and know, write about the subjects they understand very well. Because only in this way will the created works not fall into conceptualization and formulaism.

I think it is very difficult for people who live a very wealthy life to describe the life of poor people; for people who have not been to the battlefield and have not been in contact with the war, if they write about guerrillas and describe volunteers, I think they will definitely fall into fantasy, into inaccuracy, and into concepts.

But does this mean that people who lack life experience cannot write?

That's not necessarily the case. We can put in effort to refer to, study, and seek from books, newspapers, and conversations; conduct very in-depth observations and understand from relevant aspects, and only start writing after we fully and thoroughly understand all the subjects we need. That's always better than writing randomly.

In the use of script writing techniques, there is no need to imitate others. Try to create new forms as much as possible. There is no need to use tense scenes to attract the audience, nor is there a need to please the audience with jokes.

Young playwrights should have confidence and write more realistic and moving scripts. Don't imitate your predecessors, the next generation should surpass the previous generation!

In summary, solving the script shortage does not necessarily mean hoping that famous playwrights will write. We should try our best to discover new young playwrights. At the same time, our young directors, young actors, and all other workers must bravely perform difficult scripts.

——Only performing a difficult script well is the honor of the performers and actors, what's so great about performing a famous farce well?

It should be a more in-depth stage! We need to put in more effort and hone ourselves further! Therefore, the new drama of the new era must be created by young friends.

One Scene from the Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues

Captured × Military Prisoners During the Victory at De'an

After Consoling Them, They All Oppose the × Military Clique's Act of Aggression

### A Sincere Recommendation for "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" and Other Epics Written in Blood by Thousands of National Heroes

— Bai Yun

The "Wartime Special Issue," a wartime documentary film produced by the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and produced by the China Film Studio, with the first to fifth collections compiled by Mr. Luo Jingyu, has already been shown in Hong Kong; the achievements of these dozen or so photographers who were born into and out of the battlefield, experiencing hardships and dangers, do not know how many hot tears have been shed under the screen by Chinese sons and daughters living in Hong Kong who miss the War of Resistance against Japan! Recently, the "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" has been compiled by Luo Jingyu and Yuan Congmei, and has been transported to Hong Kong, and will soon be shown in the Central Theater.

At a secret screening, the reporter had the opportunity to see this systematic history of the War of Resistance for the past three or more months. When I was watching this film, I felt both glorious and ashamed! The development of the motherland, the high tide of anti-Japanese sentiment, the heroic and brave Chinese army, and many touching deeds made people's blood boil, and they couldn't help but shed tears. It is enough to make people feel proud, but also to feel that they are living in comfort in Hong Kong and cannot join the embrace of the motherland and do their part for the War of Resistance. They feel ashamed of themselves and cannot help but feel a "thorn in their side."

The value of "Wartime Special Issue" lies not only in its precious news—news that has not been recorded in newspapers, news that has never been seen or heard before—but mainly in the fact that it can systematically explain the general trend of the War of Resistance with these news, and add explanations with charts, so that people can clearly see the inevitable victory of China and the self-destruction of the × people.

The sixth collection includes the victory at De'an, a final glimpse of the evacuation of Guangzhou and Wuhan—not only did the citizens evacuate in an orderly manner, but Wuhan also had a service corps organized by students who had spent their lives studying in Japan, which plastered anti-Japanese propaganda slogans written in Japanese everywhere, preparing to show them to the × troops who were about to invade the city, so that they would receive some shocking stimuli after exchanging a huge price for an empty city. The Nanyue Conference convened by Chairman Chiang, which decided on the second phase of the War of Resistance, gathered more than two hundred generals participating in the War of Resistance, and used the experience gained with blood to discuss the initial combat plan, which also made the audience feel particularly excited.

There is also the scene of the × aircraft frantically bombing Guilin at the time, taken by a specially invited Russian war photographer, Karlman. In addition, the photographer specially sent by the factory infiltrated the × army's encirclement and took pictures of the daily life of Lushan Guiling, raising the flag on the top of the mountain, and the various situations of using guerrilla warfare to attack the × people. In addition, the front-line generals of the east, west, south, and north battlefields, such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Tang Enbo, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, and Shang Zhen, also met the audience on the screen one by one: and the front-line battle scenes were all taken by the photographer at the risk of his life, giving the audience the feeling of being on the battlefield.

What is especially noteworthy is the lives of the prisoners. From their natural actions, one can see the pain in their hearts. After losing their combat effectiveness, we not only treat them well, but also sympathize with these weak people driven by the military. We hope that they will gain new awareness.

Along with the premiere of "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" will be "Movie News" No. 48, which chronicles the grand occasion of the gold offering during the Chongqing Festival. And the anti-Japanese song collection cartoon short film "Collecting Winter Clothes," which uses a cartoon-style technique to apply China's relatively backward cartoon production skills in a very good way. Because the songs have substantial content, they feel even more pleasant to listen to, and it is also worth watching.

Secondly, we should mention the photographers who participated in the production of the "Wartime Special Issue." They bravely carried cameras and ran back and forth in front and behind the front lines. The task of carrying a camera to fight is more important than a soldier carrying a gun to fight, but they take the same risks. These photographers are Luo Jizhi, Han Zhongliang, Liu Mingxuan, Yao Shiquan, Chen Chen, Wang Zhongxi, Li Yin, He Luying, Zhu Shuhong, Xu Zhiguang, Xu Qishan, and Wang Zhigang. We pay tribute to them here, hoping that they will achieve better results and that we can see them in the next collection.

One Scene from the Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues: Spoils of Victory at De'an

### "Huanghuagang" in Full Swing

— Xiu Fu

"Huanghuagang general rehearsal tonight," "Huanghuagang general rehearsal tonight"……

On the 20th, the Hong Kong news columns of every newspaper prominently published this eye-catching headline.

On that night, a night after the rain, with a gentle spring breeze, in the dark auditorium of South China Middle School, countless people were flashing, crowding, laughing... all those present were drama workers from Hong Kong.

Actors from the Xinsheng Drama Society, Hongbai Drama Troupe, Zhongyi Drama Troupe, Lufeng Drama Society, Cyclone Drama Society, Dingchou Drama Society, Youth Troupe, Zhonglu Drama Troupe, Ziqiang Drama Society, Rendou Drama Troupe, Tieliu Drama Troupe, Qingniantongle Society, Ant Drama Troupe, Vanguard Drama Troupe, Time Drama Troupe, Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, etc. all arrived.

Ouyang Yuqing, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi, Tang Shuming, and other drama seniors also arrived. Since the start of the "Huanghuagang" project, all the staff have gathered together the most fully this evening. Such a gathering under a great call and unified solidarity is so inspiring!

Due to the repeated postponement of the performance, everyone has invisibly developed a tendency to slack off, which is naturally not good. However, the sincere and enthusiastic meeting of all the staff that evening proved that everyone's slackness can be quickly overcome.

As the time is getting closer and closer to the performance, it is urgent to strengthen our work and quickly complete this great task in a blitzkrieg manner. At the same time, in order to increase the effectiveness of the work, a new and careful plan has been started for the rehearsal time and the distribution of director responsibilities.

The rehearsal time is almost every day from the 20th onwards. The new distribution of directors is decided as follows: Prologue Hu Chunshui, Act 1 Huang Ninglin, Act 2 Ouyang Yuqian, Act 3 Zhong Qinan and Lu Dun, Act 4 Ouyang Yuqian and Li Jingbo, Epilogue Tan Guochi.

Obviously, the director's responsibilities have been strengthened. Mr. Huang Ninglin, Zhong Qinan, and Tan Guochi are all senior figures in the Guangzhou drama circle and participated in the important work of the "Huanghuagang" performance in Guangzhou last year. This time, they are re-participating in the Hong Kong performance with a familiar attitude, which will undoubtedly provide great help!

In recent days, rehearsals have been taking place every night in Zhongyi and South China Middle School, tensely and actively. Every worker is struggling under the banner of this great and vast undertaking with the greatest effort and enthusiasm.

In addition to the important requirement for the number of actors in this national revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang," its difficult stage design and costumes and props are equally important, especially the troublesome set design, which is of absolute importance. In the past, when it was performed in Guangzhou, what made the entire process of "Huanghuagang" the most glorious page was the mobilization of countless stage workers to complete its installation with extremely strong power. What people will never forget is a group of little heroes and our "Old Huo" - 尔. In Hong Kong, this difficult task was originally placed on the shoulders of Old Er, but unfortunately, he fell ill last month. It was then handed over to a very capable Mr. Ye Jian, but Mr. Cai Chusheng's "Orphan Island Paradise" grabbed him, and as a result, the director of the Hongbai Drama Troupe, Mr. Lu Jingguang, was finally pulled out to shoulder this thankless task.

It is a fact that time is very tight. It is not easy to build four or five huge sets in about ten days, but Mr. Lu Jingguang sincerely and bravely took on this responsibility. In recent days, he has been hurriedly and tensely directing the start of the task.

In addition, the costume design and preparation have begun under the responsibility of Mr. Tang Shuming Tang Xingtuan, and the props have been designed and prepared under the responsibility of Mr. Zhong Pinglin Jin.

The publicity is also starting to be very planned. It is believed that at the joint meeting on the 19th, Mr. Lu Fu had offered very detailed good suggestions, and preparations have been underway in recent days. It is planned to publish more than 20 special publications in various newspapers during the performance period, so it is very urgent. It is hoped that the various drama troupes will send more manuscripts related to "Huanghuagang" to the publicity department. At the same time, many very exquisite art advertisements, etc. will be printed and sent out in the future, and it is hoped that this vast publicity campaign will receive satisfactory results.

Here we can imagine how the entire work of "Huanghuagang" is unfolding in a tense and rapid manner. May this great joint performance push the Hong Kong drama movement to a newer stage and unite Hong Kong drama workers into a stronger front!

### After the Wuhan Chorus Went Abroad, They Strengthened the Drama Group. Xiang Kun Returned to Hong Kong to Recruit New Talents

The Wuhan Chorus is not only a "chorus," but drama is also an important tool for them to engage in the national salvation movement and expand international propaganda. Since the group left Hong Kong for Singapore, they have given public performances for more than four months, raising a total of 300,000 yuan in national currency. In more than one hundred public performances, they all appeared in the form of a combination of "chorus" and "drama," which greatly inspired the overseas Chinese. The group is now continuing its propaganda and fundraising work in Johor. In order to strengthen the drama lineup, Xiang Kun, the head of the group's drama section, specially came to Hong Kong to recruit new drama talents. According to Mr. Xiang, without publishing an advertisement, dozens of people have applied for the exam in just a few days. The exam will be held today, with sincerity towards national salvation drama as the most important criterion. It is planned to recruit two women and one man. After obtaining their passports at the end of this month, they will travel south with Mr. Xiang to return to the team in order to continue to expand their work. Mr. Xiang's conversation with the reporter was very exciting. The reporter has written an article "The Wuhan Chorus in Singapore," but due to the crowding of manuscripts in this issue, it will be published in the next issue.

True Light Girls' Middle School Drama Troupe Performs at the YMCA the Day Before Yesterday

The various grade drama troupes of True Light Girls' Middle School regularly take turns performing at the YMCA every week. On the one hand, to expand salvation and national salvation propaganda, and on the other hand, to promote the popularization of drama, the intentions are beautiful and good. The performances have been very successful and have been praised by people from all walks of life. The day before yesterday (the 21st), the third-grade junior high school students of the school once again performed three one-act plays at the YMCA auditorium, namely "I Am Chinese," "An Enemy of the People," and "Scar," as well as the Victory Hymn, which greatly moved the audience.

### Performances Once Every Seven Revolutions

— Wang Ying

Foreword

It has been twenty months since we left Shanghai. With the progress of the entire war of resistance, drama has achieved amazing results during this period. It has penetrated among the masses, and it is loved by the vast number of peasants and soldiers. Everywhere, in remote rural areas, and on the front lines, we see groups of drama workers, wearing old clothes, barefoot, carrying simple props, setting up their camps everywhere—fields, mountain peaks, densely wooded places, trenches... performing enthusiastically.

What should be especially mentioned here is that these new drama outposts are all middle school students and young intellectuals. They bravely opened up a bright road, a constructive and growing road, for the emerging drama of the new China. The entire future of drama is entrusted to them.

It is regrettable that there are very few people who have always been engaged in drama work who are participating.

In this great torrent, we work with these pure and enthusiastic friends, and we have learned a lot from them, especially a new spirit, a courage to move towards the truth without fear of difficulties and hardships. Here, I deeply miss a group in Dabie Mountain. They returned to their hometown, Shangcheng, from Qingdao, Beiping, and other places, completely abandoning all their original lives and throwing themselves into the ranks of the peasants; more than a hundred of them were excellent middle school and university students, and the women participated in various work just like the men. For example, writing letters of condolence, they mobilized the people of the whole county to participate enthusiastically in one morning. They patiently, driven by enthusiasm, overcame all stubborn and terrible difficulties. Cleaners, odd-job men, all kinds of chores; what the common people did, they did. Now, they are in the Dabie Mountain, working with the guerrillas! When we left the mountain peak of Xinjian'ao, they wrote a small flag and gave it to us, accompanied us for more than ten miles. The Japanese ×× artillery fire was clearly resounding in our ears. We parted in the small town of Xindian. They squeezed together and shouted: "Don't forget us!" We turned our heads to look at them, standing on the earthen slope waving their hands, a group of black-faced, ragged people, an infinite sense of parting and joy welled up in our hearts! They, they are the most outstanding and bravest sons and daughters of the Chinese nation!

Since we set off to this day, we have performed 741 times, with rural performances accounting for two-fourths, the remaining one-fourth being small cities and counties, and then large cities; we have traveled through eight provinces and contacted various different audiences: now I want to pick out a few practical examples of our work experience and the difficulties we have encountered in our work (in terms of performance), and write a little bit about them, which I think friends would also like to know.

### The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy

— Jie

In wartime fiscal policy, monetary policy, in the era when currency management was not implemented, involved changing coins, reducing the value of currency to increase financial resources. In the modern era where currency management is implemented, currency inflation is carried out for utilization. However, China did not embark on the path of currency inflation, but rather increased tax revenue and issued public bonds to coordinate their utilization, as the primary strategy of wartime finance. The collection of gold and silver policies was carried out to increase the strength of wartime finance. It was previously reported in this newspaper that the Ministry of Finance issued a telegram on the 21st prohibiting silver merchants from privately purchasing gold and silver, and established a collection method, which can be said to indicate that the implementation of the collection of gold and silver policy has reached its peak.

Because silver was nationalized on November 3, 1935, the collection of gold was still the most vigorously pursued aspect of wartime gold and silver policy. The main methods were: the "Measures for Converting Gold into Legal Tender" and its implementing rules, promulgated on October 10, 1937, stipulated that those who exchanged raw gold, gold utensils, gold coins, or newly produced gold nuggets, gold sand, etc. for legal tender would be given a handling fee of 3% to 5%, those who purchased national salvation public bonds would be given an additional 6%, and those who made legal tender deposits would be given weekly interest at the newly set interest rate of two percent. Secondly, the "Measures for Supervising Silver Merchants' Collection and Exchange of Gold" promulgated on November 1, 1938, stipulated that silver shops were only allowed to collect or sell gold and 90% pure gold in the form of jewelry or utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaf, placer gold, and ore gold were not allowed to be collected or sold. As for shops that specialize in buying placer gold and ore gold, they should contact the Central Bank to sign a entrusted contract and transfer all of it to the Central Bank. In mid-November of the same year, the private transport of gold and any form of gold jewelry out of the country or to occupied areas was further restricted. The auxiliary methods were: the method of raising national salvation public bonds stipulated that national currency, hard currency, foreign currency, raw gold and silver, etc., and the gold public bonds stipulated that raw gold or gold coins, etc. could be used to purchase public bonds.

It can be said that the above main and auxiliary methods for the collection of gold and silver are very detailed. However, when China implemented the legal tender policy, the method of issuing legal tender to issuing banks with 60% legal tender and 40% guarantee was not abolished. Therefore, in the progress of the wartime gold and silver collection policy, there were inevitably defects—although the main methods had clear regulations on collection and transportation, there was no consideration given to the point of using the collection as a preparation for receiving coupons. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed financial institutions, stipulating that silver merchants in various places who had concluded coupon-receiving contracts with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank to collect gold and silver as reserves should first report to the issuing bank that they had contacted to receive coupons, and report to the Gold and Silver Exchange Office for entrusted handling, in order to eliminate the malpractices of speculation or smuggling. If a coupon-receiving contract had not been concluded and no application for entrustment had been made, it would be treated as private purchase for profit, and would be punished according to the circumstances. This method involves two agencies, the issuing bank and the Gold and Silver Exchange Office, and it is of course not easy for malpractices to occur, so it is easy to prevent or eliminate speculation or smuggling.

### First Division Football Championship Battle, South China South Wins Championship, Fighting in the Rain, A Big Victory Over Navy Four to Zero, South China's Victory is the Success of Using Avoidance and Light Strategy

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Although yesterday was not torrential rain, it was very heavy. General football fans, witnessing this dull weather, were not happy, complaining that the heavens were not beautiful, and were afraid that the First Division League championship battle would be postponed because of this. If not, the players competing in the rain would at least reduce the wonderful performance.

There were also many people who worried about South China South, because although each of the South China players' football skills are highly skilled, their physical strength is not as good as that of Westerners, which is an undeniable fact. Moreover, people in the Navy are accustomed to life on the water, so it is reasonably thought that they are also conducive to water battles for football, so in this environment, they are afraid that South China will be more bad than good. In addition, the Navy's lineup is extremely complete, with strong personnel and horses, which seems to be rare this year.

The more people worried about South China South, the more they wanted to know the truth, so more than five or six thousand people braved the rain to watch the game, occupying all the seats in the entire Navy Stadium, and also unfolding a "covered" conference, which was a spectacle.

In the competition, the South China players used their superb skills to perform cleverly and beautifully, and the connection was perfect. Although the field was wet and the ball was heavy, it was unavoidable to be strenuous, but they had control over the ball and the passing was appropriate. Therefore, under this situation of excellent technology, they finally ran on the road to victory, killing the foreign sailors to a complete defeat by a score of four to zero.

I can see that the only main reason for South China's great victory this time is the success of avoiding the heavy and taking the light. On this point, it is clear that it is the role of skill. The body sizes of the South China front-line players are not as strong as those of the foreign sailors. If they did not use skills to find a way out, and wanted to rely solely on strength, this would be impossible. The South China players can take advantage of open positions, avoid the interception of the Navy's defenders, and deliberately play tricks, luring them and shaking their defensive center of gravity, so that even Hendy, whose skills are the most stable, cannot take care of it. As a result, the Navy had to be defeated.

Zhuandi was the left inside forward, and the performance was the most fierce, but the more heroic he was, the easier it was to fall into the trap, because South China, not long after the start of the game, Li Yaorong immediately switched positions with Hua Beihua because of pain in his right foot, and the front-line attack also focused on the right side. He Di was properly defensive, and was inevitably busy dealing with it, and had to disobey the attack, and this move was exactly what South China's front-line had planned to avoid the heavy and take the light. Therefore, when Bei Hua lured him from the middle and transferred him away, he gave Feng Jingxiang an opportunity to take advantage of. Looking at the three goals that Jingxiang won, the position he stood in each time he knocked on the door was farther away from He Di, but very close to the goal, so it is clear that the South China front-line's tactical strategy is to avoid the heavy and take the light, and also to avoid the heavy and take advantage of the weakness.

The forwards scored a total of four goals, and Jingxiang alone accounted for three, which is a great contribution, but don't forget that Bei Hua helped with strength, and his contribution is also not small. The advantage of Bei Hua lies in the beauty of the transmission and the ability to cooperate with Jingxiang to the extreme. If Zhaorong had not appeared on the stage with an injury, the connection between the three forwards would have been better and there would be no doubt.

Jingxiang's skills have indeed reached the peak, and he can act according to circumstances, and has both wisdom and strategy. Since Zhaorong was injured and unable to walk well, he immediately changed his strategy, focusing on seeking progress with the strength of South China, and using his own strength to try to make up for the position that Zhaorong should have walked but did not walk. There is also one thing that is quite rare: after 70 minutes of fighting, everyone was covered in mud, but Ma Jingxiang's uniform had very few stains, because he ran steadily, stood firmly, and scored three goals without falling once, which is really rare.

Luo Liaowen's performance in this battle is quite commendable, and he is much better than before. Deng Lusen's performance has recently been in the peak state, and the same was true in yesterday's battle. He can be called the number one right winger in Hong Kong today. Zhaorong did not have a good description due to the pain of the old creation, but winning the second goal was his indirect contribution.

The South China front-line's half-time performance was better than the first half, and Guo Yingqi and Liang Rongzhao made great contributions in the defensive aspect, and these two also contributed to the offensive aspect, but Rongzhao's deliberate pretense should not be changed. He was named by the referee in yesterday's battle because of this, which was too much, but why did Rongzhao deliberately cause trouble? Liu Qingcai is also considered to be working hard, but it is difficult to restrain the activities of Armstrong and Zhong Shi, but he is not used to living on the left, so there should be forgiveness.

Li Tiansheng and Li Guowei repeatedly rescued dangers in the first half, turning danger into safety, and being able to protect a clean victory without losing a goal was really hard work, and Bao Jiaping also had many good works.

The reason for the Navy's defeat is that the hard-line skills of the defense side are not enough to resist the strategic progress of the South China forwards, but the performance of their three forwards in the first half was good. The advance and retreat seem to have the style of Goringden. Internal defenders Xuan Di and Ge Lianchen are also very fierce, but they only use force to control people, and eventually become exhausted, and they are not as good as the South China forwards' clever minds, so in the second half they finally collapsed.

Few of the forwards are good at shooting, and even if they have opportunities, they will miss them. When South China was threatened in the first half, if its forwards had shooting shoes, South China might have lost first.

I missed one thing, and I have to add a few words here. Yingqi stuck to Touban and refused to let go in yesterday's battle, making Touban unable to attack. It seems that Yingqi's body size is half the size of Touban, but he can use clever skills to restrain Touban.

Now that the Navy has been defeated and cannot get the championship, even the runner-up seat is a problem, because Eastern has also completed twenty games and scored twenty-nine points, which is the same as the Navy's position, and they still have to have another runner-up final to determine who is difficult to defeat. Eastern has returned from Saigon today, and the date of the final with the Navy will not be far away. At that time, Eastern has Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to help, and the military appearance is very neat. Maybe they can defeat the Navy and win the runner-up, but the war period is not yet determined, so let's wait for the next time. The lineup of the two armies in yesterday's battle is as follows:

South China South

Bao Jiaping Li Guoji Li Tiansheng Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao Guo Yingqi Luo Douwen Ye Beihua Feng Jingxiang Li Zhaorong Deng Guangsen

Navy Team

Dejiachen Xuan Di Gelianchen Gao Lushi Taneng Hanniweiluo Molisi Tuoban Jinbeilu Zhong Shi Yan Langshide

### First Half Battle Situation

(Ten Minutes) The two armies are in a very fierce confrontation. Yan Langshide gets the transport from the rear, and rushes to camp like a fast horse, forcing a corner kick. After the opening, Taneng advances rapidly in the crowd and shoots violently at the door. His labor is exceptionally dangerous. Fortunately, Shen Heng swept his feet and saved the ball out of danger.

(Fifteen Minutes) Rongzhao gives the ball to Bei Hua, Bei Hua earns it over Han Niweiluo, and transfers it to Guangsen. Guangsen shoots violently, but is blocked out of bounds by Xuan Di, getting a corner kick. Guangsen takes the kick, which is beautiful and exquisite, but it is a pity that Jingxiang raised it high.

(Seventeen Minutes) Douwen's courage suddenly increases, dribbling the ball and rushing forward, charging and running in the Navy's position, losing and regaining it, and shooting hard at the door within reach, hitting Dejiachen's body and bouncing out. Zhaorong shoots again, with a very good angle, but the momentum is not strong, and it is saved by Dejiachen again.

(Si Minutes) Rongzhao intercepts Jinbeilu's ball and passes it to Zhaohua, who dribbles it up and cleverly passes it to Guangsen. Gao Lushi can't intercept it and loses a corner kick. Guangsen opens it, and the momentum is beautiful. Jingxiang gently shakes his copper head in the crowd, and the ball rolls into the net. (One to Zero)

(Twenty-two Minutes) Armstrong is unusually lively, and has another chance to copy into the corner of the South China goal. Fortunately, Qingcai returned in time and desperately blocked it, preferring to lose a corner kick. Armstrong's main kick fell to the opposite side and retreated without success.

(Twenty-three Minutes) Molisi took advantage of the South China defense's emptiness and suddenly moved forward. Guowei Fu defended, and Jiaping abandoned the door to fight. Molisi's foot was not agile, and he did not shoot at an empty door, and even hit the ball into the wilderness.

(Thirty Minutes) The Navy launched another fierce attack. The giant Tuoban attacked in front of the South China goal. Jiaping hugged the ball tightly and kicked it out in time. In an instant, Jinbeilu was bitterly pressing in the corner of the door, and the situation was very fierce. Only Jiaping calmly engaged in the matter and hugged the ball to escape the danger.

### Second Half Battle Situation

(Five Minutes) Zhaorong gets Jingxiang's wonderful pass, crosses the customs and cuts the generals, and shoots and shoots. The ball rushes towards the Navy's city gate. Gelinchen raises his feet to block it and sends Ban Luoye, losing a corner kick, and almost scoring on his own goal.

(Fifteen Minutes) The Navy attacks with the ball. Within ten minutes, it is bitter to kill the South China guards. The crisis only passed when Han Niweiluo fouled, and Gelinchen fouled. Zhaorong took a free kick, and Jingxiang headed the ball in the Navy's hinterland, and hit the red heart again. (Two to Zero)

(Twenty-three Minutes) Guowei kicked a long ball, and Jingxiang rushed forward to win it, like a wild horse off the rein, galloping forward. Taneng, Gao Lushi, and Xuan Di and others blocked him on three sides, but they were ineffective, and Jingxiang finally took a city in one go. (Three to Zero)

(Thirty-three Minutes) South China steadily engaged in the matter, and did not slacken its strength because the end of the game was approaching. Guangsen sent another wonderful ball in the urgent attack, and Bei Hua shot lying on the ground, establishing a merit. At this point, it became a score of four to zero, and South China won the championship.

### How to Practice Freestyle Swimming

— Pan Congbo

If the body can almost float to the surface, adding the movement of the limbs will make it float even higher and move forward. Beginners who understand this can easily learn as long as they are not afraid of hardship and can improve very quickly. The lower limbs must be straightened. Do not forget that the knees will be impacted by the water and the lower limbs, so the lower limbs should be bent and extended to kick the water. The small force of the lower limbs comes from the activity of the thigh joint. Therefore, the lower limbs are easily fatigued. When practicing at the beginning, start from simple and gradually move to complex. First, do the movements of the lower limbs. Lower your head, and the upper limbs still extend forward together. The floating body will completely float to the surface due to the alternating kicking movements of the lower limbs.

For the upper limb movements, one hand often enters the water in front of the head, and the other hand is drawn out of the water from the waist. After it comes out of the water, the hand entering the water is inserted into the water. The upper limbs in the water are slightly bent and pushed backward, creating a mutual resistance with the water, like a boat being propelled forward by oars. The lower limbs constantly move up and down alternately, and the upper limbs are used in coordination. The freestyle swimming posture only lacks the breathing action.

The breathing action is different in the water and in the air. Daily breathing is best done with air passing through the nostrils, but when swimming, it is most suitable to inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. Why exhale through the nose? Because the freestyle swimming action requires the head to be slightly tilted to the left and right as the upper limbs crawl in the water alternately. Although the head position in freestyle swimming may vary depending on the use of other movements, the breath is always exhaled before the head is tilted to the side. That is, when it is facing forward, the remaining air is exhaled, preparing to take a deep breath of a large amount of air through the mouth when the head is exposed above the water on the side. If you do not inhale through the mouth, it will be difficult to inhale enough air in the short, quick intervals of the action. If you exhale in the water not through the nostrils, it is easy for water to rush into the mouth, and the breathing action will be immediately hindered.

The movements of the lower limbs, upper limbs, and breathing should not only be practiced in the water. During morning exercises, because the movements on land are easier to support, in addition to practicing the movements of each part separately, practicing the entire movement makes progress easier. How to perform the above movements is not convenient to describe in detail here. However, for breathing practice, in addition to not needing to use equipment, practicing with the water in the washbasin when washing your face is like practicing in the water.

The movements for practicing freestyle swimming have been described above, but it is not easy to become proficient. Not only is it not easy to become proficient, but it is also very hard. This requires the greatest determination to overcome difficulties. It is worth noting that you cannot learn for just one day in warm weather; otherwise, it is not surprising if you cannot master it even after three or five years.

Secondly, even if freestyle swimming is learned, one always feels that breathing is rushed and the movements are easily tiring. Before reaching a distance of three or five zhang, one becomes exhausted and cannot catch their breath. What can be done?

The inability to sustain breath and strength is certainly related to the strength of the physique. However, the failure to use breathing effectively and the improper use of muscles have an even greater impact. Because to get the head into a suitable breathing position, the head is often raised too high and swayed too violently to the left and right. The disadvantage of the former is that it changes the force of the limbs floating horizontally in the water, increasing the difficulty of the lower limbs supporting buoyancy. The latter affects breathing. Not only does the body sway from side to side, hindering forward movement, but the neck also feels easily tired, which can also lead to difficulty in breathing.

The so-called improper use of muscles refers to the failure to obtain opportunities for rest and relaxation between the continuous movements of the limbs. Not only does it easily lead to fatigue, but it also makes it impossible to exert the fierce force for forward propulsion, which is a great obstacle to improving swimming skills.

Regardless of how the limbs move, since they have a resisting effect with the water, they should also have movements that do not resist the water. This movement is intermittent. Although the swimming action does not stop, there is an opportunity for alternating work and rest. After the lower limbs kick the water, they are drawn upward again. The time when the upper limbs are drawn out of the water to prepare to be inserted into the water again is a good opportunity for the muscles to rest. At this time, the muscles should be relaxed, and the movements will naturally be more gentle and smooth.

It is necessary to practice diligently to improve freestyle swimming skills. Pay attention to your own physique and swimming technique. Increase the time and distance of each swim. Pay even more attention to the fact that poor habits may be magnified through long-term practice, which is not easy to correct. Only with correct posture can swimming skills be easily improved.

### Rongye Brand Completion of Merit Ceremony: Awards Given Yesterday, Wellington Wins Exhibition Match

The Rongye Brand competition organized by the Small Football League has come to a conclusion after months of intense battles, and the winners have been determined. Yesterday, the championship and runner-up exhibition match was held at London Garden, and prizes were awarded. Wellington won the championship, and Kitchee finished as runner-up. Although the weather was cloudy and rainy, the audience was still crowded. Both sides did not perform carelessly due to the final match and gave their all from beginning to end. Wellington used its original lineup, while Kitchee mostly filled the spots with substitutes. Although the strength was slightly inferior, they posed a serious threat to the Wellington team. Wellington won by two goals in the first half, mainly because Kitchee's goalkeeper was not good. Kitchee launched a counterattack in the second half, and Zhu Jincheng finally scored a goal. As a result, Wellington won by a score of two to one. Lin Huasheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Li Huilin of the Wellington team were the best players of the match, while Zhu Jincheng, Yin Zurong, and Chen Jiali of Kitchee were the outstanding players. The lineups of both teams are listed below:

Wellington

Lin Huasheng, Deng Songxiang, Chen Jinpei, Zeng Huai, Li Xinhan, Gang Yingqi, Li Huilin

Kitchee

Wu Jingfu, Li Zhaolin, Yin Zule, Chen Jiali, Wan Fuxiang, Lin Suxiong, Zhu Jincheng

### Yesterday Evening's Group B Basketball Game: Wah Hung Defeats Qing Zhi Team, South China Li Xing Also Wins

There were three Group B men's basketball games last night. In the first game, Qing Zhi played Wah Hung. Qing Zhi's defense was unusually weak, while Wah Hung's entire team was brave and skillful, making the game one-sided. Hong Xiaotai, Huang Zhaopan, and Ma Weifen attacked with great success. Yu Ruixi, Situ Ying, Liang Song, Li Ming, and Yao Junjie also contributed. Under the counterattacks of Qing Zhi's Huang Jinyuan, Zhang Yun, and Liang Shihua, they made some achievements, but Wah Hung's front-line offense was fierce, winning by a score of fifty to twenty-eight. In the second game, South China played Qing Zhi. South China's coordination was appropriate, and Qing Zhi's forwards failed to attack evenly, allowing South China to break through. After the start of the game, Cheng Enrong, Liu Bingrong, and Lin and others opened fire on both sides. Wu Haifu, Deng Yaoming, and Deng Xihong also divided their troops to charge and kill. However, Fu Hua's momentum was overwhelming, and the entire army launched a fierce attack. At the end of the game, South China won by a score of fifty-three to thirty. In the final game, Li Xing played Qing Team. Li Xing is a strong team in this tournament and has many strong players. After the start of the game, Li Xing mobilized its entire army, with Lin Youpei, Lu Dezhang, Chen Yuting, and Chen Chengji attacking from left and right. The Qing Team tried hard to support them and was exhausted from blocking. Although Li Yinche, He Huanzhang, and Yu Yangang tried their best to counterattack, it did not help the overall situation. The entire Li Xing team was able to drive straight in, defeating the Qing Team by a large margin of seventy-eight to twenty-four.

### Literary Offensive

— Huang Sheng

On the one hand, it is serious work, on the other hand, it is obscene and shameless. This sentence is exactly a portrayal of the cultural world here and now. The establishment of the Hong Kong branch of the Literary Association marks the beginning of the unity of progressive literary workers, which is a major event in the cultural world here. It will become an organization to promote cultural struggle, and the workers who are members will also provide their strength more actively and bravely - this represents the serious side.

And at this time, a certain faction is more thoroughly selling its personality, more thoroughly betraying the motherland, more thoroughly loyal to the × people, actively buying newspapers, buying backward writers, spreading toxins in larger quantities, creating black screens more skillfully, creating rumors and swindling more shamelessly, and shaking people's hearts. The motherland does not allow them to stand, and this place has become their lair - this represents the dirty side.

The fight between light and darkness should have reached the most tense stage!

As far as the literary world is concerned, the workers have begun to unite, and now is the time to exert collective strength. On the one hand, we must launch a research movement in a planned and systematic manner, and on the other hand, we must immediately take on the task of propagandizing the masses and combating traitors - the team has gathered, with vigorous vitality and a clear battle flag. Now it is time to launch an "offensive."

Unity for offense, not just defense!

To establish an offensive, I think, first of all, we must review our own team. We must have a practical self-examination. Are there any unserious aspects of our lives? Are there any undesirable tendencies in our work? Does our writing objectively benefit a certain faction? That is to say, do we cater to the low-level tastes of some people? Workers should help each other, understand each other, and encourage and supervise each other.

Secondly, there are not many workers gathered now. We cannot admit that a small number of workers can fully shoulder the current arduous tasks. On the one hand, countless literary youths must add a pair of hands to the establishment of the literary battle flag, and on the other hand, these countless literary youths can indeed become cadres on the literary front. The Ministry of Supervision is the bravest combatant in the offensive, not to mention that our battle will not be limited to this corner, but also to explore the tentacles of the battle into the mainland, or even into places farther away from the motherland. The acquisition and training of a large number of cadres is also the current task.

Again, at the time of launching this offensive, we must also carry out political work to the backward group. The backward people do not have a correct understanding, and their work benefits a certain faction and is more easily bought by a certain faction. Therefore, we must eliminate the attitude of contempt and disregard for this group of people, and try to win them over. Also, those who have mistakenly entered the net may not be without a sense of justice. Sometimes, due to professional relations, they do some ugly things against their conscience. We must disintegrate the enemy's camp and urge these people to wake up quickly.

The establishment and development of an offensive is naturally an arduous task. What I have discussed above are just some key points. Perhaps what is more important now is the deployment of the workers who have already gathered. Those who will take on this aspect of the attack, those who will take on a certain line of attack; and there is also the issue of the use of workers' weapons, those who are most suitable to use rifles, those who are most suitable to use hand grenades, or perhaps some people should use some old treasures such as knives, spears, swords, and halberds.

### The First Night at the Front Line

— Li Qiao

Dragging my soft body, conquered by hunger and exhaustion, I walked out of the division headquarters. Based on the little experience I had when I came, we all thought we could go back. Unexpectedly, after walking out of the door not far, we were lost in the vast and boundless wilderness shrouded in darkness.

Our right front was illuminated by a frightening red light, and the deep blue sky, dotted with countless glittering little stars, was also reddened by the fierce fire. The sound of guns and cannons kept ringing densely together, as if to tear the world shrouded in darkness apart. In this deafening, chaotic sound, the machine gun sound, like hammering an anvil, was very clear, "tatatatata..."

"Which way to go?"

"I remember that we passed a dike when we came, how did we get into these wheat fields? There is no way to go, how to go?"

"Be careful! Don't go into the × people's defense line, you must know that this is the front line!"

After a brief discussion, everyone decided to return to the division headquarters. Walking in the dark for not far, suddenly, a messenger came out of the headquarters and led us back to the stone shed.

Nothing could be seen clearly on the road, and we closely followed each other, groping forward. But our feet were often blocked by something, almost falling to the ground. Sometimes, our feet were also trapped in some mud ponds, making it impossible to pull them out.

The night wind was a bit cold, and the wind was blowing in gusts, and the wheat seedlings in the field were rustling and shaking, as if the × people were walking out of the field. We walked silently, but kept our eyes wide open, conducting vigilance.

The sound of guns and cannons was still lively, and the red light was still so brilliant, so dazzling, like the moment the sun first comes out.

After passing through the warning line, we finally returned to the small room where we lived. Pushing the door open and looking inside, the room was full of more than ten comrades sleeping everywhere.

"Hey, haven't you eaten yet?" The only female comrade who hadn't fallen asleep yet, wearing her tweed coat, climbed up from a pile of sorghum stalks and greeted us.

"Not yet, have you eaten yours?"

"Yes!" she replied simply, and then lifted a basket of dry cold rice from the table and handed it to us; "Eat quickly! Eat quickly!"

We chewed a mouthful of dry cold rice and couldn't swallow it anymore. We looked at her pitifully, "Is there any vegetables?"

"No."

"Is there any salt?"

"No either!"

"Ah!" Everyone couldn't help but laugh.

We swallowed two mouthfuls of dry cold rice wolfishly, considering it a meal. But how to sleep? So many people in one place, and there is also a female comrade!

This female comrade's surname is Tang. It is said that when our troops were stationed in De'an, Jiangxi, she resolutely abandoned her family and school and joined our troops. This rare thing was reported in large print in the Jiangxi newspaper at that time. For this young female comrade, although others had a dismissive attitude towards her because of her working ability, I admired her very much. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, out of the 225 million female compatriots who account for the entire population, how many have sacrificed everything and come to the front line like her? Just for this point alone, I think she is worthy of admiration.

"Get up, re-spread it so that we can sleep well. Otherwise, how can so many people sleep?"

"Get up, those who don't want to be slaves!..." Comrade Tang sang the March of the Volunteers in a funny way, which made the people who were being attacked by sleep couldn't help but laugh.

One to the east, one to the west, the people who were just about to fall asleep unwillingly climbed up. Everyone moved the table and the pile of furniture away, and each person was busy spreading the prepared gray felt on the ground. Comrade Tang also joined this lively competition, spreading the gray felt on the ground on the side near the door. Everything was covered with gray felt, but I was still holding my gray felt in my hand without a place to put it down.

"Where is the place where I sleep?"

"Isn't it possible to sleep next to Comrade Tang?" Everyone looked at me with a smile, as if they had done something得意.

"There..." I was embarrassed by the laughter, and couldn't help but laugh foolishly with them, and the room was filled with the energetic laughter of young people.

Looking at the unrestrained and frank way Comrade Tang was sleeping there, I also obediently laid down my gray felt. Contrary to my expectations, the laughter also disappeared with it. All that could be heard in the room was the sound of cannons outside the door ringing fiercely...

### "Eating Arsenic to Kill Tigers"

— Hua Fu

Smart people in the world will never die out. They say: The first thing is to harm others to benefit oneself: the second thing is to benefit oneself and others: the third thing is - no, the third thing is terrible -, the third thing is not to harm oneself and others: as for the fourth, to benefit others without benefiting oneself, only the greatest fools in the world would be willing to do so, and it is even more terrible! In short, smart people have their own unique spirit. They want to live and not die. Even if they have to settle for the next best thing, they should live evilly rather than die well. They say that it is better to live badly than to die well, so eating arsenic to kill tigers becomes the object of their ridicule.

When they encounter a tiger, they must offer pigs and sheep to satisfy the tiger's appetite. When there are no pigs and sheep, the tiger stares at them, seemingly wanting to get them to be satisfied, and they at most avoid it and never dare to resist. They say, the tiger is such a huge creature, how dare we touch its hair and ask for trouble. If they see that they can't escape, they can only kneel on the ground and beg pitifully. Even when the tiger opens its mouth to swallow them, even though they have arsenic in their hands, they are unwilling to stuff it into their own mouths, hoping that they can eventually be "spared from the tiger's mouth." But the result of such people, we can imagine, is nothing more than being a snack for the tiger without any mercy.

Any smart person in the world may not see a tiger wanting to eat him, and indeed be so stupid. However, there are indeed such smart people in the world who see a crisis that is as likely to kill them as a tiger, and if they can't escape or fight, they never dare to bravely go to their death and fight to the death. They only want to beg, and are indeed doing the business of "asking for the tiger's skin." They say that survival is the first priority; mutual destruction is not worthwhile.

They dream of "coexistence and co-prosperity" with the tiger; they think that the tiger also has humanity and can reason with it; they even think that even if they are eaten by the tiger, they can still survive in another way - as a changgui (a ghost that serves the tiger). Getting employed by the tiger master. Therefore, they think that their theory is complete and the facts are thorough, and they have long been in an invincible position. As long as they seek peace with the tiger, they can live in this way or in that way. Only resisting the tiger is, in their view, the end of the road.

In fact, tigers are often "paper tigers." Once they are pierced, their ugliness is exposed. Even if they are not paper tigers, they are just "dog-headed tigers." Based on their instincts, they can only steal pigs and sheep, and they don't have the courage and strength to eat people. As long as people see them, they will be given a head-on blow! Any weapon will do, it doesn't have to be a quick gun. If it really is a big worm with golden eyes and a white forehead that will indeed eat people, then we should fight desperately.

I praise the spirit of fighting some tigers. With this spirit, I think that if tigers were sentient, they would retreat three times. The ridicule of smart people is to prepare to be changgui. Since we are not prepared to be changgui, what do we care about ridicule! We base ourselves on this spirit, eradicate the tiger plague, and we can see the ridicule of smart people falling on their own heads.

### The Sea of Dreams

— Liu You

In the spring, the god of Xing Tang Rou, as a gust of gentle wind, sent me into the sea of dreams!

I floated in the sea of dreams, sailing in that flower-like boat, arbitrarily heading east and west!

The sea of dreams is great! This is a world of supreme bliss, with all the treasures that mankind does not have. There are Pearl Island, Rose Forest, beautiful birds skimming across the sky, and lively fish leaping on the seabed. The clear seawater is free from waves; this sea of dreams is full of pleasant air!

The boat moved forward and reached another world. The seawater was yellow, and the sky was covered with gray clouds. The fish in the port were staying in the water in a daze. How sad and desolate this is!

The boat only needs to have a way to go. She will not stop. One end of the sea of dreams is a terrible world. Thunderstorms and typhoons raise the waves, like mountains. The boat cannot stop. The big fish in the middle open their blood basins and swallow everything!

How terrible! The Sea of Dreams. I don't want to throw myself into it again!

I summoned up my courage. Bravely, I shook the boat, this terrible world!

The Sea of Dreams is vast and boundless. The power of the boat will never find land.

I can only clench my teeth, hold my breath, and jump from the boat into the air.

Sea of Dreams, this illusory vortex, I will never throw myself into your arms again!

### Liu Er Kills Bandits (Anti-Japanese Ballad)

— Jing Xi

Snow lies deep on the head of Changbai Mountain, the waters of the Heilong River flow clear. Near the mountain and by the water lives a farmer named Liu Er, who diligently cultivates wheat year after year. He enjoys the four seasons, working from sunrise to sunset. He hates only the unprovoked invasion of the ×× pirates, who turn every place their soldiers reach into a desolate village. Women are raped, men are murdered. This Liu Er was forced by the pirates to carry ammunition, whipped day and night like an animal. One day, he followed the army to outside the gate of Suqian City, where the Japanese devils set up camp in formation.

Our planes roared in the sky, the sound of cannons shook the earth like thunder. Loyal and brave soldiers shouted as one, the bandit soldiers scattered like startled birds and beasts. Liu Er saw the bandit soldiers scatter, and a patriotic heart arose spontaneously. In the blink of an eye, he seized a Japanese rifle and began to fight the bandit soldiers. Although surrounded by countless bandit soldiers, Liu Er didn't care. He shot at those far away and stabbed those nearby, killing countless bandit soldiers. As he fought, he shouted: "Now is the time to achieve merit and kill bandits!" His shouts echoed across the fields, and the forced cooks were moved to tears. They immediately rose up within the bandit camp, their shouts shaking the earth and mountains. The cooks moved the gun troops from behind, trapping the bandit soldiers on both sides. Under the artillery fire, they met their end. The beautiful rivers and mountains were returned to China as before, and our army celebrated with joy. This is the story of Liu Er killing bandits, may our compatriots love their country and family, and may their descendants resist the invaders.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

In a state between sleeping and waking, she sometimes covered her head with the blanket, sometimes let her hands and feet fall outside the blanket, and sometimes drew out a hum, a sigh, a broken cry. Was her restless sleep disturbed by the snow? No, the snow in Manchuria disturbs those who peacefully sleep in Manchuria.

She woke up a few times, each time raising her head to look under the window, and then letting her head fall back onto the pillow. Because the snowy night in Manchuria was still outside the window. This night, she felt, was the longest night of her life.

When she woke up, it was still dark; because the factory sirens nearby rang, starting to order workers to start the machines, and incidentally waking her up.

The snow outside the window had been falling all night, and it still didn't stop. The snow on the road was already more than a foot deep, and the tall walls of the past were a few feet shorter. The snow seemed to be angry.

The gloomy morning light gradually brightened in the darkness. On the flagpole by the Songhua River that hadn't been broken by the storm, the flag that betrayed the motherland would be raised again. Was the snow in Manchuria angry for that reason?

She got up in unrest, more tired than before she slept, and walked to the window. The inner window was warmed by the fire wall and was as clear as usual, while the outer window was frozen with thick frost flowers; her gaze to the outside was blocked by the frost flowers. She opened the inner window and used her breath to melt a cluster of frost flowers on the outer window, casting her gaze through. The street outside the window, in the hazy tone, was still familiar; but the most familiar home was far away, as if it were beyond the sky. Even if dreams grew wings, it would be difficult to fly there. She wanted to break through the outer window and jump down regardless of the height below; but the outer window was nailed shut with long nails. The home she had once grown tired of walking to now evoked her longing. A mere night of separation felt like an eternity of thousands of years, so when would the distant years to come end... She dared not think anymore, thinking further would be like a long journey for a tired traveler. The longing of people grows more distant the more they think about it.

Later, she fell asleep more peacefully in bed. Her sleeping posture was like that of a homeless stray dog, lodging in a stranger's house on a wandering journey, restraining its limbs, with uneasy small movements, presumptuousness, worry, and fear still remaining in its sleeping expression. (April 5th)
