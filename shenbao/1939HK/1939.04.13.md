### European Situation and the Far East

Since Italy forcefully occupied Albania and pressed towards Greece, the situation in Central and Southern Europe has suddenly become very tense. On one hand, Germany and Italy seem inclined to actively invade and annex small countries in Central and Southern Europe in a coordinated manner. On the other hand, Britain and France are also busy preparing for active resistance. According to a report by the Associated Press today, "The British and French fleets have received secret orders from their governments to control key military points and are now concentrating in the Mediterranean." It is also reported that Britain is preparing to acquire Corfu through diplomatic means as a naval base to resist Italy. Britain has also notified Italy: "Any act of invading Greek territory, whether ports or islands, will provoke war." However, Italy not only shows no sign of backing down but also appears to be actively collaborating with Germany for larger-scale military operations. The situation in Central and Southern Europe can be said to be extremely tense, with the possibility of conflict erupting at any moment.

In this situation, the attitude of the British government is of course the first thing to note. Although Chamberlain has repeatedly warned Italy and reached a consensus with France to concentrate the navies of both countries at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea, Chamberlain's current approach still consists of trying to seek compromise with Mussolini, even to the point of recognizing Italy's annexation of Albania. News from London reports how Britain is supposedly being proactive and issuing warnings to Italy, but on the other hand, the British Foreign Office denies "the government has warned Italy not to invade Corfu and stated that such an action would lead to war." This is Britain's consistent attitude of showing weakness to German and Italian aggressors. No wonder "Le Petit Parisien" predicts that Britain will "not go so far as to declare the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16, 1938, invalid."

What we should emphasize is that for Britain to actively adopt methods to resist the powerful, all countries, large and small, in Central and Southern Europe, even all countries, whether in the East or West, that are being invaded or are upholding peace, must genuinely unite to resist the aggressors in a collective security manner. Action must be active, and the scale must be broad. The current situation is already quite mature. Not only have all the small countries sincerely accepted Britain's guarantees and mutual assistance agreements, but some countries have also expressed willingness to join the European peace front. It is reported that Chamberlain will announce to the House of Commons on Thursday that "Greece and Turkey have joined the European peace front," which undoubtedly shows that collective action in Central and Southern Europe to resist aggression is becoming increasingly mature. Here, one point that Britain and France should pay attention to in organizing this anti-aggression front is that the participation of the Soviet Union has enormous power. The news reported from London, "Britain and France are now conducting closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries," is a very good trend. We also hope that Britain and France can make this effort more active and not harbor expectations regarding Italy's actions. Britain and France must understand that the Soviet Union has already earnestly sought to unite with Turkey. The result of this union is sufficient to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait, posing a great obstacle to Germany and Italy's eastward advance. At the same time, the Soviet Union and Greece are also seeking military cooperation. If this plan succeeds, even if Romania and Poland are unwilling to connect, their strength will be sufficient to resist the joint actions of Italy and Bulgaria.

Amidst the tense situation in Europe, the war in the Far East is also becoming increasingly urgent. On the one hand, the Japanese army is actively reinforcing troops in various parts of North, Central, and South China, attempting to actively attack us. But on the other hand, our army's preparations on all fronts have also been completed, and counterattacks have been launched, with considerable progress in military operations on various fronts. Today, when the situation in Europe is tense, it is a natural tendency for Japan to actively attack China. However, the point that should be brought to the attention of all countries opposing aggression is that the actions of the world's aggressors are consistent. Although Japan's elder statesmen, senior officials, and even some influential figures in the financial world oppose further expansion of military operations, the fanatical young military officers are precisely trying to use this good opportunity to expand their plans and suppress domestic anti-war sentiments and actions. Regarding this major trend, we hope that Britain, the United States, and France will not forget this Eastern aggressor taking advantage of the situation to loot. It is faintly heard that Britain has decided to prepare for a powerful counterattack against Japan's aggression. It is also heard that the United States will discuss the issue of prohibiting the sale of arms to Japan in the House of Representatives and is considering providing loans to our country to aid the war of resistance as much as possible. Even regarding the Neutrality Act, some members of Congress have proposed amendments because the act is unfavorable to China. In any case, Britain and the United States should take more active action against Japan. Only when countries committed to peace in the East and West take active action and cooperate effectively can they have the practical effect of preventing aggression.

### The Path to Victory in the War of Resistance Opened Up by Chinese Youth

— By J. Gordan, translated by Mei Zhen

In China, the most noteworthy thing in the past few months is the increasing solidarity of all parties and factions, and the establishment of a fundamentally proactive and victorious foundation for the war of resistance on all fronts nationwide. In this unity and victorious development of the war of resistance, Chinese young students have exerted tremendous power.

When Wang Jingwei exposed his true colors in December last year, betrayed the motherland, advocated surrendering to Japanese militarism, and sued for peace with the Japanese government, he did not receive any support in all of China. Although he was once one of the highest leaders of the Kuomintang and the chairman of the Central Political Committee, only a very small number of isolated individuals ran away with him. The Chinese people and youth unanimously condemned this traitorous action. Within a few days of his defection, news of Wang Jingwei's expulsion from the Kuomintang spread immediately, and military leaders across the country jointly signed and issued a declaration denouncing Wang Jingwei as a traitor and demanding severe punishment. The leader of the Chinese government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, also issued a statement to the public within a few days, expressing his determination to persevere in unity and resist aggression to the end. Tens of thousands of resolutions from all sectors of the Chinese people poured into Chongqing like an angry tide, unanimously condemning Wang Jingwei, expressing support for the central government, and resolving to continue the war of resistance. Various youth and student organizations in China expressed their support for this policy of resistance and passed resolutions demanding Wang Jingwei's arrest.

Since Wang Jingwei left the motherland, the internal political unity of China has greatly developed. Because when Wang Jingwei was still in the country, he and his henchmen constantly engaged in secret conspiracies, provoking conflicts between various parties, especially between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At the same time, he also used various methods to provoke conflicts between the people and the government, causing the people to abandon the national policy of resisting aggression. But after Wang Jingwei defected from China, the power of this kind of activity has been greatly weakened. Now, the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is closer than before. They have also established a joint committee. At the same time, the unity of the Chinese youth movement has also been strengthened. For example, the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League established by the government in June last year initially had restrictions in its constitution on members of other parties and factions joining, but now, any young person, regardless of party or faction, can freely join the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League. (The Communist Party resolved at the Sixth Plenary Session not to recruit members and develop organizations within the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League of the Kuomintang - translator's note)

This unity and significance of the war of resistance was clearly expressed at the Fifth Plenary Session held in Chongqing in late January of this year (1939). At this meeting, Chairman Chiang said:

"The Chinese people must continue to resist aggression until final victory. The frustration of Japan's military plans, the failure of its policy of establishing a puppet regime, and the deterioration of the domestic situation all clearly indicate the collapse of Japan's adventure in China. China will never compromise or make concessions!"

At the end of the Fifth Plenary Session, a message to the people of the whole country was issued, encouraging the people to persevere in the war of resistance and commending the heroic achievements of the soldiers on the front lines across the country. It also passed a bill to step up economic construction in the western provinces and issued a declaration stating that the unity of the Chinese people, the unity of purpose, and the bravery of the soldiers are the foundation for China's final victory. The Fifth Plenary Session advanced an important step on the road to unity and resistance. Youths and students across the country again supported this meeting with demonstrations and resolutions.

Due to the strengthening of China's internal unity, the past two months, from a military point of view, have become months of victory in the war of resistance. Since the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, the Japanese army has not advanced; in many places, they have retreated. The Chinese army in Shanxi, under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army, launched a general counterattack at the beginning of January this year and recovered several important places. (The areas of Daning, Jile, Pu County, etc., in the Lvliang Mountains were recovered. Following the smashing of the Japanese army's eight-pronged attack on the Jin-Cha-Ji border region and the attack on northwestern Shanxi in December last year, the Japanese army's attack on western Shanxi was also crushed. Now, the Japanese army's attack on southern Shanxi towards the Zhongtiao Mountains is encountering a disastrous defeat under the heroic resistance of the Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi army - translator's note) This means that Japan's long-planned plan to cross the Yellow River to attack Shaanxi has not yet begun to be implemented.

In the first week of February, Chinese guerrillas destroyed a total of thirty-eight Japanese army locomotives, one hundred and forty-eight various types of military vehicles, three thousand and nine hundred meters of railways, and fourteen bridge piers, and killed eight hundred Japanese soldiers. These figures are only the result of one week of battles along the Pinghan Railway in North China. In the past two months, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also been repeatedly cut off. Guerrilla forces in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui have all achieved important victories. They fought a total of two hundred and fifty-six battles, killing twelve thousand five hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing two hundred and fourteen machine guns and three thousand six hundred and fifty rifles. In Guangdong Province, the battles are still taking place around Guangzhou. Although the Japanese army has sent a large number of reinforcements, it has not been able to make significant progress.

The Japanese air force, based in Hankou, constantly carries out cruel bombings against Chinese civilians and undefended cities as retaliation for the Chinese people's resistance to Japan. Several small cities in Guangdong have been bombed thirty-six times in fourteen days. In the bombing of Wanxian, Sichuan Province, last week, one thousand people died tragically. Chongqing, the temporary capital of China, has also suffered severely. But this random destruction and slaughter by the Japanese army only serves to strengthen the anger and will to resist aggression of the Chinese people.

In the heroic war of resistance, Chinese youth and students have played a significant role. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, they are doing educational and relief work. The work of popular education carried out by youth and student organizations is developing. For example, six hundred literacy classes for the common people have recently been opened in Chongqing. They hope to eliminate illiteracy in Chongqing by the end of 1939. An educational boat, carrying various educational supplies, books, maps, films, wireless radios, singing groups, and theatrical troupes, etc., is run by youths and students, traveling back and forth in the rivers of the mountains, conducting extensive propaganda and education work.

On the front lines and in the guerrilla areas, Chinese youths are doing a lot of heroic work. In the Eighth Route Army, in the Fifth Route Army, in the New Fourth Army, and in other central armies, the achievements of youth in serving the war of resistance are especially admired by all parties. In Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, youths are stepping up military training. At the Anti-Japanese University in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, there are a total of fifty thousand youths waiting to enroll. There, tens of thousands of students are receiving training in guerrilla warfare, the popular united front, and international knowledge. The number of students reporting to the National Military Academy is so large that it is difficult for the school authorities to choose. A new military school has also been established in the so-called occupied areas of Shanxi, Chahar, and Hebei (located in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region - ××××××), giving youths three months of guerrilla training.

In recent months, China's war of resistance has been developing victoriously, and unity has been strengthened. The Japanese authorities, who used to boast that they could conquer China in eight to ten months, are now forced to shout the necessity of a protracted war, "either ten years or twenty years." In this struggle to lead China to final victory, Chinese youths have shouldered the most important task.

### The Growing New China

— By Saiga Mirof, translated by Yi Chou

China’s war of liberation against foreign invaders has entered its second stage. Under the pressure of the superior mechanized forces of the × people, Guangzhou and Hankou have fallen. The Japanese’s ultimate attempt to weaken the main force of the Chinese army is to adopt an encircling strategy on the front along the Yellow River, but this has met with complete failure. The strength of the Chinese army has not only been preserved but has also become more intelligent in terms of combat. To be sure, the Chinese army now has almost two hundred and forty divisions, each with ten thousand soldiers. This is a significant increase compared to the beginning of the war. Each soldier in the Chinese army has improved in war technology. If it is said that at the beginning of the first phase, the losses of the Chinese army were in a ratio of three to one, then at the end of the first phase, it was in a ratio of one to one. As for the battles in the second phase, it is as General Chiang Kai-shek said: “The Chinese army, according to the quality of its own war, each Chinese soldier will be equal to three dispirited Japanese soldiers.”

The extension of the front line is four thousand miles. This has caused Japan to face a very serious offensive strategy. Therefore, their movements have to be called changes. Once the Japanese army penetrates into the mountainous areas, it loses the possibility of simultaneously attacking with its army, navy, air force, and mechanized units. When the Chinese army prepares to implement a counterattack, the Japanese army will inevitably be forced to abandon its excessively dispersed parts and shrink to its main strongholds and transportation lines.

In preparation for “resistance to the end,” China has rapidly planned to develop its economic base in the western and southwestern provinces. Many highways have been built in Sichuan Province. According to a report in the "North China Daily News": In January of this year, the construction of railways has begun in various parts of southwestern China. The first railway line will reach the border of Burma. This railway is of great significance to the Chinese economy; at the same time, it makes it possible for the supply of foreign military supplies to be imported into China.

The establishment of Chinese industry usually focused on the coastal areas. Now, the industries in the mainland of China have all been moved to western China. Many enterprises in the coastal provinces have been destroyed by Japan; however, the Chinese government has relocated many of the more important factories to the deep interior.

From the development of industry, many “inexhaustible” resources have also been discovered. Sichuan Province has a large amount of coal deposits, estimated at over 100 million tons. The coal mined in 1939 will reach over 2 million tons; while in 1938, only 1 million tons were mined. West of Chongqing, there are two counties called Weiyuan and Ziliujing, where there are very rich oil deposits.

There is also a county called Qijiang, where iron ore has been found, and 4 million tons of iron can be obtained every month. Copper mines have also begun to be found in western Sichuan; at the same time, gold mines have also been discovered. Over three hundred enterprises have been moved from other provinces. Most have already started work, and there is also a slightly larger chemical factory moved from Tianjin.

Guizhou, the neighboring province of Sichuan, is the largest source of sugar for Sichuan Province. Its animal husbandry is also quite developed, possessing many abundant natural resources of various kinds: steel, iron, coal, and water-resistant mineral resources. These mines have begun to be mined. In addition, gold mines have been discovered in twenty counties. Road construction is also quite developed. Currently, almost one hundred thousand workers are building roads paved with crushed stone. In the future, these roads will be converted into railways. There is also a long crushed stone road connecting Chongqing and Kunming.

Not long ago, Xikang, the newly established province, is also the best area for developing industry and has abundant water sources. There is a railway from Ya'an to Kangding. This railway is also being built by one hundred thousand people. A railway is also being prepared from Lubian to Yunnan. This railway passes through Xichang and directly to Huili—a place where iron, coal, lead, silver, and other mines are stored. It is a large industrial area in western China.

This is the resources and foundation that New China is preparing for a long-term war for the independence and freedom of its country.

In nineteen months of war, Japanese invaders have occupied nine of China’s twenty-eight provinces. Although, of these seven hundred and ninety-six counties, only fifty-nine are under Japanese control. The remaining four hundred and eighty-nine counties are still under the jurisdiction of the Central Government of China.

The Chinese people are determined to fight the foreign invaders for “final victory.” This principle has been clearly indicated by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Not only has the unity of the military and the people been strengthened, but the foundation for permanent cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has also been consolidated.

Fighting for the independence of their country, the heroic Chinese people have raised their political activities to an unlimited extent at this time. The broad masses of the people are constantly expressing their own political tendencies within the Kuomintang. It is difficult for general compromisers to adhere to their policies of surrender and betrayal! The emerging reserve army - Chinese patriots - joined the Kuomintang. In their struggle against Japanese imperialism, it has undoubtedly increased the number of progressive elements. Facts of great significance, its foundation has been increasingly consolidated.

### A Small Town on the Coast of Tokyo Bay

— Communication from Qisha, Guo Ji

Perhaps the name "Qisha" cannot be found on the full map of the Republic of China, but the detailed full map of Guangdong Province must contain the two characters for "Qisha."

Since the bloody clutches of Japanese fascists extended into South China, especially under the tense situation of the × people landing here several times recently and being repelled by us, Qisha, this small town near the coast of Tokyo Bay, has attracted attention. Of course, Qisha's ability to attract attention is because it is located on the front line of Fangcheng at the right wing of Qinlian; at the same time, it also occupies an important position in transportation and production. In terms of transportation, it can be accessed by both water and land to the north, and by sea to French Vietnam to the south. It faces Beihai and Weizhou Island across the sea to the east, and can be reached directly to the county by road to the west. Although the military authorities have ordered it to be thoroughly destroyed for the sake of the war of resistance, the waterway can still be freely accessible. In terms of production, food is very scarce. The largest products here are fish and salt. Many fish and salt from Nanlu and Guangxi are transported and sold through Qisha. Before the "June 1st" incident, the Guangdong Provincial Government had sent technicians here several times to conduct inspections, intending to build Qisha into a fishing port.

In September last year, Japanese fascist aircraft dropped more than forty bombs here, creating an unprecedented disaster in Qisha. Afterwards, many people had moved back to live and do business, but after a short time, the situation deteriorated again. Reports of × soldiers invading were frequently reported, and the tragedy of × people burning boats was often seen. Especially recently, × planes bombarding today, × ships shelling tomorrow, fishing is not possible, business cannot be done. Therefore, many widows and orphans, merchants, etc. have continued to move towards the interior; there are also several wealthy people who were too panicked and have taken their body taxes and bought boats to flee to Annam. However, for this kind of opportunistic, cowardly behavior of greed for life and fear of death, the local people not only verbally ridiculed them as "double-dealing traitors," but also took strong action. I remember at a meeting of the masses, someone proposed to "confiscate" all the property of the wealthy who fled to Vietnam - to be used for the expenses of the Self-Defense Corps and the training of strong men. This proposal gave the fugitives a head-on blow!

The people in the coastal area of Qisha have a great sense of unity and are very brave. Since × ships and × aircraft often shelled and bombed, and wanted to land here several times, the local people felt the threat, so they all responded to the government's call and participated in military training and armed organization.

The town of Qisha has a total population of over seven thousand, with about one thousand people living on the street. There were no less than three hundred households, but unfortunately, more than one hundred households have now entrusted Mr. Lockhead and General Menshen to guard them. People walking on the streets cannot help but feel a sense of silence, desolation, and terror! However, sometimes you still encounter three or five innocent, naughty children picking up fragments in the rubble piles under the ruined walls, competing to throw them into the bomb marks; at the same time, they open their mouths and sing loudly, "Vegetable seeds fall to the ground and will germinate, hatred will also take root after a long time, if the × people are not driven out, how much seawater will not wash away this great hatred..."

The small Qisha has been bombed beyond recognition, the body of Qisha has been broken under the executioner, but the anti-× emotions of the people of Qisha are like the seawater inside Tokyo Bay. Every day they are surging, surging, and rushing.

### From Hengyang to Shaoguan: A Friend of China in China (6)

— Ye Juesun

At five o'clock, Li Meng was already calling me outside the window. If he hadn't shone a flashlight on the glass window, I wouldn't have been able to see anything outside at all, because it rained last night and the sky looked particularly dark. I answered him and got up. I didn't even bother to open my bedding last night, so after getting up, I quickly packed up the few small items of luggage I had brought with me. At this time, the liaison officer sent by Li Jingyi also arrived, and the four of us jumped into the black car of the Garrison Headquarters. We left Hengyang City in the gloomy and damp morning. The car stopped next to the Xiang River, and the driver got out of the car to wake up the old man who drove the ferry. Sitting in the car, we looked out at the center of the river and could see several large white pillars, because the original plan was to build a large bridge in Xiangting to connect the Yuehan Railway and the Xianggui Railway, but later, due to the situation, the road was abandoned halfway. Although this was a military reason that had to be done, as a result, the Yuehan Railway locomotive could not be pulled to the Xianggui Railway, and in fact, the Xianggui Railway did feel a considerable shortage of locomotives.

After crossing the Xiang River, we quickly arrived at the Yuehan Railway Station, which is a rather magnificent white cement building, towering majestically on the plain. It is said that the roof of this building was hit by a bomb from an enemy plane, but because of its solid texture, it has always been safe and sound. I shone my flashlight on it and carefully inspected it, and sure enough, many of the glass windows had been shattered. When we entered the station, it was not yet seven o'clock, and the station was full of people waiting for the train. It is said that some of them were homeless refugees, and they had to use the station as a temporary dormitory. The train was not scheduled to leave until 7:30, and the wind outside was strong. So we sneaked into the station's office to squat and warm ourselves by the fire. The atmosphere in the office was very tense, with people holding red-edged flags constantly going in and out. Several administrators on the night shift were still radiating energy, holding a telephone in one hand and a red pencil in the other. They greeted us briefly and then buried themselves in their work. Because I had an old friend, Sun Weiqi, working as a staff officer in the Transportation Headquarters here, I asked the liaison officer who came with me to give him a card and two copies of the Ten-Day Literary Extracts from the National Salvation Daily, expressing that I couldn't visit him because of the rush of time. Unexpectedly, this poet-soldier actually came in with the liaison officer of the Garrison Headquarters. His sleepy eyes smiled into two thin lines, because he was also on duty last night. Of course, as the saying goes, "meeting an old friend in a foreign land," we chatted happily. "The No. 24 train is about to leave!" the administrator informed us. We left the office and squeezed through the crowd of passengers onto the first-class sleeper car on the Yuehan Railway. Everything here was much more beautiful than on the Xianggui Railway. The rooms not only had very elaborate beds, but also leather sofas, and various lights with different brightness were installed at the head and foot of the beds. Mrs. Li Meng said, "This is really a wartime international train, so luxurious!" I thought that "wartime" at most only referred to the situation of the passengers! If I hadn't come here myself, who would have believed that the Yuehan Railway, after more than a year of crazy bombing, still had such facilities. The train, amidst the sound of the whistle, left Hengyang Station. Because everyone hadn't slept well last night, now that there were such comfortable berths, they naturally didn't want to easily let go of the opportunity, so everyone burrowed into the clean white woolen blankets and slept soundly.

I didn't get up until ten o'clock. The weather was very cold. Both sides of the Yuehan Railway were high mountains. In the distance, the mountain peaks were vaguely shrouded in thick black smoke, making it impossible to tell whether it was fog or clouds. The north wind blew, and they floated lightly in all directions. By the time the smoke became thin, it seemed that the mountain peaks were already covered with drizzle. The weather can indeed affect people's feelings, and my friends couldn't help but feel a bit sad and desolate. Therefore, I unintentionally began to recite the "Wandering Song": "Tearfully bid farewell to the white mountains and black waters, traveled all over the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, wandering, wandering..." Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were very familiar with the tune of this song. They said that in Chongqing, in Hong Kong, in Yunnan, this song was popular everywhere. After I explained the meaning of this song to them, I also told them that the second part of this song was first broadcast on Guangzhou Radio by our Customs National Salvation Long March Team. Because after the fall of Shanghai, we came to Hong Kong with the author of this song, Liu Xueliang, and Mr. Liu completed this famous song that everyone sang on this journey full of wandering emotions. Therefore, the two of them resolutely made a wish to learn the Wandering Song before arriving in Shaoguan, followed by, wandering, fleeing, how many years will we wander until? Where will we flee to?…Strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation! The carriage of the No. 24 train on the Yuehan Railway added a lot of wandering atmosphere. The train seemed like a cunning mountain hare, constantly burrowing from one tunnel into another. The treacherous terrain of the Yuehan Railway (especially from Binzhou to Lechang, Shaoguan), the number of tunnels, is probably beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The reason why Japanese planes have been bombing for nine months a year and ultimately cannot damage a single train is of course because there are tunnels everywhere here that are sufficient to protect it. After the fall of Guangzhou, the × people repeatedly spread rumors that they would advance north along the Yuehan Railway, but it never materialized. Although the most important reason was still a lack of strength, the treacherous terrain was indeed one of the reasons that increased the concerns of the Japanese warlords. The sky gradually darkened. At more than nine o'clock on the evening of the eighteenth, the train sped into Shaoguan Station in the night.

### Fierce Fighting South of Nanchang, × Crossing the Jin River Being Intercepted, Our Army in Guangdong Province Recaptures Huaxian

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] In all battlefields, we are gradually taking the initiative. Our troops counterattacking Nanchang fiercely fought with × 20 kilometers south of the city on the 12th. We recaptured Gao'an. Two regiments of × continued to invade westward on the 12th, attempting to cross the Jin River. We are intercepting them. There are no new additions of × in Jiangxi. However, some of the existing troops have not yet participated in the battle. We are closely monitoring their movements.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] Our counterattack in central Hubei is progressing smoothly. From the Xiang River to the west of the railway line, everything is under our control. × on the east bank of the Xiang River has been wiped out by one-third. Only six or seven hundred × are stubbornly resisting in Zhongxiang City. We have surrounded it and are attacking the county town.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] According to well-informed Chinese military sources, fierce fighting has been taking place between Chinese and Japanese troops in the northeast of Gao'an, Jiangxi Province, for several days. The situation remained in stalemate yesterday, with no major changes in any of the positions. A fierce battle is expected in the triangular area of Gao'an, Nanchang, and Fengxin, as both Chinese and Japanese sides have large forces preparing for battle. On Sunday last week, the Chinese army once broke through the Japanese army's position near Fengxin. Later, 2,000 Japanese reinforcements arrived and attempted a counterattack in Gaoyou City, 10 kilometers east of Gao'an. According to another report, the Japanese army, near Pingjiang, Hunan, is attacking in two routes, one from Wuning in northern Jiangxi and the other from Tongcheng. According to the Chinese army, the Japanese army's fierce attacks between Gao'an and Nanchang are aimed at gathering the Chinese army from Xiushui and Pingjiang in one spot, attempting a major decisive battle. The Chinese army near Wuning, in order to avoid the pressure of Japanese reinforcements, abandoned several important strongholds.

[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 11th Dispatch] Three hundred × infantrymen, with two artillery pieces, were completely surrounded by us in the mountain depression near Shimen, west of Liangjiadu. A × battalion commander was also among them. The × are being suppressed by us layer by layer, and most of them have been wiped out. The remaining × are being annihilated.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 12th Morning, 10 AM Dispatch] According to a telephone call from the front, our unit has been fiercely counterattacking Huaxian for days. × are under great pressure and have retreated into the city to resist stubbornly. Our vanguard troops have repeatedly attacked into the city, resulting in street battles. Then our main force surrounded them and completely defeated the main force of × on the night of the 9th. Our army then completely recovered Huaxian.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 12th Morning, 11 AM Dispatch] More than 10,000 × soldiers moved from Jing'an to the Tongshan Chongyang area last night, seemingly with the intention of actively invading northern Hunan.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 11th Dispatch] According to a report from the front, our unit, in cooperation with guerrilla forces, launched a fierce attack on the × at Xisai Matang the other day, killing more than 300 × soldiers, capturing more than 100 ×, and seizing more than 100 × rifles. Our army also suffered minor casualties.

Our Army Enters Kaifeng

[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch] According to a Japanese report, about 2,000 Chinese troops counterattacked Kaifeng yesterday, setting fire to the police station in the southwestern part of the city and fiercely attacking the train station with light artillery and light machine guns, but were eventually repelled.

[Haitong News Agency, Beiping, 11th Dispatch] According to a Japanese announcement, when six heads of the puppet provisional government and the Pacification Committee held a meeting in Kaifeng on the 9th of this month, several strong men suddenly broke into the meeting hall from the Japanese compound and opened fire. All six of them were killed on the spot. Among those assassinated was the chairman of the puppet Pacification Committee. The Japanese claimed that these strong men were all Chinese disguised as Japanese and fled without a trace after the incident.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] According to a Chinese report, the Chinese army in Henan broke through the Japanese army's defense line west of Kaifeng and has recovered the Kaifeng military station. Fierce street battles have broken out in Kaifeng City. At the same time, the Chinese army attacked Tongxu, south of Kaifeng, and has completely besieged it.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 11th Dispatch] Our counterattack on the entire eastern Hubei front has been extremely successful. On both sides of the Hanxuan Highway, we have repeatedly captured key points. Xiaojiadian, between Zhongxiang and Dongqiao, was captured by us earlier, cutting off the retreat route of × in Zhongxiang. More than 1,000 × troops from Jingmen reinforced us, launching a fierce pincer attack. After our desperate resistance, the × eventually collapsed and retreated eastward. We are now pursuing × in Zhongxiang in two routes. Shagang, south of Zhongxiang, was also completely captured by us yesterday. Part of our army detoured to Jiukou and made great progress.

Jin × Is Weary of Running Around

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 12th Dispatch] Starting today, the × army is again attempting to invade our northwestern Shanxi. One route is from Qingshuihe to Pianguan, one route is from Shenchi to Wuzhai, and one route is from Jingle to Kelan. On the morning of the 7th, more than 1,000 × from Qingshuihe advanced south. One force engaged our army in a fierce battle at Dayuyaozi for three hours, while another force was repelled by us at Hongmenkou. Shenchi increased × by more than 30 trucks on the 9th, carrying five or six hundred soldiers. At 9 p.m., part of them entered Liuqing Village, and at noon on the 10th, they arrived at Laoyingpo. Another force attacked Sanjing Village via Yijing and Shenchi Village. At the same time, a × plane flew to Wuzhai and dropped several bombs. At 4 p.m., more than 200 × soldiers invaded Wuzhai County. As for the × at Jingle, with more than 400 infantry and artillery soldiers, they attacked Yaomafang along Jingda Avenue at 4 p.m. on the same day. Our unit fought back at Fucun. After a fierce battle for half a day, the × collapsed and retreated to Xihe. We are pursuing them.

[Central News Agency, Quyu, 12th Dispatch] More than 6,000 × bandits from Pingyao and Qixian attacked Zihongkou from Gu Kouzi Hongdongdong North Yijian and Dongpo Yapo (all southwest of Zihongkou) on the morning of the 11th. × The Pi'an Division has arrived in Qixian to command. Fierce fighting is now underway.

### Glorious Record of the Southern Battlefield: The Battle of Annihilation in Northern Guangdong; Successful Assault on the Guangzhou Outer Perimeter Line: A Conversation with a Certain Officer of Our Army

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 12th Dispatch] Since the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, our army has suddenly launched an attack near Conghua in the past ten days and will obtain extremely valuable combat results. This battle is actually a pivot for turning defeat into victory in the combat process in the southern battlefield. A reporter specially rushed to the front line in a certain place the other day, visited a certain officer, and sincerely extended congratulations, and also expressed condolences to the officers and soldiers on the front line. The officer humbly declined and said that this battle was only a small trial. Thanks to the guidance of the superiors and the courage of the comrades-in-arms, we were able to kill × and achieve results and destroy the fierce flames, which is really a great fortune. When the reporter asked about the process of our army's dispatch, the officer showed the maps since the battle and pointed them out diligently. It turned out that our military authorities had been planning carefully for several months. Taking advantage of the ×'s westward invasion of Jiangmen and Xinhui, they assigned a small unit to launch an attack on the outposts of the Guangzhou outer perimeter line. × were caught off guard. Although they were extremely tough and the 18th Division, 17th Regiment, and Abe's unit and Koga's unit fought back on the east and west banks of the Conghua Beijiang River, the army fought bravely for more than 100 hours. Therefore, they were able to complete the task, defeat the stubborn ×. In the battle of Shiqianshi on the 7th, we lured and surrounded more than 2,000 × in a certain area and carried out an annihilation battle with the spirit of brave and fearless attack, killing dozens of high-ranking officers such as Battalion Commander Mori Taro of the 17th Regiment, and capturing Shibuya Riichiro and other officers and soldiers. 23 people, the casualties of the soldiers have not yet been calculated, and a large number of light and heavy machine guns, horses, documents, and various weapons, ammunition, and luggage were seized and are being cleared up. The officer specifically pointed out that during the battle between our ×, the × only held their superior firepower and did not have the courage of the "meat bomb" attack in the Russo-Japanese War. When our army handed in the ×'s equipment, they all knelt on the ground and offered their guns to beg for life, and what we can be proud of is the love of our army towards the prisoners. The wounded are treated, and the hungry are given food, as if forgetting that they were our × people dozens of hours ago. It can be seen that the political education of our army has achieved great results, so that they can still abide by the humanitarianism of the supreme commander and treat the prisoners favorably amidst extreme excitement of feelings.

[Reuters, Macau, 12th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, Japanese sailors attempted to land at Tangjiawan, 20 miles north of Macau, but were unsuccessful, with about 12 people killed. According to female refugees, after the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the Japanese army looted ×× in Jiangmen. It is heard that the Japanese army is now working hard to restore commerce and develop Jiangmen, so they are trying their best to persuade residents to go there.

### One Week of Battle Situation, April 6th to April 12th — Announced by the Military Affairs Commission —

Our army took advantage of the remnants of the previous week's annihilation of × to exert strong pressure on the ×. The fierce battles were extremely intense. After the heavy casualties, the × were exhausted and defeated repeatedly. Famous cities and important strongholds have been repeatedly recovered. As of the time of reporting, this trend of victory in the north and south battlefields is actively unfolding.

Guangdong Area: More than 1,000 × from Zengcheng have been using fierce artillery fire for days to attack Pingfengling and Huluding in two routes in the east. After a brave counterattack, they have been defeated one by one, killing more than half of the ×. The county town has now been tightly surrounded. The × have made several attempts to break through unsuccessfully. More than 2,000 × from Conghua attacked Dawo Lang and Aotouxu in the morning and noon of the 6th. After flanking attacks on both sides, the ×'s connections were cut off. By the evening of the 8th, the entire line of × had collapsed, with more than 600 casualties. In the battle of Aotouxu, Battalion Commander Mori of the × Lin Division was shot and killed. ×'s panic is extreme. Along the Yuehan Railway, Xin Street, Dalang, and Guanyao were captured in succession on the 6th. Although the × have joined forces to counterattack for months, there have been no results. On both sides of the West River, the Xinhui Jiangmen area is still in a state of mixed war. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have all been captured one after another. More than 300 ×'s bodies were abandoned there. The remaining × are now continuing to be mopped up. More than 1,000 × troops and more than 20 tanks from Hainan Island launched repeated attacks on Anliang and Huangzhu in Ding'an County on the 7th and 8th. Our officers and soldiers waited for work and attacked head-on, killing more than 400 × and destroying 6 tanks. At the same time, another part of our army also took advantage of the situation to recover Ding'an City. After this major blow, ×'s ferocity was greatly reduced.

Jiangxi Area: More than 2,000 × facing Tang in Nanchang, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on us starting on the evening of the 6th. Our army bravely fought back, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. After a fierce battle for a day and a night, the position remained unshaken. We launched a counterattack at dawn on the 8th. The × collapsed in panic and fled north to Nanchang. We recovered the area. Gaotan County was also captured at the same time. The × retreated to Fengxin. After we took advantage of the victory to pursue them, Dacheng was recaptured. Meanwhile, we used powerful troops to pursue Fengxin. The entire line of × was shaken and fled one after another. On the afternoon of the 10th, × launched a large-scale reinforcement and counterattack. The battle situation was fierce. Because of the disparity in strength, our army in Gaoan still shifted to the original position to besiege the ×. The × suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and bodies were piled up like mountains. More than 7,000 × troops, more than 30 artillery pieces, and more than 30 aircraft from Wuning have been attacking us for days. An extremely tragic battle for was occurred in the Yantang Street area west of the city.

Hubei and Hunan Areas: In Hubei Province, our attacking troops have achieved three major victories this week. Our army advancing west in eastern Hubei, after fierce battles for three days on the 6th, 7th and 8th, successively captured Luwangcheng, Hua'erqiao, Wenkouzhen, and Wangjiadian, and are now continuing to advance south, encircling and annihilating the remaining × in Huang'an City. The vanguard of the army advancing north to attack Ying Mountain and Anlu, after recovering Haojiawan and Gongdian, the × trapped in the county town have become alarmed. They are now retreating to Huayuan and Xiaogan. Our army in central Hubei besieged Tiexiang, adopting a four-way pincer attack. On the 7th, they captured Xiaojiadian east of the city. On the 8th, they captured Xinei west of the city. On the 9th, they captured Yangzi Town north of the city. On the 11th, they captured the strongholds of Yuxinhe south of the city. The × stubbornly defended the isolated city, resisting fiercely. Our army braved the ×'s artillery fire and poison gas and bravely fought and killed. At noon on the 9th, they once attacked Beidou, killing countless ×. Because the three routes in eastern Hubei, northern Hubei, and central Hubei captured key points in succession, the × in Wuhan were extremely shocked and are now strengthening their fortifications, trying to put up a desperate fight. There have been no major changes in the battle situation in the Yueyang area of northern Hunan. The × on Junshan Island on the north bank of Dongting Lake were attacked by our troops on the 7th. The × stubbornly resisted relying on their dangerous position. They were finally captured on the morning of the 8th. The remnants of the enemy fled to Wulipai.

Shanxi Area: After the × invading the Zhongtiao Mountains from Anyi, Liancheng, and Yuxiang in southern Shanxi were defeated by us last week, more than 1,000 remnants of the × at Zhangdian Town resumed their activities on the 8th. Our army rushed to Zhen Dong and launched a fierce attack. The × abandoned more than 200 bodies and retreated. More than 4,000 × from Pingyao Jiexiu Lingshi in eastern Shanxi, accompanied by many artillery pieces and tanks, attacked Wanghe and Wangtaozhen (south of Pingyao) on the 11th. Our army bravely launched an attack, and after fierce battles for several days, wiped out a large number of ×. On the morning of the 8th, part of the × army had twice infiltrated Wanghe, but after a fierce counterattack, the ×'s attack was greatly frustrated. They are now facing off at Wangtao Shimen Zhenjie Wangfeng Village. More than 3,000 × from Huoxian did not retreat after invading Yangjiazhuang last week. This week, they continued to attack east with the same strength. After a week of bloody battle, the × have completely failed and their sacrifices have been extremely heavy, and the attack has been frustrated. A part of the × between Ningwu and Shenchi in northern Shanxi was subjected to a sudden and fierce attack by our army on the 9th, and the × were surrounded. The × stubbornly resisted to the death. After a fierce battle for three hours, most of them were wiped out. More than 100 remnants of the × collapsed and retreated to Ningwu. We are now pursuing them in victory and have pressed close to Ningwu City.

Other Areas: In addition, more than 3,000 × from Xinyang in the border area of Henan divided into three routes on the 8th, one crossing the river from Xi Bianhe, one heading to Yangliuhe, and one approaching the Zhe River and trying to break through west. A fierce battle broke out with our army attacking Xinyang. The battle was particularly fierce in the Yangliu River area. Our army attacked in separate directions and broke through the ×'s line. The encirclement continued to shrink. It will not be difficult to capture the desperate remnants of the ×. Near Kaifeng, our army suddenly attacked on the city walls with a large force at about 1:00 a.m. on the 11th, completely occupying the various key points and military stations in the suburbs of the city. The × stubbornly resisted the city. Then our army entered the city and the ×'s deaths and injuries were countless. The remnants of the × abandoned their equipment and fled. The county town was once recovered by us. Fierce battles are still ongoing. The × at Jintan Shenshui in southern Jiangsu suddenly increased to more than 5,000 on the 6th, with more than 70 tanks. On the 7th and 8th, they launched fierce attacks from Tianwang Temple and Lishui Road. Our army blocked them at Shennan and north of Xinqiao. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in the past month. Our vanguard bypassed the ×'s rear and cut off their retreat. The × were attacked from the front and rear, abandoning bodies all over the field. Another part of our army attacked Yixing's × in surprise. The × were caught off guard and collapsed and fled. We will capture Yi and recover it.

### Britain's Far East Policy Remains Unchanged; Sir Robert Craigie Makes a Statement in Japan After Returning from Shanghai; Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Passes Through Hong Kong Yesterday on His Way to Chongqing

[Chongqing, April 11th, Central News Agency] A Tokyo dispatch states that Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, after returning to Japan from Shanghai, made a special statement. He stated that his trip to China had no special mission and that Britain's Far East policy remains unchanged.

[Hong Kong News] British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, arrived in Hong Kong on the Taiyuan vessel from Shanghai. He arrived at 10:00 AM yesterday and immediately went to Government House for rest.

### American Newspapers Predict More Difficult Situation for Japanese Troops in the Coming Weeks; Invasion of Hunan Halted; Offensive Action by Chinese Forces Makes Response Difficult for Japanese

[New York, April 11th, Central News Agency] Regarding the war situation between China and Japan, the New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao published an editorial stating that the Japanese army's offensive against Hunan Province has clearly been hindered. If Chinese troops launch counter-offensives on multiple fronts, they can defeat the Japanese army in various lines and points they occupy in China. According to foreign military observers, if the Japanese army concentrates mechanized equipment to cover the advance of infantry, it can achieve its goals. Conversely, if the Japanese army's artillery and aircraft cannot exert their powerful firepower, and there are no large tank corps to cover them, they will not be able to effectively advance. The military authorities of that country have also gained painful experience and know that if the Japanese army engages in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, these Chinese troops, whether they are coolies or students, cannot be defeated by the Japanese army. Judging by this, if Chinese troops launch counter-offensives on more than ten fronts, the advantage of the Japanese army's mechanized equipment will be broken by the Chinese army. In addition, with the guerrillas disrupting the Japanese army's communication lines, the Japanese fantasy of exploiting China's resources will be destroyed. In short, the Japanese adventure in China will enter a critical juncture within a few weeks, it can be asserted.

### Wu Zhihui Writes an Article Strongly Denouncing Wang Jingwei (Continued from Yesterday)

(2) It is appropriate to disclose the records of the National Defense Conference to expose the rumors spread by Wang's faction in Hong Kong and elsewhere, claiming that Wang's declaration and the government were colluding in a double act. With the evidence revealed in the records, it is clear that the Nanjing meeting and Wang's declaration had no causal relationship whatsoever. It only reveals that Wang himself is a person who wavers between war and peace, seeking warmth from the cold. Moreover, in terms of a double act, Wang is wearing his hat askew, with white powder on his face, performing with his hands and feet on stage. Konoe is singing "New Order" behind his buttocks. Wang's hands and feet should move in sync, as if the words were coming from his own mouth. Suddenly, Mr. Chiang replaces him, vehemently refuting the "New Order." Wang remains frozen on stage, his hands and feet stiff and motionless. This allows the little brother watching the double act to judge with whom Wang is performing the double act. The little brother will exclaim, "What I am seeing is called 'Two Wei Change Yellow'," a joint performance by China and Japan, only a minor matter. I advise Wang, a big figure, not to pay attention. It would be even more unworthy to turn a major crime of leaking secret documents into a humorous anecdote.

(B) Leaking secret documents that he had access to by virtue of his position and status is already a crime. Furthermore, arbitrarily adding and altering public documents to suit his own purposes is not something that a leader should do. For example, in Wang's article, he quotes, "According to reports, the German Ambassador to Japan spoke with the Japanese Army and Foreign Ministers in Tokyo, inquiring whether Japan wanted to end the current situation, and asking under what conditions the Japanese government would be willing to end the current situation." This is not in the records, and you are trying to cover up for the Japanese to avoid the resentment of the country. As for the issue of excluding Bai Jian, the records also do not contain "The detailed method is a technical problem." Furthermore, the conversations of Tang Mengxiao, Bai Jiansheng, Xu Cichen, and Gu Lan are also not in the records. Also, "Ambassador Tao said that China's resistance to Japan has shown the spirit of resistance. If it has reached the time to end the war, there were several good opportunities during the European war to seek peace, but ultimately we were confident in our own strength and refused to negotiate. Until the Treaty of Versailles was signed, we had to accept whatever conditions were presented…" In his view, Ambassador Tao of Germany made the statement to avoid Ambassador Ji being blamed by his government in Germany, losing our Chinese diplomatic credibility. There are many such alterations, though none of them are major. They only serve to promote the idea of peace talks. However, for a key figure in the central government to be able to fabricate so freely, even if it is truly unintentional, driven by self-interest, and acting as a puppet, if you are so disloyal to your duties, wouldn't you be afraid that would ××××××××××. Moreover, your husband and wife have already colluded with 'comrades' in Taiwan, so how can you control your subordinates? It's nothing more than using falsehoods to deceive. ××××

(C) Wang boasted, "What I sincerely seek is a grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years. I have seen through it and determined that war between China and Japan will harm both sides, while peace will lead to coexistence." He also said, "It is clearly laid out before us. Can those with ambitions in both countries hesitate and be timid in the face of temporary shame and praise? Isn't it obvious what should be chosen?" Wang is acting as if he knows everything. A revolutionary for two years, party leader, orator, poet, traitor, he has transformed into an old clergyman. And your heroic wife, Madam Chen, has recently been sighing about how much suffering the people are enduring in the war, forgetting that she helped you fight fiercely in Hankou and Peiping, looking every bit like an ancient old woman. It is a pity that you and your wife are secretly instigating "comrades" to create small disturbances, preparing to organize a "central government" and attempting to seize power as a way to advance yourselves with the Japanese. People cannot help but see through your masks and know that you are shedding crocodile tears. It is actually laughable. I still advise you to take good care of your youthful heads, which are prone to being beheaded, and remain honest in the end.

(D) But what Wang does not believe in is honesty. He is determined to achieve supreme heights. He almost believes that if there is a God in the universe, he wants to rise above God. In reality, no matter how much he can transform like Sun Wukong, he can never change that tail. When people see it, they just see an animal. What is his tail after all? It is the tragic "unaging" youth, the orator who does not understand logic, the scholar who seeks out chapters and sentences, the ordinary man who also loves a few coins. I used to call him a hypocrite, but I was fooled. What party leader and traitor are just temporary titles for them. Eventually, they will be kicked away and raised by the tail, climbing from the extreme left to the extreme right, from the extreme high to the extreme low, from the extreme fragrant to the extreme stinky. He doesn't care. He himself thinks that he "has seen through it" and will immediately act. He has seen through that "the revolution comes from the left side" and feels that he can at least become one with Lenin and Trotsky. Stalin is definitely not his match. He has also seen through the grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years. At least Hitler will move to Lini, and young soldiers will be under his control. People say that Wang Jingwei has long joined a certain group, and he is doing hard ××, definitely not as simple as Qin Hui and Li Wan Yong. Therefore, the statues of Qin Hui and Madam Wang by West Lake are made of white iron. For them, at least tungsten steel should be prepared to match their weight. I don't know what will happen later, so let's see how he transforms again. I am now lamenting that since he knows that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not prevent division," how can others not see this? People are only responding to you by saying that advocating war will not cause division. Who is using resistance to unify here? What are you opposing? You are only trying to incite your "comrades" to create small disturbances for the Japanese. At this time, you want to stir up small disturbances in the country. Can you handle this transformation? You don't need tungsten steel waiting to pay respects to you. What will you use after a hundred years? China's unification through resistance is a new term that everyone says readily. No one created this term to resist the war. When asked about the content of this term, it means that apart from a very small number of traitorous animals, all Chinese people are patriots. I will also give an example: the National Political Consultative Council that you presided over is a united gathering of representatives from all parties and factions due to the war of resistance. Everyone realized that division weakens national power, so once they unite, they will not divide again. Therefore, you can also believe that "advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not prevent division." Within unification, there is also the Communist Party's obedience to the Three Principles of the People and support for the National Government, also jointly resisting the war. You think that the Communist Party is inherently disruptive. You also say that the Communist Party can "become public," but until now, we have only seen you publicly surrender. We have not yet seen the Communist Party publicly causing trouble. The Communist Party can become public, but you cannot even become public. You just want to promote your personal peace talks, your own plan, clearly announced. You are hoping that the Communist Party will not cause trouble. So you first come to do the work of manipulating, holding, and sowing discord. If the Communist Party falls for your trick and causes trouble, your opportunity will come, is that so? That is, you can use the name of seeking foreign aid to borrow Japanese troops to quell internal chaos. Isn't your extreme effort like Wu Sangui of the Ming Dynasty or Li Wan Yong of Korea? Your perverse actions have gone so far. Do you still have any conscience? You sit in the Central Party Headquarters, and isn't there anyone who doesn't follow you every day, earnestly advising your Communist friends to naturally become public and jointly build a country based on the Three Principles of the People? What is your intention in openly proposing this to the Japanese? You advocate treasonous peace talks, and you still have the ability to make them public. Everyone can work with them to love the country together, and they cannot become public. What kind of logic is this?

Alright, please, without being disruptive, put your hand on your conscience, see through less, and honestly do your job. A youthful man who can be ××××, I have offended you, and I am willing to be punished by you in the future. Finally, I will also return to you "give an example," that is, do you remember that when you were the President of the Executive Yuan and Foreign Minister in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, didn't the Japanese warlords demand the removal of Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province? You received the demands of the Japanese warlords, and without asking anyone, without asking how, and without even asking what mistakes Chairman Song Zheyuan had made or whether he should be removed, you immediately used your sincere diplomacy, responsible spirit, outstanding vision, and unfathomable methods to quickly issue an order overnight to remove Chairman Song. You bowed down to the Japanese warlords, obeyed their orders, and handed over the entire sovereignty of Chahar Province to the Japanese warlords. The Japanese warlords did not spend a bullet or shed a drop of blood and peacefully acquired Chahar. Look, what is the difference between this and President Hacha of last month handing over the Czech Republic? Calculating the time, your brilliant and swift diplomatic methods to hand over Chahar were even faster than the handing over of the Czech Republic. There are probably many other examples. I will only give this one example, which is enough to show Mr. Wang's far-sighted, insightful, intelligent, and wise diplomatic genius, responsible to the Japanese, and sincerely humiliating the country.

Mr. Wang, because of your responsibility and sincerity towards the Japanese warlords, how could the Japanese warlords be willing to let you go? Among the 450 million people in China, there is no one else to be found except you. So they found Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi, but they were still not enough. They had to say to you that only Mr. Wang could be their opponent. So, they still have to break their hearts, send troops to Shanghai to attack Nanjing, and even occupy Guangzhou and Wuhan. Mr. Wang, do you know what they are doing? Are you afraid you still don't understand? This is to wait for you to come out and replace the National Government as their opponent! But they have arrived in Wuhan, and you are still unwilling to come out to be their opponent. Do you really want them to fight to Xi'an and Nanning before you are willing to overthrow the National Government and replace it as their opponent? If they reach Xi'an and Nanning, lose many troops, and spend a lot of travel expenses, using up their budget, and can't take Xi'an or Nanning. And if you still don't come out to overthrow the National Government and replace it as their opponent, then Mr. Wang, you will really hurt them, and you will really be sorry for them. At this time, your good friend, the Japanese warlords, will definitely ask you, in your "give an example"— "laying a foundation for a century of long-term stability in East Asia" and "another path of common survival and common development"—aren't you cheating people? If you are afraid that you cannot answer by that time, I will think for you. Just say, "I am Chinese. In war, there is no room for deceit. I am like this now, and you have failed." But this is enough to be "a century of long-term stability in East Asia" and "another path of common survival and common development." Answering them like this, wouldn't you become a famous politician in history? If this is really the result, then in our future Sino-Japanese war history, on the day that the Republic of China achieves independence, freedom, territorial sovereignty, and administrative integrity, wouldn't your first contribution be recorded on the first page? What are you still afraid of having injustices that cannot be cleared? I think if you want to serve the country, make a name for yourself, and leave a good name for posterity, only this is possible. It is still the best method that your old comrade has thought of for you. Apart from this, this is a dead end. Please cherish it and never make a mistake. If you slip up and regret it for eternity, it will be too late. Goodbye. (The End)

### European Situation About to Unfold: Britain to Express Attitude Today, Fleet Simultaneously Concentrated in the Mediterranean

(Central News Agency, London, 12th) After receiving secret orders, the British and French fleets are concentrating in the Mediterranean. According to senior government officials, concrete measures have been drafted stipulating that if Bulgaria, with or without Italian assistance, invades Romania or Greece, Turkey should attack Bulgaria. It is estimated that the French cabinet has ordered 400,000 reservists to be called up, not including the 650,000 standing army. The King's sudden return to London to hear Prime Minister Chamberlain's report is reminiscent of the events of last September when the King returned to London specifically to sign the fleet mobilization order during a period of heightened European tension.

(Associated Press, Skopje, 1st) According to reliable sources in Greece, several British warships are now stationed in the ports of Argostoli and Astakos.

(Associated Press, Marseille, 10th) The French Mediterranean fleet was ordered today to depart from Toulon and head to a certain location in the Mediterranean. This action by the French fleet is a precautionary measure taken by the French cabinet. Details of the French fleet's movements have not yet been reported.

(Associated Press, Paris, 11th) The French government has ordered the summoning of naval experts and the cancellation of all leaves for naval officers and soldiers. The French fleet in Toulon is prepared to sail to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Easter leave for army personnel has also been cancelled.

(Associated Press, Rome, 11th) Italian authorities announced today that reservists from the 1901, 1912, and 1917 classes have been fully called up. A portion of the 1918 and 1919 classes have also been ordered to assemble. Officials stated that if the situation does not drastically change, Italian authorities will not call up any more reservists. It is noted that the currently mobilized troops have reached one million.

(Associated Press, Rome, 12th) Mussolini, according to an official Fascist statement issued today, declared that if the overall situation does not worsen, Italy is prepared to mobilize no more troops. However, the statement warned that if Britain and France do not take similar measures, Italy will implement a large-scale mobilization.

(Associated Press, Paris, 11th) Poland has mobilized as many as six classes of reservists, with those enlisted being between 22 and 28 years old.

(Associated Press, London, 11th) It is reported that the British and French fleets are currently concentrating off the Adriatic Sea. Chamberlain is making a final effort to negotiate with Mussolini. Chamberlain's plan is to recognize Italy's annexation of Albania in exchange for Italy's guarantee not to attack Greece and to promptly withdraw Italian troops from Spain. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain's negotiations with Mussolini fail, the Prime Minister will announce in the House of Commons at 4:25 PM on the 13th (10:00 PM Hong Kong time) that Britain will adopt close military cooperation with Turkey and Greece. It is also predicted that the government will renounce the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Meanwhile, the Admiralty refuses to release information on the fleet's movements.

(Associated Press, London, 12th) The British Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee met all day today to study the overall situation, preparing for Prime Minister Chamberlain to announce Britain's attitude towards guarantees to Turkey and Greece in the House of Commons on the 13th. It is believed that the Foreign Affairs Committee will continue discussions tomorrow morning to determine the content of the statement and hopes to obtain final reports from Athens and Ankara. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's statement will provide a clear exposition of the current situation in the Mediterranean. At the same time, there is hope here that Mussolini's declaration promising the immediate withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain can be obtained within 24 hours.

(Reuters, Paris, 12th) The French cabinet ministers unanimously passed the declaration drafted by Daladier today, which will be announced tomorrow in the name of the French government. The declaration will clarify France's attitude towards the current European situation.

Italy Guarantees Greece's Territorial Integrity

Rome Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Announcement: British, American, French, and Soviet Talks

(Reuters, Rome, 12th) The Foreign Ministry here issued a communiqué today stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had previously unequivocally guaranteed the territorial integrity of Greece. Italy has now received a letter from the President of Greece expressing gratitude for this guarantee. The Greek President believes that the development of the situation in recent days has made long-term friendship and peace between Italy and Greece possible.

(Associated Press, Athens, 11th) It has been learned that Greece has reached a specific understanding with Britain, promising that Greek ports can be fully used by the British fleet in wartime, and Britain is also providing Greece with certain benefits. It is reported that Greece has not allowed assistance to Britain in the event of an attack on Britain, but is willing to cooperate closely with Britain if Greek territory is threatened or war breaks out in the Mediterranean region. The British side has guaranteed to supply Greece with 300 aircraft, a number of anti-aircraft guns, and one million gas masks. It is also reported that Italy is currently consolidating its position in the Adriatic Sea to avoid external attacks. In the past three days, 300,000 experts and specialized workers have been sent to Vlora to build strong fortifications. There are rumors that Italian authorities have transported 250 heavy artillery pieces to Vlora. The entire defense of Vlora Bay is extremely strong, especially the Two Sassino Forts, which control the entire Vlora area. It is said that Italian artillery fire can control the narrow entrance to the Adriatic Sea, not only destroying the Yugoslav navy but also hindering any foreign fleet activity.

(Associated Press, Rome, 11th) According to Italian sources, Italy considers any British assistance to Greece an act of hostility against Italy and a danger that could alter the status quo in the Mediterranean. They said that Italy is concerned about Britain's actions towards Greece. Mussolini's mouthpiece newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" published today that Italy is planning to enlist Albanian soldiers into the Italian army.

(Associated Press, London, 11th) The British Foreign Secretary held talks with the Soviet Ambassador today to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the overall situation.

"The Times" specifically noted the importance of President Roosevelt's essay in "The Washington Daily News," saying that "President Roosevelt may have issued the most direct warning that the threat to Western culture is necessarily related to the United States." The opinions of the White House and the State Department clearly represent the views of the majority of Americans.

### Romania Seeks Aid from Britain: Assured Attention to Country's Perilous Situation, Southern Countries Follow Britain and France's Lead

(Associated Press, London, 12th) After repeated efforts at appeasement failed, Prime Minister Chamberlain and his cabinet are now adopting a tougher stance. However, diplomatic circles are now quite skeptical as to whether this stance is too late. The fate of the Balkan Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean is truly uncertain. Romania is now the focus of attention. The Romanian government has notified the British government in a manner akin to an ultimatum that if Britain cannot decide to take military assistance measures towards Romania within this week, then Romania may surrender to Germany, as the Romanian Foreign Minister is scheduled to arrive in Berlin next Monday to meet with Hitler and the Foreign Minister. The Romanian Ambassador to Britain has been constantly urging Foreign Secretary Halifax to pay attention to the perilous situation in Romania since returning here last Thursday.

### The Great Engineering of the Burma Road: British Reporter Praises the Road, the Burma Railway is Under Construction

(Reuters, London, 12th) The Chinese Government Purchasing Committee recently completed an order worth £180,000 with British merchants to purchase various building materials for the Yunnan-Burma Railway (which is now being urgently constructed). Several other orders are under negotiation. The route of the road is based on the recommendations of a British engineer 40 years ago. A "Times" reporter recently traveled by car along the Lashio-Kunming Highway and wrote an article praising the "Great Achievements of Chinese Engineers." From Lashio to the Sino-Burmese border is 124 miles, and from the border to Kunming is 648 miles. The Chinese section, from Xiaguan to the border, is 367 miles, and construction began in October 1937. That section's terrain is rugged, with steep slopes, whose heights range from 2,000 feet to 6,000 feet. However, it was completed in just 14 months, which is truly astonishing. The most difficult part of the entire road is the section from Longling to the Lujiang River Basin, which must cross obstacles of 8,000-foot-high mountains, with extremely steep slopes and almost unbuildable bends. At the same time, the valleys are 2,000 feet deep, and the terrain is extremely dangerous. The Chinese government has turned to unlimited engineering in this area, striving for perfection. However, due to terrain conditions, landslides often occur. There is also a suspension bridge, 280 feet long, that crosses the Lujiang River, which was recently completed. It is now being upgraded to allow it to carry heavy military vehicles. According to the reporter, if traffic is to be carried during the rainy season, adequate culverts must be placed at the bottom of the road to drain accumulated water. However, in any case, the accomplishments of Chinese engineers cannot be buried. Anyone who has been to Yunnan cannot help but deeply admire the determination and courage of the Chinese.

### Italian Troops Arrive at the Greek Border: Albanian Prince Leads Troops to Resist Italian Aggression

The mountain residents in those areas, with the assistance of regular army officers, united and were led by Princes Sali and Hysen. It is noted that both princes are graduates of famous French military academies. However, Italian sources claimed that they had already occupied Argyrokastro and Mount Tomorr.

Brief Commentary

### British Ambassador to Chongqing

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon from Shanghai and is scheduled to travel to Chongqing via Hanoi last night. Chongqing is currently the location of the Chinese central government, so there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ambassador's trip. However, because the ambassador recently met in Shanghai with the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to discuss the Far Eastern situation, and there have been various rumors about this meeting (such as pro-Japanese traitors spreading rumors that Britain is considering mediating the Sino-Japanese conflict), we feel it is necessary to add a brief explanation.

The ambassador personally visited various places in our rear areas and the front lines of Hunan and Jiangxi not long ago and has a clear understanding that our highest leader, government officials, military commanders, and all the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the people throughout the country all have an unyielding determination to resist Japan and a resolve to unite and resist aggression to the end. They also have a strong determination to oppose all "anti-communist," "peace," and "mediation" conspiracies by Japan and its collaborators. Today, as the ambassador arrives in Chongqing via Hong Kong, what he sees and hears will further enhance his previous understanding. This determination is a manifestation of the great strength of the Chinese nation and a guarantee that China will surely achieve independence and freedom and win a victory equal to that of the world. At the same time, it will surely increase the ambassador's courage and determination to strive to promote Sino-British friendship and cooperation, to restrain aggression, and to safeguard peace.

The Japanese seem to be paying unusual attention to the ambassador's trip to Chongqing. News agencies reported yesterday that the Japanese newspapers stated that "Britain is now working closely with France and the United States to put pressure on Japan." Regardless of the intent of this propaganda, their fear of cooperation between China, Britain, the United States, and France against Japan is already evident – what the enemy fears is precisely what we should welcome. We should use this to step up our efforts to develop the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, but this depends on our efforts and cannot be achieved by empty words and fantasies. When the British Ambassador to Japan returned to Tokyo the other day, he also said: "Britain's policy towards the Far Eastern dispute will not change in any way." We must, based on the current facts of further oppression of Britain and France by the Far Eastern aggressors, completely shatter all compromise policies and promote them to take more active steps in the Far East to aid China.

### Cultural Food Crisis

Last night, someone was discovered stealing books in a bookstore on Avenue Central. The person was immediately beaten, causing outrage among the onlookers. This incident led to thoughts about the current serious issue of cultural sustenance.

Knowledge famine is a common phenomenon in capitalist societies, especially in colonial societies. Since the war, the Hong Kong new book industry has experienced a sudden surge in development, which, although a "result of the times," still merits respect for the efforts of the new book industry operators. However, in terms of pricing, compared to the exchange rate between the national currency and the Hong Kong dollar, it still seems expensive, providing little practical benefit to the impoverished and knowledge-starved. It is hoped that the industry can pay more attention to this aspect.

Secondly, the library business in Hong Kong has become more developed recently, but either the "strict access" makes those without student status or guarantee money sigh outside the library, or the publicity is insufficient, leaving the knowledge-starved still "unsure of how to proceed"! Moreover, considering the entire population of Hong Kong, the existing libraries are still too few—it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will pay more attention to this, opening up granaries of knowledge for the poor and knowledge-starved, and extensively promoting reading guidance work.

Furthermore, Hong Kong has already earned the reputation of being the cultural center of the South. All parts of South China, as well as the guerrilla and war zones, are eagerly expecting Hong Kong's cultural circles to make efforts to supply cultural sustenance. Therefore, in addition to meeting local needs, the movement to "transport cultural sustenance to the mainland" must be expanded.

### Siyi Refugees Will Become Starved Corpses! Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Launch Large-Scale Fundraising Campaign. Street Donation Teams Established Yesterday to Vigorously Solicit Donations. Provincial Government Approves 300,000 Piculs of Imported Rice to Be Shipped to Siyi.

The Siyi General Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting yesterday at 2:30 PM to elect new officers and discuss the relief of war refugees in the region. Attendees included Huang Yueqiao, Zhu Ren'an, Liang Yuanzhao, Li Zizhen, Cen Xiehe, Zhou Xingchi, Chen Liquan, Wu Yaoyun, Zhou Daozhuang, Huang Jingshuo, Liu Ziqing, Gao Liangqing, Qu Zesen, Ma Guoying, Yu Zhuosheng, Liu Yuyun, Wu Yuhan, Zhong Jieqing, Kuang Xiankuan, Chen Zhudian, Jin Rangli, Wu Yueting, Zhang Lanzhou, Liang Shikuang, and dozens of others.

After the election, the Siyi Fundraising Conference began, with Liu Yuyun presiding and recording the proceedings.

Xin Hui County Magistrate Appeals for Relief

First, a letter from Li Wuzi, magistrate of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, was read, requesting relief. The letter stated: (omitted above) Unfortunately, our county was invaded by the × on the 28th of last month. Wuzi is responsible for defending the territory and ordered his troops to fight to the death. In a few days, they repeatedly defeated the strong ×. Later, due to the inferiority of weapons and the disparity in numbers, they had to temporarily abandon Jiangmen County and defend the strategic points while awaiting reinforcements. Commander Deng Gu has already sent reinforcements in multiple directions. A counter-offensive will soon be launched and victory will be achieved. However, the local area has suffered greatly, and the situation is dire. The people have fled, scattered and displaced, and the food shortage is severe, with many awaiting food. The local area is filled with despair and is on the verge of starvation. Our county is adjacent to other villages, including Taikai in the near vicinity and Enping in the distance, collectively known as Siyi. Since the geography is adjacent and the fates are intertwined, if the resistance this time is weak, the × will take advantage of the situation, and all parts of Siyi will also fall into disaster areas. It is clear that survival depends on mutual support. Therefore, rescuing the refugees is urgent. I hereby request that overseas Chinese from Siyi in Hong Kong find ways to raise funds, especially urging your association to work tirelessly to save this crisis.

Forming Donation Teams to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief

After the report, the discussion began. The results were as follows: (1) The Hong Kong Joint Committee for Relief of South China Refugees will allocate 200 bags of rice and medicines to the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce for emergency relief to refugees and wounded soldiers in the region. (2) A door-to-door donation team will be formed to solicit donations from overseas Chinese from Siyi. Wu Yaoting, Li Zizhen, Yu Rangli, Zhou Daozhuang, Wu Yujun, Chen Xudian, Liu Ziqing, Ma Guoying, Huang Zhong'an, Cen Xietang, and An Ting were elected as members. Directors of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce will fully participate and cooperate in the work. (3) An immediate fundraising campaign was launched to aid Xinhui refugees. Liu Yuyun and Yu Sheng each donated HK$100, and more than 20 other individuals donated HK$50, HK$20, HK$10, HK$5, and HK$3, totaling HK$660. (4) The handling of "Lotus Rice Stones Returning to the Region for Distribution" will be managed independently by the chambers of commerce in each region. The meeting was adjourned.

Duty-Free Imported Rice - Please Approve Release

Furthermore, reporters investigated the issue of duty-free imported rice for Siyi. Since the Gongbei Customs had not yet received a formal order, they were unable to allow passage. Currently, more than 5,000 bags of rice from Taishan and Heshan counties had already been shipped to Macau and were temporarily stored in Huanmen, entrusted to the Macau Chamber of Commerce to pay taxes on their behalf and gradually import them. The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, seeing this taxation as troublesome, specially requested the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Central Ministry of Finance, requesting them to quickly inform the Gongbei Customs to implement duty exemption for distribution. Furthermore, according to the Heshan Chamber of Commerce, they received a quick postal telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, approving the duty-free import of 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice, an increase of 100,000 metric tons from the previous approval. The Siyi Chamber of Commerce also received approval from the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, also approving 300,000 metric tons, with 110,000 metric tons to be imported through Jiangmen and 190,000 metric tons through Gongbei Customs.

### Philippine Student Delegation to Japan Arrives in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Organizations Jointly Host Today. Report on the Historical Facts and Significance of Our Resistance War. Clarify Sino-Philippine Relations to Prevent × Intrusion.

× often uses the slogan "Asia for Asians" to numb the weak and small ethnic groups in the East to achieve the conspiracy of aggression. Recently, × held the third Far East Student Conference in Tokyo, inviting Philippine students to participate. The Philippine Island Student Union responded to a certain invitation and sent a delegation to Japan. The delegation of 38 people, led by Mr. Luo Lu, departed from the Philippines on the Empress of Canada on the 10th and arrived in Hong Kong at 5:00 PM yesterday. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, YMCA, YWCA, China Youth Journalists Association, Fujian Association, Amateur Friendship Society, Women's Comfort Association, Women's War Relief Association, and other organizations, fearing that the delegation would be misled by × propaganda and harm the feelings between the Chinese and Filipino peoples, jointly held a meeting this afternoon to host the delegation, report on the historical facts of our resistance war, and explain that our resistance war is for independence and freedom and has a close relationship with the Philippines. According to the delegation leader, they are attending the student conference in Japan and will also study Japanese education. They are scheduled to return to the Philippines in mid-May. Most of them are students from major high schools in the Philippines, totaling 38 people.

The Hong Kong authorities previously purchased a batch of new-style alarms from London, which have recently been shipped to Hong Kong and installed. A test of the two types of alarms, air raid and all-clear, is scheduled for 2:15 PM and 2:20 PM tomorrow. At 2:15 PM, the air raid alarm will be tested. The sound will vibrate intermittently for three minutes, indicating that an air raid may occur within a few minutes. This is the first time.

### New-Style Alarms to Be Tested Tomorrow, Divided into Air Raid and All-Clear

At 2:25 PM, the all-clear alarm will be tested. The sound will be stable and will last for several minutes, indicating that the × aircraft have left the area or that the air raid threat has passed. After this test, if the authorities are satisfied, a third blackout exercise will be held in the near future. At that time, all alarm signals will be broadcast using this new machine. Residents should do their best to cooperate with the government to achieve a satisfactory level of darkness in Hong Kong, so that the × cannot see the face of Hong Kong and achieve the effect of air defense. It is reported that the alarm test yesterday was limited to Hong Kong Island, and the New Territories and Kowloon were not temporarily included.

### Stuart Symington Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss National Orphan Relief. Groups in Various Regions Have Sheltered Up to 20,000 Orphans. Medical Supplies Are Extremely Lacking; Hope Overseas Chinese Will Donate.

Stuart Symington, Design Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department and Director of the China Wartime Child Relief Association, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Chongqing via Guilin. The reporter, aware of Mr. Symington's years of dedication to orphan relief, visited his residence and received a detailed account of the national orphan relief situation. According to him, national orphan relief organizations can be broadly divided into governmental and social categories. The former belongs to the Central Relief Committee, while the latter includes the Children's Welfare Association led by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the China Wartime Child Relief Association led by Xu Shiying and Ma Chaojun, the China Child Welfare Association led by President Kong, and the Hankou Children's Education Committee. The Central Relief Committee oversees and subsidizes the above four social relief organizations. Since the beginning of the war, the various groups have sheltered more than 20,000 orphans, establishing educational and care homes to provide them with education and care. The ages of the orphans range from two or three years old to sixteen or seventeen years old. In the educational homes established in the mainland, the issue of talent development is relatively minor due to the assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. However, there is a severe shortage of medical personnel and supplies. For example, in the educational home established by the China Wartime Child Relief Association in western Hunan, there is not even one nurse for every hundred children, and the lack of medicines and treatment equipment is alarming. This situation is not unique to western Hunan. When I passed through Shaoguan recently, I visited the educational home run by the Shaoguan International Relief Committee.

The Lack of Western Medicines is Similar. The Chairman of the association, American missionary Mr. Sanders, also conveyed this shortage to people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, hoping for more donations of medicines such as Lianwan, Santonin, Brandy, gauze, and cotton. It is said that Mr. Symington will appeal to all parties again after visiting Xu Shiying. Furthermore, Ma Guo and others, members of the China-Soviet Cultural Association residing in Hong Kong, took advantage of the visit of Situ De, the preparation member of the Guangxi branch of the Association, to Hong Kong, and planned to jointly hold a fellowship meeting with all the members of the Association residing in Hong Kong within a few days, and discuss the method of regular contact between the members of the Association residing in Hong Kong.

### Interview with Mr. Hang Liwu

— Qi Zhuo

The Cooperation Between the University of Hong Kong and Our University Is Under Discussion

Special Report by This Newspaper

The University of Hong Kong is the highest institution of learning in Hong Kong, and over 90% of the students at the University of Hong Kong are young people from our country. This shows that the students at the University of Hong Kong are not only the pillars of Hong Kong society but are also specialized talents who are eagerly anticipated by the motherland. The location of the University of Hong Kong also shows its importance.

In order for the University of Hong Kong to shoulder this great mission, establishing connections and cooperating with universities in our country is the path it should take in the future. In line with the close relationship and harmonious diplomatic ties between China and Britain, the cooperation between Chinese and British cultures is also an urgent task at present.

Governor Ong has commissioned many important Chinese and British officials to form a committee to carry out cooperation matters. Mr. Hang Liwu, the General Manager of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, is also one of the members. We believe that this is a major event that should be valued. Because in addition to "self-reliance," it is also very necessary to strive for international understanding and assistance. The past shortcomings of the University of Hong Kong also have a new opportunity.

On the 16th of last month, this newspaper published a special report on the news of the University of Hong Kong cooperating with universities in our country, and provided three suggestions as a welcome gift to Mr. Hang Liwu: (1) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will list Chinese as a required course; (2) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will hire more Chinese scholars who have confidence in promoting Sino-British diplomatic ties to serve as professors to better match the national conditions; (3) It is hoped that the University of Hong Kong will lower tuition fees to benefit poor students in their advanced studies. Looking around the cultural and educational circles in Hong Kong, the prospects for Chinese-British cultural cooperation are also of great concern. However, Mr. Hang was delayed due to illness, and the special committee of the University of Hong Kong to discuss the cooperation plan was also postponed repeatedly because Mr. Hang Liwu, the General Manager of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund representing our country, had not yet arrived. It was not until the day before yesterday that Mr. Hang finally arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing amidst our eager anticipation, and the special committee of the University of Hong Kong also began discussions in the meeting. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Hang Liwu with a sincere welcome and hope.

Gathering my strength to climb to the top of the mountain, I finally met Mr. Hang Liwu at the home of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong. He was an amiable and approachable middle-aged man. His opening words were: "Your special report 'The University of Hong Kong Cooperates with Our University' has been sent to me by Mr. Ye Gongchuo. I have also read your newspaper's Sunday essay 'Mr. Zhuang Zeyi's Higher Education Reform Issue' and other articles on bridging Chinese and British cultures. The ideas are all correct." It can be seen that Mr. Hang attaches great importance to the general discussion here. We sincerely hope that he will express our position and seriously discuss with the University of Hong Kong. This is an important key to Chinese-British cultural cooperation.

After a brief exchange of greetings, we slowly moved on to the topic at hand. The ringing of the telephone interrupted the conversation several times.

This time, the University of Hong Kong believes that it is necessary to cooperate with our country in order to develop its school affairs. Our educational authorities have expressed their infinite admiration for the Governor of Hong Kong—who is also the President of the University—and the Vice-Chancellor for their enlightened attitudes, and they are also very interested in Sino-British cultural cooperation.

In the past, we allocated 205,000 pounds of the Boxer Indemnity to the University of Hong Kong's foundation. This time, when discussing cooperation, the documents from the University of Hong Kong to our authorities did not have any financial requests. As for our authorities, we believe that if Sino-British cultural cooperation is effectively implemented, we will have no problem allocating more funds to help.

Mr. Hang has brought with him a plan from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education for the cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and us, with the main points focusing on improving the level of Chinese and cultivating talents in science, engineering, and medicine. As for the specific content, it is being discussed with the University of Hong Kong and is not yet ready to be released.

In short, the issue of cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and us is a very complex issue. However, under the leadership of the wise President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, it will not be difficult to gradually seek progress.

Mr. Hang also said optimistically: "In recent years, the improvement in the level of our domestic universities and the progress in all aspects have been very rapid. We hope that China and Britain can work together to move forward!" This is certainly good news that we are happy to hear.

The phone rang incessantly. Mr. Hang was too busy, so the reporter did not dare to ask for more guidance and said goodbye.

After sorting out the documents recently, Mr. Hang plans to write an article "Prospects for Sino-British Culture" to be published in this newspaper. We are waiting to learn from it.

### Prospering Hong Kong: Hong Kong Authorities Actively Proceeding with Reclamation of the Central Waterfront. Surveying and Design Now Completed, Construction to Begin Soon. Funding of 580,000 to Be Completed Next Year.

The Hong Kong Public Works Department plans to reclaim the waterfront from the Unified Pier to the Hải An Shipyard in order to expand the Central Waterfront. After the implementation of this plan, the waterfront will be doubled. For the first phase of the project from Jubilee Pier to Pottinger Street, the Public Works Bureau has dispatched staff to conduct surveys and designs, which can be completed by the end of next year, costing 585,000 yuan, with 150,000 yuan to be used this year. Once the reclamation of this section is completed, new piers and parking lots for buses and private cars will be added. Because vehicles and pedestrians are currently concentrated at the Unified Pier, it is too crowded, so it is necessary to add a pier and parking lot. After the completion of the reclamation project of this section, the reclamation of the section from the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier to the Naval Shipyard will continue to complete the entire plan. At the same time, the Public Works Department is also reclaiming the North Point coast, with an expenditure of 400,000 yuan. The reclaimed land has been opened for bidding by the government, with the highest price being 2.20 yuan per square foot, and the average price being about 1.50 yuan per square foot. After the successive completion of the above projects, the Hong Kong waterfront, except for the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter, will become a straight line.

### Youth Journalists' Association Hosts a Banquet for the China Salvation Drama Troupe Held at the Winsor Hotel Last Night

### After I Issue General Attack Order in South China, the War Situation on the Entire West River Front Improves, Our Righteous Army Strives for Initiative, Intense Battle for Jiangmen Hui City Imminent, Our Army Recaptures Shaping and Approaches Jiujiang

[West River Express] Since Commander Zhang Fakui issued the general offensive order on the 5th, the war situation in South China has seen rapid advances and the recapture of famous cities on the eastern, western, and northern fronts after bloody battles. The Cantonese bandits are already in a situation of being surrounded on all sides. On the West River front, our regular army and guerrillas have achieved close coordination, and the war situation has completely improved. Favorable strongholds in the vicinity of Jiangmen and Huicheng are all in our hands, and the capture of both places is imminent. The war situation yesterday is recorded as follows:

Guarding and Rushing to Build Fortifications

Continuous fierce battles have occurred in the suburbs of Jiangmen Huicheng in recent days. Yesterday, the 10th, our regular army under Deng Longguang attacked Huicheng along the Xinhe Highway, while another unit ambushed Jiangmen from the side. Our troops and the bandits made contact in Fozichiao, and both sides suffered casualties. Our troops guarding Wangyue Mountain, Xiang Mountain, and other positions launched an attack on Huicheng again yesterday morning. We used the terrain to bombard the bandit positions from high positions, killing dozens of them. However, the bandits used aircraft to assist in the battle, fiercely bombing our defenses, but they had no target and we suffered no damage. The bandits now stationed in Jiangmen Huicheng, facing the approach of our large army and being surrounded, forced our people to build defensive fortifications on the Xinhe and Jiangfo highways in the suburbs to protect the two strongholds of Jiangmen Huicheng.

Cavalry Assist in Battle, Killing More Than One Hundred

On the 11th, our army launched an attack from Hechuan, making rapid progress and approaching the outskirts of Jiangmen, where they encountered the bandits and engaged in fierce fighting. Our army fought bravely in close combat, killing thousands of bandits. Then, more than one hundred bandit cavalry rushed to reinforce them. Our army immediately used flat-firing guns and machine guns to fiercely strafe the bandit cavalry. After about two hours of stalemate, more than one hundred bandit cavalry were killed, and we also heroically sacrificed dozens of people. The bandits are still confronting us in the suburbs.

Jiujiang Suburban Areas, Our Troops and Bandits Confront Each Other

Since our army crossed the river at Haikou yesterday and attacked Jiujiang, our plainclothes troops once rushed into Jiujiang City and made some gains. Our army is now in close contact with the guerrillas, launching fierce attacks on Jiujiang. The bandit forces seem to be on the verge of collapse, but they are trying to resist stubbornly. The bandit leaders yesterday transferred more than 2,000 troops from Foshan and Guangzhou to reinforce Jiujiang. Currently, our troops and the bandits are still confronting each other in the Longshan, Longjiang, Xuexian Palace, and Jiujiang areas. However, our morale is extremely high, and there will be amazing progress on this line.

Recaptured Shaping Again at 3 AM Yesterday

After our army recaptured Shaping a few days ago, they withdrew again. Yesterday, the 11th, at 11:40 PM, our regular army stationed on the Shagu Highway, equipped with guerrillas, launched a counterattack on Shaping. A fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides, and the sound of artillery fire rumbled throughout the night. Our army bravely charged, while another unit detoured to outflank the bandit's rear. The bandits could not take care of both ends, and at about 3 AM this morning, the bandits finally collapsed and withdrew from Shaping. Our army immediately entered, and Shaping Town was recaptured by us for the second time. In this battle, dozens of our soldiers sacrificed themselves, but we seized a lot of spoils of war. Our army is still actively continuing to advance towards the Gubudirection to wipe out the remaining bandits.

A Senior Officer Talks About Killing

A senior officer of the Fourth War Zone spoke freely about the battle in Xinhui, saying that the battle in Jiangxia Tangxia Huicheng was one of the best battles since the beginning of the war in South China. Although we abandoned some strongholds, we have formed a new front line in the Shaping to Huicheng area. This line and the bandit army's Tangxia to Huicheng line are almost balanced. The bandit's central breakthrough strategy is not easy to implement. If the bandits hit our waist, we can hit their head and tail. If the bandits hit our head and tail, we can attack their center. This is completely contrary to the previous method of sticking to one line and striving for initiative. Therefore, our army has been able to win victories in recent days. This is proof that our new strategy has been successful. It is believed that the full use of this strategy will surely cause a major blow to the bandits.

Bandit Regiment Commander Killed by Us

The officer then told reporters that when the Fifth District Guerrilla retreated from Jiangmen, their retreat plan was very orderly. The bandit army did not notice it and lightly pursued it, and was taken advantage of by the team. The bandit Regiment Commander Komura, the commander of the bandit army's attack on Jiangmen, was also killed by the ambush of the Fifth District Guerrilla during the pursuit. The bandit Regiment Commander Kotobuki Matsu, who commanded the troops at Shaping, was killed when our regular army launched an attack on Shaping. The remains of these two have been recovered and reported to the Fourth War Zone Command for record. As for the Fifth District Guerrilla being able to make such a contribution, a telegram has also been sent to commend them.

### No Bandit Traces in Bao'an County, Bandit Planes Bomb Tangtouxia, Reconnaissance Flights Over Shenzhen Again Yesterday Afternoon

[Shenzhen Express] Yesterday, the 11th, the bandits attacked Nantou, Bao'an, and engaged in fierce fighting with our army. It is further investigated that our army once withdrew from Nantou County, and at noon, more than 400 of our guerrillas launched a counterattack. The bandits retreated completely before dusk, and fled back to the armed fishing boats at 11 PM. Yesterday, there were no bandit traces in Bao'an, but bandit planes flew to Tangtouxia in the morning and afternoon, indiscriminately bombing, and appeared in Shenzhen.

Nantou Robbed

It was found that after the bandits entered Nantou City, they set off a major fire, and the county middle school and county government were destroyed. It was about 11 AM at the time, and the flames could be seen as far as Shekou. When the bandits entered the city, they were still afraid that our guerrillas would set a trap, so they still fired and swept around indiscriminately after entering the city. At the same time, the bandit soldiers also searched for pigs, cattle, and livestock.

Counterattack Victory

The bandits occupied Nantou this time, thinking that our army had all been transferred to counterattack Shilong and could not rush back in time. Therefore, they did not expect our army to launch a large-scale counterattack in the afternoon. Only after our large army approached the suburbs did they hurriedly fight back on one side and retreat on the other. Our army pursued them to the shore of Chiwan. Because they could not get on the ship immediately, they tried their best to resist. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours, until late at night, the bandits covered their troops boarding the ship on one side, and concentrated their fire and fired indiscriminately on the other. At 12 o'clock at night, there were no bandit traces in Bao'an.

Bandit Plane Activity

Yesterday at 10 AM, a team of six bandit planes flew to Tangtouxia on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and bombed it. The six planes flew in a character shape, flying very low, and dropped a total of eight bombs. The extent of the losses is unknown. At 3 PM in the afternoon, another bandit plane flew to Shenzhen, its purpose was to scout. It was found that after our army once attacked Shilong's bandit garrison the week before, the bandits were greatly frightened. Yesterday, the bandit planes flew and bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, its purpose was to attack our army.

### Kaiping Danshui Estuary, Bandit Planes Bombed Miserably, Seven Bandit Planes Indiscriminately Bombing in Shifts, Dropping No Less Than Thirty Bombs

[Kaiping Correspondent] The bandits threatened our Siyi coastal defense area and dispatched aircraft to bomb various places in Taishan and Kaiping on a large scale a few days ago. It has now been found that the Danshui Estuary area in Kaiping County has suffered the most. Among the bombings, the battle on the morning of March 29 at 11 AM was the most tragic. It was found that seven bandit planes indiscriminately bombed in shifts during this battle, dropping no less than thirty bombs, destroying a total of 48 houses and killing or injuring 36 citizens. The rear seat of the local police sacrifice office was also bombed. Fortunately, the county government authorities supervised their subordinates to provide effective rescue and rapid recovery work, and the market has now restored order.

### Zhongshan Is Returned, Bandit Warships Bomb Xiangzhou Yesterday, Our Army Responded Calmly, Bandits Retreated Knowing the Difficulty

[Zhongshan Express] Since Ronggui in Zhongshan County fell, the bandits have been constantly sailing rubber boats, shallow-water warships, and iron tugboats in the coastal areas of the county, carrying bandit soldiers to harass us. However, our authorities have already strengthened defensive works along the coast, so the bandits are always dealt a heavy blow each time they come to attack. Yesterday (11th), Xiangzhou in the county's fifth district was bombed by bandit warships again. The details are recorded below:

Bandit Gunboats Harass Xiangzhou

Xiangzhou is located by the sea, adjacent to Tangjiawan. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. Because the water level is deep, bandit warships often come and go openly, without any fear. At 4:45 PM on the 11th, a certain team in the area reported that two iron tugboats, one shallow-water warship, and three rubber boats, carrying bandit soldiers, were sailing from the south in single file. The team immediately prepared and waited in formation. Before long, when the bandit warships approached, they fired two cannons in succession and bombarded the shore. Then, machine guns fired thousands of rounds from the rubber boats, sweeping towards the same target. At that time, neighboring villages such as Qianshan, Baishi, and Tangjiawan heard the sound of gunfire. Although the local team saw that the bandits' attack was quite fierce, we immediately fired intensely. The bandits did not retaliate. Later, the bandit warships knew that it was not easy to attack, so they all sailed away, and Xiangzhou was as peaceful as ever.

Qianshan Was Once Alarmed

When the bandit warships bombarded Xiangzhou, the residents of Qianshan and other villages heard the sound of gunfire coming from Xiangzhou, suspecting that the bandits had landed from this direction. A small number of rural women turned pale and hurriedly carried quilts on their backs and led their children towards Macau. The order was quite chaotic. Later, Captain Xie of the local garrison explained to the people to dispel their doubts, and the people's hearts were calmed down. By 8 PM, order had returned to normal. The coastal areas of Zhongshan are still considered peaceful.

Guangdong Provincial Government Collects Propaganda Materials for Foreign Publicity

(Shaoguan Express) The Provincial Government yesterday instructed the commissioners of the districts and mayors of the counties, that the Central Propaganda Department's International Propaganda Office has issued a letter stating that the work of resisting the war and building the country has entered a very important stage, and all measures taken by the central and local military, political, economic, and cultural sectors that can enhance the strength of the resistance and enrich the people's livelihood should be widely publicized to foreign countries to strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the resistance and the inevitable success of the country's construction, and to arouse further international recognition of us. One part of the important work of this office is to collect materials, return manuscripts, and send them to various countries for publication. Therefore, we are sending letters to all competent authorities to solicit reports on recent work as a source of propaganda, and will send people to visit at any time to avoid omissions. In addition to sending letters, we are sending them to you respectfully, hoping that your government will provide as much as possible and send to our office the items under the jurisdiction of the various departments that can be published abroad, and inform the subordinate agencies to send similar materials together to facilitate the conduct of business, and to benefit the public, etc. is allowed, in addition to the sub-order, the combined order to the subordinate unity to comply with,

Bandit Economy Exhausted, Guangzhou Levies Harsh Taxes

[Guangzhou Express] Due to the exhaustion of the bandit army in Guangzhou and the lack of military pay, they have recently come up with a clever idea: to levy police donations, business taxes, protection fees, population taxes, etc., forcing the residents remaining in the city to pay according to regulations, otherwise they will be severely punished. The donations and business taxes have been levied separately from this month. The content of the levy is that the business tax is divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D. In recent days, a group of uglies has been sent out to harass various shops, investigate the amount of capital originally reported, and force them to increase it. The shops are already unable to operate in the city, and now they are being forced to levy such taxes, so they have closed their shops one after another and fled to the safe areas inland. As for the police donation protection fee, all the houses in the city are also classified into four categories: A, B, C, and D, and taxed according to the area, with an additional protection fee. The population tax is still being planned, and the pseudo-Maintenance Committee has been ordered to investigate the population.

Taicheng Holds Registration for Industry and Lodging, Strictly Investigates Traitors Mixing In

[Taishan Express] The Taicheng Police Station, because it is now the period of resistance to Japan, and attention should be paid to the security of the rear, since the Xinhe battle, traitors have been mixing in the hotels in this city, in order to thoroughly consolidate the security of the rear, a full city hotel industry worker registration was held on the 5th and 6th of this month, and it was stipulated that if any suspicious persons are seen in the hotel, they should be reported to the police at any time, to arrest them, in order to purge the traitors, so that the bandits can not use their old tricks, it is said that the registration has been completed.

### Changgang Ridge, Bandit Army Collapses, Both Sides Suffered Very Heavy Casualties, Our Army Follows Up and Pursues

[Wengyuan Special News] After a certain division of our 12th Group Army recaptured Huaxian County, a certain regiment of the chasing troops advanced south to the area of Luodong Village, Changgang Ridge. More than a thousand bandit reinforcements, with several aircraft taking turns bombing as cover, advanced north from Xinmin Xianlongkou Village on the 11th and attacked us fiercely. A fierce battle broke out immediately. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the victory, responded calmly, and charged bravely, fighting fiercely all day. The bandits could not hold on and fled to the Zhongtan area of Longkou Village. Our army is still following up and pursuing them. Both sides suffered very heavy casualties in this battle. Our army seized many spoils of war. Bandit corpses and dead horses were scattered everywhere near Changgang Ridge.

Kaiping County Actively Proceeds With Adjustment of Baojia System

[Kaiping Correspondent] After the outbreak of fighting in Jiangmen and Xinhui, Chairman Li Hanhun of the provincial government, considering that the local grassroots organizations in the counties of Kaiping, Taishan, Chixi, and Xinxing, which are adjacent to the war zone, should be improved as soon as possible so that the implementation of government orders, the protection of security, and the promotion of conscription are absolutely smooth, in order to meet the needs of wartime, has issued a special order to the governments of the counties to quickly and conscientiously adjust the Baojia system. Those who have already handled the soundness of the system should strive for perfection, and those who have not been thorough should speed up the process. The county governments have received the order and are proceeding separately. Kaiping County is stepping up the process. It has been found that the county government has entrusted Chen Qitai, secretary of the county government, and Section Chiefs Yu Xifu, Su Fanyi, Liang Jinquan, Chen Weiwan, Wu Zhizhao, chief of the police bureau, and other eleven people as members of the Baojia Adjustment Committee, and convened an adjustment meeting on the same day to discuss a three-step adjustment: 1. Propaganda, 2. Compilation and inspection, and 3. Spot checks, etc. Also, because the districts must proceed simultaneously, Committee members Sun Shengwu, Zhao Sen, Hui Ji Rong, Zhou Fuyuan, etc. were assigned to the districts under the county to work with the district heads, in order to be meticulous, and it was decided to complete the adjustment work within one month.

The Importance of Children's Films in Various Countries: A Unique Tool for Assisting Children's Education

Film has already been recognized as a rapid tool for assisting children's education. Therefore, countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. Now, I will briefly report to the readers on the situation of children's films in various countries.

United States: The United States is an advanced country in the film industry. Therefore, film education in the United States is also more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States now purchase projectors and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some are specially filmed by public institutions collecting materials and compiling scripts, and some are filmed by film companies specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas that publicly screen films with children's educational significance will significantly reduce ticket prices for children who go to watch them.

United Kingdom: In tradition, the ancient films, which are somewhat conservative in everything, are certainly no exception. Special attention is paid especially to children's films. When the film censorship boards in various places inspect films, each film must be prefixed with the letter A or U. The letter A is an abbreviation of "Adult," which means that only adults are allowed to watch, and children are not allowed. The letter U is an abbreviation of "Universal," which means that adults and children can enter and watch. In recent years, the United Kingdom has established an agency dedicated to children's films, shooting children's films, and publicly screening them in public institutions or schools.

Germany and Italy: Both Germany and Italy, as dictatorial countries, also attached great importance to children's films. However, after the Fascists gained power, these two countries successively controlled the film industry, using films as a tool for propaganda. Political function is more important than entertainment, so children's films are no exception. The government selects materials for children's films, films them, some overtly and some subtly, and propagates Fascism and National Socialism to children. And cinemas and schools often have public screenings of such children's films.

Soviet Union: The progress of the Soviet film industry is extraordinarily rapid, which is enough to surprise anyone. In particular, great attention is paid to film education. Taking Moscow alone, every holiday, more than 500 cinemas screen children's films in rotation from 9 am to 9 pm. The low ticket prices are unprecedented in other countries. These films, including features and cartoons, are produced by the government and are exclusively for children aged 8 to 16. In terms of production, the stories are all aimed at children, which is different from ordinary films.

China: Finally, what I want to say is that our China Central Film Censorship Committee does not have a clear indication of whether the film is suitable for children to watch during the film censorship. The country has not prohibited children from watching certain types of films. However, in recent years, attention has also been paid to film education. Taking Shanghai alone, the China Film Education Association has a branch in Shanghai, and often screens specially filmed or selected children's films in various primary and secondary schools for free in rotation. However, after "August 13th," this agency also temporarily withdrew with the National Army to the west.

### The First Soviet Three-Primary-Color Film

Will Premiere in Shanghai

It is reported that the Soviet Union's first three-primary-color film "Nightingale" will be released at the Shanghai Guangda Theater in mid-May.

This film was produced by the Soviet Soyuztilm company. If the public screening is popular and a box-office success, the Shanghai Guangda Theater will continue to select and screen such films in the future.

The internal layout is all set. "Guolian" China General Manager Zhang Shankun, as well as the sales managers of the three companies, Li Dashen, Ka Yuying, and Wu Bangfan, etc., have come to this new address since yesterday and started business.

Wang Hanlun, who has been out of the limelight for many years, used to set up Hanlun Beauty Salon on Xiafei Road, operating a beauty business similar to a barber shop. Later, she married and retired, and then stopped. Later, she had a falling out with her husband, Wang Jihuan (a famous scholar from eastern Zhejiang), in Hangzhou and was involved in a lawsuit, which eventually led to their separation. Not long after, Ji Huan was killed when a house collapsed. Since Wang Hanlun came to Shanghai again, she has not developed much either. Recently, she has formulated a plan, thinking about moving after a long period of dormancy, preparing to raise 5,000 gold to restore the old business of the beauty salon. It is heard that under active progress, there are already some clues, and she will seek to start it.

### First Division League Championship Final: Navy General vs. South China; Many Talents, Strength Unknown; South China Also Slightly Changed Due to Mai Shaohan's Illness

[Special Report from This Newspaper] This football season can be concluded at the end of this month. The Football Association and the Police have decided that the 22nd will be the date for the First Division League Championship and the League Team Performance. The champion and runner-up of the league have not yet been resolved, and the match between South China and the Navy on the 15th will determine who wins.

The Football Association originally wanted to hold this match earlier this month, but it could not obtain the consent of the Navy, because the Navy believed that holding it earlier would be detrimental to them, because many warships were at sea at the beginning of this month, and the strong players were not fully assembled.

At present, there are many warships docked in the port, so the Navy's football talents have also increased. However, what its strength is is something that those who are interested in football want to know in advance. Whether South China can win the championship depends entirely on the gains and losses at this final juncture. Therefore, the strength of the Navy is strong or weak, which is affected by the success or failure of China.

According to the reporter's investigation with relevant parties in the Navy, it is learned that its battle line at that time is generally as determined below. However, after carefully reading the military post, there are already many strong players who are not on the list, because Dixon and Didi have returned to the United Kingdom, so there are many new people on the list. However, its strength cannot be predicted.

On the South China side, because Mai Shaohan is ill and still needs to recuperate, he will definitely not be able to play at that time. Therefore, the proposed lineup is slightly the same as when facing the police in the special silver medal final the other day. Li Guowei will serve as the left inside guard, and Guo Yingqi will serve as the right forward guard. As for the forward position, it will be filled by Li Enliang.

In addition, the Football Association has decided that the performance match on the 22nd will add a match between the Second Division champion team and the League team, and the award ceremony will be held after the match. (Taisui)

The two lineups proposed by South China and the Navy are as follows:

South China South

Zhang Rongcai, Bao Jiaping, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Liu Qingcai, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Li Enliang, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen

Navy Team

Luo Bianchen, Xuan Di, Ge Lianchen, Gan Nichang, Ta Gen, Han Ni, Gao Lushi, Ban, Li Shi, Li Shi, Yan Luode, Lang

### Yesterday's Basketball Game: Police Fought Hard to Defeat the Police

In the public men's basketball game, the Hong Kong University team played against the police last night. Hong Kong has been defeated in all battles since its debut, and the police have not yet won. In terms of strength, the police are stronger than Hong Kong University. Bu Wei said that after the connection, Hong Kong University was full of energy and overwhelmed the police with 20 to 12 in the first half. Later, the police changed their strategy and transferred Hui Tingkai to serve as a forward, which gave Hong Kong University a great threat, and won with 46 to 37.

In the second group, Guan Lei fought against Da Zhong. Guan Lei's offensive power was not weak, but the people in the team were able to unite in attack and defense. Dong Qibiao, He Jinshi, Wu Kun, Zheng Yong, etc. made special contributions. Therefore, Guan Lei lost with a score of 31 to 51.

In the final game, Qingzhi played against Zhongsheng. After the start of the competition, the strength of the two sides was very different. Qingzhi was repeatedly broken by Zhongsheng.

### Second Division Runner-Up Final: Not Held Yesterday Because the Fifth Battalion Artillery Did Not Arrive

[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the Second Division Football League, after South China defeated Scott and won the championship, as for the runner-up spot, because the Fifth Battalion Artillery and Middlesbrough had the same score, a final match must be held to determine who it belongs to. It was found that this final match was originally scheduled to be held at the Sochengbu at 3:30 pm yesterday. At that time, all the players of the Mi team had arrived and were ready to fight, but the soldiers of the Fifth Battalion Artillery were never seen, so it was not held. According to the investigation, the Fifth Battalion Artillery did not receive the notification letter from the Football Association and did not know about the competition in advance, so they did not send a team to the scene.

### Today's Tennis Match: Xu Weipei vs. Kobayashi Zhen; Li Huitang Defeated Na Xi Yesterday

In the Open Grass Tennis Tournament, there were originally two scheduled doubles and singles matches yesterday, but the doubles match between Xu Runpei and Xu Weipei against Lin Tiande and Huang Xi was postponed due to Lin Tiande's illness. Therefore, there was only one singles match between Na Xi and Li Huitang. Na Xi was indeed not Li Huitang's opponent, but his batting technique was still good. In the second set, he once launched a fierce attack on Li, but in the end, he was unsuccessful due to insufficient stamina. On the contrary, Li played steadily, but his splitting and killing were inferior to Na Xi. He was only able to use his intelligence to take advantage of the situation, combining gentleness and strength, and especially able to engage in short-range combat in front of the net, which made Na Xi exhausted. Li won in two straight sets. Today, there will be two singles matches, and Xu Weipei vs. Kobayashi Zhen will be the most spectacular, because these two were the champion and runner-up of the previous year. Meeting today, the performance is expected to be wonderful, but Xu's ball skills are superb and he will definitely be able to win.

(Yesterday's results)

Li Huitang won against Na Xi 6-1 6-4

### Chatting About Tennis

Tilden Says Amateur Tennis World

Only Has Five Years of Life Left: Professionalization After Five Years

[London Correspondent] According to former Wimbledon champion Tilden, amateur tennis only has five years of life left. After this, open tournaments in which amateur and professional players compete together will definitely appear.

"All the great players are now gradually leaving the amateur world," Tilden said yesterday. "In the near future, there will definitely come a day when there will be no good players in the amateur team who can attract the audience. At that time, there will be no one in the amateur tennis world who can protect the money, and naturally open tennis tournaments will emerge."

Tilden will soon go to Olympia to participate in professional competitions. He hinted that if the amateur side does not listen to the professional players now, then when they ask the professional players to compete with the amateur players in the future, if they are rejected by the professional players, then it will be "too late to regret."

But let's see what the other side says.

Simpson Says Tilden is Threatening

Amateur Tennis is Currently Thriving

Simpson, a sports reporter for the London Daily Mail, said that Tilden actually thought that we could say goodbye to the Davis Cup, Wimbledon and other competitions within five years and go to join hands with professional players to form open tennis tournaments together.

What he said may come true – who knows what things will change in five years? Many people say in unison that our tennis leaders dare not admit reality, but we cannot just accept Tilden's threat so docilely. Although there are still many amateur players receiving subsidies, we cannot but admit that amateur tennis is thriving.

In amateur tennis, there are predetermined victories. It is different in professional tennis. It is often suspected that some professional competitions are often rehearsed like a play before going on stage.

To win the audience's interest and create opportunities for the success of the next competition. Like this, if professional players also join Wimbledon, then tennis will be completely over.

Furthermore, assuming that the management completely allows it, are all amateur players willing to reach out and take a salary? Does everyone, no matter where they are, think that money is more important than anything else?

And how can we guarantee that professional players will definitely raise the standard of tennis a little bit? How do we know that amateur tennis will not disappear after five years? And how many places in the world are as wealthy as the United States? Moreover, even in places as wealthy as the United States, only exhibition matches can support some money. Therefore, whether amateur tennis will completely perish, this should also be carefully considered.

Panlai Speaks: Australia May Win the Taiwan Cup

American Main Player Drops Out: Victory Only Accounts for Half

Davis Cup. The tennis tournament has already begun this year. The defending champion, the American team, has suffered great losses in strength because its main player, Boqi, has already transferred to the professional world. It is also very speculative as to who will win the cup. According to the New York Telegraph, Panlai, the former British main player and champion of Wimbledon, who had run, said to people at the International Indoor Tennis Tournament here a while ago that who will be the owner of the Taiwan Cup this year is a very interesting question. At present, the United States' hope of maintaining the Taiwan Cup is only 50%. According to Jin's opinion, the Taiwan Cup may be owned by Australia, because if the United States has Boqi, it will get two points. Now that Bo has transferred to the professional world, the best player in the United States is Riggs, and what Riggs holds is his backhand shot. However, Brownville of Australia is good at fighting with both hands, and both his backhand and forehand are strong, and there is no difference. Therefore, Li has no possibility of defeating Bo. The key to victory or defeat lies in this. If Australia can retire from the group and fight with the United States, then the Cup treasure is also very promising.

### On the Trivialities of Art

— Jie Ru

The essential characteristic of art lies in its typicality. The reflection of objective reality in works of art is not done in a piecemeal and straightforward manner. It must be done through the artist's artistic generalization, so as to express the truth of reality in a universal and typical way. All great artists, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, their artistic victories are also the victories of their typical creations. "The power of art lies in generalization, in universalization." In the entire organism of art, it is completely impossible for us to abandon its characteristic of typicality. The task of the artist is to create artistic types, and from artistic types, to deepen and broaden people's understanding of life and reality, in order to "raise mankind above reality."

Art must have its typicality; this is already a definitive conclusion. But in addition to typicality, or rather, within typicality, art still cannot abandon its accuracy in detail. When Engels discussed this issue in a letter to Margaret Harkness, he emphasized, "I think realism means not only the correctness of detail, but also the correct transmission of typical characters in typical circumstances." From these two sentences of Engels, we can clearly see that in realism, although typicality is the basic and main trigger, the trivialities of art are also a factor that cannot be ignored or missing. Only in the organic combination of profound creation of typicality and accurate depiction of trivialities can excellent and great works of art succeed.

Detail—triviality is an important element in art. Although it is often looked down upon by many harsh critics or simply opposed by them, its existence in art, its provision of infinite clarity to art, is undeniable. The trivialities of art bring extraordinary persuasiveness in life, the soundness of images, and the clarity of environment to the creation of typicality. The generalization of art requires not only depth but also the coherence, persuasiveness, and clarity of the images of each detail, each scene, each character, etc. These can only be obtained and maintained in the correct depiction of artistic trivialities. Therefore, the trivialities of art become something that an artist cannot neglect during creation. Gorky, in his book "My Literary Education," repeatedly pointed out from his own early literary experience his mistakes in the depiction of trivialities when writing, and said, "This kind of mistake seems unimportant, but in fact it has great significance, because this kind of mistake will destroy the truthfulness of art." From this, we can see the importance of the meaning of artistic trivialities in the whole of art.

The trivialities of art can give a strong color to works of art and artistic types, and endow vivid stories and vibrant characters with freshness, clarity, vitality, and originality. Sholokhov, in "And Quiet Flows the Don," skillfully used various trivial depictions, clearly marking the entire artistic achievement with strong colors, giving people a particularly profound impression. This is one of his great successes. The correctness of artistic details can strengthen the power of art and give artistic types a fresh identity. Due to the trivialities of art, the soundness of images, the persuasiveness of life, and the clarity of the environment can be completed, and art can obtain its full persuasive power. In order to make works of art play a more active role, in order to make art achieve greater success, artists must put more effort and make more efforts in the depiction of artistic trivialities, emphasizing the vivid colors of the truth of reality from the truthful expression of artistic trivialities.

However, we must pay attention to the fact that the trivialities of art are not equal to being disorganized. The detailed description of each detail, scene, character, and situation does not mean that the artist should indiscriminately pile up each detail into the work without choice, order, or clarity. Artistic creation does not need simple trivialities, but needs accurate, ordered trivialities. It must be such trivialities that can make art obtain its particularity, clarity, and persuasiveness. Therefore, the trivialities of art, no matter which detail, scene, character, or situation, needs to be of high quality, a typical thing. For the entire work of art, it must become an indispensable and special aspect. When an artist wants to describe a special life phenomenon, if he needs to use artistic trivialities to emphasize the color of life, then he must select the most distinctive details that can clearly express the phenomenon from the aspects he needs, organize them, arrange them, so as to make them become an organic part of his art.

Although the trivialities of art are an important factor in the formation of art, they cannot be separated from the typicality of art and exist independently. Without the trivialities of art, it is true that typicality would lose its vivid posture and strong colors, but if artistic trivialities are raised not on the basis of typical creation, then it completely loses its existence. The typicality is still the basic and main. The trivialities of art are only a foil and subordinate. Only under the premise of strengthening typicality, deepening typicality, and matching typicality can the trivialities of art have its basis for existence. Its task is to render and create the general typicality from various special details. Therefore, the trivialities of art are the bridge of the generalization of art, the road from the particular to the general for art. Merely trivialities are not everything, nor are they a work of art. If someone regards trivialities as the fundamental content of art, it is undoubtedly lowering art, or rather, destroying art, because simply describing the trivial and non-essential aspects of objective reality, not distinguishing between the trivial things and the main aspects in reality, and blindly imitating the surface of life and reality, is unable to grasp the center of reality and the overall appearance of life. Blind imitation and trivial accumulation can only show the weakness and powerlessness of the artist and the work of art!

We must look at the trivialities of art from the perspective of typical creation in order to understand its fundamental meaning.

### To Our Beloved Fighters

— Ren Yinghui

Friends who are fighting for the glory of the motherland, I am moved by the letters written by you with passion and blood and tears. Every time I read your letters and savor your arduous and great deeds, how violently my blood vessels throb. I clearly know that your will has not wavered in the slightest. You resolutely appear at the front and rear of the × people with a heroic posture. You have demonstrated the great power of young people in action and work, and fulfilled your own tasks. This is the guarantee of the final victory of the motherland.

I will eternally remember what you said: "It is glorious to die in battle for the survival of the motherland," and "It has the highest value to die in battle for the establishment of a new life path for the nation's descendants." Friends, these words are absolute truth, the cry of the new generation of the Chinese nation. Only you who are in combat can recognize them more clearly, and only you are worthy of shouting them loudly.

The motherland is in battle, and you in the great ranks of battle have stood up without shame. You braved the bullets of the × people, went through life and death, and endured all kinds of hardships. You have never said a word of "fear of difficulty and avoidance of responsibility." You have not been in the slightest bit negligent in your work. Your determination in the belief of resistance and your enthusiasm for the civil movement all show that you have exhausted your strength. In your letters, you have never mentioned the issues of living conditions in the death-defying work and the personal prospects. This clearly shows that you have forgotten your own existence and have already put the country and the nation first. If it is said that this is your great achievement, it is rather to say that everything that has awakened and progressed in China in the battle.

Friends in battle, you earnestly hope that young people like you will return to the motherland and place themselves in the great torrent of the War of Resistance. You said that there are places for young people to work everywhere in the war zone, and young people are needed everywhere to exert their strength. I have a 120,000-point agreement on this. We will soon answer you with facts. Although it is good here, it is definitely not a place where young people like us can live for a long time. We will soon pack our bags and return to the country, and stand with you, the thousands and millions of Chinese fighters, and build a great wall of flesh and blood in the ranks of the War of Resistance to defend a path to life for the Chinese nation.

Friends, friends in battle, we return to the country and stand with you, work together, and we are "alive." Although we are living a comfortable life of peace here, we are feeling suffering from the bottom of our hearts—friends, we are about to embark on the journey, wait! We will meet soon.

From afar, I wish you who are valiantly resisting the war for the motherland good health.

### Tidbits of Chao'an

— Xin Ding

Chao'an is a county town with feudal remnants. The most prosperous and longest road is called Taiping Road, just like Huiai Road and Hanmin Road in Guangzhou, and Nathan Road and Shanghai Street in Hong Kong. However, it does not have any Westernized flavor, but rather has a strong feudal meaning. Along the road, there are many archways from the emperor's era, and the plaques of "Holy Day" are still hanging. The shops on both sides are all flat and have no special features, but many of the residents still have red-door bridges; there are golden characters or golden Bagua patterns in front, and the elderly women still wear trouser leggings, bound feet, and wear long-sleeved robes. Walking on such a road, it is as if you are in the world of an old novel. There are very few vehicles on the road, only some rickshaws and bicycles, and occasionally one or two streamlined cars pass by, which are those of "officials and dignitaries" from Shaoguan, with yellow mud splashes decorating the body.

In the spring of March, it should be the time of "drizzling rain." The buildings on the road are not arched but flat, so the rainwater does not flow away by itself, making the road muddy and difficult to walk. I went back to the hotel alone and asked the "waiter" to make tea. The teacup turned out to be as small as a wine glass. It is said that this is the custom of drinking tea here. If you drink from a large cup, it is not "civilized" enough. The entire county town does not have a single restaurant. No, there are also teahouses here, but they are not for people to "sip tea" but for eating and drinking. The food is very expensive. The dishes in ordinary medium-sized restaurants cost five or six jiao to one yuan each (most have been changed to national currency). Those at the lower level also cost two jiao for a meal package. As for rice, there has recently been a severe rice shortage in the Chaoshan area, with each yuan only buying nine tubes—about six jin or so, which directly affects the lives of most civilians.

There is not much atmosphere of wartime on the streets. There are no slogans, slogans, or wall newspapers. I went to the county civil education hall alone to take a look. Inside a large courtyard, there are rows of exhibition rooms, but they are all closed, covered with dust and cobwebs. The animal and plant specimens displayed inside are all in a disordered and incomplete state. There are no people coming to visit, and no staff are managing them. Only one worker is repairing the windows at the door. This situation is very desolate and dull. However, according to the newspapers, the national salvation movement in Chao'an is very enthusiastic. These days, they are carrying out condolences to the families of soldiers on expeditions, preparing for the expanded commemoration of the "March 29th" Huanghua Festival, and joint symposiums of various social organizations—party, government, and culture.

The people of Chao'an love music, so the musical instruments produced here are very famous. As long as two meals a day are not a problem, they like to play the coconut fiddle (a huqin made of coconut shell) and the qinqin in their spare time. Once I went to the Hongqiao area in the suburbs to stroll around. The scenery there is very good. There are blossoming kapok trees, and mountain lodges by the narrow pond, planted with silky willows on both sides. Under the backing of a small hill, there is a natural park. In a thatched hut in a nearby vegetable garden, I heard popular Chao'an music. However, these songs are all decadent and charming. According to the Cantonese saying, you can say that "you can hear the ear oil coming out," but it definitely cannot arouse intense emotions. The reason why this "Chaoshan music" is so attractive, in my opinion, is that it can use soft melodies and properly matched harmonies. In the Taiping prosperous age of entertainment and peace, people leisurely listen to a song after enjoying a comfortable life, and the taste is no less than that of the leisure class of tobacco and chocolate; but today, when the smell of gunpowder is strong, and Chao'an has become an important place on the eastern road of Guangdong, the general public is still immersed in soft and charming colors. This needs to be greatly reformed. I hope that the comrades of national salvation in Chaoshan will actively promote anti-× songs that can inspire, excite, and agitate, and sweep away the decadent and depressed customs!

### Spring in My Hometown

— Chu Qing

It's the time when kapok flowers are blooming again

The spring breeze stirs the traveler's homesickness

I dream of that unforgettable old place

(That, although not my true hometown

But I once grew up there)

Gentle sea, oh

The morning sun and water are like a pair of leaning lovers

In the silky drizzle

The cowherd children step on the shining dewdrops

The loud singing breaks through the silence of the wilderness

Over there, scattered huts

Release wisps of cooking smoke

Chickens and dogs have not broken the tranquility of the countryside

We once relied on two hands

Or an ox

On that fertile seaside

Living a comfortable life of the ancient century

But, since the Rising Sun flag appeared at the mouth of the Pearl River

A group of demons landed on the coast

The huts turned into ashes

Sisters were raped

The lucky ones only picked up a life from the cracks of guns

Now, the green fields are covered with blood and ointment

The sea is sobbing

Only sorrow remains in the hometown

Wanderers

Take the spring light and return

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Work? Hmph, is it just the work of killing people?" Fearing that these tough words would provoke a tough reaction from the other party, she paused and carefully observed the other party, because the other party was still holding the key to her life. She did not dare to resist harshly, nor was she willing to easily obey, so she had to use all her intelligence to ridicule, reluctantly speaking with a tough tone, and asked again: "Could it be that other people's graves are the foundation of your work?"

"..."

"Tell you, those who have killed people are not necessarily heroes!"

"Yes, those who are killed are not necessarily weak."

"Weak," she is weak. Otherwise, she could have escaped. If: When the maid served tea, when she stayed on the snowy road... But now, even if she is strong and has the determination to take risks, her result is bound to be failure. Because now he has changed his predetermined way of working. He does not hesitate to sacrifice her to complete his work.

"Your work, I know! Or know even more, I am weak! For the sake of work, for the sake of the weak, you should still fire a shot!... If your work can succeed, the death of the weak is nothing to regret!"

So, he told her the main reasons for killing her: in addition to hatred for her father, it was only money, just money. Then, he asked her again:

"Do you value it? Do you value your own life?"

"My money belongs to my father, my life is my own--"

"Then, do you love money? Or do you love life?"

"Is it that I love money?"

"Then I'll kill you?"

"What if I love life?"

"Then you come with me!"

"What if I don't love money or life?"
