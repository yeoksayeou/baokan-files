### A Brief Discussion on the Fake "Huaxing Bank"

The "Huaxing Bank," jointly established by puppet organizations in Central China instigated by Japan and various Japanese banks, was announced in Shanghai a few days ago. It is rumored that it will soon issue counterfeit currency to seize the Chinese legal tender currently circulating in Japanese-occupied areas. Japan's aim is to disrupt China's wartime finance and realize its so-called "yen bloc." Last year, it issued fake "United Reserve Bank" ("Lian Yin") banknotes under the name of the so-called "United Reserve Bank." The value of these counterfeit banknotes is now plummeting. According to a recent Reuters dispatch, the premium for exchanging counterfeit banknotes in North China for legal tender has reached 34.5%. Based on this example, it is not difficult to foresee the future of the so-called "Huaxing Bank."

It is very difficult to establish a country's currency system, and it is also not easy to destroy it. Given the solid foundation of China's legal tender system and the loyalty of the people to their country, any financial conspiracy by Japan will not yield unexpected gains. This has been proven by the failure of the counterfeit banknotes in North China. Moreover, Japan's attempt to destroy China's legal tender system is just that, an attempt, and it has no real ability to do so. The failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China was due to the existence of a name without substance, making it impossible to obtain foreign exchange. The counterfeit banknotes about to be issued in Central China will also have no so-called reserves. Some may think that they will use Japanese yen as reserves, but the amount of Japanese domestic currency issued had already ballooned to 2.9 billion yen by the end of last year, and most of the currency reserves have been spent on purchasing military supplies. If counterfeit banknotes in Central China are backed by Japanese yen, it will indirectly accelerate the expansion of Japanese currency. Some may think that they will use foreign currency as reserves, but with anti-aggression movements underway in various democratic countries, who would be willing to bear the responsibility of helping aggression? Japan's international credit is now so low that there is no guarantee of support for Chinese counterfeit banknotes, let alone loans for so-called industrial construction. Under Japan's current policy of excluding European and American interests in China, the door to borrowing has long been closed. It is rumored that last year, the puppet Manchukuo tried to borrow ten million dollars from American businesses for railway equipment, but this was rejected by the United States. Some may think that counterfeit banknotes will be exchanged for legal tender, and the legal tender reserves will be used as reserves. This is Japan's hope, but in reality it is extremely slim, because the Chinese government has long imposed very strict controls on foreign exchange. Some may think that foreign exchange from exporting goods can be used as reserves. This is possible, but how can one quench thirst by looking at plums? What are the real reserves except for the guns and knives of Japanese soldiers?

In fact, Japan knows that the counterfeit banknotes in North China cannot destroy China's legal tender system. The counterfeit banknotes in Central China will be no different from those in North China, and will have absolutely no ability to compete with Chinese legal tender. However, at a time when the people are impoverished and the country is financially exhausted, Japan, in order to achieve its illusory dream of creating a new order in East Asia, has no choice but to adopt this method of issuing counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's instigation of puppet organizations to gradually expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance is not to establish a foundation for any currency system for the puppet organizations. The issuance of counterfeit banknotes, in relation to the puppet organizations, is at most that when Japan is economically unable to provide assistance, the puppet organizations can borrow an economic blood debt in the military-occupied areas. Japan's real purpose is to take advantage of the convenience of the yen bloc, on the one hand, to extract the blood and sweat of the people in the guerrilla areas of China as much as possible to temporarily support the war against China; on the other hand, to control foreign exchange based on counterfeit banknotes and to try to exclude all European and American power in China.

The only role that counterfeit banknotes have in the guerrilla areas of China now is to facilitate trade with Japan, that is, to use counterfeit banknotes to forcibly purchase goods in the guerrilla areas, transport them for export, obtain foreign exchange, and control it. Export merchants must sell their foreign exchange to the puppet banks, and import merchants must obtain foreign exchange in advance. This is how it is done in North China. For example, last year, Japan's trade with North China, both imports and exports, doubled compared to the previous year. At the same time, it can also use Chinese goods that Japan does not need to exchange for various raw materials needed by the Japanese military. For example, the so-called list of priority import goods established by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in North China is entirely for the use of the Japanese military. Conversely, European and American countries' trade with North China is either restricted by Japan or has no profit to be made, so the trade volume has decreased greatly. Now, in order to obtain more raw materials and a larger market, and in order to more actively exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, Japan will naturally expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance to the Central China region.

The Chinese government had already taken precautions against Japan's attempt, prohibiting the free flow of goods between the mainland and the guerrilla areas, improving and reorganizing local finance in the war zones, and the guerrillas' severe punishment of those who use counterfeit banknotes. These are all effective ways to deal with Japan's issuance of counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's attempt to issue counterfeit banknotes in Central China this time has limited ability to destroy Chinese legal tender. In terms of the current actual situation, the circulation of counterfeit banknotes in Central China in the future will generally be limited to a few larger cities directly controlled by Japanese military force. The Chinese people living in these areas and the European and American merchants engaged in foreign trade in the Central China area will be greatly affected, especially the latter, who may encounter the same environment as in North China. This is what European and American expatriates in China should pay special attention to. At the time of the establishment of the puppet Huaxing Bank, it is said that the Chinese and foreign banks and money shops in Shanghai decided not to cooperate. This is an inevitable measure for the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to protect their own economic interests in Central China.

### Reports from Vietnam

— Li Xi, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper

(1) The Reaction to the Intrusion of × Planes into French Annam's Airspace

April 13

When the No. 19 mail plane of the Luoge Asia Airline was near He Kou, it was rumored to have intruded into French Annam's airspace. The French people here are quite indignant about this. Currently, more and more of them are expressing dissatisfaction with the weakness of France's Far East diplomatic policy. A French friend told us that the young French soldiers here, in view of Japan's repeated oppression, having already occupied Hainan Island, the Storm Islands, and now becoming even more aggressive, openly invading French Annam's airspace, are quite a few who advocate war against Japan because of this. Recently, a high-ranking officer of the French fleet stationed in Vietnam, someone, represented this opinion and strongly advocated taking military retaliation against Japan. However, this is of course impossible in the current state of affairs, so he was regarded as an extremist and recently transferred elsewhere. From this, we can also see that although France is now more willing to take the path of opposing aggression, it is still very limited.

(2) The Political Director of the Annam Governor-General's Office Transferred

On the 26th (?), the newspapers in the Japanese-controlled area all published the news that Mr. Grandfean, the Political Director of the Annam Governor-General's Office, was being transferred back to Europe. I think this news may be worth our attention. As far as we know, this political director is a famous "Japanophobe" here. It is said that when our "August 13th" War of Resistance broke out in Shanghai the year before last, he was ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate the war. Later, he returned to Annam and made a report, the general idea of which was that Japan's mechanized units were very powerful, their morale was very high, and their military discipline was very good. In short, he expressed his admiration for Japan. As for China, he said that it was simply completely hopeless. Not only were the weapons obsolete, but there was no organization at all. Even some new mechanized weapons could not be used, and when they saw the × people coming, they had no choice but to abandon the machines and "flee for their lives." Therefore, he advocated that in order to preserve France's Far East interests, it must compromise with Japan. This report of his became the basis for France's rather long-term policy of compromise with Japan. Let us not criticize the ridiculousness of his ignorance and shallowness. Let us say that under the leadership of this political director, after the fall of Hanzhou, Annam, after being slightly threatened by a few arrogant words from Japan, immediately implemented a blockade of the border between China and France and stopped the transportation of military supplies to our country on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. They attempted to obtain temporary security by compromising and retreating from Japan. However, the facts were completely different. Japan instead occupied Hainan Island and the French-owned Storm Islands, and even openly violated France's Annam airspace. These facts completely shattered Grandjean's short-sighted views. At a time when the anti-aggression united front movements of countries such as Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly active and close to gradual completion, France has transferred this old gentleman back to Europe. It must be related to the changes in France's overall foreign policy.

(3) French Newspaper Reports That Our Consul in Saigon Is ×'s New Secretary

A few days ago, the local French newspaper La Vonlonte Indochinoire reported that after the death of Mr. Zeng ××, a certain consul of our country in Saigon took over the position of private secretary of ×××. Later, it was rumored that when the consul studied in France in the past, he had accepted personal subsidies from ×. It is not impossible that he would do such a thing today. The above records and rumors are closely related. It is unknown whether they are true. If they are not true, we believe that the consul should immediately publish a statement in the newspaper to clarify the facts. At the same time, we also hope that our government will immediately and thoroughly investigate the matter to find out the truth and take action.

(4) Certain Civil Servants' Corrupt Behavior in Vietnam

Since Wuhan and Guangzhou successively fell, and international routes shifted to Annam, various military and political departments of our country followed suit and established offices here, and many civil servants also came here. Among the civil servants sent to serve here, there are indeed those who can maintain their integrity, act in the public interest, and defend the country, but there are also many who are not satisfactory. The local overseas Chinese, witnessing the extravagant and corrupt lives of civil servants entering and leaving dance halls, brothels, and bars at will here, express infinite indignation. We feel that this phenomenon needs to be corrected urgently. Because overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about loving their country, it is a major driving force for our current war of resistance. We must not disappoint them and reduce or even eliminate their patriotic enthusiasm. Recently, a famous overseas Chinese gentleman here told reporters that he had heard that a civil servant went to a foreign firm in Hanoi to buy an old Ford car. The price was agreed to be 2,500 yuan, but the civil servant insisted that the firm's office write 3,500 yuan on the invoice, making the firm confused and unwilling to agree. The civil servant said sternly: "If you can act according to my opinion, then I can help you buy three more. Otherwise, I will go to another place to trade immediately, and I don't want even this one!" In this way, of course, there is no more problem. The firm obeyed for the sake of safety. It is said that this news is very true. Reporters have heard many similar incidents. For example, in order to avoid being reported for corruption, civil servants are unwilling to trade with overseas Chinese and are mostly willing to pay high prices to do business with foreigners. This is a good example. We believe that regardless of whether these incidents are true or not, we hope that our civil servants will all take the meaning of "correcting mistakes if they exist and being encouraged if they don't," and instead create many extraordinary and glorious examples for us, so that the overseas Chinese here will have a fresh impression!

(5) Friction between Overseas Chinese and Annamese People Under the Conspiracy of × People

More than two months ago, this reporter saw a document issued by our consulate in Hanoi advising overseas Chinese not to create disputes with the Annamese people, so as not to be provoked by × people to sow discord and undermine our war of resistance. It is said that recently, overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong have still not been able to completely avoid disputes such as quarrels and fights with the Annamese people. This is truly a great pity! The cause of these disputes may seem to be due to the fault of the Annamese people on the surface. However, our overseas Chinese should adhere to the great principle that our motherland's war of resistance today must strive to win foreign aid, and give up all anger. As the ancients said, "A small impatience will ruin a big plan." What's more, these disputes are actually caused by the instigation and provocation of an agent. Compatriots, let us not be fooled! We should try to win the sympathy of the Annamese people. Haven't the Vietnamese overseas Chinese in Yunnan and the Annamese people here donated money to help our war of resistance? According to what reporters have heard, there are also Annamese people who voluntarily report information about × people to us. Especially the Annamese communists, because they witnessed the purchase of Vietnamese drivers by × people to drive and transport gasoline for us within Vietnam, secretly dumped or sold the gasoline. And they voluntarily took responsibility for supervising us. These things are so touching to us! As for their verbal sympathy for us and hatred for Japan, they are another matter.

However, unfortunately, there is something even more heartbreaking for us! According to reports, in a place called Hongge (Hougay), located 70 kilometers (each kilometer is about 1.7 li in our country) northeast of Haiphong, a major dispute between the Chinese and Vietnamese recently occurred. Hongge is a mining area, and most of the miners are Annamese, and there are also some overseas Chinese. The area is adjacent to the sea and is a strategic location in military terms. It is said that if × people invade the north of Annam in the future, that place will be one of the places where both sides must compete for victory or defeat. Therefore, × people are very active there. It is said that this dispute was caused by a fight between Chinese and Vietnamese children. Later, the parents of the Chinese children showed favoritism and lightly beat the Vietnamese children. As a result, the Vietnamese miners gathered a crowd to fight the Chinese, and the local Chinese also gathered to clash with them. The number of participants even reached more than a thousand. Later, fortunately, the police suppressed the situation and arrested a number of people from both sides, and the situation stopped. It is no accident that a small incident has expanded to such a scale. It can be asserted that the background must be the conspiracy and provocation of × people! It is a pity that our overseas Chinese are ignorant and have been poisoned by × people! When reporters write here, they feel that these things cannot be ignored, and it is by no means effective with a single document from a line consul. It is necessary to hope that our local overseas Chinese groups and youth workers for national salvation can come out to conduct more of this kind of propaganda and education, expose the conspiracy of × people's challenges, and carry out a planned movement to stop the continued development of this friction situation. At this point, the reporter cannot help but shout to our overseas Chinese again: Compatriots, let us not be fooled by × people!

(6) Regarding the Recent Charity Painting Exhibition in Haiphong

A painter named Huang recently held a personal painting exhibition in the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, selling his paintings at high prices. The price of each painting is often dozens of yuan, and some are as high as sixty yuan! However, in terms of the content of the paintings, they are nothing more than old-fashioned paintings depicting the scenery, flowers, moon, birds, animals, plants, etc., which have more than enough propaganda for elegance, but not only are they insufficient to encourage national salvation, but it is simply impossible to talk about. So why can he sell his paintings so well? It is said that half of the income from each painting, excluding expenses, is to be donated to the government for the war of resistance. He uses the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese, so he can sell his paintings so well. A gentleman from the overseas Chinese said to me: If he sells a painting worth ten yuan for sixty yuan, donates thirty yuan to the government, isn't he still making a fortune of twenty yuan from the national crisis? I said: I don't know your "humor," only the painter knows!

(7) × People's Propaganda Work for Overseas Chinese

× people recently sent propaganda to overseas Chinese in Haiphong and Hanoi from Guangzhou, door to door (presumably in other places as well). Not only are the street numbers and store numbers accurate, but even the names of the store owners are written clearly! What are they writing? "Guangzhou Minsheng Daily," "Japanese Osaka Chinese Daily," "South China Books and Newspapers," "Xiamen Pictorial," "Far East Monthly" - issued on February 1, Showa 14, etc. What is particularly noteworthy is the stinky article "Wang Jingwei's Recent Important Remarks - to Give an Example" printed on special paper. The "Guangzhou Minsheng Daily" solemnly reprinted it and specially wrote an editorial saying: "Crush the dreams of those who advocate war and oppose peace." From this, we can know the thoroughness of × people's propaganda work and the urgency of × people's desire for peace. They want to use this to shake the patriotic enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese. Who knows that the facts are completely beyond their expectations? The overseas Chinese immediately tore them up when they received them and did not even want to take a look. Some even said to the postman, this thing is not ours, take it back. They are unwilling to take it in order to preserve the purity of their patriotic enthusiasm!

April 28, 1939, in Hanoi.

### The Financial Situation in Beijing and Tianjin Under Japanese Control

— Xinsheng

(May 1, Beijing Correspondence) The North China Daily News recently published an article by its Tokyo correspondent, stating that the Japanese authorities are currently drafting a great plan to develop gold mining on the border of Rehe and Manchukuo. It also stated that the gold obtained will be used to increase the resources of the newly established "United Reserve Bank" in Beijing and help to establish control over the financial situation in North China and expand foreign trade in the region. If the bank's hope of increasing its resources lies only in this aspect, then this kind of assistance will have to wait to be obtained, because currently, due to the continued sharp decline in the value of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, there is a serious monetary crisis in North China. At the time this reporter was writing, "United Reserve Bank" banknotes were exchanged for legal tender at a discount of more than 35%. The decline continues day by day. The monetary issue is really the only topic of discussion here in recent days, even to the point of ignoring the war situation. The residents of Beijing are now worried and talking to each other in low voices, saying, "The new currency is going to be worthless." They seem quite alarmed, which reduces the credibility of those so-called financiers, because those who know the content of "United Reserve Bank" have always been sure that this kind of banknote without any reserves will not know how the Japanese declaration and bayonets can give it value. The public's panic is justified for several reasons, because we have now seen the signs of financial chaos. Such as the rise in the cost of living, stores raise the prices of various goods every day, necessities such as flour and kerosene, and all imported goods, are all rising in price. A bag of 40 pounds of American flour, which could be obtained for six yuan three weeks ago, now costs seven yuan and two cents. Railway fares have almost doubled, and return tickets cannot be purchased. Even the local taxes have been increased several times. Several foreign stores have recently started to price their goods in pounds or gold dollars. The free exchange of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes for Japanese yen at par has been restricted, and now the restrictions are even tighter. Only Japanese stores with special permission can obtain a limited amount of Japanese yen from the Yokohama Specie Bank. There are various reasons for the depreciation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. One explanation is that foreigners import a large amount of flour into North China, and now importers have to use foreign exchange, which can only be obtained with legal tender. However, the Japanese have promulgated regulations to implement searches and confiscations, which has forced legal tender to circulate formally. Therefore, unless with a very high premium, a large amount of legal tender cannot be obtained. This is one reason, but not all reasons are in this. Although this can explain the rise in the price of a small number of goods and the reason for the considerable premium on legal tender, this theory does not take into account the sudden and drastic decline in the value of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes and the general mistrust. It is rumored that the Japanese bridges in North China are willing to pay any price to purchase legal tender. This is one example. Many believe that this is caused by the continuous depreciation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, and the rumors that the Japanese yen is about to be devalued have made people even more uneasy. The "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which are currently worth about six pence and five farthings, can be exchanged for Japanese yen, which is officially priced at one shilling and two farthings, at any price, but the amount is limited. From this fact, the current financial chaos here can be clearly understood. Observers who are watching similar financial oddities in other parts of the world with cold eyes are now discovering that Chinese merchants who only a few months ago were demanding payment in "United Reserve Bank" banknotes are now eagerly asking customers if they can pay in legal tender again. Or seeing shops that had previously firmly announced that they only accepted "United Reserve Bank" banknotes are now reissuing notices stating that they will price their goods in a certain gold coin in the future. It should not be surprising at all. Many Japanese are talking about the need to take "resolute measures," but even the Japanese military's finances cannot explain what kind of boldness can give value to a worthless currency. There are also suggestions to stop the import of all goods into North China. This move may temporarily prevent "United Reserve Bank" banknotes from continuing to fall, but it is only temporary and will only increase financial chaos. Because the implementation of this move will cut off the sources of several necessities that cannot be obtained from Japan, the cost of living will continue to rise, which will have an unfavorable impact on the Japanese yen and will lead to widespread smuggling. The exchange rate of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will still not be resolved. Products from most of the mainland, such as cotton, peanuts, eggs, etc., still have to be paid for in legal tender, and since the amount of legal tender is small, it gradually rises in premium. Finally, even today, it is still doubtful whether restricting imports can restore confidence in the unprepared "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. The only sound method is to admit failure and gradually withdraw this new currency, just as when a large amount of Japanese yen flowed into China last year. However, this is only a suggestion and will certainly not be adopted by the Japanese. In view of the disastrous failure of the Japanese currency experiment in North China, and the Japanese military financial experts still decided to use a new currency that is "independent" in Central China, it is even more obvious that there is no hope of accepting advice.

### Germany Prepares to Attack

— By Mrs. Tabouis

From studying the mission of Göring and Goebbels abroad, we can draw an ominous conclusion.

Göring is preparing an attack on the democracies, an attack launched by the Berlin, Rome, Tokyo, and Burgos axis.

Goebbels is preparing an advancement on Göring's plan, that is to say, Hitler has ordered him to execute two new propaganda programs now that Göring's mission has been completed.

Göring has now gone to Italy, which is equivalent to a German colony, (note that Göring has already returned to Germany) to supervise the management of Italian troops. Italian troops, from the smallest units to the largest forces, will be attended by German technical experts and officers, creating a manipulative situation. The German Wehrmacht has already mobilized and concentrated troops on the border of the Alps.

For a time, Italian Chief of Staff General Pariani opposed handing over this border to the German army, but in the end, Göring prevailed.

It is estimated that the German forces concentrated on this border now number about 100,000.

At the same time, after inspecting Italy's airfields, Göring is now transferring more German air force units to Italy. He believes that the air defenses of Italian coastal cities and Rome are insufficient and should be remedied by the German air force.

He said that Italy's military supplies and heavy artillery should also be enhanced by German technical experts.

Finally, he went from Calabria to Tripoli to inspect the Italian troops in Libya, checking whether it was possible for them to launch a rapid attack on French territories. General Balbo, the Italian resident in Libya, said that to do so, they would need another 300,000 men.

Göring has also prepared to deploy 60,000 German troops to Rhodes in the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey. These troops are fully armed and equipped as an expeditionary force. Where will they advance? Against Syria, Egypt, or Palestine? No one knows yet, but Greece has already been greatly alarmed by their movements.

Göring has been actively cooperating with Berlin in dispatching these German colonial troops to Libya. Last week, 28,000 German soldiers passed through Italy to Libya.

At the same time, the German Colonial Office, following Göring's instructions, has ordered the conscription of colonial doctors and officials, asking them to sign contracts stipulating that they and their families can be transferred abroad by the end of June and take up new positions in mid-July.

According to secret orders from the Colonial Office, Germany will have recovered some of its old colonies by that time.

While in Italy, Göring had frequent long-distance telephone calls with Hitler day and night. As a counterattack against the Anglo-Polish alliance, he and Hitler agreed on a new plan to attack Poland, preparing for German troops to enter Poland at two points: the Polish Corridor and Silesia. The German side believes that Poland will not resist, or, in any case, if Germany agrees not to attack French territory, France will not intervene.

This is the plan put forward by Göring and Hitler. In other words, Göring is now organizing the four countries of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain to launch a fierce attack on the democracies.

General Franco, that is, the Italian and German troops in Spain, will attack the British forces in Gibraltar.

Italian troops will launch their offensive in Libya and Tunisia, combined with air raids on British and French naval and land forces in the Mediterranean.

German troops will make a large-scale attack through the Netherlands, while simultaneously entering the Polish Corridor and Silesia.

Hitler and Göring decided that if they launched a fierce and rapid military offensive, the democracies would be willing to concede and agree to the demands of the Axis powers, and would not dare to break out into a terrible war.

Göring is the most hated person in Italy, because his military officers manipulate Italy. They wear two badges, one is the Nazi swastika badge, and the other says "Italian Army." These officers treat the Italian people with arrogance and abuse.

The anger of the Italian people is obvious. The famous futurist Marinetti said: "I am in favor of the Rome-Berlin Axis, I believe in the Berlin-Rome Axis, but as for the kind of Berlin Axis imagined by General Göring, even if you take our lives, I will not agree with it or believe in it!"

Goebbels' mission in the Balkans and the Levant (the general term for the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, from western Greece to western Egypt) is another aspect of the situation. Hitler ordered him to prepare two propaganda plans, one for use in a major war, and the other for use when the democracies surrender.

Goebbels went abroad with many of his propaganda department staff, and recruited new people in Athens, the Balkans, and other countries of the Levant.

Half a month ago, at a meeting of the Propaganda Department presided over by Hitler, he rudely told Goebbels: "The current propaganda methods are of no use to Germany's goals. Göring already has his army orders. Now it's up to you to have a new propaganda plan for the glorious days to come."

### Our Army Achieves Great Victory East of Xiangfan × Army Suffers Casualties Exceeding 30,000 A Certain Officer Leads Troops Across the Xiang River to Attack

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 7th] The × invading central Hubei, according to their serial numbers, consist of three divisions. Two divisions and a cavalry brigade attacked north from the Hanyi Road, while one division advanced along the Hua-Xiang Road towards the left flank, vying for control with us in fierce and bloody battles. Since a certain officer of our army led his troops across the river to attack north, they have achieved numerous victories in recent days. Yesterday, they routed 3,000 × troops on the Haozigang and Tianjiaji routes, killing more than 1,000 × troops, seizing a large number of weapons, horses, military supplies, and documents, and capturing a × army officer named Matsui.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] In the Xia County, Wenxi, and Anyi areas of southern Shanxi, we have launched continuous attacks on the × troops, killing several hundred. Southern Hebei is under our control. We killed two to three hundred × troops near Nangong and Daming previously.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guilin, 17th] Our × troops are still in a standoff with the × troops near Wuning and north of Gaoan in Jiangxi Province.

The situation on the eastern bank of the Gan River and the Fu River is calm.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] According to Chinese sources, there have been 416 battles on various fronts between China and Japan in the first half of May. The Japanese army suffered 12,0475 casualties, of which 105 battles were in Shanxi Province. The battles in Hubei Province were particularly fierce, with 12,781 Japanese troops killed and 18 Japanese aircraft destroyed, not including those shot down from the air.

Our Military Authorities Refute × Propaganda

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Recently, the × side has repeatedly broadcast that they have surrounded more than 20 divisions of our army, totaling 150,000 men, near Zaoyang, and have annihilated them. When asked about this news, military authorities all laughed and said that our army, based on its consistent strategy of protracted attrition warfare, avoids decisive battles with the × troops. Our troops have retreated in due course in advance of the × army's self-proclaimed encirclement operation. Even most of the civilians in the area have been evacuated, leaving no one within the encirclement. Therefore, if reporters stationed in Shanghai and Tokyo ask the × army spokesperson about the fruits of the × army's victory in this encirclement, such as how many prisoners were captured and how many spoils of war were seized, even the × army spokesperson, who is best at fabrication, will be at a loss for words. Moreover, after the × army surged northward from ×× to ××, they were met with a head-on blow from our Tang Army Corps from the north, and the × army collapsed and fled south. If ×× is outside the × army's encirclement, the × side broadcast the next day that it was shrinking the encirclement. Although the × army has repeatedly stated that Tang Enbo's army has been surrounded and annihilated, who was it that inflicted a painful blow on the × army at ××? And why did the × army, which won the victory on the Huayuan-Xiangfan Road, abandon its countless wounded soldiers along the way without taking care of them? Perhaps only the trees, houses, and plants on the Tongbai Mountain and Dabie Mountain, which cannot move, were unable to resist the × army's encirclement. Moreover, in the battles east of Xiangfan, the × army suffered more than 30,000 casualties, a number far greater than our army's.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to a spokesman for the Chinese military headquarters, due to the fierce fighting in central Hubei Province, the Japanese army has had to rush troops from all sides to reinforce it, so the fighting on other fronts has been suspended. The fighting near Suixian is relatively fierce, making it extremely difficult to obtain accurate information. However, the Japanese propaganda that twenty divisions of the Chinese army have been trapped is completely groundless. The spokesman also said that the Japanese army's goal is Xiangyang, and they are also attempting to cut off the retreat of the Chinese army in the area, but so far they have not succeeded. Recently, a thousand cavalrymen set out from Zhongxiang and advanced north, but were driven back to the east bank of the Han River. The Japanese army originally had four divisions, but now half of them have been transferred to northern Hubei, because most of the war zone is mountainous, making it difficult for the Japanese army's mechanized units to transport supplies, resulting in heavy casualties. In the past week, the Japanese army suffered about 6,000 casualties. The fighting near Xinye and Tanghe is even more fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides. Tanghe was once lost, but was soon recaptured by the Chinese army. After losing Tanghe, the Japanese army reinforced it with 3,000 troops, and the Chinese army also transferred troops from Nanyang to help. The two armies are now in a standoff southeast of Tanghe. Currently, only the front line of Suixian is experiencing a major battle, and in each melee, the Japanese army suffers heavier casualties, while the Chinese army suffers few losses. Even after investigating after the Japanese aircraft's frenzied bombing. Finally, the spokesman said that it would take three months to determine who would win or lose. The Chinese army is now preparing to counterattack. If they fail to succeed, they will retreat to Xiangyang. But in any case, the Japanese army is powerless to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army.

× Reinforces Shanxi Province Makes a Last-Ditch Effort

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] A Chinese military official told an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army is now planning to send coarsely trained divisions to the five districts of Shanxi Province to assist the independent divisions in each district in combat. The purpose of this plan is to make a final effort to "pacify" the Eighth Route Army guerrillas. This "pacification" work is the main strategy of the Japanese army in order to maintain the transportation lines in the Northwest and to serve as a base for future attacks on Xi'an and Lanzhou. However, the Japanese army's plan will inevitably fail, because the Chinese guerrillas are strong and have superb tactics, and the Japanese army's scattered forces are not enough to encircle the guerrillas.

### Kulangsu Concession Authorities Reject Japanese Demands Rear Admiral Noble Leaves British Warships in Amoy England, America, and France Have Protested to Japan

[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th] Late last night, the British cabinet discussed whether to send the navy to Kulangsu to deal with the Japanese occupation of the island. According to political circles here, the British government cannot tolerate the Japanese military action in Kulangsu, otherwise Japan will occupy all the public concessions in the Far East. The British government is now consulting with the United States, as the two countries must take joint action on such events.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Kulangsu Concession Administrative Council held a special meeting yesterday and decided to oppose the conditions proposed by the Japanese Consul-General in Amoy on the 13th.

### × At Wit's End Fabricates Lies Distorts International Information Deceives Domestic Population

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Recently, the × side has suffered repeated defeats on various fronts, and its domestic economic resources and military strength are unable to maintain the situation. Therefore, it is fabricating rumors in Tokyo, attempting to distort international information and reduce anti-war sentiment at home. When bombing our capital Chongqing a few days ago, it arbitrarily dropped bombs on foreign embassies and churches. Afterwards, it falsely claimed that there were our anti-aircraft positions near the embassies and consulates in an attempt to shirk responsibility. Due to the condemnation of gentlemen and scholars in Chongqing and the protests of Britain and the United States, it was unable to answer. Now, Tokyo is spreading rumors that Ding Jianxu, a division commander of our army in northern Jiangxi, has been captured by the × troops and made a speech in the × army. Its trick of fabricating lies is even more ridiculous. According to military authorities, Ding Jianxu is a brigade commander of our army, loyal and brave, and has repeatedly made outstanding achievements. The × troops fear him like a tiger. He is currently working hard to kill the × troops. How can he be captured? The × side is at wit's end and attempts to spread rumors to deceive its people, but it does not know that it is only accelerating its collapse.

### National Production Conference Chairman Chiang's Instructions (3)

Should meet current needs. We should rush to manufacture what is necessary. The most urgent need at present is for armaments and all military supplies. Our various factories must strive to improve the quality of national defense products. Secondly, we must, in light of the convenience of raw materials and transportation, enable a certain region to develop a certain leading product, and at the same time be able to divide labor and cooperate. On the one hand, we concentrate our strength, and on the other hand, we lay the foundation for the balanced development of the national economy. Finally, transportation industry, which is closely related to national defense and general production, is receiving full attention from the government, but we also hope that entrepreneurs across the country will do their best to support it.

Third, we must develop inherent production and maintain national economic self-sufficiency. Our modern production must revitalize both agriculture and handicrafts. On the one hand, our country must build modern economic weapons. When modern weapons are insufficient, even the most primitive weapons must be used. Today is a great opportunity for us to revitalize native products. This is not only extremely important for maintaining the daily life of the people in the rear, but also of great significance in the occupied areas. The × people are looting funds and dumping × goods in the occupied areas. In addition to doing our best to protect our resources in the occupied areas, we must do our best to maintain our economic self-sufficiency and maintain our inherent production industries. That is to say, we must consolidate our economy at all times and in all places. The Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association has already started to do this work, which is a very good thing. We must also intensify our efforts in this area. We must have a strong economic fortress, and even more so a strong spiritual fortress, in order to enable everyone to resist the war, defend step by step, and achieve the goal of all-out resistance.

Fourth, we must study science and technology and improve the quality of production. Production and science cannot be separated. In the future, we must integrate production and scientific education to achieve the goal of integrating construction and education. In the past, our science was impractical and our production lacked technology, so that neither production nor science could develop. For example, today, we have many machines that rely entirely on imports, and many raw materials that we cannot manufacture ourselves. Once many raw materials are lacking, production will be panicked. Therefore, I hope that our entrepreneurs and scientists will cooperate sincerely, conduct joint research, give play to the creative spirit of our ancestors, study substitutes, study methods of manufacturing new raw materials from inherent raw materials, and improve the quality of products and establish a reputation for domestic products. We have already made a lot of progress in this area, but we must continue to exert our best efforts to create more amazing achievements. All inventions originate from needs. Today should be the time for us to give full play to our great creativity.

Fifth, we must practice economy and accumulate resources for national construction. Today, in the midst of extreme hardship, if we want to build, we must practice economy. Especially with regard to national defense resources, such as metals, power, liquid fuels, we must cherish them. A drop of oil is our blood, two inches of iron is our life, and a point of electrical current is our breath. We must save one point if we can. By extension, we must not allow the slightest waste of manpower, material resources, or time. In addition, we must save for ourselves those items and raw materials that can be exported and exchanged for foreign exchange, and exchange them for the materials we lack. In addition, all undertakings must not have unnecessary duplication or unnecessary competition, but must concentrate manpower and material resources, divide labor and cooperate, and move forward towards the great goal of prosperity and strength.

### Declaration of the National Production Conference

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The National Production Conference has issued a declaration, the full text of which is as follows:

"Resistance and nation-building, proceeding simultaneously," is the established national policy of the Central Government. Modern nations are based on three pillars: economy, education, and military force. "The victory or defeat of war depends on the sustained supply of economic power," is also the clear instruction of the Commander-in-Chief. Since the outbreak of the war, our country's military strength has grown stronger with each battle. Today's key task is to develop national production, so that the country's economic strength becomes increasingly substantial, and can be matched with this strong national military force to win the victory of the war of resistance and establish the foundation for nation-building. The government is mindful of this principle, and in order to review past work and promote future production, it has convened the National Production Conference. We, the participants, have overcome dangers and hardships to travel thousands of miles to attend the conference. We deeply appreciate the government's thoughtful plans for the country, and its important considerations for national construction. After seven days of detailed discussions, decisions have been made on various production issues. We respectfully offer our humble opinions for the government's reference in policy-making, and for discussion among our fellow countrymen.

Future Policy

China's economic construction has only progressed slowly despite decades of effort, and no significant results have been achieved. There are two main reasons for this: first, before the establishment of the National Government, although there was some construction, there was no plan; second, after the establishment of the National Government, although there was a plan, it was overshadowed by internal and external troubles, and no significant progress could be made. Now that the war of resistance has begun, the country is unified, internal troubles have been eliminated, and external troubles are also mired in difficulties. China's future economic policy should absolutely be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, aim to solve the normal needs of the people's lives, and especially develop state capital, support private enterprises, promote cooperative movements, and at the same time prevent capital concentration, so that production enterprises are nationalized, people-oriented, and rationalized, in order to lay the foundation for the construction of a new China and cultivate the economic strength of the entire nation. The war of resistance and nation-building are related to the safety and survival of the nation. The government should, based on the principles of "military first, victory first, country above all, nation above all," plan the national production forces as a whole, so that all kinds of essential military and civilian supplies are produced in large quantities and continuously, to meet the needs of national defense and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. There should be an overall plan for the types and quality of products, and there must be close links between various production enterprises, so that the entire national economic production becomes a mobile whole with a system and organization. Since the basis for national revival lies in the hinterland of the southwest and northwest, economic construction in the rear is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. Before the war, the economic center of the country was in the east. In the years after the war, the economic center of the country will be in the west. Therefore, all economic construction in the rear today must be based on planned calculations. The participants of this conference believe that the overall national production policy in the future should take economic construction in the southwest and northwest as one of the central principles, which should be recognized by the entire country, from top to bottom.

Agriculture, Forestry, Industry, and Mining

Are the mainstays of production enterprises. Their scope is broad and they await planning. Let's first talk about agriculture and forestry. Since the outbreak of the war, the war zones have been devastated and the coastal areas have been ravaged. Future agricultural construction must not only actively develop agricultural production in the rear to make up for the losses in the war zones, but also strive to restore agriculture in the war zones to enhance the strength of the compatriots in the war zones to resist the war. We believe that the objectives of agricultural production in our country should be: internally, to realize planned and organized production, so that agriculture can cooperate with industry to coordinate the relationship between various production sectors; externally, to increase the export of agricultural products to improve our international economic status. The planning and implementation of this agricultural policy cannot be achieved without the collective efforts of a large number of professionals. Therefore, the central government should urgently establish an Agricultural Design Committee and give agricultural professionals the convenience to contribute their opinions at any time. At the same time, it should strengthen the agricultural administrative agencies, so that all departments related to agricultural improvement are subordinate to a unified administrative system and maintain close contact to assist in the implementation of policies. Immigration and land reclamation are important measures to increase production and relieve refugees. They are currently being carried out by the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations, but due to the lack of unified management, organization, and guidance, the results have not been significant. The government should also set up land reclamation management agencies to take special responsibility, delineate the scope of the reclamation areas, generously allocate funds for land reclamation, cultivate land reclamation talents, and establish state-run and provincial-run reclamation areas, in order to achieve the success of the land reclamation cause. In the border provinces, where the land is vast and the population is sparse, immigration and land reclamation are particularly important for border administration. Planting the roots and establishing the foundation should be planned in advance.

The Price of Agricultural Products

Directly affects the interests of farmers and indirectly affects agricultural production. Therefore, raising prices is the most effective way to increase production. In the future, the Agricultural Bank and the Trade Committee should consider the situation and purchase rice, wheat, tung oil, silk, tea, pork, fur, and other items in large quantities at higher prices, and improve the marketing of agricultural products to improve the economic situation of farmers and increase their production capacity. Many farmers in our country are unable to fully use fertilizers and labor to increase production due to lack of funds. In order to prosper agriculture, agricultural financial institutions should promptly provide long-term, medium-term, and short-term loans. The improvement of agricultural production technology is the main way to increase industrial production. The backwardness of agriculture in our country, the unscientific nature of technology, and the lack of widespread promotion are important reasons. In addition to the construction of farmland irrigation, which should be handled by the government as a whole, various agricultural agencies should focus on crop breeding and cultivation, silkworm and livestock breeding, pest and disease control, effective use of fertilizers, self-sufficiency in improved agricultural implements, manufacturing of forestry and livestock products, promotion of three-dimensional agriculture, conservation of agricultural resources in the war zones, active implementation of agricultural extension and agricultural cooperation, and improvement of agricultural extension agencies. Special attention should be paid to rice, wheat, and cotton, which are related to people's livelihood, and silk, tea, tung oil, and pork, which are related to export trade, in order to improve the lives of farmers and increase agricultural products.

Forest Production

Is of great importance to industrial raw materials and farmland irrigation. During this time of war, the need for timber is particularly urgent, and the wood chemical industry should be established by the government. The southwestern provinces of our country are not lacking in large areas of natural forests. The surveyed and proven valuable timber is no less than tens of thousands of trees. All forests related to water conservancy and national soil conservation should be designated as state-owned forest areas by the government in accordance with the law, and bureaus should be established to manage them and harvest them in rotation. This will not only provide timber, but also employ labor. If the competent authorities can direct and supervise, so that logging and afforestation go hand in hand, so as to avoid the abuses of overlogging or abandonment, the timber will be inexhaustible. As for the existing barren mountains and wastelands in various provinces, those suitable for cultivating special economic forests should be planned by the central government and local governments should be urged to implement afforestation, in order to achieve the great effect of popularizing afforestation in the shortest possible time.

### The Blood Debt Owed by the × People

— Mo Huanping

— The Bombing Situation in Chongqing on May Fourth —

[Chongqing News Agency of the Revolutionary Comrades Society] The citizens of Chongqing, no, the compatriots of the whole country, will never forget this day—the old and new hatreds of May Fourth!

This day was a clear early summer day, and the thick fog that permeated the skies of Chongqing had suddenly disappeared. The air raid siren had sounded once at half past ten in the morning. The bloody lesson of the day before, May Third—another day of old and new hatreds—the bloody lesson of being bombed and burned for two miles, had caused every citizen to flee desperately to air raid shelters or safe areas, helping the old and carrying the young. However, the × planes were intercepted by us and could not enter the city's airspace. An hour later, the alarm was lifted, and the citizens calmed their pounding hearts and went home to carry on with their lives.

A peaceful half-day, a tense half-day. —This was the fourth day of the May Fourth Revolution Propaganda Week, and a torchlight procession was planned for the evening.

At 4:50 in the afternoon, just as the sun was about to lean against the mountain peaks, the citizens thought it was a safe time, but suddenly the first air raid alarm went off. The will to live gripped the souls of the citizens, and they once again desperately ran to air raid shelters and safe areas. Children of a few years old were crushed under the feet of the crowded masses; eighty-year-old women were knocked down on the side of the road in the flowing stream of people. Upon entering the air raid shelter, seventy-year-old men gasped for breath, rapid breathing tormenting them as they lay down on the damp ground, as if dead; fashionable young ladies, pulling up the cheongsams whose clasps had been broken off in the crowd, wiped the sweat that poured from their foreheads like a spring.

Airplanes whirred and circled in the sky.

"One plane—two planes—six planes—nine planes—fourteen planes... Look, over there..."

"The emergency alarm hasn't been sounded yet, these are our planes!"

"Who cares whose planes they are? What are those people who are chattering away in the air raid shelter if not traitors?"

"Stop arguing! Stop arguing!" A third person interjected.

The planes circled in the sky for a while, and the sound gradually faded, until it could no longer be heard. The people hiding in the air raid shelter breathed a sigh of relief and walked out of the shelter entrance, raising their hands to look at the sky.

"The × × planes have been driven away by us."

"They've gone back."

"The alarm hasn't been lifted yet!"

"The emergency alarm hasn't been sounded, why wait for it to be lifted?"

So the citizens gradually set foot on the road home.

Woo—woo—woo—... Suddenly the emergency alarm sounded. The citizens immediately ran back to the air raid shelter.

"Those who deserve to be punished by heaven! How did the × × planes turn back again?"

The muscles on every face jumped with the torches of anger.

Boom! Rumble! Rumble rumble rumble! ...Bombs were dropped like a string of pearls. The waters of the Yangtze River beside Chongqing were shaken and rippled; the mountain peaks above Chongqing were shaken as if by an earthquake; the people in the air raid shelter all covered their ears with their hands, and their faces turned the color of dirt in shock; the terror of death enveloped the air raid shelter, and everyone held their breath. A wave of resentment stimulated the cells of the whole body, and red blood spurted out:

"Damn it! Even if we die, we'll go to the front line and fight those × × before we die!"

The dull, heavy sound of the planes gradually faded again, until it could no longer be heard. The citizens were still trembling in the air raid shelter, not daring to move. Restlessness, depression, and tense emotions were revealed in their eyes and muscles. After a good while, they crawled out.

"Ah!—"

They cried out in startled amazement.

Chongqing was burning with a sky full of beacons of fire!

It is said that in the past, × planes dropped bombs one by one, but now it is different. Dozens are dropped at the same time. It is estimated that twenty-seven × planes broke into the city's airspace to bomb on this day, each dropping ten or eight, or dozens of bombs, and most of them were incendiary bombs. The houses in Chongqing are all made of wood, and they are very dense, and the streets and alleys are narrow. Fanned by the fluttering early summer wind, how could it not immediately be a sky full of fireworks?

The prosperous commercial districts, cultural centers, and the location of foreign consulates, Xinglong Street, Du You Street, Cangping Street, Guanmiao Xiang, Chaijia Alley, Jishi Alley, Cangxian Bridge, Qixing Gang, etc., were all groaning in the flames; the "goods" of several large department stores were swallowed by the fire, and the Commercial Press, which had not yet recovered from the devastation of the "January 28th" Incident, was also destroyed; the British and French consulates suffered losses, and even the consulate of × people's ally—Germany—was turned into the embers of fire...

The tongues of fire, both wide and long, stretched into the clouds, causing the bright moon to lose its color; thousands upon thousands of citizens—men, women, old, and young—groaned, cried, and struggled in the tongues of fire...!

The citizens who luckily escaped the tongues of fire, after the air raid alarm was lifted, discovered that their houses and shops had been burned down. Immediately, wrinkles of grief and indignation swelled up on their faces, and they rushed towards the fire. I searched for my father, wife, children, and friends. The city's fire brigades, protection corps, rescue teams, and even the military police and the Youth Corps of the Three People's Principles were all mobilized to rescue the fire, refugees, and demolish fire lanes... Countless citizens, men, women, old, and young, some naked, some in long gowns, some fashionable, some in suits, sat on the streets, clenching their fists, watching the tongues of fire gradually spread out. Thus, the night of May Fourth passed!

On the morning of May Fifth, Chairman Chiang immediately ordered the allocation of one million yuan to urgently relieve the suffering compatriots. He also ordered various agencies to start registering refugees in several places; at the same time, all vehicles, large and small, from Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang down to ordinary civil servants and private individuals, as well as ships on the rivers, were centrally controlled by the government and assigned by Ministers He Yingqin and Yu Feipeng to carry out emergency free transportation of refugees to various safe locations.

As for the disaster areas, the city's protection, rescue, and military police personnel were mobilized to carry out the arduous task of digging up corpses. The corpses that were dug out had their clothes burned off and looked like fire-roasted pigs fresh out of the oven. Some had dark faces and could not be recognized; some had blurred flesh and bones and were no longer human-like; some had heads but no feet, and some had limbs separated. One by one, they were dragged out of the fire and placed on the streets, one by one, they were placed in thin wooden coffins costing four yuan each, and one by one, they were carried to the burial places in the suburbs. Who would not shed tears of mourning when they saw this? Who would not be aroused by the fire of anger!

The work of digging is still going on; the work of burying is also continuing. According to the statistics of the morning of the 7th, the coffin fees bought by the government at four yuan each have reached 36,000 yuan; the money spent by private individuals to buy coffins and bury the dead without coffins is not included. There are still several streets that have not been excavated. Let us try to imagine, how many kind civilians were killed by the × bandits' arson in Chongqing this time? As for the loss of property, it is even impossible to estimate!

We have another blood debt on our backs. This is a blood debt with new hatreds added to old hatreds. Every citizen of Chongqing, every Chinese compatriot, will absolutely not forget it, and will repay it with blood! (May 7th, Chongqing)

### British Cabinet Discusses New Note to Soviet Union Yesterday, Accepts Soviet Mutual Assistance Proposal in Principle, Advocates Joint Declaration by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 17th] Lloyd George will present a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons on Friday on behalf of the opposition Liberal Party. The government will be questioned about the progress of British-Soviet negotiations. At the same time, Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Poland will also be discussed. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Undersecretary Butler will be the main speakers for the government, while Attlee and Greenwood will be the main speakers for the Labour Party. It is expected that the Prime Minister will rise to speak shortly after the start of the debate. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on Tuesday evening, lasting two hours, to conduct a preliminary study of the Soviet Union's reply before the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

[Associated Press, London, 16th] According to reliable sources, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee has passed a new note to the Soviet Union, accepting in principle the proposal for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. Earlier, the Soviet Union notified the British Foreign Office that it had decided to appoint Ambassador Maisky to replace Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to attend the League of Nations Council meeting, as an indirect warning to the British government not to delay the British-Soviet negotiations any longer. After receiving the Soviet Union's notification, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee immediately convened an exceptional meeting this afternoon. It is heard that all committee members are prepared to find ways to accept the Soviet proposal. Foreign Office experts have reportedly suggested a draft reply from the British side, the content of which seeks to accommodate the Soviet Union's views. The British government will convene a full Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and prepare to pass the new note, which will then be handed over to the Soviet Foreign Minister by British Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain can show a posture of compromising with the Soviet Union, Potemkin will still be able to attend the League of Nations meeting. The French side has previously expressed its willingness to mediate. It is heard that the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax in Paris next Saturday.

[Associated Press, London, 16th] Informal rumors were circulating in the House of Commons this evening that the British new note to the Soviet Union, while still refusing to form a military alliance, expressed three points: (1) Acknowledging in principle the signing of a mutual assistance agreement; (2) Approving the Soviet Union's proposal to provide guarantees to Poland, Turkey, and the Baltic states; (3) Expressing Britain's urgent desire to guarantee the Soviet Union's western border.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Since the Soviet authorities announced the change of the initial proposal, changing from Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to Ambassador to the UK Maisky to attend the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva (according to the Soviet plan), Soviet diplomacy has attracted more and more attention. In order to answer the Soviet Union's steps, the future talks in Geneva are extremely important. The French Foreign Minister Bonnet will begin to participate in the British and Soviet negotiations, and only from this fact, the British-Soviet negotiations have the hope of satisfactory conclusion. The League of Nations Council meeting itself is quite important. In addition to the original agenda, the League of Nations Committee may report on the Danzig issue. Political circles here firmly believe that the Soviet government's change of sending Maisky to attend the League of Nations meeting will absolutely not affect the British reply. However, in any case, the British reply must wait until Saturday before it can be delivered to the Soviet side. At the same time, it is hoped that Chamberlain will be able to announce the substantial progress of the negotiations with the Soviet Union on Friday.

### France Plans to Discuss Military Alliance with Soviet Union to Link Britain and Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] It is learned that France is now planning to discuss a military alliance with the Soviet Union in order to act as an intermediary between Britain and the Soviet Union, to seek a compromise, without formally forming a tripartite alliance. Daladier and Bonnet are preparing to discuss this issue with Halifax. France's plan is to add provisions to the Franco-Soviet agreement that if one country is attacked or goes to war, the other country should provide assistance, but France's guarantee obligations to other countries have been lifted. Because Britain is France's close partner, this plan is enough to link Britain and the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] It is rumored in political circles here that France will actively operate in Geneva and other places this week, acting as a faithful middleman between the London and Moscow governments, jointly seeking the best way to resist aggression. There is absolute confidence here that an effective compromise can be achieved. The "Debate News" said that it is believed that Britain can overcome all obstacles with France's diplomatic cooperation. The "Radical News" further said that according to a certain report, the British side has already formulated a compromise solution, which can be completed on Saturday and sent to the Soviet representative in Geneva on Monday next week.

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the Soviet government's reply yesterday regarding the anti-aggression group. According to official sources, the government will send a new counter-proposal to the Soviet Union, the content of which is approximately four points: (1) The British, French, and Soviet governments will issue a joint declaration stating their determination to prevent aggression in Europe; (2) The Soviet Union will provide guarantees to neighboring countries; (3) If the Soviet Union is attacked while implementing this guarantee, Britain and France will immediately provide assistance; (4) The British, French, and Soviet governments will agree on various practical military strategies, so that once something happens, the existing political agreements can be quickly implemented. The British and French governments will continue to exchange views in order to effectively determine the content of this new counter-proposal.

### Italian Foreign Debt

### The United Kingdom to Enact First Conscription: House of Commons Continues to Discuss Bill, Attorney General Proposes New Clause

[Haitong News Agency, London, 17th dispatch] According to reports, the British government will, starting July 1st, conscript its first group of 40,000 to 50,000 men, even those as young as 21, and assign them to military training. Those conscripted must, within two weeks, pass a medical examination and report to the local government for enlistment. A second conscription will be carried out two months later.

[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] When the conscription bill was presented again in the House of Commons today for discussion, the Attorney General proposed a new clause, advocating authorizing the government to apply the conscription bill to British subjects residing outside the United Kingdom. In explaining this new clause, the Attorney General stated that, within the limitations of this new clause, British subjects residing overseas should register at the local British consulate and need not return to the country. Labor Party member Mr. Benn asked whether South African nationals residing in England would also be obligated to serve in the military. Questions were also raised as to whether men of age whose parents were British but who were born in France or Argentina should also be required to serve. The Attorney General explained that the conscription bill cannot be applied to British subjects originally residing in British territories, including self-governing dominions, colonies, and protectorates. Therefore, South African nationals can also be exempt from military service. Those residing in self-governing dominions and other parts of the British Empire have their own responsibility to defend that territory and are therefore not within the scope of the conscription bill. Conversely, British subjects residing in foreign countries, having enjoyed the benefits of British protection, should not be exempt from military service. The Attorney General stated that difficulties arising from the nationality of young people are unavoidable. At the same time, because the nationality laws of various countries have different bases, this issue is truly difficult to resolve completely and perfectly. Later, this new clause was finally attached to the conscription bill.

Short Commentary

### Crushing the Air Raid Plan

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to prevent the bombing by [Japanese] aircraft, issued a letter on the 16th to the provincial and municipal governments and compatriots throughout the country. The full text was published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Chairman Chiang pointed out that the [Japanese] warlords' air raid plan consists of: (1) attempting to threaten the spirit of our entire nation's resistance with continuous bombing, hoping that we will surrender to [Japan]; (2) attempting to cut off the livelihood of our compatriots with fierce bombing, coercing our compatriots to reduce production in their displacement and affecting the future of the War of Resistance; (3) attempting to disrupt the tranquility of our society and disturb the order of our rear with concentrated bombing. Therefore, Chairman Chiang solemnly encouraged our compatriots throughout the country with three points, namely, first, to never forget this deep hatred, to further strengthen the determination to resist to the end, to crush the [Japanese] warlords' vicious plan, and to seek survival from death; second, to actively disperse urban residents, and also to earnestly strengthen organizations, go down to the countryside to develop rural areas, consolidate the front line of protracted resistance, and lay the foundation for future nation-building; third, to cooperate from top to bottom, to step up defense work, to ensure that we do not suffer major damage when the [Japanese] aircraft attack, and not to allow social order to be slightly affected. In this speech, Chairman Chiang also specifically pointed out our country's unprecedented victory in the current situation and the [Japanese]'s frenzied coming, and hoped that the soldiers and civilians throughout the country will further increase unity, vow to avenge the shame, be affectionate and sincere, and jointly repay the national hatred.

But looking at the extremely uncomplaining attitude of our Chongqing populace since [Japanese] aircraft frantically bombed Chongqing and other places, the increasingly high degree of anger of our national populace towards [the Japanese], and the unanimous condemnation of the [Japanese]'s [bestial] actions by domestic and foreign public opinion and the call for the entire nation to redouble its unity in supporting the central government's adherence to resistance, we can happily point out: all of our Chinese sons and daughters who are unwilling to be slaves have already used the fact of sincere support to express their compliance with Chairman Chiang's speech! However, as Chairman Chiang said, "[Japan] wants to destroy our nation, it must first cut off our people's lives, and its future brutal and cruel behavior will be even worse than today." Therefore, our compatriots throughout the country, in particular, must carefully read the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech this time, sincerely and earnestly comply. In particular, we, the overseas compatriots from all walks of life who have escaped the [Japanese]'s bombing and massacres and live abroad, should especially review Chairman Chiang's speech three times, and never forget the [Japanese] bandits' [cruel actions] against our ancestral land, homeland, and compatriots. Chairman Chiang said: "Those of our compatriots who are hit by their bullets may have their flesh and blood rot, or their homes turned into ruins. If anyone has a heart, how can they not feel compassion? And thinking of our compatriots in the occupied areas, the men are driven and tied up by [the Japanese], the women are forced and humiliated by the [Japanese] army, looking up at [Japanese] faces, bowing down to secretly weep, seeking to live without success, and unable to risk death!" All of our overseas compatriots, if they have a heart, how can they not feel heartache when they think of this? But as Chairman Chiang also showed: "The [Japanese] aircraft's behavior of indiscriminate bombing everywhere this time is certainly cruel and hateful, but its predicament is knowable." Therefore, our overseas compatriots, at this juncture, cannot just look back at the motherland and feel heartache like burning, but should redouble their alertness, solemnity, and unity, on the one hand, express their lofty respect and sincere support to Chairman Chiang, and express the greatest sympathy and sincere assistance to the compatriots under air raids and the compatriots in the occupied areas, on the other hand, we should support national unity in fact, support protracted resistance, promote spiritual mobilization, hold a national convention oath, mobilize overseas compatriots to return to the country to serve, [illegible] help the front line, expand the unified relief of refugees and the fundraising movement to help the soldiers, especially launch a large-scale international propaganda campaign, and do everything possible to increase the motherland's air defense capabilities.

Bandits are everywhere and thieves are on the rise. In the past two days, within a period of six hours, there were two robbery cases on land and sea. The first case occurred in the waters off Tai Shek Hau in Cheung Chau, where a sampan was looted by three thieves, and the owner's daughter was tragically strangled to death. Unexpectedly, only six hours after this case occurred, a "Pi An" in Ping Shan, a closely guarded area of the New Territories, was also looted by four armed thieves, and a young boy was shot and wounded. The rampant nature of the bandits can be said to be extreme.

### Sea Robbers Loot Ferry in Cheung Chau

The owner of the sampan No. 34040 is a woman named Cheng Dai-di (39 years old), who lives with her beloved daughter Luo Cai-kai (15 years old) on the sampan, specializing in the business of "ferrying" passengers across the sea. On the evening of the 16th of this month, they anchored in the waters off Tai Shek Hau in Cheung Chau. At nine o'clock that evening, a robber boat suddenly came surging in. Although they knew that the arrival was not well-intentioned, they raised their sails to escape. However, it was deep at night and there was no moonlight. Knowing that escape would be difficult, they glimpsed from a distance of several dozen feet that the robber boat carried three burly men, all wielding guns and looking fierce. After the thieves jumped over to the boat, they immediately threatened the Cheng mother and daughter with guns, tied them up with hemp ropes, and gagged their mouths with cloth. Then they calmly and arbitrarily searched and looted.

### Gaggered Tanka Girl Tragically Suffocated to Death

Luo Cai-kai, because her mouth was gagged by the thieves for a long time, was tragically suffocated to death. The three thieves searched and looted for about half an hour, and then fled with the stolen goods. After Cheng saw that the thieves were gone, she bravely broke free from the ropes, mourned over the body, and tried her best to steer the sampan back to the main port and reported the case to the police station. In this incident, stolen silver and goods included 15 yuan in cash, including three one-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, two yuan in dime coins, five yuan in five-cent coins, and five yuan in Hong Kong cents; a pair of knotted silk gold bracelets, worth 67 yuan; a pair of four-stranded gold vine bracelets, worth 35 yuan; a pair of three-stranded gold-set bracelets, worth 20 yuan; a set of [illegible] colored women's shirts and pants, worth 5 yuan; a blue satin women's shirt, worth 3 yuan; a black dotted muslin shirt, worth one [illegible], worth 7 yuan; a red crepe gauze undershirt, worth 1.5 yuan; a cotton quilt, worth 2 yuan; a pair of apricot jade earrings, worth 15 yuan; and a black cloth shirt, worth 2 yuan, totaling 171.5 yuan.

At three o'clock yesterday morning, when everyone was fast asleep, Feng Dong-lian was awakened by the sound of the door. Just as she was about to get out of bed and ask who was there, a thief suddenly stood next to Feng's bed. Feng was pushed into the kitchen, tied up with ropes. Before long, three more thieves entered, with one thief watching Feng. Two thieves went into the room to do their work, and one thief was "keeping watch" at the door. Feng's companion, Au Kwai-ho, knew that she was being robbed, so she fled in a panic. However, she was seen by the thief, who chased after her and hit her with the butt of a gun. Au was so frightened at this time that she fell to the ground, injuring her face and hands. Seeing that she was injured, the thief did not pursue further. Au fled to the entrance of Shek Po Village, and her soul finally settled down.

### Young Boy Cries for Help, Shot

Feng's younger brother, Bo-kei, seeing his sister tied up, shouted loudly that she was being robbed. The thief guarding the door, fearing that the sound would spread outside, fired a shot at him, hitting his left foot. The boy fell to the ground in a pool of blood and lost consciousness. The four thieves overturned chests and boxes, and fled after half an hour. Afterwards, Feng Dong-lian and others went to the Ping Shan [illegible] to report the case. The on-duty officer immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to investigate. It was found that the bullets fired by the thieves were .38 caliber, leaving behind two bullets, one used and one unused. One shell was .32 caliber.

### Hong Kong Drama Circles Re-stage Huanghuagang

However, at this critical moment in the nation's [illegible], it is not appropriate to spend lavishly on personal birthdays.

### Our Foreign Transport Channel: Hong Kong-Vietnam Freight Traffic is Unprecedented, More Than 30 Ships are Traveling Between the Two Places, Average of One Ship Carrying Increase Every Day

Since the fall of [Guang]zhou, the cessation of the Yuehan [Rail]way, and then the [Japanese] invasion of Hainan Island and the emergency in Beihai, the Tonggui Highway has been completely destroyed. Most of our country's import and export goods have taken the route of Haiphong in Vietnam. As a result, Hong Kong-Vietnam freight traffic has become increasingly congested. According to what reporters learned from various shipping companies yesterday, the freight traffic between Hong Kong and Haiphong can be said to have reached its peak and can be said to be unprecedented in history.

### Hong Kong-Vietnam Ships Reaching More Than 30 Vessels

It has been found that there are currently more than 30 ships sailing between Hong Kong and Haiphong. In addition to Swire, CNCO, and French Post, there are also Jebsen and other companies. On average, there is almost one ship entering and leaving every day, and most of them are fully loaded. In Hong Kong, those who want to send goods to Haiphong must wait for a considerable period of time, or they must make a reservation in advance. Some merchants have to rent storage space because there is no rail transport. At the same time, the freight rate per picul has also increased from a few cents to more than one yuan. Most of the goods from Hong Kong to Haiphong are foreign goods, most of which are transshipped to the southwest provinces. The goods shipped from Vietnam to Hong Kong are mostly local products, such as tung oil, tin, medicinal herbs, and other [illegible] products.

### Haiphong Warehouses Impassable

According to an air express report received by a shipping company yesterday, due to the congestion of freight traffic, there are indeed no empty warehouses in Haiphong. Many goods are stored in the open air near the customs. The congestion is even more severe than in Hong Kong in the past year. This is because there are not many warehouses in Haiphong, and the storage capacity is far less than that of Hong Kong. Passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Vietnam are also breaking the records of recent years. It has been found that most of the passports issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs [illegible] Certificate Office in Hong Kong in recent months are for those who travel from Vietnam to Yunnan. It can be seen that many of the travelers to Vietnam are using a false route to enter the mainland. According to speculation in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong-Vietnam freight traffic will be booming for a certain period of time, and it is possible that several more ships will be added in the near future.

### Hong Kong Fishermen's Association's Proposal to Promote Fisheries Submitted to the Production Conference for Reference; Minister of Education Chen Lifu Replies to the Fishermen's Association

The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently noted that since the incident in South China, many coastal fishermen have been slaughtered by the enemy and suffered enormous property losses, and tens of thousands have been unemployed and destitute. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, the association submitted a proposal to the National Production Conference, requesting adoption. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from the Ministry of Education approving the inclusion of the proposal in the conference for reference. The details are as follows:

Relief Plan

The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association believes that the convening of the National Production Conference this time at the initiative of the Fisheries Association is of great significance. In the issue of increasing national production, fishery production is quite important. Therefore, it has formulated three relief proposals: (1) Request to include strengthening the organization of fishery production and handling fishery relief; (2) Request to include a fishery item in the Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction Plan and central government expenditures to promote national aquaculture; (3) Request the central government to cherish specialized fishery technical personnel and promote fisheries education for fishermen. The association submitted these proposals to Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Preparatory Committee of the Production Conference, requesting them to be submitted for discussion at the Production Conference.

Ministry of Education's Reply

Yesterday, the association received a reply from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, stating that the three proposals have been submitted to the Production Conference for reference. The original telegram stated: "On behalf of the telegram, the details regarding various fisheries matters have been presented, and it is requested that they be submitted to the Production Conference for discussion. Having learned from the telegram on your behalf, it has been copied and sent to the National Production Conference for reference. Please be informed accordingly." This is the reply from Minister of Education Chen Lifu.

### Birdsong Everywhere

— Bai Ying

"Mahjong" in Hong Kong is considered a "noble" pastime, one of the indoor games. So every household, and even small merchants on the streets, set up tables and play their four-person game. The clatter of mahjong tiles is endless.

In middle and upper-class families, almost nine out of ten play mahjong as part of their daily routine. When friends visit, they naturally gather four people for "entertainment." Even when they are short one player, they rope in friends and relatives to join the game for amusement.

The working class and shop employees, because they are in Hong Kong, naturally see this "entertainment" no differently than the middle and upper classes. However, most of them do not have families in Hong Kong. Opening tables privately is hindered by the interference of bosses and colleagues. Going to a club requires at least five or seven dollars, which they cannot afford to frequent. In such a social environment, "mahjong parlors" where all kinds of people can sit down have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, planned by clever "operators." From then on, the common people no longer worry about having nowhere to "entertain" themselves. According to an investigation by insiders, there are about fifty or sixty of these mahjong parlors in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The "Aviation" in Central's Gage Street and "Chicken Kee" on Hoi Mei Nan Street are well-known mahjong parlors. The former seems to be the earliest established and has the most tables (two shops connected, with thirty to forty tables). The working class in the Central area, during their leisure time, especially on payday, all go to "Aviation" without fail. The latter is a quite large one by the sea, with branches in two locations.

The locations for opening mahjong parlors are mostly in areas where lower and middle-class commoners gather. Gage Street and Hollywood Road near Water Street in Central, Chun Yeung Street and Cross Street in Wanchai, and Western District's Sai Ying Pun and First Street, as well as Nam Street in Tai Kok Tsui, Wu Song Street, Battery Street, Shanghai Street, and the section of Canton Road near Yau Ma Tei, can all be said to be areas where mahjong parlors abound. Day or night, they are always crowded with customers. If we try to take a look inside, we will see several people standing and waiting for a "reserve" seat, and we never see an empty one. The number of people who "entertain" themselves will leave you speechless.

Their business method is "taking a cut." For games with a base of one dollar per point, the owner takes two cents from each player. For every four points after that, the owner takes one cent from each player. For games with a base of two or three dollars per point, it follows the same principle. Players who sit down must play with "face value," meaning that they must put as much money as possible on the table. It is said that at least six copper coins are required to play. After one round, they must "push the seat to the next player," and the people on the waiting list immediately take their seats. This method is used by the owners, first, to prevent "empty guns," and second, to eliminate disputes between players.

Because these mahjong parlors are open to all kinds of people, the quality of the players is mixed. A month ago, because robbery cases occurred frequently in Kowloon, the police authorities, in order to actively prevent and clear out bandits, arrested many suspicious bandits in these mahjong parlors during a certain period. In addition, professional gamblers who live by cheating mix in, and fights and disputes are naturally unavoidable. Therefore, the owners hire one or two strongmen in the parlors to "watch the heads" (monitor), in order to curb and prevent such events from happening. If the cheaters are still not polite and continue to patronize the parlor after being warned by the strongmen, they will naturally be beaten and driven out.

Mahjong parlors like "Aviation" and "Chicken Kee," which are larger in scale, are estimated to have a daily income of six or seventy dollars in net profit after deducting expenses, and smaller ones have ten or twenty dollars.

"Sharing the wealth," it is said that mahjong parlors, like other "opium dens" and "drug dens," cannot be an exception.

### Over Two Hundred Refugees Stranded in the New Territories, Awaiting Help. Unable to Return Home, Now Living Outdoors and Starving

Over a hundred refugees in the northern New Territories, who were ordered to return to their hometowns or were unwilling to leave last Sunday, were allowed to be aided by the Red Cross. According to recent information from our reporter, there are still over two hundred people who cannot return to their hometowns, and the Red Swastika Society cannot accommodate them. They are wandering around various villages in the New Territories and are still awaiting help. These refugees have sent representatives to the Tung Wah Hospital to request assistance. It is found that they are still living outdoors and are suffering from hunger, which is very pitiful. In the past two days, a certain wealthy merchant has sent people to deliver a batch of lunch and white porridge for relief. It is hoped that kind and charitable people from all sides will provide assistance.

### Smugglers Greedy and Treacherous! Secretly Transporting Tung Oil to Hong Kong. Two Transport Ships Intercepted by Our Customs Overseas, Containing Three Thousand Cans of Tung Oil Worth Over Thirty Thousand Dollars

Tung oil is one of China's special products and has a wide range of uses. It can be used for manufacturing military supplies. In recent years, countries have been expanding their military equipment and purchasing it in large quantities from China. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the National Government has ordered a nationwide ban on exports, with the government controlling overseas sales and designating sales to the United States in exchange for foreign exchange to purchase military supplies. However, some smugglers, greedy and treacherous, take advantage of the government's ban on exports to smuggle and profit from it. The situation is especially serious in Guangdong. For more than a year, they have been secretly transporting oil to Hong Kong to sell to the enemy or foreign merchants in large quantities. Our authorities have been paying close attention to this. According to our reporter, smuggling has been extremely active in the coastal areas from Chaozhou and Shantou to Hong Kong recently. They use small boats to smuggle tung oil to Hong Kong at night. Yesterday, another large batch was smuggled for export using civilian ships, but after leaving the harbor, they were discovered and intercepted by a customs patrol boat. A total of two ships were seized, containing three thousand cans of tung oil worth over 30,000 yuan in national currency. It is learned that the batch of tung oil was organized by unscrupulous merchants in Shantou on a large scale, using civilian ships to transport it to the waters outside the port of Haimen, and then transferring it to large merchant ships heading to Hong Kong for transport to this port. In addition, bandits there are also secretly transporting tungsten ore, hemp, and other items for export.

### The 12th Army Group's Liang Division Achieves Victory in a Surprise Attack on the Suburbs of Zengcheng, Killing Fifty to Sixty Enemy Soldiers in Close Combat

(Special Dispatch from Wengyuan) The Liang Division of our 20th Army Group launched a surprise attack on Xiafu, Dongtang, Pujun in Zengcheng and the northeast of Zengcheng on the evening of the 14th with one part of the 4th squad of the 3rd company, and attacked Hulong and Zengdong with two squads of the 2nd Transport Unit. The army occupied the above-mentioned areas at 11 p.m. on the 14th, and continued to attack the north side of Highland 102. They immediately broke through two layers of barbed wire, and the enemy soldiers stubbornly resisted in strong fortifications. The soldiers engaged in close combat. The soldiers were concerned about penetrating too deeply. The enemy in Zengcheng fired artillery at the Luojin positions. Hit by several bullets, they suffered more than a dozen casualties. The soldiers were engaged in fierce fighting until 3:00 a.m. on the 15th and soldiers withdrew to the original positions as the sky was about to dawn.

### Enemy Ships Increase Again off the Coast of Southern Guangdong, Secretly Surveying Our Fortress Waterways. Commander Zhang Yan of the Special Garrison Area Orders Garrison Troops to Strictly Prevent and Control

(Express News from Nanlu) The number of enemy ships off the coast of Southern Guangdong has increased slightly. Statistics show that there are now about thirteen or fourteen ships, cruising in the areas of Fangcheng, Qinzhou, Beihai, and the Leizhou Peninsula, or taking the opportunity to survey waterways. At 7:30 a.m. on the 10th of this month, an enemy ship with double smokestacks suddenly sailed to Xuwenzhisan Tanggang and spied and peeped. Our garrison troops knew that the enemy must have a plan, and redoubled their attention. Before long, the enemy ship released a speedboat, carrying fifty to sixty enemy soldiers, and headed straight for the shore. The soldiers feared that they would take the opportunity to land, so they prepared to intercept them. However, the enemy boat did not dare to enter the perimeter of our warning line, and only carried out waterway surveys nearby. It was not until 9:00 a.m. that they scurried back to the ship. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 13th, an enemy cruiser also scoured the sea near Anpu Port, which belongs to Lianjiang County, and sent two enemy boats, carrying seventy to eighty enemy soldiers, to survey the waterways along the coast. Zhang Yan, deputy commander of the Special Garrison Area, because the number of enemy ships in Nanlu has increased again, and they frequently conduct secret surveys of our coastal waterways, has ordered his subordinates to strictly prevent and control.

### Shantou Teams Practice Street Fighting, Enemy Aircraft Strafe Civilians in Chaozhou

[Shantou Newsletter] On the fifteenth, there was dense fog overseas. In the afternoon, the weather changed suddenly, and waves filled the sky. It is not known whether the enemy aircraft carrier anchored in Nanao was transferred to another location. No air raid alert was heard here all day long. Only two enemy transport aircraft routinely traveled back and forth between Xiamen and Guangdong via Chaozhou. As for the Mazu Estuary in the north and south ports, there are currently one patrol ship, two destroyers, and three armed fishing boats anchored there. On the 14th, three enemy aircraft attacked Chaoyang. Twice, they flew low and strafed passengers at the Longdu Qianxi Wharf, killing four men and one woman, and injuring more than 20 people. They also dropped white incendiary powder, burning down two Xin Ning Flying electric boats, fortunately without injuring anyone. Two ferries in Fengchuan Shangdian were also strafed on the way, killing and injuring more than a dozen people. The Shantou People's Police Headquarters, in view of the increasing tension in Chaozhou and Shantou, in order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of various teams and increase self-defense capabilities, convened various teams at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th to practice street fighting. When the hypothetical enemy approached the streets, the teams bravely counterattacked. After a period of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled. The results of the exercise were very good.

### Recent Events in Shaoguan

(Shaoguan Newsletter) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun believes that wartime political measures are extremely important, and that for all aspects of people's livelihood, finance, construction, education, and general administration, first, we must seek to eliminate abuses, and second, we must seek to promote benefits, so as to adapt to military needs. Recently, groups from all walks of life have moved to Shaoguan one after another, and the atmosphere of national salvation has suddenly become vigorous. The specific circumstances are as follows:

Various Groups Move to Shaoguan Since Shaoguan formed a new Guangdong capital, groups from all walks of life have moved to Shaoguan to handle affairs. Currently, the Guangdong Provincial General Labor Union has moved to Shaoguan to set up. In addition, the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Provincial Journalists Association are also preparing to move north. The Provincial Party Headquarters has formulated a plan for the issue of various groups moving to Shaoguan, and has notified groups scattered in various places to move to Shaoguan before the end of June, otherwise their activities will not be effective.

Reorganization of the Mobilization Committee The Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee was originally chaired by Yu Hanmou and vice-chaired by Li Hanhun. Later, Yu resigned after having repeatedly asked to be released from the burden of administrative responsibility, as he was too busy with military affairs. The Central Government then sent Li Hanhun to take over as chairman. The committee is currently completing the handover, and the reorganization will be completed during the day. The director of the committee, Lu Zongqi, is internally designated to take on responsibilities. After Director Li took office, he immediately implemented the National Spiritual Mobilization Covenant promulgated by the Central Government, and instructed all agencies and groups to hold monthly meetings to eliminate all bad habits of the people and take on the important mission of resisting Japan and building the country.

Guerrilla Class Graduates The xth War Zone has specially recruited aspiring young people to establish a guerrilla training class to train guerrilla cadres and talents, implement various guerrilla tactics training, and has now completed training. In mid-month, they will be assigned to serve in various war zones and occupied areas, focusing on organizing the masses, training the masses, and participating in the anti-Japanese war.

### Guizhou Grain Administration Regulates People's Food

The Guizhou Provincial authorities specially ordered the Guangxi Grain Administration to find ways to regulate food, to make up for shortages with surpluses. Currently, the Bureau has been ordered to requisition civilian ships to Liuzhou to collect rice and distribute it to food-deficient areas to stabilize people's food. Both east and west regions have each sent a group to investigate and guide, emphasizing both sides.

### Enemy Ships Bomb Xiaolan from Yinggezui River Surface; Seven Shells Fired, Three Hit Xiaolan City; Six Houses Destroyed, Three Killed, Five Injured; Enemy Ships Loitered After Shelling, We are Closely Monitoring

(Zhongshan Express) Enemy efforts to advance across the river are repeatedly thwarted, accomplishing nothing despite great effort. Attempting to contain our forces, they constantly send enemy ships and motorboats to harass our coasts and incite Chinese traitors to infiltrate the mainland of Zhongshan to spread rumors, in order to cover up their defeats in the Xinhui area. Their limited skills are evident. Recently, seeing that the defenses of various districts in Zhongshan are solid, they are trying to disrupt local security. Yesterday, around 9 a.m. on the 16th, three enemy shallow-draft vessels suddenly sailed from Rongqi to the Yinggezui River surface at the border of Zhongshan and Shunde, wandering back and forth with suspicious movements. Our defending teams, fearing that the enemy intended to land, immediately took strict precautions and telegraphed the headquarters of the First District Guerrilla Detachment. At almost 10 a.m., the enemy ships fired shells at Xiaolan from afar, firing seven consecutive rounds, the sound of which reverberated far and wide. Three shells immediately hit Xiaolan City. The citizens, having just heard the sound of artillery fire, immediately saw houses collapsing and people being injured, not knowing where the shells came from, and fled in panic, causing disorder. After investigation, one shell landed inside Liu Kuanda's building on Huaguang Temple Street, piercing the roof and walls, with the diameter of the hole exceeding five feet. One shell landed in a large house in Tongde Lane, collapsing three houses on either side, killing one old man and injuring three passersby with shrapnel. One shell landed in the Yangzhong Street Taibai Building of Tiyun Yixue, killing two and injuring three. The remaining four shells landed in the wilderness. Yuan, the commander of the Special Action Column, immediately led his troops to maintain order and ordered the stationed rescue teams to mobilize. It was not until 4 p.m. that order was restored in the city. However, the villagers automatically evacuated to other places. According to intelligence, the enemy ships are still loitering in Yinggezui. Our coastal teams have doubled their efforts and are strictly guarding the area.

### Guangdong Relief Association Organizes Relief Corps, Emphasizing the Rescue of Child Refugees

(Qujiang Communication) The Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, considering that the relief cause urgently requires a large number of talents, has specially accepted more than 100 graduates from the former Fourth Route Army Headquarters Rescue Cadre Training Class, more than 100 members from the Xijiang Provisional Political Brigade, more than 10 members from the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, and more than 20 members from the Hong Kong Student Relief Association Returning to the Country Service Corps, and organized them into a relief corps, with Chen Ruye concurrently serving as the corps commander, directly under the command and dispatch of the association. Since the outbreak of the war, war zone refugees have been displaced and urgently need relief. Child refugees are especially in need of rescue. The association has already started relief efforts separately. Currently, the New Life Movement Women's Work Team has also organized a child refugee rescue team, which set off to rescue people in Taishan, Xinhui, and the Dongjiang area at the beginning of this month. At the same time, the Provincial Party Department's wartime work team has also organized a rescue team to set off for work in the war zone.

### Students Who Left Training Camp are Allowed to Return to School

(Qujiang Communication) The Department of Education, considering that some students in centralized training have escaped and left the team, should have been expelled from school in accordance with Article 1 of the Measures for Punishing Students Who Evade Training and Escape. However, after investigation, a considerable number of students have been punished with expulsion, and many of them have been lost in the chaos and have not been able to return to the team. If they were to lose their schooling as a result, it would be regrettable. Therefore, it was discussed with the General Headquarters of the Centralized Training of Students in this province, and a letter was replied approving leniency. Students who have left the training camp are allowed to return to their original schools, but considering that these students have been in training for quite a long time, which is different from the situation of students evacuated in other groups, the original schools should require them to repeat a grade and record a demerit once, and they will be summoned for supplementary training in the next session. A special order has been issued to the county and city governments to instruct the schools to comply with the order.

### Central Film Studio Completes New Film "The Siege of the Lone City"; Premieres Simultaneously in Three Theaters in Chongqing

(Chongqing Communication) Since the Central Film Studio moved to Chongqing, due to the limitations of material conditions, several films that were originally planned to be made could not be started. However, in terms of newsreels, "The Shanghai Front," "The Eastern Battlefield," "The Active Western Front," and "The Ninth Month of the War of Resistance" have been completed one after another. Problems such as electricity, scenery, and indoor venues, which were previously considered difficult, were not solved until the summer of last year, and formal film shooting work began at that time.

The first planned production of the Central Film Studio was the anti-Japanese war newsreel "The Siege of the Lone City." Since the film began production last year, it has been suspended due to material problems. It was not until recently that the entire production was completed. The film tells the heroic story of General Yao Ziqing's defense of Baoshan City. The actors, such as Bai Sen, Bai Yun, and Bao Shi, have all received university education. Although they are not old and experienced big stars, their acting experience on the screen may not be very proficient, but their familiarity and efforts have made the film exceptionally colorful.

Another film, "Prelude to Victory," was completed at the same time as "The Siege of the Lone City." This film is a real record of anti-Japanese war news, so it is included in the fifth volume of "Anti-Japanese War News Records." In this film, there are real scenes of the "Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement" conference, Generalissimo Chiang's exhortations to women, Ms. Soong Mei-ling's speech for women's contributions, as well as the heroic posture of our Northwest cavalry attacking and the real record of the Japanese fleeing in disarray. The whole film is full of shots that make people feel exceptionally excited.

Now, these two completed anti-Japanese war films have begun premiering simultaneously in the "Xinchuan," "Cathay," and "Only" three theaters in Chongqing since May 5.

### How Little Babies Act; Half a Minute is More Than Enough

The telecommunications meeting on the 25th of last month recorded that the new labor law in California, USA, restricts the work of young children in filming to no more than half a minute (30 seconds) per day. Readers may ask, "How can you act in half a minute?" Yes, please see the following facts:

The first to film in accordance with the new labor law was a baby who was only sixteen days old. He performed in the telephone film "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" (starring Loretta Young and Don Ameche). In the plot, there is a section where Loretta Young should be holding a newborn baby. Before the filming started, a doll was used to rehearse. When the rehearsal was pure, the filming started. When everything was ready, the nanny brought the baby, and his mother and a representative of the state health department followed. In a dressing room with white satin walls, the doctor dropped a small drop of disinfectant oil in the baby's eyes to avoid the strong light and sterilization of the arc lamp. Then filming began. Loretta Young gently held the baby, Don Ameche bent down to look at him, and then turned around. The shot was over. The time spent was only ten seconds. The cautious director, seeing that there were still twenty seconds left, ordered a retake. But when it came to the thirtieth second, the government representative, who had been standing next to him watching the watch, ran over and said, "It's time!" So the baby completed his day's work.

### Lost Lamb; Ge Zaozhi Quits Movies; Rumored to go to the Philippines to Study Music

Ge Zaozhi, a child star now in Hong Kong, is still as lively and lovely as he was in the film "Lost Lamb." However, although he is still a child, he understands everything about adults thoroughly. People who see him often feel that he now has the habits of adults. You may doubt how his innocent posture in Shanghai disappeared so quickly. Was it the environment in Hong Kong that made him like this, or was it his own psychological perversion?

He has been acting very little lately and is still idle all day. It is said that he will go to the Philippines before June at the latest, because he has an uncle who works in customs there, and several brothers also work in the same place. One of his brothers is a senior staff member of a radio company. The purpose of his going there is to study radio.

Ge Zaozhi's family financial situation is not very good, and his current living situation is not ideal. Now no one asks him to act anymore. Originally, child stars have never been valued in Hong Kong, so he must leave the film industry to find a way out in another society.

### Flower Girl (3) Pygmalion Produced by MGM Original by George Bernard Shaw Starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller

Pickering smiled, as if his bet with Higgins had been won. "I say again--if you can make her into a duchess, you are indeed the greatest teacher in the world."

Week after week went by, one side patiently teaching, the other patiently learning. Eliza repeated meaningless vowels over and over again.

"No, Eliza, wrong, read it again." Higgins would sometimes take off his glasses worriedly, waving his finger to correct her pronunciation. "Let's try again, ah--ah! --like the A sound in the word Father."

Eliza studied very attentively, not afraid of difficulties at all, which also moved Higgins very much.

His teaching method was very simple, he only taught her to pretend that she didn't know anything, completely like learning to speak from the beginning. He also taught her how to enter a room, how to exit a room, how to stand, how to sit, how to walk, and finally he always returned to the question of her pronunciation, asking her to follow his speaking tones and repeat them again and again until she spoke clearly.

Months later, Higgins said to General Pickering, "The day of success has arrived, we can take her out to try." He thought for a while and said with a smile, "I have it, go see my mother."

Professor Henry Higgins was a very respected person in society, but his mother still treated him like a child when she saw him. When he walked into her parlor today, his mother said, "I have many guests today, you shouldn't come, you don't understand etiquette."

Mother and son talked, and he briefly said something about Eliza. He finally said, "I asked her to come here today, you don't have to worry, she won't make a fool of herself, just talk about the weather and health and other kinds of polite words."

At this time, guests arrived one after another, and Higgins was a little worried. His heart was also beating faster, because all those who arrived were aristocratic figures. General Pickering also arrived later. After a short while, the maid finally reported that Miss Doolittle had arrived.

Eliza appeared at the door, wearing beautiful clothes, with a smile on her lips. She looked around the room and walked towards Mrs. Higgins, saying in a lovely, clear, and enthusiastic voice, "Mrs. Higgins, may you be well. Professor Higgins said I could come."

"That's right, that's right," his mother said cordially, "You are very welcome to come," as if she and Eliza were very close old friends, introducing her to the other guests one by one. When she walked to Higgins standing by the fireplace, she said to Eliza, "You already know my son--"

### Completion of the Championship Sweep: South China Wins the Asahi Cup Again; Navy, Though Resisting Tenaciously, Ultimately Loses 1-4

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Spring departs, good times don't last; that "restore prosperity" football season is now fading with the ninety days of spring. Times of elegance and romance disperse; the most distressing thing is...

Yesterday afternoon, the championship battle for the Asahi Cup was performed at the Garrison Hill venue. This was the finale of the six major championships, a matter of great importance, not to be taken lightly. Because this coveted prize, whose fate was yet undecided, in the "triangular" pursuit, who would ultimately be victorious, was determined here.

After all, South China was fortunate, forging a "good match," and giving their "rival in love," the foreign sailors, a painful blow, teaching them to return to their ships and sail out of the "river of love."

South China, in this instance, achieved two things at once. Not only did they regain the "throne," but they also completed the South China team's creation of a championship sweep. Such a feat can be described as glorifying the ancestors and benefiting future generations.

However, the Navy was not "powerless to protect the flower," only lacking in the fortune of fate. In the competition, they struggled valiantly, extraordinarily tenacious. They once took the lead with a score of 1-0, even winning a penalty kick against South China and several opportunities to score on open shots. Alas, their feet had no eyes, kicking blindly and missing. The "Johns" in the audience were disheartened by the sight.

The lineups of both sides were slightly different from the last time. On the South China side, they temporarily invited the universally admired Li Huitang to play center forward, thereby strengthening the attacking power of the front line. His name was not originally listed in the "battle order," but Ye Beihua and Chen Dehui both had foot pain, leading to lamentations of a lack of talent in the front line. Thus, the "strategist" Mo Qing became anxious. Only yesterday morning did he obtain Huitang's consent, willing to take the field for a good cause. In fact, Huitang shared the same concern as us regarding whether the South China team could complete the championship sweep. Moreover, he was a contributing member in winning the International Cup and the Li Hua Cup. Although he wanted to stay out of the Asahi Cup contest, he was compelled to take the field as a pivotal figure, due to the injuries of those who could not participate and Mo Qing's earnest invitation, in order to fully complete the final act, lest the effort fall short after nearly succeeding. His loyalty to his mother club is truly rare. If he hadn't been in the lineup yesterday, it would have been quite questionable whether they could have won. This is because the foreign sailors performed very well in this match. Even with Huitang in the lineup, it was not easy to attack and win. If he were absent, it would be difficult to guarantee that they would not be defeated by the foreign sailors. Therefore, yesterday's success was undoubtedly due to Huitang. The saying "with the right person, the championship thrives" is also South China's good fortune.

On the Navy side, they replaced two new players in the front line; the rest were the same as last time. Although there were replacements, their combat power was not weakened but rather enhanced. Their defense was particularly effective. Center back Cooper marked Huitang closely, never leaving his side, making it difficult for Huitang to find opportunities. Therefore, before Handy was penalized for the incident, they were still playing evenly matched against South China, and the situation was very tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately, Handy lacked self-control and struck Yang Shuiyi, violating the "heavenly law," sacrificing himself and, as a result, causing his team to collapse and become irredeemable due to fighting with fewer players. They conceded two more goals, leading to South China's resounding victory. However, while we certainly wanted South China to win, there was no need to feign pity for the Navy with a "hungry fox mourning the mouse" attitude. However, many exciting and tense moments of the battle were ruined by Handy's lack of discretion, which spoiled the whole thing. It was truly a blemish on perfection. Therefore, I believe Handy is the villain of the Navy side and a spoilsport for the spectators.

The South China players were skilled at playing on wet ground. After the light rain, the field was as soft as cotton. South China had the advantage of both favorable weather and terrain. During the match, the red sun was in the sky, and they chose to position themselves with their backs to the sun, so their momentum was irresistible. Victory was expected.

After the silver whistle blew, Morris was the first to sound the battle drum, marching straight forward, hoping to take the Yellow Dragon's lair in one fell swoop. Qingcai attacked from the side, and the Navy's attack was slightly blunted. From then on, there was close-quarters combat. Guangsen swore an oath at the border, directly attacking the Navy's hinterland, but it was unsuccessful.

Soon after, Horton's cross was blocked. South China counterattacked with the ball. Guangsen immediately crossed, and the ball landed in a good spot. "Buddha" used his "Buddha's head" to head the ball, but it was a wasted effort.

After a prolonged battle, the Navy advanced through the middle. Tiansheng was unable to defend, allowing Knox to go straight into the interior, raise his foot, and shoot. The ball went in with a sound, opening the scoring.

After the restart at the center line, South China counterattacked. Huitang received Shuiyi's cross and passed it to "Buddha" for a diagonal shot, but it missed. Huitang was unwilling to lose out and seized the opportunity to rise up. Before long, Huitang passed the ball through the middle to Jingxiang, and as desired, he scored with one shot, tying the game. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the Navy's center forward attacked, and Tiansheng's attack was judged as a foul by the referee, resulting in a penalty kick. At this time, the fans were all terrified. Cooper stepped forward to take the kick, and Rongcai embraced the moon, catching the ball in a perilous situation. The fans applauded thunderously.

After a long melee, Guangsen moved and crossed in time. Sitang received the ball and shot immediately, straight into the net, scoring a second goal. The victory was secured from this point. In the first half, South China took a 2-1 lead.

Before the players had time to catch their breath, they went back on the road. Huitang led the army forward, but they were blocked. After a while, Guangsen sent supplies forward. Huitang shot high and retreated. The Navy advanced from the border, breaking through many defenses. Knox and Dulan passed the ball beautifully, but fortunately, Troban's shot missed.

Before long, Morris went on a solo run. The crisis was urgent. If it weren't for Guowei's surprise attack, a goal would have been unavoidable.

The Navy repeatedly looked for a way to score within the South China formation, hoping to wipe out their shame. Soon after, Knox Dulan fired a shot from the front line, powerful and fast. Fortunately, Rongcai was quick-handed and quick-eyed, catching the ball and averting the dangerous situation.

South China seized the opportunity to attack. During a close-quarters melee, Handy inappropriately struck Shuiyi and was seen by the referee, who ejected him. South China also gained the advantage of a penalty kick. Huitang took the shot and scored, making it 3-1. After about a minute of further play, Buddha also scored, sealing the deal. As a result, South China won 4-1. Thus, this 70-minute Asahi Cup battle came to a close.

After the game, the award was presented by Mrs. Jia Naixi, wife of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army stationed in China. At this time, fans gathered around to watch. When Huitang accepted the big silver cup, the fans responded with enthusiastic applause. The lineups of the two teams during the battle were as follows:

### Xu Brothers in Battle and Harmony with Philippine Players; Four Scenes of Double and Single Matches Today

…Yesterday afternoon, after the rain cleared and the sun shone brightly, the originally scheduled Philippine-Hong Kong tennis exhibition match was able to take place on time. The general fans were overjoyed.

…The Philippine First Cup player, Sanchez, is still well and his demeanor remains the same. Yesterday, he and the rising star of the Philippines, Abong, passed through this place and came to the venue together. Abong is only seventeen years old and no more than five feet tall, the youngest player to ever attend the Cup competition. His skin is dark brown, with the flavor of his Philippine homeland. He is as light as a swallow, lively, agile, and truly promising.

…The Xu brothers first played a doubles match against the Philippine players. Big Xu served first, and he and his younger brother coordinated well, winning the first game. In the second game, Sanchez served, powerfully and with good angles, scoring four "aces" in a row, tying the game at 1-1. After that, Sanchez repeatedly used his serve to score, leaving the two Xus at a loss, taking a 5-3 lead. At this time, Abong, with victory in sight, continuously performed his special skills. His net play was fast and steady, and the balls he hit were mostly near the net, leaving the Xu brothers helpless, and winning the first set 6-3.

…In the second set, the Xu brothers realized that the Philippine players were not very confident with overheads, so they sent out high balls whenever possible, attacking their weakness. They took a 2-0 lead, then a 3-1 lead. They only faltered when Sanchez served, and were caught up to 2-3, then tied at 3-3. At this point, the Xu brothers, fearing further losses, braced themselves and paid full attention, displaying their special skills, and finally reached a 5-3 lead. Abong also showed off his good skills, assisting Sanchez with long shots and short attacks, achieving some gains. However, the two Xus retaliated in kind, so there were eight times when they were about to win but could not. The intensity of the competition was evident. In the end, the two Xus grabbed the deciding point and won back one set 6-4, shaking hands and making peace.

…Based on yesterday's performance, Abong was more outstanding than Sanchez. Although his serving technique was poor, his smashes and volleys had dangerous angles. No wonder he was able to overcome the experienced Philippine general, Jiaweiya.

…Sanchez is best at serving. In the two sets he played against the Xu brothers, he scored a total of ten "aces." However, his biggest weakness is that he often misses overheads. If he encounters the He Jialiu and Li Rurong team, who adopt a resilient strategy, he will definitely be threatened.

…The second battle was between the Philippine players and De Fu and Gao Luwen. De Fu played very strongly and served well, but unfortunately, Gao Luwen was of no help and could not resist the Philippine team's attacks, losing 1-2.

First Scene
Sanchez and Abong 6-3, 4-6, Xu brothers

Second Scene
Sanchez and Abong 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, De and Gao

…Because the De Fu and Gao Luwen team played three sets against the Philippine players, it took a long time, which affected the original schedule. The singles match between Little Xu and Abong was forced to be canceled and will be played today. The schedule for today is as follows:

First Scene Doubles
Philippine players vs He Jialiu and Li Rurong

Second Scene Singles

### The Current Students (II)

— Zou Falu

On the Necessary Innovation of Physical Training

According to the leader's pronouncement that "to create a solid foundation for the war of resistance and national construction, the united solidarity and joint efforts of the youth of the whole country are essential," it is evident that the youth occupy an important position in the present situation. Students are the soul of the youth, and the youth of the whole country must advance under their leadership. If we want to make the youth useful to the country, it is obvious that students need to temper themselves and strive forward. In this perilous environment where survival is uncertain, it is clear that only those who are free of melancholy and infirmity, and not decadent and degenerate, can take on the responsibility of leading the youth. Therefore, the importance of physical training for current students is an immutable principle.

Our country has a long history of establishing physical education schools to train students' physical fitness, but to this day, the level of students' physical strength is still not as desirable as we would like. There are many reasons for this, but echoing others' words, blindly following, and adhering to unchanging, outdated methods are among the main reasons. At a time when there is an urgent need for students to have strong physical fitness to shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country from danger, we cannot hope to achieve our goals unless we thoroughly reform the past errors and inappropriate practices. Based on my observations, I offer some suggestions, hoping that students who care about physical training will pay attention to them.

1.  Innovation of concepts: Concepts are like the path taken on a journey. Correct concepts are like a wide, level road with no obstacles ahead. Wrong concepts are like remote, forked paths, full of thorns, and you will inevitably encounter unexpected difficulties. If students hope to achieve results in physical training, they must first start by eliminating wrong concepts and having correct concepts.

### Discussion on Handling War Loss

— Lu Shanshi

(4) Some may think that listing war losses as deferred assets allows for amortization over several years, which reduces net profit and consequently lowers the income tax burden. However, this is not necessarily true. Income tax calculation requires determining a ratio based on the size of net profit and actual capital to establish the standard for tax rates. Tax rates vary, and net profits differ. The extent of war losses varies greatly across industries, and business performance in the years following the war will also vary. While some businesses may benefit from treating war losses as deferred assets under certain circumstances, others may find it disadvantageous for tax purposes. Therefore, from a tax burden perspective, the benefits of treating war losses as deferred assets for both the government and businesses are mixed and cannot be definitively determined. This is the fourth point for discussion from a tax burden perspective.

(5) For businesses that have suffered war losses, existing public reserves and provisions can be used to offset them in the first year. However, if the shortfall is listed as an asset, it can only be amortized partially during annual settlements. Even if substantial surpluses are generated later, it will be difficult to quickly recover the full amount. Furthermore, it becomes questionable whether public reserves should still be set aside during profitable years, and whether these reserves can still be used to offset war losses. As for the amortization standard for war losses treated as deferred assets, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that it should not exceed one-tenth annually, in reality, if war losses need to be determined gradually over several years, the original amount of deferred assets will inevitably fluctuate, making calculations difficult. This is the fifth point for discussion from an accounting practice perspective.

The above points are just some of the major considerations that come to mind. In practice, problems may become more complex due to the varying financial strengths, asset structures, degrees of loss, and future trends of different industries. Thus, it seems inappropriate to treat war losses as deferred assets, amortizing them gradually over ten years or more, from accounting theory, financial policy, legal perspectives, tax burden, accounting practice, and post-war reconstruction. In the author's opinion, the industrial and commercial losses from this war are indeed significant, but since the losses have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, the focus should be on rapid post-war reconstruction. For the sake of industrial and commercial enterprises, rather than clinging to the remnants of the past and struggling to survive, it is better to endure temporary pain and seek stable progress. For those businesses with excessive losses that may be severely damaged and difficult to recover without leniency, it is believed that a reasonable extraordinary arrangement should be sought, but it should be approached in a stable and effective manner, rather than concealing losses or artificially inflating assets, which would only create future troubles. The following are some humble suggestions for handling war losses, but whether they are feasible is uncertain. It is hoped that accounting and business professionals will provide guidance.

1.  Property located in war zones that has been verified as undamaged but cannot be disposed of or fully controlled for the time being should be listed separately as "War Zone Assets." Property that has been verified as damaged should be treated as war losses.

2.  Accounts receivable that existed before the war and have been proven uncollectible should be listed as war losses. Accounts whose collectibility is uncertain due to the debtor's disappearance should be listed as war losses after two years. Accounts that are temporarily uncollectible for reasons other than the debtor's disappearance should be listed separately after verification as "Pre-War Delayed Collection Accounts."

3.  The valuation of property listed as war losses should be based on the last book value before the war. For fixed assets with depreciation reserves, inventory with price drop reserves, and accounts receivable with bad debt reserves, these reserves should be deducted from the original price, and the remaining balance should be listed as the loss.

4.  Depreciation should continue to be deducted annually for "War Zone Assets," and bad debts should continue to be deducted annually for "Pre-War Delayed Collection Accounts."

5.  Maintenance costs for war zone property should be treated as losses for the respective year. Transportation costs for war zone property should be listed as war losses.

6.  Businesses with war zone property that has not been verified and reorganized should allocate all surplus from the settlement to a war loss reserve, without issuing dividends or interest.

7.  War losses that have been verified and confirmed should be compensated for using existing public reserves and provisions as a priority. The remaining amount should be included in the current year's loss calculation.

8.  The order of priority for using public reserves to offset losses should be: retained earnings and undistributed profits first, followed by discretionary public reserves without designated purposes, then discretionary public reserves with designated purposes but no external contractual obligations, and finally statutory public reserves.

9.  If a loss occurs in the current year due to war losses being listed as expenses, the loss amount should be compensated for as a priority in future years when net profit is generated.

10. If the loss amount exceeds one-third of the total capital, a shareholders' meeting should still be convened within a possible scope to decide on a course of action and remedial measures. If the losses are too large, resulting in insufficient assets to cover debts, and the business can still operate and has prospects for recovery, it may be allowed to obtain the consent and understanding of creditors to temporarily avoid declaring bankruptcy. If the business has already stalled and has no prospects for recovery, it should still declare bankruptcy.

11. The number of shareholders whose addresses are unknown and cannot be notified when convening a shareholders' meeting may be temporarily excluded from the calculation (this is a temporary relief measure for when a shareholders' meeting cannot be convened).

12. Unpaid shares should be called in immediately when losses are incurred. If they cannot be collected within one year, the shareholder's rights should be suspended. At this time, the calculation of the loss amount should be based on the standard of exceeding one-third of the total paid-in capital after the call (including previous collections). If an increase or decrease in capital is required, the unpaid shares may be combined into whole shares based on the proportion of unpaid amounts for calculation (this clause is a temporary relief measure for the loss of shareholder rights). According to the Company Law, if a shareholder fails to pay after two calls for payment, the company may declare the shareholder's loss of rights and auction off the shares. However, in reality, after the war, shareholders are displaced and relocated, and some may be unable to pay on time due to force majeure. Therefore, for practical considerations, it is advocated that only the exercise of shareholder rights should be suspended. However, if an increase or decrease in capital is required at this time, the only way to implement a capital reduction is to combine the shares first).

13. For businesses that have suffered war losses and consequently incurred losses, before the losses are fully offset, if there is a surplus, the government should temporarily exempt them from income tax obligations to "show sympathy for business difficulties" and protect the tax base. However, once the losses are fully offset, they should still be taxed as usual. (According to income tax regulations, losses from the previous year cannot be included in the calculation for the following year. However, this applies to normal times. In wartime, when businesses have suffered losses, their vitality has been severely damaged, and the cause of the losses is not due to poor management. The government should provide special leniency so that they can be expected to recover soon. At the same time, the government has collected excessive profits tax on businesses that have gained extraordinary profits due to the war, so it should also exempt businesses that have incurred losses due to the war to be fair.)

14. For the sake of protecting the capital turnover of the company and the majority of shareholders, even if war losses have not been fully offset, if the losses do not reach one-third of the total capital, they may be allowed to distribute dividends not exceeding 5% per annum in years with surplus. However, interest income tax on dividend income should still be paid as usual. (The Company Law originally had provisions for construction interest for businesses requiring long-term construction, so it seems appropriate to use it here.)

The above measures are all applicable to the current war period and have a passive nature. As for the future, after the war is over, for the sake of the overall recovery and prosperity of industry and commerce, more active relief measures should be sought, such as issuing reconstruction bonds and providing industrial and commercial loans, which are all effective relief methods. However, as they are not within the scope of this article, they will not be discussed for now. (End)

### Fallacies and Facts

— Yu Tian

Before the war, Wang Jingwei delivered a speech on construction plans during a memorial week. In it, he criticized the thinking of Chinese literary writers. "If we examine the literary works that have been popular in the country in recent years, which have had a considerable impact on thinking, we find that most, almost all, of these literary works are filled with negative and destructive ideas about the current social economy, and lack positive and constructive ideas. They seem to be applying the slogan of literary writers, 'Only point out the symptoms but not prescribe the cure,' but this slogan is overused and can be dangerous."

Such a sweeping evaluation of literary works, such casual talk and criticism; overuse can indeed be dangerous.

Looking at our literary writers, everyone has stood on their respective posts to defend the motherland: some are carrying guns on the front lines, becoming heroic soldiers; some are writing explosive texts with their pens, relentlessly fighting against the rumors of traitors and the arguments of pessimists and negativists; some are writing wall newspapers in the countryside, compiling anti-Japanese tunes, and inspiring the fighting spirit of our farmers - a spirit that has been latent in their blood, having existed for generations since their ancestors. These were unforeseen by Wang Jingwei at the time and are unseen by Wang Jingwei today.

Recently: Wang Jingwei's escape abroad and subsequent publication of absurd "electric messages," "举一例," "致华侨某君书," "important statements," etc., are these manifestations of positive and constructive thinking?

Recently: the unanimous telegram from all members of the National Literary Resistance Association condemning Wang, is this also influenced by negative and destructive ideas?

Regarding positive construction, it is so needed in our country, in every aspect! The * people use planes and cannons to destroy the buildings in our cities, and even set fire to the small thatched cottages in remote villages. But, the more irrational the * people are, the more we must fight on, and we must show people reason. Our soldiers and our leaders do not know discouragement. Resistance has become a cause that must be won, just like we must have food every day, otherwise, we will die! Objectively, due to the rise of every citizen, due to the sincere unity of the entire country, and due to the so much and so sincere sympathy on the international side. Indeed, as with all our strong consciousness: we will win, we must win, we want to fight for victory!

Since the war of resistance, and before the war broke out, our literary works have consistently appeared in a fighting posture. Qu Qiubai, Lu Xun, and those writers in the struggle, did they only give us the slogan "only point out the symptoms, but not prescribe the cure"?

Regarding the social economy at that time, if we are to ask our literary writers to play a role of positive and constructive thinking, why didn't Wang Jingwei say this: "Come, accept the neighbor's grace, China's disease is not enough to attend to."

Facts finally proved everything.

Therefore, Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the motherland was not accidental. Consistently, he embraced an erroneous thought: constantly, he carelessly misdirected.

Day. 已比塞 said: "...in life there is no rational basis, will inevitably fall into the abyss of suppression and sink into disappointment."

In "举一个例," Wang Jingwei is a bit pessimistic to the point of being "pathetic."

Our literary writers, even if they do not go to the front lines, then revealing a little of the traitors' ignorance and insidious features - and constantly fighting resolutely against their "theories," is also a force, and it is an objective need.

Those traitors' theories, if embodied, will gain even more people's curses.

### Sneaking into Wuhu City (Continued)

— Wang Ping

Silhouettes of * people occupying the city

But, no matter what, it wouldn't work. Pulling and scolding all the way, they headed towards the grain depot. After a while, the sound of miserable screams mixed with the smell of roasting flesh reached people's ears, noses...hearts...No one dared to listen to this tragic cry for help anymore! This time, more than a hundred wounded soldiers were burned. In Wuhu, the cries of wounded soldiers being burned like this had been heard countless times. This told the common people that if the Japanese were treating their own people like this, what about the Chinese...

Now let's talk about the enemy's actions in Wuhu:

March 28th was the anniversary of the Reorganized National Government. The puppet county government ordered grand celebrations, lantern festivals, and street parades. Lecture meetings were held in the city and suburbs, with the main content of the lectures being three points:

(1) In the political aspect, "oppose Chiang," "oppose the Communists," "oppose England," and "support Wang."

(2) In the economic aspect, "revive industry" and "revitalize the countryside"!

(3) In the aspect of "social order," compile Baojia and improve civil certificates into residence permits.

Now I will record a few passages of the lecture to show a glimpse:

"...Who is the real enemy of China? It is * imperialism, which has demarcated concessions everywhere since the Opium War, and ceded territories...extorting debt from the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and recently borrowing money from the Party government, this is the ironclad proof of economic aggression...You see those blue-eyed, high-nosed, yellow-haired people, that is the real devils, that is our enemy! "Japan is a military" and China is of the same origin, and looks like the Chinese, they are the descendants of Qin Shi Huang...this time is to "return home" to "suppress bandits"...so we should support..."

"...Why is China not peaceful now? It is because Chiang Kai-shek has been communized, listens to the words of the Communist Party, and throws social order into chaos. The 'Imperial Army' is fighting with them to protect the people..."

"...Compiling Baojia is to prevent troublemakers and protect good people to live and work in peace. Therefore, they organize "Anti-Communist Youth League," "Anti-Communist Self-Defense," "Anti-British United Association," plus the existing "Great People's Association"...etc., using Wang Jingwei's remarks and neighborhood declarations as a "theoretical basis" to vigorously carry out the "three oppositions" work.

From April 1st, they began issuing residence permits, with Baojia as the unit. They had to fill out applications and provide two 2.5-inch photos; of course, they had to spend some unjust money. Baojia was restored before that. According to the traitor's "Wuhu Xinbao," 240 Bao and 2,415 Jia have been compiled.

Do you think the common people don't understand these tricks? Humph, after more than a year of experience and lessons, everyone in China knows that "opposing England" is to shift the goal of "resisting Japan" and threaten England not to help us. "Opposing Chiang and opposing the Communists" needless to say, it is a consistent slogan and conspiracy of the Japanese invaders. The so-called groups and associations, as well as the compiling of Baojia, are completely a deception by the * people. It is a new means by the enemy of repeatedly drafting men in Wuhu and other places and suffering defeat. Therefore, the common people's way of dealing with them is "two-sided faction." On the one hand, they perfunctorily treat the * people and delay the enemy's attempt to compile Baojia in various ways; on the other hand, they try to cover up the Chinese "gerber birds" active in Wuhu, and try to convey all kinds of news to the National Army and the guerrilla teams surrounding * Lake, and also try to find out the correct news of our resistance - until now, most of the Wuhu compatriots still do not believe that Wuhan has fallen, because they only see the treacherous "Wuhu Xinbao," which is in a big trend, thinking that the fall of Wuhan is a rumor made by traitors; Not among the common people. The Chinese who serve * people are also mostly like this. As long as our army wins, they will definitely waver. If it comes to the counter-offensive, they may still be "thorough Chinese!" The following event is a concrete proof;

On April 4th, the enemy transferred 210 members of the "Anti-Communist Youth League" to Nanjing for training, but they all ran away on the way, not even one! The * people's "Lianwei Bao" also could not act, because most of them ran away, one set was a large batch, isn't this a big joke for his "appeasement policy"? Who can say, who dares to say; Wuhu is finished? (End)

### Surpassing the Previous Generation

— Ding Di

We take on a job, from the previous generation's hands.

A history of mankind. It should be painted with the blood of struggle, with the martyrdom of martyrs, and the putrid stench of ghosts and goblins, like dragons and snakes fighting each other, twisting and fighting for tens of millions of years, with light and darkness replacing each other. There is no eternal light, nor is there permanent darkness.

Righteous people sacrifice themselves and fight to seize the light from the hands of "evil." The spark of fire was seized by the "evil" one, and the universe became a hell, deep, dark, and cold. No sun, no moon, no stars, no light. The timid ones trembled in the cold, groaning, weeping, complaining, quietly dying in depression. The brave, the steadfast, the insightful. Cannot succumb to fate, they each raised their arms and rose up, willing to entrust their own flesh and blood to the mountain road; thus, building a bridge. To allow their descendants to cross the deep water, cross the dark valley, and climb the mountain peak.

The fire came, and the "evil" world belonged to the brave, the steadfast, the insightful, the ones who fought for the light.

Like hibernating insects, silently hiding, "evil" has not disappeared. When there is an opportunity, it will rise up, from the mud, from under the tree roots. Thus the "evil" that has died but not been destroyed will be reborn. In the history of mankind, we will again see the struggle between snakes and dragons.

The root of "evil" has never been cut off. Therefore "justice" can never be at peace. Light ascends to the sky. Darkness quietly crawls onto the earth; "morality" has only become slightly tired, and the clown wants to strangle it to death; the small boat of "justice" sailing in the sea, the brutal carp often wants to take it to satisfy its hunger.

"Evil" never repents. Often those who condone "evil" will soon be harmed by evil. At this time, those who help evil to do evil, the accomplices of evil, the flatterers, do not want to praise the declining justice. They call it: the cowardly, the incompetent, the ones who are eliminated by natural selection.

When "evil" is rampant, we are easily infected and attacked, so we want to build a fortress of justice to defend ourselves.

For thousands of years, we have been moved by the fortresses left by our ancestors, half of which have been destroyed, and half of which are not strong enough. "Evil" can invade at any time. Although we repelled it for a while, it has not been eradicated. For the sake of long-term peace and stability, we are building a new fortress, greater and more solid.

Erecting tall wooden frames, driving down long ropes, and using heavy stones, forcefully striking down. We strike, strike, and drive piles - we build a foundation. Build a foundation for justice for tens of millions of years ago, and for tens of millions of years to come, deep, thick, broad, and never wavering.

Sweat dripping from the forehead, and hands and feet also calloused, this is indeed a bitter thing. Our previous generation did not do it, our friends did not do it, but the troubled us carry it on iron-like shoulders.

"If it is for self-defense, then driving away 'evil' is enough, why do you need to build a greater, more solid fortress?" Some people ridiculed us for being too busy and not knowing how to be clever. But we don't care about these. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves and strive for permanent justice, protecting ourselves, and even more protecting our friends; planning for ourselves, and even more for our descendants.

Not only laying a deeper and thicker foundation, but we must also engage in close combat with "evil," clearing the sands of defeat, blowing out the embers of cold ash. Give the universe of tens of millions of years a pool of clear water, removing those permanent silences.

Although our previous generation also had a fortress, and also drove away "evil," but now the fortress is about to collapse, and "evil" has not been eradicated. People have passed by, taking away laughter, taking away tears, sunny days and cloudy days, sadness and happiness, leaving the fragrance of Du Ruo, and also leaving the pungent stench of Penghao. The walls of "justice" have been erected, and the snakes of "evil" are stirring again, shaking, shaking. Don't you see, the boars and snakes are always coveting us, wanting to swallow the light in two bites? You say, can we still live in peace?

It is not a time to live in peace, nor is it a time to retreat. Even a single spark can start a prairie fire, and in the land where "evil" is buried, humanity can never be at peace.

Dig up the burials in that place, capture. Destroy the "evil" in your place, build a strong fortress, for others, and for yourself.

Wash clean the universe of tens of millions of years, leaving no trace of the dregs of "evil," cleanse the putrid stench of the dead from the "past" grave, and then tear off the mask of "today" from the remnants of the attack.

When pursuing the fleeing enemy, we are the vanguard; when building a fortress, we are the first to raise the base of the pile driver high.

Sow the seeds of "justice", one day they will bloom, and bless the people of the world. Let us build a fortress of happiness.

In the previous generation, "evil" was not eradicated, and our work must surpass the previous generation, so that it will never be reborn.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"No, there is a piano score."

"Ah, and a dagger!"

He didn't mean to say it, but was coaxed into it. But the more she said it, the redder her cheeks became, like they were painted with rouge; the regret was unforgettable. She playfully slapped him, stopping him from mentioning the words "dagger" again.

The snow kept falling, and everywhere was covered with snow. Snowdrifts piled up on the sides of the streets, forming snow mountains; the snow-covered roads narrowed. It was already hindering the progress of people and vehicles. The pedestrian paths swept clean in the morning were already closed off by snow again. The accumulated snow dragged under their feet was higher than their ankles, almost soaking into their overshoes.

The roar of the storm could be heard from afar, and in the wind, it seemed as if countless steel needles were hidden, piercing every pore of their faces; but they didn't feel it, because their blood was hot; and they harbored a kind of fervent hope. This hope could subdue the cold of the frigid zone.

There were few pedestrians on the street, and more horse-drawn carriages and snow; countless icicles formed on the fur behind the horses' hooves, and when they ran, the sound was like copper bells, coupled with the bells of the church, which to her ears, was still that extraordinarily beautiful music of the past. Only her eyes couldn't bear the reflection of the snow-covered ground; this snow-covered ground seemed to have more scattered golden stars than before.

"Are we almost home?"

She looked at the end of a street, which was constantly flashing with light—reflected by the snow-covered ground and not clearly visible: so she asked him. He looked and told her there was still half the distance to go. She asked again:

"Would you like to take me all the way home?"

"Of course!"

"Then why don't you come in for a while before you leave?"

"Strange, how can I still go to your house? Doesn't that gossipy old woman in your house recognize me?"

"With me here, what are you afraid of?"

"No!"

He still had some concerns about her talkative maid.

However, she met her; and, followed by several detectives. As soon as she saw Zhu Lin, she ignored Yu Wen, and followed. Her words began:

"Miss! I really missed you so much, these three days felt like thirty years! Oh, my hair has all turned white!—"

If Zhu Lin didn't stop her, her words wouldn't have ended. Zhu Lin looked at the ground and the several detectives, and became blank.

Then, the maid told Zhu Lin that the detectives had already found clues to the case and were going to arrest the criminals; and they also wanted her to identify the ringleader who kidnapped Zhu Lin.

Zhu Lin sighed hypocritically and said:

"Now it's too late!" (68)
