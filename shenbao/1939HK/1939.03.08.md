### Celebrating International Women's Day

Thirty years ago today, working women in the United States jointly held demonstrations demanding freedom and equality for women. The following year, 1910, at the Socialist Women's Congress, a proposal by women's movement leader Clara Zetkin was unanimously passed, permanently designating March 8th as International Women's Day. Since then, every year on this day, women in various countries have held grand commemorations, reviewing the past and planning for the future. Therefore, March 8th is indeed a day of great significance for the liberation of women and the progress of human culture worldwide. Since the "May Fourth Movement" twenty years ago, the women's movement in our country has also made significant progress, and every year on this day, major cities hold grand commemorations, the significance of their struggle for women's liberation being no different from that of civilized countries around the world.

In the twenty or thirty years since, the international and Chinese situations have undergone very significant changes, and the international and Chinese women's movements have also made considerable progress. However, generally speaking, the vast majority of women around the world are still groaning and weeping under heavy oppression. Especially since Hitler jumped onto the political stage, the world has been forced into the flames of World War II. Since the establishment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" by Germany, Japan, and Italy, the World War has actually begun. Not only the women of Spain and China, like men, are displaced, sacrificed, and injured in the fires of aggression, but also the women of the fascist aggressor countries, like men, are subjected to inhuman exploitation under the heavy burden of war; women in other democratic and peaceful countries cannot avoid the threat of World War, and the limited rights of political and economic equality gained through the heroic struggles of women in the past have been lost again! Therefore, the main and urgent task of the current international women's movement must be: to unite the oppressed women of the world, to unite with men, to resolutely resist the poisonous flames of fascism, to resolutely resist aggressive forces, and to protect democracy and world peace.

Chinese women, although having shattered the millennia-old patriarchal practices since the May Fourth Movement, and having achieved legal, political, and economic equality, on the one hand, are facing intensified oppression from the remaining feudal forces, and on the other hand, are being attacked by international ××××, especially by ×× invaders, not only preventing women from realizing the equal status they have fought for, but also subjecting them to the intensified oppression of feudal forces, especially the trampling and humiliation by Japanese invaders. At the recent symposium on women's participation in politics held in Chongqing, a representative of women from the Northeast stated: "I am a woman from the Northeast. In our occupied territory, women truly live a hellish life. I am a medical student, and I work as a doctor examining prostitutes in a police station. I examine as many as 600 prostitutes every month. In the opium dens that are everywhere, each den regularly has 30 to 40 female students. A department head often has eight concubines. Our female compatriots simply live a cage bird's life, never seeing the light of day even in adulthood." This is only a small part of a report filled with tears and blood. The deaths and displacement caused by the Japanese invaders' deeper incursions and the relentless bombing by Japanese aircraft are beyond calculation! Therefore, the current urgent task of our Chinese women's movement is to liberate ourselves from the dual oppression of the invaders' iron hooves and the remaining feudal fetters. We must participate in the protracted War of Resistance against Japan to win national liberation. In this great and sacred battle, we must eliminate the remaining feudal forces and expel the Japanese invading demons to truly achieve freedom and equality.

Every awakened Chinese woman has realized that only when the entire nation achieves freedom and liberation, and gains an equal position in the international community, can Chinese women have true freedom and equality. The Chinese national liberation movement can only achieve final victory with the support and direct participation of more than 225 million women. In the twenty months since the full-scale war of resistance began, women from all walks of life have participated heroically. They have not only provided great assistance in various tasks such as propaganda, education, fundraising, and rescue, but also established many achievements on the front lines, even in hand-to-hand combat, just like men! However, as this war of resistance enters a new stage, the cruelty and barbarity of the × military, political, and economic offensives will be even more alarming. Our cause of resisting aggression and building the nation is also leaping into a more serious and greater period, and the mission that the masses of women bear in this period is even more difficult and heavy! How are we going to fulfill this great and arduous task?

The first is naturally to intensify the establishment and expansion of the national women's anti-Japanese united front and to unite and strengthen the struggle of the women of the world against fascism and aggression. In the overall task of organizing, consolidating, and expanding the women's united front, we must do our utmost to demand the realization of the mobilization, organization, and education of the lower-level laboring masses, rural women, professional women, and female workers. It is remembered that the women's movement during the Northern Expedition had a great development, among which the great efforts and sacrifices of the laboring working women and peasant women were the main reasons. Unfortunately, after the success of the Northern Expedition, the masses of women followed the masses of the workers' and peasants' revolution ××××××. Today, the women's movement should naturally not ignore this! In addition, the suffering female compatriots in the broad and detailed war zones and the occupied areas, and the masses of women who have been displaced by the threat of war, should not be forgotten. We must help them, promote them, and educate them so that they can become the main force on the united front, the main force in striving for national liberation and women's self-liberation!

The second is to expand the movement demanding women's participation in politics. Although the government's promulgated regulations on senators have affirmed that women have the right to participate in politics, in reality, the political status of women is still equivalent to nothing. Zhang Yulin of the wartime service of Catholic women recently stated: "There is no country in the world whose women are as brave and hardworking as our Chinese women. But why is the quota of women in the provincial and municipal senates only three percent?" This is definitely not a statement made out of anger. If we want to win the war of resistance, we must concentrate the power of women nationwide on the front line of the war of resistance. Today, on the one hand, we must actively strive for the quota of women in the provincial and municipal senates, and elect female senators with mass prestige and working ability to fight for the happiness of more than 200 million women. On the other hand, we must also carry out extensive propaganda and mobilization work so that women can recognize the importance of their position today and the great significance of women's participation in politics, so as to serve as a backing for female senators, in order to directly serve the war of resistance, nation-building and establish the foundation of democracy.

The third is to promote the movement to improve women's lives. At present, the vast majority of Chinese women have not yet participated in the sacred and great cause of resisting aggression and building the nation. On the one hand, this is due to insufficient propaganda and mobilization efforts, but the basic reasons are: (1) The vast majority of rural women, professional women, housewives, and female workers are still suppressed under inhuman feudal constraints and exploitation. Economic inequality restricts their development; the heavy burden of housework and raising children restricts their actions; and the traditional concept that women do not ask about politics and do not participate in social movements, and the erroneous education, further restricts their thinking of seeking freedom! And all the bad habits, outdated dogmas, and extravagant and indulgent life in society further cause women to lose their awareness and determination to fight for liberation without realizing it! This is already a very serious situation in normal times, and today it is a major obstacle to winning the liberation of the people! Improving women's lives, first of all, is to guarantee the equality of women's economic rights and improve social organizations, which is also an important task in the current women's movement.

The above are important conditions for developing the Chinese women's movement at the current stage and striving for the liberation of the nation and women themselves. However, it is by no means to say that Chinese women must sit and wait for these conditions to be met, but must use practical actions to participate in the cause of resisting aggression and building the nation to promote the fulfillment of these conditions. Today, women urgently need to participate in the practical actions of the cause of resisting aggression and building the nation. There are at least the following: (1) Expanding the movement of women serving wounded soldiers. (2) Intensifying relief work for refugees. (3) Protecting and educating our descendants, cultivating cadres for building a new country and a new society. (4) Consoling and organizing the families of soldiers going to war and fallen soldiers, and expanding fundraising abroad to remit money back home to console and assist soldiers going to war and fallen soldiers' families, while calling on and encouraging men to return home to serve." (5) Intensifying international propaganda work to arouse greater international sympathy and assistance for us. (6) Expand the movement, and obstruct the traitors and national traitors who have committed all kinds of evil deeds to national liberation and women's liberation, defeatists and their advocacy, , , and make desperate struggles. (7) Launching a movement to seek international assistance to strengthen our country's air defense and donate air defense and anti-poisoning supplies. (8) Regularly and conscientiously promoting women's self-education and the training of women's movement cadres, and holding more current affairs seminars, wartime work training classes, wartime social political and cultural research classes, and self-education organizations on mobilizing women to fight for the War of Resistance and nation-building.

The glorious history of the Chinese women's movement for twenty years and the great performance of Chinese women in the twenty months of the anti-× war have clearly indicated the bright and victorious future of the women's liberation movement. Today, Chinese women support and participate in the heroic struggle of "uniting the whole country to persist in resisting aggression." On the one hand, this is for women to seek self-liberation from dual oppression. On the other hand, it is precisely the important force that determines the success or failure of the Chinese national liberation movement. At the same time, the Chinese women's movement is one of the main forces in the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle, so it will also make a considerable contribution to the world women's liberation movement. On this glorious and great International Women's Day, we hope that the government will earnestly encourage the unity and struggle of women across the country, and encourage women across the country to participate heroically in resisting aggression and building the nation. We also hope that the public opinion will unanimously assist the masses of women, establish and develop a women's united front, and realize equality in political and economic status, so as to ensure that women participate in the War of Resistance and nation-building to achieve final victory.

### Overseas Chinese in Annam (3)

— Yuan Yun

The Ardent Enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese in Annam for the War of Resistance

People living overseas, because of the weakness of their country's status, are often bullied and humiliated. Imperceptibly, they directly feel the lovability of their country, and at the same time, their enthusiasm for their motherland is particularly fervent. The overseas Chinese in Annam, seeing the painful loss of their country by the Annamese, feel even more the preciousness of their country. Even if the country is declining, it is better to have one than not. At the same time, the deep sense of homeland among overseas Chinese is a characteristic of the Chinese nation. Their attachment to their hometown and the closeness of their clan are something that other nations have never had. Almost every overseas Chinese with a little wealth in Annam will definitely return to their country once every two or three years to sweep the tombs, visit relatives, and reunite. Even if they suffer extortion from customs officials and harassment at the docks, they still maintain their determination and their heart is still oriented towards their hometown and their motherland. This spirit of perseverance, loving their hometown, and loving their country demonstrates the extraordinary greatness of the Chinese nation.

The War of Resistance gave the overseas Chinese in Annam an energizing injection. The old sleeping lion is turning over! Their wishes and their hopes are completely entrusted to the War of Resistance. Everything they have, whether it is spiritual or material, is also given to the War of Resistance. Whether they are older veterans or young men, everyone unanimously supports the War of Resistance. Because of the War of Resistance, the status of overseas Chinese in Vietnam suddenly improved. Because of the War of Resistance, the Annamese and the French respected the overseas Chinese more. Because of the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese loved their motherland even more. The French said: "The Chinese nation has ambition. You stand on the side of justice and peace. We sympathize with you." The Annamese said: "You are liberated, and we also have hope." The Japanese business in Annam collapsed. Although the pro-Japanese propaganda desperately said: "The French are helping China. If China rises, you will have no hope. If Japan wins the war, it will definitely help you achieve independence." However, the facts of Korea and Taiwan are right in front of us. Who would fall for their lies! The donations of overseas Chinese in Annam for the War of Resistance are constant. Everyone has a monthly donation, donating one-tenth of their income to the country. From big merchants to small clerks, everyone has to donate monthly. There is also "reduced food donation," with two-tenths of each month's meals being saved and donated to the government. Those who had monthly food expenses of ten yuan in the shop would have to donate two yuan, and the shop assistants would actually receive eight yuan per month. In addition, the license tax was also doubled. Those who had to pay a certain amount of license tax to the Annamese government each year also had to donate the same amount to the Chinese government. As for overseas Chinese families, there were also women's monthly donations and children's monthly donations, ranging from a few cents to several yuan. In Haiphong alone, the total number of overseas Chinese, including the elderly, young, men, women, strong, and weak, was less than 7,000. The total monthly donations were around 7,000 yuan. It can almost be said that even the babies in their arms and the elderly leaning on crutches had discharged their heavenly duty, and the donations for each public debt and relief fund were not included.

The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam for the War of Resistance also has one point that is most touching, that is, their unwavering confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance. In Hanoi and Haiphong, prominent figures of the overseas Chinese, such as Mr. Guan Chiheng, Mr. Luo Ziji, and Mr. Huang Lizhou, all unanimously expressed their absolute support for the government's war resistance policy and were extremely confident in the final victory of the War of Resistance. They believed that since the War of Resistance, the gains and losses of each city and each fortress had moved the overseas Chinese. However, the fall of Guangzhou on November and December, and Wang Jingwei's collaboration with the enemy and seeking peace on December 27th were the greatest humiliations since the War of Resistance. When the news of the fall of Guangzhou came, all overseas Chinese denounced it as unfounded rumors and considered it the news of traitors. The Haiphong Overseas Chinese Middle School almost caused a huge misunderstanding because it published this telegram on the bulletin board. Once the news of the fall was confirmed, all overseas Chinese gnashed their teeth with hatred. Some were so angry at the time that they stopped paying their monthly donations. However, after thinking about it calmly, the motherland is still the motherland, and the monthly donations continued to be paid. As for Wang Jingwei's defection and collaboration with the enemy, because he was hiding in Hanoi, the overseas Chinese here all wanted to get him and be content. It is said that Wang is now living in a government sanatorium in the Tam Dao district near Hanoi (the place in Annam is about the same as Moganshan in our country), and the French authorities have specially sent detectives to protect him closely. Wang also knows that he is unacceptable to people and does not dare to see people easily. At the end of the year, the French newspaper reported that he had disguised himself as a beggar and fled, and made a lot of cold sarcasm about him. I think, if Wang did not live in seclusion, it would be difficult to guarantee that he would not become a second Lin ×× under the heavy pressure of public anger!

The improvement of the status of overseas Chinese in Annam in the past two years can be proved by the following matters: The first thing is that the harsh practice of "leaving the port certificate" has been exempted. In the past, overseas Chinese who paid the personal tax (16.5 yuan per year) were only allowed to reside locally. If they had to go to another port for business, they had to obtain a "leaving the port certificate" from the local authorities and pay one yuan to obtain a 15-day departure period. After 15 days, they had to pay one yuan again. This regulation was a harsh treatment and a disgrace to the overseas Chinese. Because the business of merchants is often as urgent as a spark, you often miss the opportunity after you ask for a certificate, pay the fee, and get approval. After Mr. Xu Nianceng, the Consul General in Hanoi, took office, he used diplomatic methods to cancel this harsh practice. Since then, overseas Chinese have been very free to travel to various parts of Annam. This is one thing; the second thing is that the incident of illegal imprisonment of overseas Chinese no longer exists. In the past, when overseas Chinese violated the law, whether they were guilty or not, they were imprisoned first. Now, because of the friendly relationship between China and France, this incident has been explicitly canceled. All overseas Chinese whose crimes are punishable by imprisonment of less than two months must not be arbitrarily detained before a verdict is reached. At the same time, there have been some improvements in the prison. Originally, when overseas Chinese committed crimes, they were imprisoned with the Annamese in the same place. The place was dirty and inhumane. Now, another place has been opened as a detention center for Chinese. This is another thing. There are three French newspapers in Hanoi, all of which sympathize with China, encourage China, read China's greatness, and criticize Japan's failure. When I was in Hanoi, I once bought a tie in an Annamese store. The shop owner pointed to the tie and told me that it was a Japanese product and told me not to buy it, and said that he was not going to sell this old product. Another time, in an Annamese store in Haiphong, the clerk told me that he was also Chinese, worshiped Chairman Chiang, and donated a lot of money to help China win the war. I spent a night in Lang Son and met an old woman burning incense in front of the Guandi Temple. I asked her what she was doing, and she said: "Pray to the Bodhisattva to kill the Qing × Japanese devils and bring peace to the world." These things only move people, but on the other hand, an overseas Chinese said very painfully: "We tighten our belts, give out all our money, and use all our strength, those officials, when they come here, do not ask about the hardships of the overseas Chinese, and do not care about the life and death of the overseas Chinese, they only ask: which is the biggest hotel? Which is the biggest restaurant? Where is the dance hall? Where is the cinema? After spending a few days living a life of extravagance, they run back in a puff of smoke and say that the work of comforting the overseas Chinese is completed. Or they say that they have passed through Vietnam on official business and their mission is completed. We think that the money they spend here, the money they eat, the money they visit; is probably the money drawn from our sweat and blood. We really feel a little unwilling, a little unwilling!" I was also very heartbroken when I heard these words from this overseas Chinese, so I specially brought it up to inform you public officials, if you have it, correct it, if you don't have it, encourage yourselves, so that you can be worthy of the heavy trust of the country and the nation, the instructions of the governing officials, and the hard work of the blood and sweat of your compatriots!

### Xiang River Defense Consolidated, Stalemate near Zhongxiang, Fierce Fighting in Southern Shandong and Southern Hebei

[Special dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 8th, 9:00 PM] The Japanese troops who invaded Zhongxiang in central Hubei continue their fierce offensive northward along the highway, attempting to cross the Xiang River and disturb our Jingmen and Yicheng. Our reinforcements from certain units are counterattacking the Japanese troops. Certain units of our forces continue to fight near Zhongxiang. Fierce fighting is also taking place near Changshoudian, Majiaji, Zhangjiaji, and Daidai Zishan north of Zhongxiang. Many Japanese troops have been killed. The Xiang River defenses are safe.

[Special dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 8th] Along the northeastern coast of Shandong, our troops have been engaged in fierce fighting for several days. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the southern Hebei area. Our lineup has been strengthened in eastern Henan, and the situation is very stable. The Japanese troops in Baotou have increased to more than 2,000, with two artillery teams, more than 20 field guns, 17 tanks and armored vehicles, 80 vehicles, and more than 500 boxes of poison gas. In the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, we are advancing towards a certain location. The Japanese troops are extremely panicked.

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 6th] Former French Foreign Minister Daladier recently published an article in a local evening newspaper criticizing Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, stating that while Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is ostensibly a military measure against China, it is actually a demonstration against Britain, the United States, and France. This is the result of the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is hoped that Britain, the United States, and France will rise up to jointly seek countermeasures. If the countries cannot unite on such an event where obligations and interests are equally clear, then when can we expect them to unite?

[Xingji, 7th] At 5:00 AM, more than 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry troops from Lingshi launched an offensive eastward in three routes. Our certain army intercepted them separately. Fierce fighting broke out at the highlands northwest of Jingsheng and at Zaojiaozhen and other locations. The Japanese troops used intense artillery fire to cover the advance of the infantry. Our army fought bravely and valiantly. The Japanese troops sent reinforcements and also used a large number of poison gas bombs. Many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned, but they all held the determination to fight to the death and not retreat. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops several times. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and did not succeed.

[Xingji, 7th] The Japanese troops in Qi County have increased by more than 1,000. For several days, they have been setting up electric barriers to the west and collecting mules and horses, preparing to attack west. Another unit of hundreds of Japanese troops has been infiltrating Wutai and Dingxiang and was heavily damaged by an attack by our Dongshan troops.

### Planned Action by Japanese Troops, Repeated Disputes in Shanghai

[Shanghai, 7th] Foreign news. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side here has submitted three main points to the French Concession authorities, the content of which is completely the same as what was submitted to the Public Works Department two weeks ago, namely: 1. Demand for the administrative rights of the French Concession, 2. Participation in the police power of the French Concession, 3. Elimination of anti-Japanese activities and organizations.

[Shanghai, 7th] Foreign news. Since the incident last night in which the Japanese side detained a British detective and arrested Chinese people arbitrarily, the foreign parties here are quite indignant, believing that the Japanese side has broken its promise of the agreement recently signed with the Public Works Department.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 7th] After the tense atmosphere between the Public Works Department and the Japanese side here eased slightly, the incident of the Japanese side detaining a British detective of the Public Works Department occurred again last night. The reason was that the Japanese army arrested five Chinese people on Huishan Road, Yangshupu, accusing them of being communists. The Yulin Road Police Station, believing that there was no basis for the accusation, sent British detective Robertsson to negotiate and order their release. The Japanese side refused the request and, in a fit of anger, detained Robertsson at the Japanese military headquarters for questioning for as long as eight hours. It was only after the Public Works Department negotiated that he was released. The official in charge of the Public Works Department immediately held consultations with the Japanese side. At the same time, the Japanese Marine Corps surrounded the Yulin Police Station as if facing a major enemy. As a result, the five Chinese people were still taken away by the Japanese side. What happens next remains to be decided through consultation.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Shanghai news. Last night, several armed Japanese marines went to Yangshupu in the Public Concession and surrounded the police station there for forty minutes. The reason was due to a misunderstanding. According to the police station, the police station would arrest two people, and the Japanese side sent someone to negotiate, saying that "one of the men was an anti-Japanese element and was engaged in propaganda work and should be handed over to the Japanese side." After some negotiations, the police station handed over the two Chinese men, who were taken away by the Japanese side. The armed Japanese marines also withdrew. According to a reporter from the North China Daily News, the matter has been resolved peacefully.

[Shanghai, 7th] According to the Japanese-affiliated Domei News Agency: The puppet Weixin government's "Pacification Department" has begun to take oppressive actions against the Shanghai concessions under secret orders from the Japanese side. Troops from the "Pacification Department" have been stationed around the adjacent concessions, and all entrances and exits have been blocked. On the 6th, the false notice was posted with a false order, ranting: "The concessions are the nest of villains, and the good people are in pain. Now the 'Pacification Army' is sent to the outskirts of Shanghai to wipe out bad elements and protect the lives and property of good people."

[Shanghai, 6th] According to the Japanese-affiliated Domei News Agency, at around 7:00 AM on the 6th, Zhu Ganting, the puppet Nantao Customs Director of the puppet Weixin government, was assassinated at his home on Kangnaot Road, a road built beyond the border in western Shanghai. The assassins were two Chinese men in plain clothes. When they opened fire, Zhu defended himself with a cotton quilt, so he was only injured and did not die immediately. The murderer escaped.

(Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th) An unidentified body was found on Yulin Road, Yangshupu today. The head had been severed and placed next to the body. According to this type of incident, five cases have occurred within this week.

(Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th) Forty policemen from the Japanese Consulate General arrived here today, ready to serve in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou.

### Yunnan-Burma Highway, Construction Workers Rush to Build in Yunnan, Deadline at the End of the Month

[Special dispatch from Kunming, this newspaper, 7th] For the unfinished project of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the provincial government ordered the counties along the route to conscript 28,000 laborers, with a deadline for completion at the end of the month, to be taken over by the Ministry of Communications.

### × People's Wild Words Criticize Tokyo Diplomacy Demand an Attack on Britain and America

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th] Mr. Nakano, the former chairman of the right-wing and egalitarian Eastern Society of Japan, gave a solo, wild speech to the Japanese in this area yesterday, saying, "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hastily and unnecessarily apologized and compensated for the bombing of the American warship 'Panay.' This is inappropriate because in the West, an apology indicates wrongdoing. If Japan was not at fault, it should not apologize. After Japan occupied Guangzhou, I believe it should attack ××. Japan's actions in China should be directed not only at China but also at Britain and America, as they are Japan's true enemies." He also said, "Japan does not need to worry about European matters because events in Europe prevent Britain and France from moving troops to the Far East, which is beneficial to Japan. Germany's expansion of power in Central Europe and Italy's development in the Mediterranean can disrupt the connection between Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the Far East. The Japanese government's flattering diplomatic policy toward Britain and America should be ashamed." He further urged the use of force to prevent British ships from transporting munitions to China.

### × Military Expansion Budget Threatens Britain and America Minister of Finance and Minister of Navy Explain in Detail Hoping for Approval from Parliament

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Tokyo dispatch: Regarding the additional naval budget案, the naval budget is 180 million yen. Minister of Finance Ishiwata explained the use of the funds yesterday. The Minister of Finance stated that this amount includes the 61st installment of Japan's six-year warship construction plan, the first installment of Japan's five-year naval aviation force plan, and the first installment of the naval munitions replenishment plan. (According to the total amount of the six-year warship construction plan, it is more than 1.2 billion yen, the five-year naval aviation force plan is 348 million yen, and the naval munitions replenishment plan is 188 million yen.) Minister of the Navy Yonai said that Japan's fourth naval replenishment plan will be compared to the world's strongest navy, so that if Japan has friction due to the construction of the "New Order in East Asia," the Japanese navy will overcome it. At the same time, if the great powers closely related to Japan increase their military strength, the Japanese navy will also be able to find ways to deal with the new situation.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] The House of Representatives has already passed the next fiscal year's regular budget totaling 3,694,000,000 yen. The budget has also been approved by the House of Peers.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese cabinet has passed the additional army and navy budget案 for 1939-1940, totaling 910,543,000 yen. The cabinet has passed it and immediately submitted it to the House of Representatives. The funds will be used to expand the armaments of the Japanese army and navy.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese army and navy authorities today submitted a new military expansion budget to the Diet, totaling 1,889,133,300 yen, to be completed in five years. However, the navy expansion plan will be completed in six years. The army expansion expenses are 194,991,100 yen, including 132,004,000 yen for replenishing military equipment, 90,600,000 yen for reorganizing the army air force, and 91,187,000 yen for modernizing military equipment.

All these supplementary budgets refer to the expenses of various projects that have already begun to be implemented.

### Second Financial Conference President Kong's Admonition

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] The full text of President Kong's admonition at the Second Local Financial Conference on the 6th is as follows: Today, the Ministry of Finance has invited you all to Chongqing to hold a discussion meeting. It is extremely hard for you to come from afar, but this kind of difficulty cannot be avoided. I met with you all during the previous conference on reorganizing financial institutions. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet and talk again this time. Last year, the Ministry of Finance convened a conference in Hankou to adjust local finance to adapt to the situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan and decided on many important cases. Since its implementation, it has achieved great results. It has been more than eight months. During this period, the first phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan has just ended, and the second phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan is beginning. The overall situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan has undergone important changes, so the local finance sector should be carefully reviewed and make further efforts to cooperate with the military operations. The status of provincial banks and local banks is the key to promoting local finance, and the responsibilities they bear are extremely important. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has invited you all to talk here. On the one hand, we want to understand the current financial situation in various places. On the other hand, we also plan to raise several important issues and conduct more detailed research and discussion with you. You are all the highest responsible persons of local financial institutions. I believe you must have good opinions for reference and selection. It is expected that the results of this discussion will have satisfactory results in the future. However, in view of the importance of local financial affairs at present, I have some opinions on how to carefully consider and handle the planning and promotion, and I would like to offer them to you on this occasion: (1) The issue of responsibility. It is found that the current provincial and local banks, whether they are within or near the war zone, are often encountering difficulties and setbacks in the conduct of their affairs due to environmental factors. However, it is not right to avoid them. All personnel of local financial institutions, regardless of their position, must recognize the importance of their position and responsibilities in the future. They must not perfunctorily deal with the matters they should handle. They must move forward with a spirit of sacrifice, without fear of difficulty or hardship. For example, branches of local banks within the war zone should continue their daily operations as usual and should not evacuate before the army withdraws. In addition, if a branch has not been established in the location of the war zone headquarters, a branch should be added to facilitate war zone finance. This kind of area is not a very safe place, but it is natural to have no reason to avoid it. For example, the central government now stipulates that the four branches of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank within the war zone should be the last to withdraw with the army, and that one of the four banks should establish a branch in the location of the war zone headquarters and provide services as usual. It is hoped that provincial and local banks will also do the same, so that there will be no stagnation in wartime finance. (2) The special task in extraordinary times. Since the outbreak of the war, provincial and local banks have become increasingly important. The tasks they bear are no longer limited to the nature of a bank but have a special mission. In other words, it is to support local production and business and to resist the circulation of counterfeit currency, which contains many important and special issues. How to develop the local economy, how to assist in the development of agriculture, industry and commerce, how to promote agricultural products, how to purchase important materials and raw materials, how to facilitate the issuance of provincial currency, go deep into the guerrilla areas for circulation, and resist the circulation of counterfeit currency, how to investigate and collect information on the economic aggression of the people, and how to use the power of finance to support the comprehensive development of local finance. All these should be listed as the most important matters, and the situation should be carefully considered and implemented in a cautious and sensitive manner. The provincial and local banks of today should have a new spirit and a new look. They must have a broader vision. They should not be like commercial banks, counting every penny and focusing solely on profitability. (3) The issue of promoting the central government's economic policy. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the central government has been advancing on various important economic and financial facilities, but the national promotion still depends on the practical assistance of local financial institutions in order to achieve complete success. If they are disobedient in public but obedient in private, acting perfunctorily and shirking their responsibilities, not only will the new policies be affected, but also the local economic situation will not be improved. In the past, provincial and local banks have made good progress in assisting in the promotion of legal currency policies, purchasing raw gold and silver, and promoting small-denomination currency systems. In the future, they must work harder, such as purchasing materials and agricultural products on behalf of the central government, opening national construction savings, and promoting thrift and other matters. The central government and local governments must work together to achieve twice the result with half the effort. (4) The issue of cooperation between central and local banks and provincial and local banks. The four banks of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank should closely cooperate and help each other with provincial and local banks, such as purchasing materials, developing production, handling loans, rediscounting banknotes, and other matters. There are also many things that provincial and local banks can cooperate with each other. In short, it is necessary to form a national, complete, and sound financial network between the provinces and the central government and between the provinces, to form a unified whole with interconnected circulation, so that the national finance can achieve the effect of complete adjustment. The above four points are briefly put forward. I hope that you will take responsibility, cooperate with each other, and cope with the current difficulties. If you have any opinions on this, I hope you will discuss them as much as possible. After everyone's close research, there will be satisfactory results.

### × Legislator Questions Government

Can Japan's Invasion of China Really Succeed?

[Associated Press, Tokyo Correspondence] The Japanese House of Representatives yesterday had a heated debate about General Chiang Kai-shek's refusal to "kneel" and continue the War of Resistance. One legislator asked how Japan would deal with it. The president of the Seiyukai asked the prime minister to tell the legislators whether he believed that Japan could definitely succeed in the long run. The prime minister replied, "My position cannot explain military actions. As long as the Chiang regime exists, we should deal with it." The president of the Seiyukai suggested, "I think the Chinese people should join in dealing with it." The prime minister replied that other methods are difficult to implement and that force is the only way.

### Chongqing Residents Intensify Evacuation All Newspapers Ordered to Relocate A Large Number of Foreigners Do Not Plan to Leave Chongqing for the Time Being

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 7th] Since the government announced the evacuation plan, the 17 newspapers that moved here from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou will move again. Only the "Sao Dang Bao," "Xinhua Daily," and "Dagong Bao" will remain here to publish. The Central Propaganda Department has allocated 150,000 yuan for the relocation of various newspapers.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 7th] According to the police department's investigation, although the government is carrying out the evacuation of residents, the number of residents here has slightly increased. As of the end of last month, there were approximately 457 foreigners in Chongqing, scattered in the suburbs and not planning to evacuate. Currently, there are seven foreign embassies, one legation, and four consulates in Chongqing.

### Liang Hancao Appointed Director of the Political Department of the Guilin Headquarters

[Special dispatch from Chongqing, 7th] Liang Hancao was appointed as the Director of the Political Department of the Guilin Headquarters and will go to Guilin to take office within days.

### Controlling North China Trade × Attempts Difficult to Realize

[Reuters, Yantai, 7th] It is said that the Japanese side previously ordered the puppet government of North China to control trade with foreign countries and other ports from March 10th, but it has now been partially cancelled due to its inability to implement it. Only a few items such as peanuts, cotton seeds, tobacco leaves, and coal are still planned to be controlled. The foreign exchange rate of the prepared bank is planned to be fourteen pence. Foreign businessmen have not accepted it and are still negotiating.

### Guangzhou × Continues to Search Residents Rumors of Assassination Incidents Occurring

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 7th] Incidents of robbery, plunder and murder continue to occur here. The Japanese side has begun a large-scale house-to-house search in several suspected areas of the city. A large section between the British bridge and Huangsha Station has been blocked off for the Japanese army to carry out the search. The results of the search are still unknown, but many Chinese people have been seen tied up and taken elsewhere. Another reason for this search is said to be the occurrence of several assassination incidents, including a puppet municipal government official, a Japanese sentry, and a puppet police officer.

### Hong Kong Rumors Britain Loans China Huge Sum to Strengthen Our Currency System

[London, 6th] Foreign news: Officials here have confirmed that the British government has decided to lend 3 million to 5 million pounds to China for the purpose of maintaining the Chinese currency system. The significance of this loan is a sign that the British and American Far East policies have become consistent. At the same time, the British are deliberately attacking Japan's attempt to dominate the Pacific. This loan will be divided among British banking groups, with HSBC as the leader.

[Hong Kong News] Regarding the foreign report that the United Kingdom has decided to lend 3 million to 5 million pounds to our country, there are also various rumors in all circles in Hong Kong, expressing their joy. They believe that if it is true, it is within expectations, because the situation of our country's War of Resistance Against Japan has completely changed, and the European issue has also become clearer. This is indeed the best opportunity for the great powers to assist us. However, according to a staff member of HSBC in Hong Kong, he has not heard anything about the bank's participation.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 7th] According to well-informed sources, the Morning Post's report that the British government plans to lend new debt to China is completely inconsistent with the facts.

### From Changde to the South Bank of the Yangtze River

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Geng Ya

The willow branches are slightly turning yellow, and the color of the grass is also changing. The early spring on the shore of Dongting Lake is preparing to put on a bright new look in the style of 1939.

This is a beautiful natural painting that the reporter saw on the way from Changde to Shashi. However, there are few people on the road, and it is even harder to find cars. It is very different from the wartime scene on other roads, which makes people feel lonely.

When the car passed Linli, it suddenly encountered fifty or sixty youths in plain clothes, each holding an "iron spear with a red-wrapped long handle." They were marching in formation, each one energetic and neatly dressed, quite like the heroic soldiers and strong generals in the old opera's martial arts scenes. A friend said, "This is the Red Spear Society that is going to kill the Japanese!" Suddenly, the whole car applauded like thunder to express their welcome. After each trip, they encountered another team, and everyone applauded again. Finally, they encountered five or six teams in a row, and the applause was like firecrackers, constantly ringing. They also raised their spears and cheered, indicating that the hundreds of red spears they were holding tightly were determined to stab in a certain direction with all their strength. From then on, the long journey of loneliness was swept away.

Passing through Lixian County and entering the territory of Hubei, the boundaries of the two provinces are connected by fields, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard from each other. There is only a wooden bridge to mark the boundary between northern Hubei and southern Hunan. A certain guest said with emotion: "How can there be no construction at the key crossing of the two provinces?" He meant that they should build something like provincial defense blockhouses. In fact, how can the new China, forged in the furnace of "War of Resistance and National Reconstruction" in the future, still repeat the old trick and play this set internally! Isn't this worrying needlessly?

The roads in Hubei are rugged and uneven. As soon as the car drives across that big wooden bridge, it starts dancing vigorously all the way to Xiangfan in northern Hubei, thousands of miles away. A certain brother, who was used to acting in a regular manner, was so dizzy that he vomited a belly full of pearls and jade, benefiting the neighbors on the left and right, and adding a lot of rain and dew. Perhaps he wanted to divert the target of the neighbors' accusations, he burst into tears and cursed: "The Director of the Construction Department of Hubei should be dealt with by military law! Transportation is the blood vessel of the War of Resistance Against Japan, how can it be so bad!"

"In the past, the political authorities of various departments in Hubei rarely used local talents. Most of them only held the principle of being officials and collecting money, and rarely worked in a down-to-earth manner to leave some good results for the construction of Hubei." A Hubei-born lady said with the identity of a landlord, "If the puppet government is reorganized and they are replaced, their pockets are already full, and they will return to their hometowns in glory, so the scolding will naturally be unheard of. Therefore, Hubei has been advocating political construction for so many years. Except for a part of the scenery of Wuhan Municipality, the rest, whether on the surface or inside, is behind the neighboring provinces. The road administration is very bad, which is only an easily exposed weakness." Such a view naturally has its reasons. Because the Chinese revolution failed in the past, the administrative system was not unified, Hubei was located in the center of the country, and it was convenient for railways and the Yangtze River waterway, which was easy for the separatist forces to pour into and for the corrupt elements to steal, knowing how to chase the smell of blood and pursue profits, but not knowing how to engage in construction, which was inevitable in the situation.

This Hubei-born lady is from Shishou County near where the car is dancing. Her husband, General Chuan ××, is now a guerrilla commander in northern Hubei. This time, she came all the way from Guilin with a determination: "Travel thousands of miles to find her husband and help him fight!" Because everyone saw a man and a woman riding a horse together on the road, causing a burst of laughter, she tirelessly explained, "Women in the countryside of western Hubei love to dress up. Even if their families are so poor that they cannot afford meals, they must wear new clothes when they go out. In the past, they still bound their feet small, and small feet were not good at walking, so they had to find horses to travel, which also cultivated the habit of women riding horses; however, it is indeed very unsightly to hear that men and women ride a horse together?" Listening to this, the problem of women in western Hubei lies in completely unbinding their feet, not in men and women riding a horse together. As long as the horse can handle it happily and the safety of the riders is not a problem, it is the same as modern men and women in big cities riding a car together, rowing a boat together, riding a motorcycle together... each has its own merits, and it can be appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar!

Gongan is the first county to enter. The car passed the northeast corner of the city and saw several bomb craters from aerial bombs in the fields on the roadside. The farmers were turning them into fertilizer ponds. On a small river ferry, I heard that the county government was also bombed; however, someone said it very well: it doesn't matter if the county government is bombed, as long as the county magistrate moves the office desk to another place, he can still collect taxes, handle conscription, organize the people, and train the soldiers.

After passing a piece of water and grass, a zone where the farmers' association is located high on the embankment, we arrived at the south bank of the Yangtze River, which is vast with smoke and waves and flows eastward. Someone said that the Japanese army attempted to penetrate deep into western Hunan. Since they bumped their heads when invading from Dongting Lake, like a blind man riding a blind horse, they bumped around aimlessly. Perhaps they would go up the river and turn south here. However, based on actual observation, although there are no high mountains and ridges in this area, the water and grass are marshy, and the embankments are crisscrossed, which has become a natural obstacle. If the mechanized troops on which the Japanese army depends for survival were to operate here, they would inevitably be like the so-called "blind man riding a blind horse," suffering the consequences of "standing by a deep pool at midnight." Moreover, according to Mr. Guo ××, who once served in the Jiangyin Fort Command, "There are still several lines of defense along the river east of Shashi, as solid as copper walls and iron walls." It can be seen that it is not an easy task for the Japanese to pass the first pass of the river defense.

During the Shanghai War of Resistance on August 13th two years ago, the Huangpu River suddenly made a huge noise one night, and the whole of Shanghai was immediately filled with thunderous cheers, spreading the news that the Japanese commander's flagship "Izumo" had been bombed—everyone still has some images of this great miracle, right? However, the truth of the matter is that since the authorities have not announced it, even whether the bombing was one or two explosions, and whether the "Izumo" was injured or not, very few people know. Now that Mr. Guo has told me in detail, I am very excited. Fortunately, it is now a thing of the past, so it is okay to jot down some of it:

We are not an invading country and have never paid attention to naval equipment, so a few days after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the entire Huangpu River was almost completely occupied by Japanese warships. However, the warriors who were responsible for the great mission of bombing the Japanese warship "Izumo" were three in total. They carried two torpedoes and rode a small boat. At dusk, they set off from ×× and used the fastest speed to break through the heavy Japanese warship guard line at the risk of death. They finally reached a suitable location about one kilometer away from the target "Izumo" ship. They quickly aimed the two torpedoes at the hull, quickly opened the button, and shot them out like arrows. As a result, one hit the stern of the ship and went straight in; the other deviated slightly, brushed past the hull, and completely destroyed a certain pier. At that time, the huge booming sound would shatter the glasses worn by the Japanese commander who was waiting for good news in a hotel on the Bund!

"Once the Izumo was seriously injured, its stern immediately fell and gradually sank. It was immediately surrounded by escort ships, which lifted it up for repairs. It could barely sail and was quickly moved elsewhere. The Japanese people were terrified.

Those two torpedoes that had made great contributions to the anti-aggression war of the Republic of China were about fifteen feet long and three or two feet in diameter. They were manufactured in × country and cost 10,000 yuan in national currency each. If one hits the hull at the same time, the "Izumo" can be buried in the Huangpu River!

In addition, our three heroic warriors completed their mission. In an instant, they were illuminated by the searchlights of the Japanese warships; they quickly plunged into the river, and the speedboat was shattered into pieces by the rain of Japanese bullets! They were prepared to make a heroic sacrifice, but as a result, two of them survived: one was unharmed and floated to the shore on his own; the other was hit by several bullets, but was fortunately rescued by a foreign warship and sent back. One was missing, presumably martyred at the same time as the speedboat!

The Japanese commander praised their loyalty and bravery and gave them each a bonus of more than 1,000 yuan; he gave special condolences to the families of the missing.

The last sentence: When the Shanghai War had just begun, we were able to establish such great achievements, and in the future, when we turn to the second phase of the war of resistance, there will naturally be other miracles!

Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma Moves in the House of Commons to Submit the Local Funds Act as a Draft Law to Parliament

【Reuters, London, 7th】Last night in the House of Commons, Lieutenant Colonel Muirhead, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma, moved to submit the Local Funds Act for the Shan states (populated by the Ae people scattered throughout Indochina, whose physique and language are similar to the Siamese) as a draft law for discussion in Parliament. Sir Wilson, a Conservative MP, questioned, "Since the construction of the new Burma Road, a large number of Chinese have entered the Shan states. Has the government taken any measures to prevent this? According to the information I have received, more Chinese are entering Burma via this road than at any time in the past." Mr. Muirhead replied, "Sir Wilson has raised a very broad issue. His speech touched on various aspects of the construction of the new Burma Road, but there are not currently very many Chinese entering the Shan states." Sir Wilson also asked, "Are Shan state public funds being used in part to finance the construction of the new Burma Road?" Muirhead replied, "Yes, the Shan states have indeed contributed some funds to the construction of that road, but they did not participate in the financial adjustments handled by our government." He also answered another question from Wilson, "Last December, I traveled along that road and entered China for ten miles. There were indeed many Chinese along the way, but according to unofficial information I have received, there will not be as many Chinese crossing the border this year as last year."

British and Spanish Diplomatic Relations, Chamberlain Speaks in the House of Commons, No Loan Negotiations with Franco

【Reuters, London, 6th】British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke today in the House of Commons on the diplomatic relations between Britain and Spain, stating that after the British government recognized the Franco government, it cancelled its recognition of the Spanish Republican government. Therefore, there can be no diplomatic representatives between the British government and the Spanish Republican government not under Franco's jurisdiction. However, British consular authorities will take appropriate steps for humanitarian reasons and to protect British interests.

【Reuters, London, 6th】British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today, in response to a question, that Britain is not currently conducting loan negotiations with Franco. Furthermore, Under-Secretary of State Butler, in response to a question regarding Ashton-Gwatkin's recent trip to Germany, stated that this trip was purely to re-establish contact with German officials and exchange views on general economic conditions.

Spanish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Arrive in Southern France

【Reuters, Toulouse, 6th】Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez arrived here today by civil aviation aircraft (Toulouse, in southwestern France, is an industrial center in southern France, located on the upper reaches of the Garonne River). They were accompanied by secretaries. Later, another aircraft arrived, carrying the remaining important cabinet members.

【Reuters, Burgos, 6th】The significance of the surprising developments on the Spanish government side is difficult to determine here. The newly formed National Defense Council has indicated that the Communist Party has been excluded, and its leaders have stated that they will fight to the end unless the rebels offer surrender terms. However, Casado and Miaja are both military figures who know that if the rebels launch another attack, their resistance will collapse. Therefore, it is believed here that the National Defense Council is an organization preparing for a final surrender. It is generally believed that it is still unknown whether the situation will descend into anarchy or an orderly surrender, but the latter seems more likely.

【Reuters, Paris, 6th】Spanish Senate President Barria, currently in France, stated today that the Spanish government and General Franco will negotiate a settlement. "General Miaja will be able to restore peace to Spain with General Franco," and he mentioned the newly formed international conference, stating, "We completely agree with the desire to end the war." He also stated that the Standing Committee of Parliament met three days ago and informed Negrín that the committee was prepared to cooperate with him, provided that he ended the civil war with the least loss and sacrifice. "Our attitude is very clear. Negrín understands this, which may have triggered this coup to promote peace."

【Reuters, Paris, 7th】Today, various newspapers here believe that the New Madrid National Defense Council's declaration of peace may bring the Spanish war to an early end. The newspapers suggest peace based on independence and freedom, which is in line with General Franco's wishes.

Spanish Government Warships Head to French North Africa

【Haitong Press, London, 7th】It is reported that eleven warships of the Republican government were discovered yesterday off the coast of Algiers in North Africa. It is generally believed that the fleet is heading to Arzew to surrender to the French authorities.

【Haitong Press, Paris, 7th】The Spanish Republican government fleet fled due to a sudden revolution near Cartagena and was discovered off the coast of Algiers in North Africa, apparently heading to Arzew. It is said that the local authorities have ordered the fleet not to dock in Arzew but to sail to Bizerte. The fleet consists of three cruisers and ten torpedo boats.

【Haitong Press, Tunis, 7th】Yesterday afternoon, Tunisian authorities, together with French army and navy officers, held a meeting to discuss the matter of the Spanish Republican government fleet entering the port of Bizerte this morning and decided to detain them. It is reported that the Governor of Tunisia, Labonne, has therefore postponed his tour of southern Tunisia, and additional police stations have been deployed in the port of Bizerte to prevent conflicts between Spanish refugees and local residents.

A Brief Commentary on the Power of the Jinan Guerrilla Unit

Today's newspaper reports that our country's military authorities estimate that the total number of guerrillas active in the rear of the * army has reached 2.5 million, with 300,000 to 400,000 in Hebei Province alone, constantly attacking the * army's transportation. In the past few months, an average of approximately 20,000 * soldiers have been killed each month.

The authorities have clearly defined that "in the second phase of the war of resistance, guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare." Now that the guerrilla units are powerful, it is naturally exciting news. However, we should also be aware that these guerrillas active in the rear of the * army are facing many difficulties that ordinary people cannot imagine. First, the * army is intensifying its encirclement step by step and using all kinds of malicious means to undermine the prestige of the guerrillas. Second, the guerrillas themselves lack weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies, and there are many shortcomings in mutual communication. Therefore, we cannot simply stand by and watch the guerrillas, who are of great significance in determining the current war situation. We must do our best to alleviate their difficulties and assist in their development!

For example, organizing a powerful advancing corps to penetrate deep into the * rear, extensively promoting political work in the * rear, arousing and organizing the people, crushing the puppet regime of traitors, and establishing local anti-* governments are important steps to break the * army's strategy. Expanding and substantiating the War Zone Party and Government Committee, unifying the command of the war of resistance in the * rear, allocating a large amount of funds for the development of guerrilla units and the political work in the * rear, and expanding the overseas recruitment of medical and anti-poison supplies are the main tasks to solve the difficulties of the guerrilla units themselves.

In order to win the victory in the second phase of the war of resistance, we must do our best to achieve the above requirements as soon as possible.

Important Meeting of the Banking Community

In order to understand the financial situation in various places, and to counteract the financial destruction and economic looting implemented by the * puppet regime in the war zone, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of the chairmen and general managers of local banks in Chongqing starting the day before yesterday (the 6th). Seventeen local banks from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces participated, with more than 40 representatives in total. As the War of Resistance enters its second phase, the overall situation has changed significantly. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee made important decisions on economy, finance, and finance, and the National Political Council also made extremely important resolutions in its third conference. We hope that this meeting can formulate concrete measures in accordance with the above decisions and resolutions based on the actual situation in various places, and use the power of finance, finance, and economy to serve the war of resistance and national construction, and strive for the realization of the final victory. The most important issues at present include: how to maintain and strengthen local financial organizations? How to maintain the credit of the currency system? How to consolidate and develop the national economy? How to implement the balance of wartime prices? How to increase the production of special products and food and improve their procurement and transportation? In particular, how to assist workers and farmers and refugees to engage in production and construction, and so on, should first determine specific and easy-to-implement measures.

U.S. Defense Amendment, Senate Passes Resolution, Army Aircraft Can Be Increased to 6,000, Rear Admiral Leahy Advocates Fortifying Guam

【Central News Agency, Washington, 7th】The US Senate today voted to pass an amendment to the US defense bill. The bill decides that the Army's Air Force can be increased to 6,000 aircraft, 500 more than the number decided by the House of Representatives.

【Central News Agency, Washington, 7th】The Senate has passed the budget increase for the Air Force. The bill passed by the House of Representatives previously restricted the US Air Force to no more than 5,500 aircraft. Now the Senate has increased the number of aircraft to 6,000.

【Central News Agency, Washington, 7th】Rear Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, spoke again yesterday before the Senate Naval Affairs Committee to persuade Congress to pass the Guam port construction plan. Rear Admiral Leahy said that Guam has a very important strategic position, and anyone who wants to attack Hawaii or the American continent will be hindered by Guam. The island can be a base for the American sea and air forces, and American commerce in the East Indies and elsewhere can be protected. It is inappropriate for some people to hold their erroneous views and oppose building a port on Guam. According to the current plan, the island will have breakwaters built to facilitate the location of seaplanes. The Guam port construction plan is part of a US$65 million bill to build new sea and air force bases, which has been passed by the House of Representatives but removed part of Guam.

Philippines to Build Rayon Factory with Capital of Two Million to Eliminate Foreign Rayon Imports

【Associated Press, Manila, 7th】The government-run National Enterprise Corporation announced today that it is studying a plan to establish a rayon factory with a capital of 2 million, producing 3.5 tons of rayon per day, working 300 days a year. Its annual output is equal to one-third of the total rayon imported into the Philippines. 70% of the rayon imported into the Philippines comes from Japan. Chairman Roxas of the Economic Committee said that if the National Enterprise Corporation approves this plan and decides to implement it, it will purchase machinery from the United States as soon as possible. The plan will use Manila hemp (banana plants produced in the Philippine Islands), bamboo, grass, cork, etc. as raw materials. Roxas also said that if this plan is implemented, it will encourage private capital to invest in the rayon industry, so as to completely eliminate the import of foreign rayon.

Hitler's Invasion of Ukraine (Part 2) Translated by Dong Ping

——Exposure of Germany's Eastern Expansion Policy——

Original by Ludwig Lore. Translated from "Modern Historical Materials," February Issue

In the first few years after Hitler came to power, Berlin exhausted all means to incite Warsaw, saying that Poland should help the Ukrainian Kuomintang to seize power, so that it could share the spoils with Germany. In reality, this was urging Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to follow Berlin's diplomatic line and jointly oppose communism with Germany.

However, after the Munich Conference, the Ukrainian question changed. Now, most Ukrainians who care a little about politics are clamoring for independence and freedom, and they are openly opposed to Poland. As for Germany, Ukrainians believe that they are only using it. Not long ago, a senior Ukrainian Kuomintang member said: "It is very easy to get rid of German rule. At that time, the disputes with Warsaw will also be easily resolved."

The Ukrainian Kuomintang movement in Poland is not too new. In February 1938, the Polish Kuomintang submitted a petition to the Polish government, requesting permission for the Ukrainians in southern Poland to have complete autonomy, and to establish a Ukrainian Parliament and organize a Ukrainian army. They declared that only under such conditions could they belong to Poland without changing their allegiance.

At that time, the Ukrainian Kuomintang was already a government party, but their party leader, Merget, believed that the party's continuous activities over the past three years had not achieved good results between the Polish government and the Ukrainian minority. He said: "I warn the Polish government not to be so irresponsible again, otherwise the Ukrainians in Poland will be forced to ask for the protection of other friendly powers. The European situation is very dangerous, and we Ukrainians have nothing to fear; however, if the Ukrainian question cannot be resolved and Poland is dragged into the war, it will be very unfortunate." Isn't this the same as what Hanlon said to the Czech government not long ago when he challenged them? You will understand the trick here.

The Polish government did not dare to answer this challenge rashly: so it carefully considered it again and again, and after eleven days, on December 21, it formally notified the Ukrainian representatives in the parliament: after careful study, because the request completely violated the Polish constitution, it had to be rejected. In reality, to pass such a reform bill, at least one-quarter of the members of parliament had to support it, and the sixteen Ukrainian representatives also admitted that this was impossible. Therefore, this question was rejected.

However, the autonomy movement itself did not die. On the contrary, Daniel, the son of General Skoropadsky—who now lives in Berlin—soon organized a new group dedicated to promoting Ukrainian independence. He spent a year in the United States—where there are many Ukrainian people—and was very well-funded. He hired six propaganda experts to participate in countless large and small lecture meetings in the United States, drumming up his tongue like reeds. At the same time, he also directed the Ukrainian newspapers in the United States to intensify their anti-Soviet and anti-Polish propaganda.

On December 20, 1938, the Ukrainian Federation of America held its annual meeting at the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York. Representatives claiming to be from the four largest minority groups in Europe attended and gave speeches, saying that only by establishing a free Ukraine could war be avoided in Europe. Therefore, it was decided to use the United States as the center to promote Ukrainian independence to the world. At the same time, a fundraising plan was drafted to broaden the financial resources.

The Ukrainian question, in fact, does not need to be too alarmed. It has already re-solidified the mutual relations between Eastern European countries. It has already united Germany's sacrificial victims and made strong anti-Nazi actions. The renewal of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and general support were early hints from Warsaw to Hitler, saying: We are also prepared here, and if necessary, everyone might as well do it. This hint will obviously make Germany hesitate a little. In early January of this year, Colonel Beck visited Berlin, and undoubtedly, he will also talk to his friend Ribbentrop about his heart.

Today, Poland itself should understand that she is not innocent either. Three months ago, in Czechoslovakia, she cheered for Germany. In the past four years, she indirectly helped Nazi Hitler climb onto the world stage. Her short-sighted diplomatic policy has created Germany's military control in Eastern Europe.

If Hitler's ambition is to be stopped, it is the result of a new alliance—the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania; they were formed after the Czech incident, and perhaps they will expand to the Baltic countries and the Scandinavian countries—if Britain encourages them.

If Germany is really prepared to fight for Ukraine, the first to suffer will undoubtedly be Poland. The large amount of military supplies stored in the East Prussian border area is not meaningless. Danzig and the Polish Corridor are naturally also Nazi targets. In Hitler's eyes, Poland alone is a major obstacle preventing Germany from developing towards the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. If the Polish fleet exists for a day, Germany's naval position will always be fragile. Therefore, not long ago, Berlin persuaded Warsaw to change Lithuania's mind and promised full support; this was because the country wanted Warsaw to completely get out of the corridor. Germany's current propaganda in Memel still indicates that she still wants to obtain the Polish Corridor by peaceful means.

Therefore, Germany's purpose in vigorously inciting Ukrainian autonomy is very obvious. First, if she controls Ukraine, she will step into the door to attack the Soviet Union, making Hitler's last wish—to crush the Soviet Union—one step closer.

At the same time, there are many other reasons. The fertile land and 30 million people of Soviet Ukraine are extremely important from an economic point of view. There are extremely rich products there; if Germany can obtain it, she will not bother to care about a group of Ukrainian lands in Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

To put it plainly, if Germany obtains Ukraine, she will be completely independent, self-sufficient, and will not need any foreign help. She will be the master of her own destiny, and she will be the leader of all of Europe. This is Hitler's last wish.

Germany has reached a turning point in her history. This time, a major invasion plan that she has never encountered before, if she succeeds again, then she will be able to cooperate with her allies and compete with other powers for world hegemony. (End)

Exhibition of Scenic Spots in Occupied Areas Scheduled to Be Held in Hong Kong and Kowloon

Since the July 7th Incident, many of our beautiful mountains and rivers have fallen into the hands of the *. In view of this, the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association specially invited our country's famous photographer, Mr. He Tiehua, to preside over the "Exhibition of Photographs of Occupied Areas" in order to stimulate the national sentiment of overseas Chinese and raise funds to relieve the affected compatriots. It is scheduled to be held from the 11th to the 13th of this month at St. John's Cathedral in Garden Road, and from the 17th to the 19th at South China Middle School in Nathan Road, Kowloon. The exhibition includes areas in North China, Central China, and Guangzhou, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, Tianjin, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Mount Tai, Qufu, the Great Wall, Guangzhou, etc. The essence of our country, whether it is scenery, cultural relics, great construction, or customs, is all-encompassing. All 500 works have been enlarged and framed, and Mr. He personally took the photographs years ago. This exhibition is even more strictly selected. Mr. He's photography skills are excellent, and the rich and beautiful content of the works and the profound significance of holding the exhibition are not comparable to ordinary photography exhibitions.

Air Defense Bureau Actively Studies Ways to Evacuate the Population During Wartime, Outskirts of the New Territories and Lantau Island Are Ideal Safe Zones

The Air Defense Exhibition Opens Today, and the Air Defense Drill Will Be Held in Two Weeks

Since the establishment of the Hong Kong Air Defense Bureau, Hong Kong's air defense has become increasingly consolidated under the guidance of Controller Stilwell. In addition to actively training air defense personnel, in order to instill air defense knowledge to residents, a air defense exhibition will be held tomorrow at the Peninsula Hotel. Mr. Stilwell also personally delivered a speech on air defense issues on the radio station on Sunday evening. It can be seen that the authorities are proceeding extremely actively with Hong Kong's air defense. Mr. Stilwell met with reporters yesterday to discuss the issue of wartime population evacuation. It is said that the population of Hong Kong is too dense, and if something happens and * planes attack, the dangerous situation will be unbearable. The only safe solution is to move residents from densely populated areas away from the city when necessary. Mr. Stilwell also said in his speech on the radio station that it is practically impossible to prevent houses from being directly bombed. Even incendiary bombs alone are enough to pose a great threat to buildings. Therefore, the issue of population dispersal cannot be delayed. According to the reporter, the Air Defense Bureau has established a new subcommittee. Although the content of the group has not been announced, its purpose is nothing more than to study how to evacuate residents from various densely populated areas, such as the Central District, Wan Chai, Western District, Yau Ma Tei, etc., when necessary, and to survey suitable locations in the outskirts of the New Territories as safe evacuation zones. Lantau Island is also a location that the committee has in mind. As for the air defense exhibition held by the Women's Air Defense Group, it is scheduled to open at 2:30 PM this afternoon. The ceremony will be hosted by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, and his wife. There are a total of 14 exhibition items, including air defense and bulletproof tile surface construction methods, air defense trench models, household fire extinguishers, air defense rooms, and anti-poison clothing. There is everything, so that viewers have a deep understanding of air defense knowledge. As for the new alarm system recently shipped to Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, it has been gradually deployed at key points in the city. It will be completed in two weeks, and after testing, the first air defense exercise and light control will be held on a regular basis.

The Glorious History of Machine Workers, Overseas Machine Workers Return to Serve the Country One After Another, the Penang Machine Workers Team Cables That They Will Arrive in Hong Kong in a Few Days

Our country's government has launched a full-scale war of resistance, and there is a need for specialized technical personnel. Therefore, it has sent a letter to overseas Chinese groups asking them to use this opportunity to send talents back to the country to serve. In particular, machine art talents are even more needed. After receiving this notice, overseas Chinese groups immediately collected such talents and sent them back to the country in batches. Several batches have passed through Hong Kong recently. According to news from the Hong Kong Chinese Machine Association yesterday, the association has now received a telegram stating that a team of more than 30 machine art engineers from Penang is returning to the country on the * ship. They are expected to arrive in Hong Kong in a few days and will go to the front to serve. It is reported that the members of the team are mostly skilled in automobile driving technology, and many of them are also rich in other machine engineering technologies. They were strictly selected in Penang before returning to the country. In addition, there are one or two batches that are being organized, and they will depart for the country one after another in the near future. It is also reported that the 81 members of the Malayan Drivers Returning to Serve the Country Corps have already returned to the country for many days. The second batch of 100 members has also been organized and will be able to return to the country in the near future. If due to ship relations, they will take the route through Hanoi, Annam, and transfer to the interior, it is not yet certain.

After the Outbreak of the Hainan War, Cargo Transportation Between Hong Kong and Vietnam Was Hit, Goods Coming and Going Have Been Reduced by Four Tenths Compared to Before

When the situation in South China turned critical, our import and export cargo transportation moved to the two transportation lines of Shen, Myanmar, Guizhou, and Vietnam, and Haiphong and Yangon became important transit stations for our import and export goods. For a time, the cargo trade between Hong Kong and Haiphong suddenly developed amazingly. In order to adapt to the needs, shipping companies such as Taikoo and Jardine also sent additional ships to sail on the Hong Kong-Vietnam line. All kinds of goods were transported from Hong Kong to Haiphong and then transferred back to the interior, and the numbers were extremely large. However, since the outbreak of the * army's invasion of Hainan, the sea route of ships going from Hong Kong to Haiphong passing through the Qiongya Strait has been controlled by the * army's forces. As a result, Chinese and Western merchants in Hong Kong were afraid of accidental losses and did not dare to ship various goods as before. According to shipping agents yesterday, since the outbreak of the Hainan War, cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Vietnam has been severely affected. Up to now, statistics show that the goods transported from Hong Kong to Haiphong and the goods transported from Haiphong to Hong Kong have both been reduced by about four tenths. This can be seen from this.

Blood Splattered on Tai Tao Road West, Six-Year-Old Child Tragically Died Under the Wheels, the Driver Was Afraid of Trouble and Hastily Drove Away, the Transportation Authorities Ordered Strict Investigation and Prosecution

At approximately 7:00 PM last night, a tragic accident occurred on Tai Tao Road West, across from the Wuchang Restaurant, where a child was run over and killed. After the incident, the driver ignored everything and sped away. Later, a passerby called the hospital, and a car was sent to the scene to transport the child's body away. The transportation authorities have strictly pursued the perpetrator.

The Vehicle Involved in the Accident Hastily Fled

The location of the accident was on Tai Tao Road West, across from the Wuchang Restaurant. At 7:15 PM last night, a child of approximately six years of age was about to cross the road when a certain car came head-on. Both sides were unable to avoid each other, and the child was knocked down. The wheels ran over the child's head, and his brains splattered on the spot. He died immediately. The driver of the car, after causing the accident, ignored everything and sped away. Two minutes later, a passerby discovered it. At the same time, the patrol officer nearby also went to the scene to investigate, but the perpetrator had escaped, and the case was nowhere to be found. Passersby saw the child die tragically under the car and called the police station, and also called the hospital to send a car to transport the body to the Marie Mortuary.

The Authorities Strictly Investigate the Vehicle Involved in the Accident

When reporters arrived at the scene of the incident, they witnessed the child lying in a pool of blood, his head splattered with brains, and his death was very tragic. According to vendors near the area, when the deceased was about to cross the road, a vehicle similar to a "Chicken Car" crashed into the child. When the deceased was hit, the car accelerated and fled. However, according to another passerby, the perpetrator was actually a certain bus. After the accident, the bus inspectors on duty and the detectives from the Central and Western Districts went to the scene to investigate. As a result, because the car had already gone far away, they still had not found out whether the vehicle involved in the accident was a "taxi" or a "bus". The transportation authorities paid great attention to this matter and conducted a thorough investigation in order to arrest the driver involved in the accident and bring charges.

Anti-Aircraft Guns Were Practiced Yesterday Morning

In order to cope with the arrival of emergency times, the Hong Kong military authorities have made substantial preparations for all military deployments. Each fort and warship is also constantly practicing with live ammunition. Yesterday morning, the Mount Davis Fort held another anti-aircraft gun exercise, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. For a time, the sound of cannons rumbled, echoing far and wide.

A Free Discussion on Learning the Spirit of Clara Zetkin   Hui Na

——Commemorating the March 8th Women's Day——

On the eve of this world war storm, when the Chinese nation is undertaking the sacred struggle against aggression, commemorating this "International Women's Day" against war and aggression, its significance is self-evident, great, and arduous!

Chinese women can only achieve true liberation under the torrent of the War of Resistance, and only after the entire nation is liberated can they achieve true freedom and equality. Based on this new and special significance, the task of Chinese women is not only to resist the war for their own interests, but also to fight for the survival of the entire nation and world peace. On this "International March 8th Day," we are reminded of the life of the initiator, Clara Zetkin, and her unfinished mission and work after her death.

Clara Zetkin was a giant in the world women's movement. She dedicated her life to fighting for the working masses and oppressed women all over the world. Whether in work or theory, she left behind immortal achievements. She joined the Polish political group at the age of twenty and never stopped until her death. She was imprisoned for this reason and suffered all kinds of persecution and painful escapes. However, the persevering her still met it with calmness, and struggled with the spirit of courage and perseverance!

When the First World War broke out, she went everywhere to appeal for peace and carry out activities against aggressive war! She presided over the International Women's Anti-War Conference in Bern and edited the anti-war central publication "Equality" in Paris. Although evil forces oppressed her, and although she was weakened by old age and illness, she still worked tirelessly and tirelessly. Even a few months before her death, she still expressed her lifelong views in the German Parliament in front of many opponents. This spirit of hers towards revolution and the world women's movement is truly worthy of admiration.

There are probably two points in Zetkin's spirit that are worthy of our emulation: First, from her lifelong theory and practical actions, it is explained that the women's movement must be consistent with the movement of the entire country and society to achieve victory. Therefore, Zetkin was not only a feminist activist, but also engaged in practical revolutionary work throughout her life. Her theory was most clearly demonstrated in the success of the Russian Revolution and the Paris Commune. Today, the Chinese women's movement is developing as Zetkin pointed out. This can be evidenced by the work of Chinese women since the War of Resistance. Second, she devoted her life to opposing aggression for world peace. Before and during the Great War, she loudly called for anti-war propaganda. She organized the Spartacus League, an anti-war center in Berlin, and convened the International Women's Anti-War Conference. Her enthusiasm for opposing aggression is exactly the same as that of Chinese women today.

In short, from Zetkin's life, we can find many historical facts and spirits worthy of reference for the Chinese women's movement. On the occasion of commemorating "March 8th Women's Day," we should of course commemorate this giant of the world women's movement. We should also learn from Ms. Zetkin's lifelong spirit of struggle, and we should carry forward her spirit of anti-fascism and anti-aggression to complete her unfinished work and mission, so as not to lose the true meaning of commemorating "International March 8th Women's Day" today! The Due Task of the Women's Circle on March 8th - Engraved by Tang Yingwei

### Remembering Old Mrs. Zhao on March 8th   Zhang Chunfeng

I remember that Old Mrs. Zhao, the mother of the Chinese guerrillas, came to Hong Kong last November. It seemed that she brought the heroic spirit of the nation's bloody war of resistance, which boosted the decadent atmosphere of the women's circle on the island who were singing and dancing. At the same time, she also personally confirmed the certainty of winning the War of Resistance and the certainty of building the country. The hearts of the people on the island were greatly encouraged. However, after a while, Old Mrs. Zhao returned, and the atmosphere on the island returned to silence. The once excited and enthusiastic women's circle still lived a competitive life of gorgeous costumes and heavy makeup, which is really sighing "this is one time, that is another."

Carefully examining the great achievements of Old Mrs. Zhao in the history of the Chinese national women's war of resistance, she is truly worthy of being written in large characters as surpassing the ancients and guiding future generations. As an old woman in her sixties, she actually led thousands of passionate young men to fight in a dangerous area for several years, attacking the enemy, which really makes us carefully investigate and admire and respect her.

From a formal point of view, she is the most unfashionable, the least dressed up, and the least able to learn the modernization of the new era. She can't walk in high heels, doesn't know how to dance, and doesn't even know what Parisian perfume is, let alone go to a cosmetics party. If she were to throw herself into the modern fashionable women's group, if she were not pushed out, she would be ridiculed and forgotten in the darkest corner of society; however, in essence, she is indeed a great woman of the times who surpassed the ancients and guided future generations. She is a mentor to the 200 million women in the women's movement, and the embodiment of the spirit of all national resistance to aggression. The great glory she has gained by leading the national resistance to achieve results is enough to compete with the jewel light of the necklaces of millions of noble women.

She said: "If everyone is thinking about their own home and is burdened by their families, who will save the country?" She is a great woman who has no home and takes the nation as her career. Today, it is of course not difficult to find women on the island who take the dance hall as their home and decorate themselves with makeup, jewels, and fake diamonds, but compared with Old Mrs. Zhao, how small, inferior, and pitiful they are!

I remember that when she was in Wuhan, she once sighed with loyalty and worry because of the friction and disagreement within the War of Resistance groups. She said, how should I move those who are always arguing? So, at that time, she said the most meaningful and greatest ordinary sentence, she said, "All compatriots in the country must move, those who can bring wind should bring wind, and those who can bring rain should bring rain." What a practical and powerful touching words—if everyone moves thoroughly, of course they will have no time to rub, and they will not bear to rub, and they will not be able to rub. Since the War of Resistance, there have been no less than thousands of speeches to resolve the friction within the party, but none of them have been as crisp and thorough as this one. Old Mrs. Zhao's thinking is indeed outstanding.

For women's participation in the War of Resistance, she also loudly urged: "Some people say that it is inconvenient for women to participate in the guerrillas. I want to ask, when the enemy arrives, is it convenient to be insulted by the enemy? Young women, don't wait to be the temporary wife of the enemy. Even the old woman should always remember to put a kitchen knife on her body. When the enemy comes, kill one of them by surprise." How fierce and powerful are the words? Especially the sentence "waiting to be a temporary wife of the enemy" is even more painful. Therefore, women on this island, even though they are in a safe area, should even more plan day and night for good strategies to repay the country and save the nation.

Regarding the methods of women repaying the country and saving the nation, she also clearly pointed out that: "Anything can save the country, sewing clothes for the army, making a pair of shoes, and burning a bowl of tea also help the country." She also said: "Saving two cents can buy a bullet for the country." Chinese women who live and work in peace on the island should also know how to save the country and save the nation—especially for wealthy women, she especially emphasized: "If you have money and don't take it out, can you take your money to the coffin?" Although the words are serious, they can also stimulate those misers who only care about their families and not the country.

Today is March 8th Women's Day. Every Chinese woman on the island should silently think about, "How much have I done for my motherland?" Parents should also think deeply, just as Old Mrs. Zhao said: "Be a good parent, but you should let your children save the country, and you should also save the country." It is true that "What time is it now? If you don't do it now, it will be too late to regret it." "Women should do things like men, and prepare quickly before the enemy kills you."

On this day, we who live in Hong Kong and live in foreign concessions should not forget the brothers who are fighting bloody battles on the front line." Although Old Mrs. Zhao is far away in Chongqing today, her passionate calls are still connected across the sea and can be heard thousands of miles away. She said, "If the country is destroyed, what face do you have to live in a foreign country?" People on the island can reflect deeply!

I would like to take this great day of Chinese Women's Day to commemorate Old Mrs. Zhao, the mother of the Chinese people who is working hard and worrying about the War of Resistance day and night in the motherland, and wish her vigorous spirit and healthy body.

A Few Things About the Women's Movement   Lat

Naturally, there are many things to say today. However, we must list them one by one, and ask everyone to abide by them like a preacher. This is certainly a very meaningful and important work. However, when I am unable to implement it in this way, I can only talk about other aspects that are also important.

I should talk about one thing:

In the new stage of the War of Resistance, on Women's Day, especially on Women's Day here today, we should take a look at how many of the women we can mobilize are participating? Is the public awareness of the March 8th commemoration universal? What enthusiastic work have women done in today's commemorative festival? We should use these points to examine the achievements of the women's movement.

On today's Women's Day, if we find that the masses of women have not been widely mobilized; the masses of women's understanding of this festival is still very weak: the masses of women have not widely demonstrated work related to the War of Resistance in this festival, then it is obvious that our women's federation work is still behind the tense reality, and we need to be vigilant and need us to remedy it.

Although these are only two or three small things in the women's movement, we can't help but examine them carefully today, as a reliable reference for our women's movement workers, and as our women's movement workers should intensify their efforts to complete this unfinished task.

Where Should Housewives Go?   Pan Wen

From the "Equality of Men and Women" movement to the "Women's Liberation" movement, the progressive elements of the Chinese women's circle have been bravely fighting for more than 20 years. Has it been successful? Yes, but not completely successful. Where is the success? The traditional concept of valuing men over women for thousands of years has been broken. The law has clearly stipulated the equality of men and women. The traditional etiquette that has been oppressing for decades has been broken. In name, women have gained freedom of thought, belief, love, marriage, and occupation! Aren't these things that foreign countries have struggled for hundreds of years and have succeeded in more than 20 years of struggle? However, we have broken free from old ideas and etiquette shackles, and have been locked into new cages! The dual oppression of imperialism and domestic feudal remnants has caused the women's circles who are moving towards freedom and happiness to encounter unprecedented and cruel persecution! Among them, especially housewives, tens of thousands of them are imprisoned in a prison called "family." Even if you have received a good education before and have been determined to liberate women and transform society, most of them have invisibly turned themselves into prisoners due to the burden of housework, the burden of children, and the perfunctory nature of human relationships. What's more, more than 200 million Chinese housewives are still completely illiterate, especially completely impoverished! Today, everyone understands that in order for women to be thoroughly liberated, in addition to legal and nominal provisions and regulations, an economic and political foundation must be established. And the establishment of this foundation must first eliminate the current biggest obstacles, the domestic feudal remnants and international imperialism, especially the current fascist aggressors. At the same time, everyone also understands that the final victory of the struggle against fascism and aggression, and the demand for world peace and Chinese liberation, cannot be finally successful without the heroic and resolute support and participation of 200 million Chinese housewives. However, our housewives continue to be isolated from the struggle of our motherland and the world. This is the most serious problem in our women's movement.

How should we solve these serious problems? First of all, we must universally and deeply carry out political mobilization work for housewives. This includes regular official propaganda in sub-districts, sub-districts, and sub-districts, the literacy and writing movement, the Latinized new writing movement, and using all opportunities to hold appropriate discussion meetings such as housework seminars. In the discussions of daily life, try to fulfill the tasks of educating, organizing, and mobilizing housewives. In addition, it is especially noteworthy in Hong Kong that most housewives, unwilling to surrender to corrupt customs and lewd lives, have run to the "church"? Let's see the crowded situation of women in every church holding "sermons" and other gatherings!

We don't need to compete with the church for women's masses, but we must learn from the church's methods of mobilizing women on the one hand, and on the other hand, in their groups, publicize the Christian righteousness of saving mankind, defending our homeland, and promoting culture without fear of sacrifice, publicize the heroic deeds of Christians participating in the Crusades to regain the Holy Land in the Hundred Years' War, and publicize the glorious facts of Christians and Catholics heroically participating in the War of Resistance and rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees in our country since the War of Resistance, encouraging them to use the spirit of saving the world and saving themselves to contribute money and efforts to support the War of Resistance, build the country, and strive for lasting peace.

Secondly, it is of course worthy of special encouragement that housewives can enthusiastically accept training and heroically participate in frontline work, but in fact they are a minority. This is not the weakness of housewives, but the special difficulties of their environment. We should persuade them not to look down on themselves because of this, and at the same time point out the importance of organizing propaganda teams, fundraising teams, comforting wounded soldiers, refugees, and families of soldiers resisting Japan in the rear, point out the importance of publicizing overseas to encourage their lovers, husbands, brothers, children, relatives and friends to contribute money and efforts to save the motherland, and point out the importance of doing their best to maintain and educate children for the family and society, and increasing the backbone members of the future construction of a new country and the creation of a new society. We not only have to persuade them in this way, but also have to work hard and take the lead by example to lead them and help them to put these tasks into practice.

Finally, and most importantly, housewives have their own greatest pain, such as (1) if they are not married, they are affected by the wrong quick thoughts and feel ashamed to participate in the national salvation movement (2) if they are married, they are burdened by family affairs, and they have to serve their parents-in-law, manage housework, and raise children; (3) economic rights are not equal, and they have no freedom of action in the family; (4) the environment is bad, and they have to make kinds of insincere social interactions, and they have no time to participate in group work; (5) due to various sad experiences of individuals in the family, they are discouraged in everything. In addition to doing our best to help them encourage them to get rid of their own difficulties, we must also urge the government to quickly implement comprehensive education, implement the socialization of family affairs, widely set up nurseries, nursing homes, homes for the disabled, sanatoriums, reward women's labor, and unite the united front of women.

More than 20 years of experience and lessons of struggle will help our women to launch a united front struggle under heavy pressure, and will guarantee that our strict struggle will eventually win the final victory.

### British Government Considers Definite Protection of Interests; Conservative Members Urge Retaliation Against Japan; Deputy Foreign Minister Says Action Will Be Taken When Possible

[Reuters, London, 6th] Deputy Foreign Minister Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the Shanghai Municipal Council had discussed a cooperation plan with the Japanese authorities, and after review by Foreign Secretary Halifax, it was deemed not to impede the functions of the Municipal Council. When asked if he could guarantee that the government would continue to provide full assistance to the Municipal Council, the Deputy Foreign Minister replied, "This is a matter of course." Butler then responded to a question from Liberal Party member Sir Herbert Samuel, stating that, as mentioned on February 13th, regarding the blockade of the Pearl River, the government did send a note to the Japanese government, but the government had never interfered with the Japanese army's occupation of Humen. Halifax is closely monitoring the situation of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, so he is very aware of the impact of the current ban in Guangzhou on British interests. The government has decided to instruct the ambassador in Tokyo and the authorities in Hong Kong and Guangzhou to continue to negotiate with Japan to restore traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong as soon as possible. Sir Herbert Samuel then asked, "Is the Deputy Foreign Minister also aware of the seriousness of this matter and the damage suffered by Lancashire?" Butler replied that he felt the seriousness of the situation, so he said that he was determined to urgently demand that the Japanese side restore traffic as soon as possible. Conservative member Moore-Brabazon then asked, according to Japanese official announcements, since March 10th, all transactions in North China must use banknotes from the puppet "United Reserve Bank," and those who do not comply will be prohibited from transporting all goods to British and colonial ports, unless they have a consular certificate proving that the funds were provided by British, American, and French banks. Has this matter drawn the attention of the British government? Butler said that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of this statement. As for the second half of this question, the government authorities are considering various practical ways to effectively protect British interests. Moore-Brabazon continued, "What we need is action, not consideration." Butler replied, "If practical action is needed, we will not reduce its necessity." Conservative member Marston asked whether the British government had a consulate in Yichang. Now, in view of the Japanese army's intensified advance towards Yichang, if there is no British consulate there, should the British government immediately send a consul to protect overseas Chinese? Butler said that although there is no British consulate in Yichang, there is a British warship stationed there, and the warship is responsible for taking all necessary steps to protect the lives and property of British citizens. However, if the circumstances require the establishment of a British consulate, it can also be sent from Chongqing in a short period of time.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Regarding the "Provisional Government" of North China's decision to manage foreign exchange, Conservative Member of Parliament Moore-Brabazon raised an inquiry to the government this afternoon. Deputy Foreign Minister Butler replied that, according to information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, the North China foreign exchange management measures will be implemented on the 11th of this month. Thereafter, those who export various goods abroad must submit a statement proving that the foreign exchange they obtained has been sold to the "United Reserve Bank" at the designated price, otherwise they will not be allowed to declare for export. Moore-Brabazon also asked, what methods does the government intend to use to maintain the interests held by Britain in North China? The Deputy Foreign Minister replied again that all practical and feasible methods sufficient to safeguard British interests must be considered. Moore-Brabazon further asked, could Deputy Secretary Butler provide a more detailed answer regarding how British interests should be safeguarded, and stated that in addition to considering various possible measures, the government will actively take action as soon as practical action is possible. The Deputy Foreign Minister replied again that practical activities may be necessary in the future, and I will not shy away from saying so.

### Stimson Suggests Naval Cooperation Among Britain, France, and the United States to Resist Aggression by the Three Fascist Countries; Britain, Australia, and New Zealand Discuss Defense Plans

[Reuters, New York, 7th] Former US Secretary of State Stimson, in a letter to the "New York Times" today, advocated that the US Navy should take action when fascist countries invade Britain or France, stating: Britain and France are likely to encounter attacks from fascist countries at any time. Judging from the current situation, this attack will be carried out jointly by the three fascist countries. To defend against this kind of attack, only the joint action of the navies of the three major democracies (including the United States) can achieve it. If one of them maintains isolation and does not cooperate, the result will inevitably be a disastrous defeat for the three countries. Conversely, fascist countries also know that this kind of action is enough to prevent their attack. Currently, the land and air forces of the aggression group are stronger than those of Britain and France. Their naval power will also exceed the fleets of Britain and France in Europe. If the Japanese fleet dominates the Western Pacific, including Australia, New Zealand, Western Canada, and Singapore, and Singapore, which is the key to protecting various places in the Western Pacific, is threatened or lost, France or the Netherlands will be forced to cede some land in the Western Hemisphere or the East to fascist countries, or conclude some compromise treaty, which is clearly a deep-seated danger to us. Can we improve our position by waiting for such things to happen? Now is not the time for the United States to forget the lessons it has recently learned. The New York Times also praised Stimson's policy in an article, saying, "The United States does not need foreign alliances to implement this policy, it can only discuss self-defense with law-abiding countries."

[Reuters, Melbourne, 7th] The "Melbourne Herald" here editorialized today, hinting that Britain, Australia, and New Zealand will soon hold an Imperial Pacific Conference, and said that negotiations between New Zealand and Australia have already begun. It is said that the conference will discuss defense plans, as well as the financial and other responsibilities that each country is willing to bear.

### Sahadat Speaks, Respecting Madame Chiang; This Sino-Japanese War Will Continue for Three More Years
