### Our Forces Recapture the North Street of Jiangmen; The Battle Northeast of Xinhui Proceeds Smoothly

[Reuters, Macau, 3rd] Jiangmen has now been recaptured by the Chinese army. Two divisions of the Guangxi Army arrived in Jiangmen yesterday and immediately launched a fierce counter-offensive, surrounding the Japanese army and cutting off their retreat. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with only a few retreating across the river to Jiujiang. The Japanese army completely withdrew from Jiangmen during the action. By 4 PM, the Japanese army...

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 3rd] Yesterday, the enemy invading Jiangmen again attacked Lile Village in Xinhui, using nine tanks to cover the advance of over five hundred infantrymen. We had previously destroyed the highway and our troops intercepted them in the narrow mountain roads. Our detachments circled around to the enemy's rear, unleashing a barrage of gunfire. The enemy was surrounded on all sides and their formation was in chaos. We seized the opportunity to charge and kill dozens of the enemy. There are no enemy traces in Lile Town at the moment. Yesterday morning, Jiangmen was officially recaptured by us, and two to three hundred enemy soldiers were captured. Regarding the battle in the vicinity of Huicheng, with the cooperation of a certain Guilin regiment of Deng Longguang and a part of the Guangxi Army, along with the Fifth War Zone guerrilla teams and the people's determined resistance, progress is smooth, forming a stalemate.

[Shiqi Quick Report, 3rd] The defense of Zhongshan is fortified, and local peace is as usual. The reporter met with County Magistrate Zhang on the morning of the 3rd. According to him, the county government received reports from the front line that on the afternoon of the 2nd, a certain two regiments of the Guangxi Army launched a counter-offensive from the Dahui Village, northeast of Huicheng, towards the enemy in the Baisha area, wiping out over a hundred enemy soldiers. At that time, there were several enemy planes assisting, but our army fought extremely bravely and made efforts to counter-attack. The enemy eventually could not withstand and retreated towards Jiangmen. Our army took advantage of the situation to advance towards Jiangmen. In addition, the Fourth War Zone Headquarters and the provincial government sent the capable... two officers to Zhongshan to inspect the teams. They arrived in Shiqi this morning and inspected them at Renshan Square. In the afternoon, County Magistrate Zhang, together with the special commissioner, went to the Xiaolan front line in the Third District to inspect. The report stated that the Zhongshan County Government had stopped collecting an additional five yuan per vehicle for the Qiguan vehicle. The county government confirmed that this was absolutely not the case.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 2nd] The enemy invading Shaping was intercepted by our army, and a fierce battle unfolded. Our forces fought bravely, killing over two hundred enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered a major setback. The remaining enemy planned to escape to Zhuangyuan Mountain and other places, relying on the dangerous terrain to resist. We are currently encircling and annihilating them.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 2nd] On the evening of the 28th, our teams launched a counter-offensive against Shaping, which belongs to Heshan County, heavily surrounding the enemy. The enemy, numbering about four hundred, had five tanks and two steel cannons. Near Shaping, our army suddenly surrounded and attacked them, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. After losing Shaping, the remaining enemy lost their combat effectiveness, stubbornly resisted relying on the dangerous terrain, and used four planes to indiscriminately drop bombs. As of the morning of the 29th, the struggle for Shaping was still ongoing.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] The enemy invading Shaping after crossing the Jiujiang River continued to add four to five hundred infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen, and four tanks. More than a thousand reinforcements are crossing the river. In the past four days, the enemy has transported seven hundred wounded soldiers to Jiujiang, which shows the intensity of the fighting there. The enemy landing in Jiangmen numbered about a thousand, with six tanks.

### Report from the Hong Kong Xinhui Chamber of Commerce on the War Situation and Disaster Situation in Jiangmen

[Hong Kong News] The Hong Kong Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, in order to understand the war situation and disaster situation in Jiangmen so as to facilitate relief, publicly appointed Zhang Lanzhou, the vice-chairman of the Chamber, to go to Macau with Lu Aiyun, the chairman of the Jiangmen City Chamber of Commerce, to investigate. According to Mr. Zhang's return to Hong Kong, the situation before the 30th of last month is as follows:

Since the morning of the 29th, the enemy has launched an invasion of Jiangmen by the sea and air forces from several routes, including Tianhe, Zhutou Mountain, and Wai Xue. We responded on all routes. On the same day, Chen Chi, the captain of the Self-Defense Brigade, launched a counter-offensive in Tangxia and fought a deadly battle with the enemy. The enemy was driven out of Tianhe. On the 30th, the enemy reinforced with more than three thousand troops, and planes bombed the area relentlessly. The shallow-water fleet in the north street kept firing artillery, and also used speedboats and cavalry, etc., to charge in by different routes. Because we were outnumbered and our weapons were inferior, we shortened our defense line and retreated into the urban area. Then the enemy charged in from all directions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand street fighting, gaining and losing ground several times, resulting in a stalemate that lasted all day. After wiping out over a hundred enemy soldiers, we began to withdraw to the suburbs and dispersed. The part that retreated to Huicheng ambushed between Dahui and Qibang. At that time, the enemy charged towards Huicheng along the Ningyang Railway, and we intercepted them in Dahui, Qibang, and other places, causing many casualties on both sides. On April 1st, the enemy began to approach the outskirts of Huicheng. We defended Guifeng, Xishan, Xiangshan and other places outside the city and fought fiercely with the enemy.

All the personnel involved in this resistance war were determined to sacrifice themselves and deal with the enemy. Commander Li and County Magistrate Wu Zi remained calm and stayed in the county government from the 29th to April 1st, calmly directing operations day and night with a telephone in hand. It was reported that his hand was injured by shrapnel. Deputy Commander Zhou Hanling, when he arrived in Tangxia, was machine-gunned by enemy planes while traveling by car from Tingdou to Shuanglong, injuring his right hand. He immediately bandaged it with cloth and went to Daxian. Squad leader Zhou Fu was the most commendable. He defended the East Fortress and the Shuinan line, and remained steadfast for two days and nights, finally sacrificing himself heroically.

In this battle, in addition to the sea and air forces, the enemy increased its infantry to more than five thousand people. On our side, there were the Xinhui Special Fourth Company, the self-defense regiments of Chen Chi, Shi Songping, and Yin Hongfei, one battalion each, and the national military reserve company, the county government political police team, and about one battalion of police, fighting the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. Female transport teams also participated in the battle, and the villagers, hearing that the enemy was coming, even took up farm tools to fight the enemy desperately. Their loyalty and courage were enough to chill the enemy's hearts. General Deng Longguang's large reinforcements, in order to avoid air strikes, traveled at night and were said to have arrived... Now they are deployed on various lines outside Huicheng, and a joint counter-offensive is imminent, which will surely produce amazing results.

It was also found that the enemy occupied Jiangmen and used the Pengjiang Hotel as its headquarters. They searched door-to-door in the villages of Fanluo, Zini, Yunjing, and Dongcangli in an attempt to find our troops, killing many people. The enemy garrisoned in Waihai extorted three million yuan in currency.

The shops and population of Jiangmen have been evacuated and are now a dead city. Most of the disaster-stricken villagers came to Macau by sea. County Magistrate Li was very concerned and, despite his hand injury, telegraphed the heads of coastal villages to send self-defense regiments and reserve teams to protect the refugees in different routes, so that they could escape in an orderly manner. It was reported that Feng Jie, the captain of the Muzhou team, continuously used boats to transport and protect the refugees, which was very effective. Most of the wounded soldiers and civilians in Jiangmen were transported to the vicinity of Huicheng, where Zhang Jiuliang, the chairman of the Red Cross branch, led the rescue teams to provide assistance to various hospitals day and night.

In this battle, when our county fought with the enemy, the enemy initially overstepped their bounds. Our teams numbered only over two thousand, and the enemy then used more than five thousand troops, as well as airplanes, warships, tanks, and cavalry to confront us. However, we were able to support with all our strength, turning the situation around with fewer troops. Although this was due to Li Wuzi's gaining the support of the people, and Zhou Hongzhi's bravery in battle, the local gentry also led the people and united sincerely, so that everyone was of one mind and displayed the spirit of resisting the enemy and defending the land, adding another glorious page to the history of the Chinese Republic's resistance against the enemy.

Mr. Zhang then said that he had discussed relief issues with Mr. Qu Zesen, Chairman of the Chamber, Manager... and other colleagues this morning. Everyone suggested that a meeting of the Chamber's Relief Association be convened immediately to discuss relief measures and to send telegrams to commend those who had contributed to the battle.

### Prospects for the Hunan-Jiangxi War Situation

[Special Correspondent Aviation News from Changsha] Since March 18, the enemy forces in northern Jiangxi began their attack with the aim of capturing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Ruoxi in the middle reaches of the Xiu River to Wucheng in Hekou, a fierce battle unfolded along the entire line. As of the end of March, the main enemy forces who crossed the Xiu River forcefully at Goutouling between Qiujin and Yongxiu had captured Nanchang. Other enemy forces, under the cover of tanks, were confronting us in the area of Liantang, Shabutan, and Sanjiangkou. Nanchang is an important town in northern Jiangxi and the gateway to eastern Hunan. It also occupies an important position in the transportation links to the southeast and southwest. Therefore, we believe that we will launch a counter-offensive in the near future.

On the enemy's side, capturing Nanchang is actually an unnecessary waste. This is why they only started attacking Nanchang after occupying Jiujiang and Wuchang. More than a year of large-scale warfare has taught them: as long as China's field army exists for one day, China will definitely have a day to destroy them; but China's field army is being strengthened and expanded, and their dream of annihilating it will never come true. Therefore, they thought: if China's international transportation lines are not cut off, China will definitely have righteous friends who will provide more substantial assistance in terms of materials. Judging from the enemy's occupation of Hainan Island, the intensification of the construction of fortifications, the construction of airfields and warehouses, and the active increase in reinforcements in Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, and the clearing of the rear, they are indeed preparing to cut off our international transportation lines in the southwest and northwest. If the enemy puts all its strength on this strategy, it is not something to be ignored.

But the enemy is an adventurous merchant with a shortage of capital, and also a rogue gambler who scrapes everywhere at home to make a desperate gamble. He does not have so much capital to take that big risk: he walks into the casino with a small amount of money he has pieced together and does not know which door to bet on to win. The world recognizes that there are no adventurous merchants or rogue gamblers who become rich.

International events, domestic realities, and the hundreds of soldiers who are fighting endless wars in China make the Japanese warlords more impatient and anxious than an adventurous merchant or a gambler. Especially for the people at home and the soldiers on the expedition, five months after occupying the two empty cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou, they must find something quite stimulating to comfort the people and boost their morale. Therefore, after once being active in central Hubei, they chose Nanchang again. In fact, if he concentrated all his strength from central Hubei and broke through to the west, he might have stepped on the land of Jingzhou or Yichang. Regardless of whether there would be no more advance from then on, but only the opportunity to retreat, he could also shamelessly make sensational propaganda to the country, such as "the Imperial Army is only so many kilometers away from China's capital, Chongqing."

So what about Nanchang?

Nanchang, Changsha, and Wuchang, these three points can almost form an equilateral triangle. The enemy has occupied Wuchang and Nanchang. After losing two corners, it is naturally quite difficult for us to defend Changsha this corner. In the parallelogram formed by Jiujiang, Yueyang, Changsha, and Nanchang, stands the natural fortress bestowed upon us by the Creator - Mount Mufu. On the one hand, it breaks through the special corner situation between Wuchang, the Yangtze River, and Yueyang, hindering the communication between the Yangtze River and Yueyang, and at the same time threatening the middle of southern Hubei from the mountainous areas on both sides of the Xiu River in a commanding posture. This great, deep mountain range between the border areas of Hunan and Hubei can accommodate one or two hundred thousand troops without being seen. It can actively attack the strongholds surrounding it on the north, east, and south sides, and retreat to preserve its strength, and cover the three Xiang regions. Therefore, although the enemy occupies Nanchang and cuts off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they only deepen the mistake of invading the inland and fall into the quagmire of being attacked on all sides, destroying the Japanese goods market that could still be smuggled from Guangzhou and Haikou to the inland... What is facing them is a broader "sea and land" and a deeper mountainous area. They do not have more manpower, material resources, and financial resources to control a larger battlefield, protect longer battle lines, and defend more strongholds.

From a strategic point of view, it is also a mistake for the enemy to expand the Hunan-Jiangxi battlefield. The enemy's operations have far exceeded their original plan. The equipment of the enemy's army is for plain warfare. The ideal war zone is outside the Great Wall, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. They have also prepared for coastal operations, so there are a considerable number of special landing units. In reality, they did not expect to fight a mountain war with China. Although they also have two or three (at most four) divisions equipped for mountain warfare, they were exhausted in the mountain wars in southern Jiangxi and the mountains of Anhui and Hubei during the Wuhan Battle. From the most recent spoils of war, the maps of Jiangxi and Hunan they are using - especially Hunan - are far less detailed than the maps they used in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Shandong. They are currently committing the mistake of being "led by others" that Sun Tzu called "those who are good at using troops lead others, but are not led by others."

The enemy's adventurous actions between Mount Mufu and Poyang Lake are giving us a good opportunity for a large-scale encirclement and annihilation. For the upcoming major counter-offensive, we will definitely retake Nanchang. International people will say: Although the Japanese have occupied seven major cities in China, they cannot occupy China's eighth city; just like that unanimous determination to resist Japan. (The general idea is like this) Now, let us use this determination to recapture our eighth city and defend the gateway to eastern Hunan! (Zhang Dangren. Three, Thirty-one)

They plan to set up a branch office in Xiangyang to expand the work.

Editorial

### Commemorating Children's Day

Children are the future masters of the nation and the determiners of the world's future destiny. All countries in the world regard children's affairs as one of the major national undertakings, and the annual commemorations of Children's Day are even more enthusiastic. In the past, our country was plagued by internal strife and foreign aggression, and children's affairs were not given due attention. In view of this, the China Child Welfare Association submitted a request to the National Government on March 7th of the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], clearly designating April 4th, a time of vigorous spring, as Children's Day. Since then, national commemorations have been held for eight years. However, in the past, most were routine commemorations, and there seemed to be few concrete plans for activities that truly benefited children, and even fewer praiseworthy actions. Only after the full-scale War of Resistance began, last year's Children's Day, under the advocacy of the women's leader, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, saw a nationwide call to strive for wartime children's affairs. For example, regarding child care work, there is already an organization of childcare associations, and initial progress is still smooth. As for the relief and education of child refugees, the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, has repeatedly ordered local governments to pay attention. However, in the past year, with the expansion of the war zones, looking back at the work of child care, it is still far behind the needs. Therefore, when commemorating this year's Children's Day, we cannot but think of the children in the war zones under the gunfire and swords of the Japanese, suffering from hunger, cold, displacement, and death! We cannot but think of the children in the occupied areas, suffering from bullying, ×××××××××. We cannot but think of the children in all parts of our vast motherland, they are in distress! They are wandering! They have lost their homes! They cannot see their parents. Under such a new situation, our urgent task in commemorating Children's Day is, first, to intensify the work of rescuing our children in the war zones and occupied areas. Second, it is to expand the promotion of nurturing the descendants of our nation, and nurturing the masters of the new China. We must, without any delay, transport the children in and near the war zones to safe areas, to the more distant rear, to avoid the devastation and bombing of the Japanese. We must also use a variety of methods to launch the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor struggle in the occupied areas, and do everything possible to relieve, organize, and educate the children in the occupied areas. We must systematically investigate and register the children rescued from the war zones and the children originally in the rear; organize them into groups, divide and send them out, guarantee their material life, implement correct and appropriate spiritual education, and use all their possibilities to increase the strength of the War of Resistance (such as the Boy Scouts in Shanghai assisting the army and the children's theater troupes traveling throughout the country to engage in propaganda during the War of Resistance). In order to cultivate the basic talents for the future construction of a new China of the Three Principles of the People.

In order to perfectly achieve our current urgent requirements, we must immediately strive for the following tasks that must be implemented at present:

On the government side, it should further recognize the great significance of rescuing child refugees and caring for children at present, and use laws and other appropriate methods to help wartime childcare associations and other enthusiasts in caring for children, increase assistance in transporting children from the war zones, allocate needed housing to provide food and clothing needs, widely solicit pediatricians and nurses for medicines, and implement refugee education suitable for the War of Resistance, etc. The government has already done its best in the past, and should universally intensify its efforts in the future.

On the people's side, we should recognize that rescuing child refugees and caring for children at present has the great significance of reducing national sacrifices, reducing our own sacrifices, and guaranteeing the future life of our nation. It is the current bounden duty of all Chinese sons and daughters. Therefore, all sectors of our men and women, especially organized mass organizations, must immediately strive to help the government and practically start from their own scope, concentrate financial and human resources, and expand the childcare movement. In particular, overseas Chinese should expand the fundraising movement and the medical donation movement for this purpose.

On the international front, we must expand propaganda work, on the one hand, use concrete materials to expose the truth of the Japanese harming our children and women, increase international indignation against the Japanese, and on the other hand, explain the importance of caring for Chinese children in ensuring China's victory in the War of Resistance, success in national construction, and even safeguarding world peace, in order to gain the sympathy and assistance of international people. The Soviet Union and various countries in Europe and America have successively provided material assistance to Spanish refugees, and the workers and masses of the Soviet Union and other countries, together with peace-loving and righteous people all over the world, have separately cared for thousands of Spanish refugees, which are good examples.

Finally, we must also strive to cultivate specialized talents in childcare. We hope that wealthy compatriots will assist the government in establishing childcare cadre training schools to provide a large number of such specialized talents. Others with medical and nursing knowledge and experience should enthusiastically volunteer in the spirit of national spiritual mobilization.

If we want to strive for national liberation, we must rescue and care for the descendants of our nation. We persevere in the War of Resistance for the construction of a new China, and we must even more resolutely strive to rescue and care for the future masters of the new China. And only by expanding relief and childcare can we reassure our soldiers to fight, workers to work, farmers to farm, and women can also be spared the burden of their children and participate in the work of the War of Resistance and national construction. All Chinese men and women compatriots who do not want to be slaves, we must cooperate and earnestly shoulder the task of childcare given to us by history. The masters of the new China will grow and thrive in the bloody battles of gunfire!

### Anti-Aggression Scope: Soviet Union Aims to Extend to the Far East, Urges Closer Cooperation Between Britain and the Soviet Union; President Roosevelt Pays Attention to the European Situation

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Yesterday, the Soviet press criticized Britain's guarantees to Poland, believing that Britain's guarantees were not thorough and demanding closer ties between Britain and the Soviet Union. The government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," called Chamberlain's declaration "ineffective" and repeatedly cited the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting. The Soviet Union favored a comprehensive anti-aggression declaration, in which not only related countries but also small and medium-sized countries and the Soviet Union would participate, rather than a unilateral declaration by Britain. The newspaper further demanded that Britain and France abandon their non-intervention policy and resume collective security actions. If they agree to oppose any aggression, the Soviet Union will certainly provide full assistance. According to diplomatic circles, the last sentence above indicates that Moscow intends to expand the anti-aggression declaration and apply it to the Far East.

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] The Soviet Union's opinion on Britain's guarantee to Poland is that Britain may exert pressure on Poland to force it to cede the Polish Corridor, which is viewed with suspicion. "Pravda" published an official commentary stating that "the results of the Munich Conference are a reason why the Soviet press cannot trust British foreign policy. From then on, the floodgates to prevent fascist aggression were opened, and peace-loving democratic countries, especially those at the forefront, were hit by the torrent. The only way to eliminate this mistrust is to take action to show a determination to actively resist aggression."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] President Roosevelt, who is currently on vacation, is paying close attention to the European situation. Yesterday, the President had a telephone conversation with State Department officials on a dedicated line. At the same time, communications from the US embassies in Britain and France can also be connected to the line for direct conversations with the President.

[Associated Press, Rome, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, Britain and Italy are the behind-the-scenes countries "appeasing" the situation in Central Europe. It is reported that Britain is making every effort to reach an understanding between France and Italy, while Italy is mediating the tense relations between Poland and Germany.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck will arrive in Britain tomorrow. After Hitler's speech in Wilhelmshaven, the British House of Commons will also discuss foreign policy tomorrow, and the center of political interest will return to London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said: "Beck's visit to Britain, accompanied by many officials and experts to attend the meeting, indicates that the situation of British and French guarantees to Poland will continue to develop." The question of further guaranteeing the security of peace-loving countries will also be one of the issues to be discussed in the future.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, Labor opposition leader Attlee, currently represented by Greenwood due to illness, is expected to deliver a public speech at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow, proposing that the authorities take more active steps to expand the scope of Chamberlain's declaration last Friday. At that time, Chamberlain will discuss this issue after Greenwood makes a general statement. Liberal leader Sinclair, Eden, Churchill, or Lloyd George will also participate in the debate, and finally Dalton and Simon will represent the Labor Party and the government to conclude the debate.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Labor opposition leader Greenwood will be the first to speak when the House of Commons meets tomorrow to debate foreign affairs. He criticized Hitler's speech yesterday in Bradford, saying that what he declared was no different from his established strategy. Hitler did not put forward any constructive proposals to resolve the European situation, and his strategy is still to intimidate small and weak countries in Europe, creating a situation of unease in Europe. As long as this strategy continues, the crisis of war, even though Hitler says he wants to avoid it, will continue to exist.

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The British branch of the World Peace Congress held a meeting today, with hundreds of representatives from all walks of life participating. It was decided to hold a large-scale demonstration in Hyde Park on the 16th to support the collective security policy and advocate that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, and other countries willing to participate should conclude a peace alliance.

### Polish Foreign Minister Beck Arrives in London Yesterday; Germany Threatens Poland Again, Saying It Will Cancel the Friendship Agreement

[Reuters, Euston, 3rd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck, who is currently visiting London, arrived here this morning and crossed the Channel to Douvres at 11 am. When Colonel Beck passed through Berlin last night, the car stopped for 20 minutes. He did not get out of the car. An official from the German Foreign Ministry visited Beck and stayed for five minutes. Beck's talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Cox were very free. Tonight, he will attend a banquet at the Foreign Ministry, and tomorrow noon he will have lunch with the British. In the evening, he will attend a banquet at the Polish Embassy.

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 3rd] Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, along with several attendants, departed for London yesterday to discuss with British Prime Minister Chamberlain the proposal for British aid when Poland encounters German aggression. According to official views, Hitler's speech on Saturday can show the seriousness of the British hard-line policy in Hitler's mind, but the general view is that Germany has no immediate intention of attacking Poland. According to sources in Berlin, the Polish Foreign Minister arrived at the Silesian border at 8:45 pm and left at 9:11 pm. He did not get out of the car. The German side only sent representatives to give a routine welcome, and only talked for about five minutes. Many reporters gathered at the station, but the Polish Foreign Minister did not make any comments.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd] The German Foreign Ministry is now waiting for the outcome of the Polish Foreign Minister's talks with the British government in London, and is well aware that the talks will mention Germany's future actions in Central Europe. Hitler issued a warning to Poland and Britain in his speech in Wilhelmshaven yesterday, saying that Germany will never allow hostile countries to implement an encirclement policy against Germany. Observers with knowledge of the situation say that Hitler's words are the last warning to Polish Foreign Minister Beck. If Poland abandons its neutral policy and destroys its friendship with Germany, it should bear the responsibility for it. German party members expressed indignation at Britain's guarantee to Poland, saying that Germany did not intend to mobilize its troops and attack Poland, and condemned Britain's anti-German sentiment. German political circles declared that if Poland allies with Britain and France to oppose Germany, Germany will eliminate its obligations to Poland under the 1934 German-Polish Friendship Agreement. The term of the agreement is still five years. General observers believe that this agreement can guarantee that Germany will not immediately invade the "Polish Corridor" or change the status of Danzig.

### Government Guarantees Romania's Integrity; Suspected of Assisting in Strengthening the Air Force; Romanian Foreign Minister Will Visit Turkey

[Associated Press, Viking, 3rd] It is reported that British Minister to Romania Sir Ho has verbally stipulated with the Romanian government that Britain guarantees the territorial integrity of Romania, just as it does with Poland. Romanian Minister to London Tisi returned here last week. This trip was the most strenuous, and he went to London before Sunday, hoping to arrive at the same time as Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in order to participate in discussions to maintain the status quo in Eastern Europe.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to "Daily Mail", King Carol and the Romanian cabinet have decided to accept the British assistance and the Polish guarantee to resist German aggression. As for the British side, if it can receive a reply from Romania today, the Prime Minister will announce it in the House of Commons' foreign affairs discussion. The newspaper said that the British side also requested Romania to provide a guarantee that if Poland is attacked, it will immediately provide assistance to Poland.

[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 3rd] It is felt here that Britain and France's guarantee to Poland is a step to defend other Eastern European countries. According to authoritative sources, after Britain provides a guarantee of resistance to aggression to Romania, it will loan money to the country to help strengthen the Romanian air force. It is reported that Romania currently has no more than 300 first-line aircraft, and there are also very few aviators who are accustomed to flying at night. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will visit Turkey this week, at which time he will discuss the issue of foreign warships passing through the straits during wartime and reaching Romania. The general public deeply hopes to achieve a favorable outcome.

[Associated Press, Romanian Capital, 2nd] It is reported that the British government has agreed with the authorities here on the matter of guaranteeing Romania's integrity. It is generally believed that the British government will issue a statement to the House of Commons tomorrow, stating its guarantee to Romania. It is also reported that the Romanian Foreign Minister plans to go to Ankara before visiting the capitals of Western European countries to spend the holiday there, in order to discuss the Dardanelles Strait issue. It is generally believed that Romania is now eager to obtain Turkey's promise that when Romania is attacked, the warships of Romania's aid providers can come to aid through the strait. In this regard, Romania has hopes not only for the French navy, but also for the British navy, because Britain has just agreed to guarantee its territorial integrity.

### Former Polish Prime Minister Shot and Seriously Wounded; Rumors That He Committed Suicide

[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] General Rawicz, former Prime Minister of Poland, was found shot today and was taken to the hospital. His injuries are very serious. It is said that he attempted suicide.

### Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Dispute Temporarily Resolved; Both Parties Have Signed an Agreement with a Term of One Year

(Reuters, Moscow, 2nd) The Soviet Union and Japan signed a fisheries agreement today with a term of one year. (Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the Soviet-Japanese fisheries issue has been resolved and a public statement will be issued soon. Today is a Japanese holiday, and no detailed announcement has been made here. (Reuters, Moscow, 3rd) In the new Soviet-Japanese fisheries agreement, the Soviet Union has agreed to allow ten of the thirty-seven locations previously reserved due to topographical reasons to be exchanged in the same way. The number of locations leased by the Japanese side is twenty-five fewer than in the old agreement, and all are paying a 10% higher rent.

### Philippine Islands Security Threatened by Japan; US Senator Speaks

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US Senator King said today that Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands threatens the security and sovereignty of the Philippine Islands. This move by Japan is another example of Japan's attempt to dominate East Asia. Germany, Italy, and Japan have an agreement to advance simultaneously in different directions, and this has now been proven. While Germany and Italy are threatening Britain and France in Europe, Japan is continuing its aggression in the Far East. Since 1933, almost every incident has occurred simultaneously, making it impossible for other countries to cope. As for Japan's approach, it is regrettable because Japan endangers the rights of the United States in the Far East. However, this is a French problem and the United States cannot protest or take action against Japan. Japan took advantage of Germany and Italy's demands to occupy the islands, while the US Congress rejected the Guam harbor construction bill, indicating that the United States is unwilling to provoke Japan's position in the Far East, so Japan dares to act recklessly.

### How to Resolve the Issue of Volunteer Soldiers in Spain Raises Questions in the French Press; Large Number of People Arrested in Madrid

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 3rd] After General Franco issued the official announcement on Saturday that the Spanish Civil War has officially ended, the French weekly newspapers raised questions about how to resolve the issue of Italian volunteer soldiers. One newspaper believes that if Mussolini still refuses to send the Italian army back at this time, and violates the promise he made to Chamberlain during his last visit to Italy, then the Anglo-Italian Agreement signed in October 1938 will be just a formality, because the agreement stipulates the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers. However, according to the newspaper's speculation, Mussolini must be unwilling to withdraw the Italian army, because doing so would be tantamount to destroying the tool he uses to realize his Mediterranean ambitions.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] A report arriving here from Madrid stated that General Franco's military police have arrested 2,000 people in the past 24 hours. Electricity costs are not published in part.

### Germany's Budget for 1939; Military Spending Not Published

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Today, the "Legal Gazette" published Germany's budget for 1939, the total amount of guarantees reached 123,000,000 pounds, including 40,000,000 pounds specifically for promoting export trade. It is reported that the government has no intention of publishing detailed budget figures at present, and the Finance Minister is also authorized to use 16,000,000 pounds within the four-year plan for industrial development. It is difficult to predict what Germany will use to expand its rearmament in the future.

### French President Disregards Opposition from Various Parties, Agrees to Participate in Elections Again

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] President Lebrun quoted the name of former President Doumergue today, saying, "I did not come for my own personal interests, I cannot ignore the interests of the people." It is generally believed that this statement can be regarded as Lebrun's agreement to participate in the general election again. 156 Socialist members of the Chamber of Deputies, 14 Socialist senators, 29 Social Republican members of the Chamber of Deputies, and a large number of Radical Socialist members of the Chamber of Deputies have all opposed Lebrun's participation in the general election again. Lebrun's expression today shows that he has disregarded this opposition and agreed to participate in the general election.

### Belgian Parliamentary Elections

[Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 3rd] Belgium elected members of parliament yesterday. It is reported that officials will not formally announce the results until this afternoon or tomorrow morning.

[Haitong News Agency, Belgian Capital, 5th] The final results of the Belgian parliamentary elections are announced as follows: Catholic Party 73 seats (10 more than before), Social Democratic Party 60 seats (6 fewer than before), Liberal Party 33 seats (10 more than before), Flemish Nationalist Party 17 seats (1 fewer than before), Communist Party 9 seats (no change), Royalist Party 4 seats (16 fewer than before), Independent 1 seat, Army Representative 1 seat.

### Hitler's Speech: British Reaction

Does Not Increase British Concerns

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The "Weekly Review" criticized Hitler's speech, saying, "Hitler's words are enough to confuse us, but they will not increase our worries." These two sentences can represent the reaction of ordinary British people to Hitler's speech. The "Weekly Review" welcomed the fact that Hitler did not dare to abandon the Anglo-German naval agreement and did not issue激烈詞句. At the same time, other newspapers have译异 the fact that Hitler's speech this time was more restrained. One "People's Daily" said, "He who knows no threat is wildly咆哮, he who knows no danger of being attacked盛言 the need for people to prepare for war. However, there has never been anyone who can revive his country and 甘以一時之魯莽败一生之功業." Bassata wrote in "Weekly," saying that Hitler's speech was a weak response to Chamberlain. The speech seemed to be specifically for the country, and the words made informed people laugh. As for the 指責提之缺乏平衡, it is only enough to deceive a generation of German youth who consider Hitler as a god. "" 近期快戰 "" Said the speech was indeed restrained and had a special迷惑之空氣.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The "Sunday Times" criticized Wilhelmshaven's speech, saying: "In yesterday's speech, Hitler wanly denied that he had threatened anyone, and what he asked for was not to be interfered by others. In this regard, we sincerely hope that Hitler will first abide by it and not interfere with others. In yesterday's speech, we failed to find anything to encourage or dispel any concerns. The only hope for maintaining peace still lies in cooperation rather than isolation. If they are opposed, the strength of peace-loving countries is still the greatest."

London Pays Attention to the Military Section

[Reuters, London, 2nd] London paid close attention to the section of Hitler's speech yesterday in Wilhelmshaven that mentioned British and German armaments. A detailed translation of the section of the speech is as follows: "Germany does not want to attack other countries indiscriminately. What we hope for is to expand our economic relations. We have this right. We do not want to accept the instructions of any politician in Europe or outside Europe. We are indeed reorganizing our armaments, but if other countries do not interfere with us, we do not want to attack other countries. Germany will never be suppressed by policies of intimidation or encirclement. I have signed a naval treaty with Britain. The signing of this treaty is based on our ardent desire to never fight with Britain. If Britain no longer has this desire, then the actual premise of the treaty no longer exists. Germany is very willing to tolerate this idea. We are fully confident, because we are already so strong and united. Those who have no strength will lose their right to exist. When people in other countries are now talking about expanding their armies and saying that their military expansion will never end, then I can only frankly tell those politicians that their words are not enough to bother me. I am determined to continue to advance on this path of military expansion, and I firmly believe that our military expansion will be faster than other countries. If anyone wants to compare strength with us, then the German people are always ready to deal with it. I am prepared, and I am determined."

### Revising the Speech, Focusing on Britain

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Well-informed sources in Germany believe that Hitler's speech in Chexim Severn Harbor was specifically a peace speech with an attached warning to Britain. One commentator said that Hitler had declared his love of peace but at the same time warned against Chamberlain's continued encirclement policy. The commentator said, "We absolutely do not believe that this policy has any self-defensive nature. We can almost daily find examples of attempts to undermine our peaceful activities" to hinder Germany's development, the Romanian agreement signing is one example. We are prepared to realize peace, but we are absolutely dissatisfied with the encirclement policy. We cannot continue to sink like this until the item, and then think about ways to get out. The newspapers also paid attention to the danger of the "sentence garden policy" and stated that Hitler had given Britain time to carefully consider.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Officials have recently decided not to widely broadcast Hitler's speech because it could not attract a large audience at the time, so it was only recorded and broadcast again during people's meal times. It is said that the sudden interruption of the shortwave transmission to the United States was due to a mechanical failure. According to non-official opinions, Hitler's original speech was broader and more specifically addressed the United States, but after Chamberlain's speech in the British House of Commons, the entire speech was revised to focus on Britain. Therefore, the special interest in the United States no longer existed, and it was finally decided not to broadcast to the United States. Hitler is still on the "Robert Thoral" ship and is said to land in Hamburg tomorrow afternoon. In addition, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels has recently arrived in Bauders and will spend two weeks there.

### French Air Minister Arrives in Britain to Discuss Aircraft Manufacturing Procedures; British Chief of Staff Returns to London to Report on Talks in France

[Haitong News Agency, London, 2nd] British Chief of Staff Goddard, after inspecting French fortresses and defenses, returned here yesterday with his entourage. It is said that Goddard will visit Prime Minister Chamberlain and Land Minister 倍立夏 for discussions and will report on the Maginot Line and his talks with General 甘末林, Commander-in-Chief of the Continued Army. It is believed that French Air Minister Shangbaier arrived in London today, which is related to the aircraft manufacturing procedures of Britain and France. The goal is to achieve a balance with the German air force in the shortest possible time.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] French Air Minister Shangbaier will arrive here tomorrow evening to have two days of talks with British Air Minister Wooda. Among those who came to Britain with Shang are also technical experts. Therefore, the content of the talks is mostly still on technical issues and not on staff matters.

Short Commentary

### Japan × Yielded!

3rd Reuters News Agency, the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute has been completely resolved. The two countries have signed a fishing agreement for a term of one year. The establishment of this Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement is noteworthy in three aspects:

First, it shows that Japan × has completely yielded to the Soviet Union. Because Japan × originally wanted to . The original fishing agreement continued to be in effect. However, this new agreement forced Japan × to give up thirty fishing zones, and the Soviet Union designated ten additional zones for military reasons. Moreover, Japan must pay an additional percentage of the rent tax. In the past, the Japanese side claimed that it would not hesitate to fight if it failed to extend the fishing agreement. Now, the act of kneeling down has been staged.

Second, it proves the success of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, which not only forced Japan × to submit but also made the world recognize Japan ×'s outwardly fierce but inwardly weak ugly state!

Third, it proves that since the disastrous defeat in the Zhangguxiong campaign, Japan × has indeed lacked the courage to attack the Soviet Union. On the one hand, it can be seen that Japan × cannot simultaneously wage war against China and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, we must be careful that the Japanese will inevitably try their best to "subdue" China first. We must be wary of their military adventures, political divisions, and diplomatic inducement schemes!

### The Conspiracy of the Puppet Central Government

The conspiracy of ×× traitors for peace, compromise, and the organization of a puppet Central British government exists with the domestic and military predicament of × people and has developed as an example. As the political, military, and diplomatic difficulties of × increase, this conspiracy becomes more and more intense. These days, the air of peace and compromise is followed by the re-emergence of the puppet Central Government conspiracy.

According to a Shanghai telegram from Haitong News Agency, "× People's traitor Liu is paying close attention to Wang Jingwei's statement of "giving an example" to reserve his personal right to negotiate directly with Japan. However, Wang Jingwei's statement coincides with the time when the British Ambassador to Japan is about to come to Shanghai to meet with the Chinese Ambassador. This is especially the intention of ×. On the other hand, the puppet governments in Beiping and Nanjing are hoping that the war can end as soon as possible. It is rumored that the two puppet governments have suggested the establishment of a new puppet central government with Wang as the prime minister." This news has partially revealed the recent political plans of ×.

The facts are very clear. We can only win by insisting on unity and resisting the war. × people use anti-communism and peace to undermine our unity and prevent our resistance. We can only have the poorest victory by sincerely supporting the leader and supporting the central government. × people use all means to provoke dissent and attempt to create a puppet central government to destroy our country. The activities of the puppet governments in the north and south and the activities of Wang Jingwei are precisely part of the × people's plan.

For the independence of the country and the liberation of the nation, we must not only insist on unity and resist the war and support the leader and the government, but also resolutely oppose any peace compromise and international mediation, and we must also do our best to combat any traitor puppet regime in order to defeat × people and win the final victory!

### × Ships are Getting Fiercer; They Broke into ×× Abusively; After a Cargo Ship in Nanwan Was Robbed, It Was Taken to Guangzhou with More Than 20 People on Board; Two Fishing Boats in Gaosha Were Sunk by × Artillery Fire and Dozens of Boatmen Died

Violent × disregards international law and has been constantly sending large groups of armed wheel ships to search and loot civilian ships along the coast for the past ten days. Yesterday, a cargo boat, whose ship administration was registered in Hong Kong, was robbed by × in the ×××× sea area, and then the ship was taken away. Dozens of boatmen were not spared. After the boatmen were taken away, they were sent to Guangzhou to fill the lost jobs. Yesterday, there were people who escaped back to this port and reported to the police station. On the 31st of last month, in the Gaosha sea area of Xiangzhou, another tragic incident occurred in which two fishing boats were sunk by × artillery fire, and dozens of people on board died under the bullets. The process of the two tragic events is listed below.

×××× Robbery and Looting

According to Zeng Xiangsheng (31 years old), the owner of the ship who suffered in the ×××× sea area, who returned to Hong Kong to report, his ship was registered in Hong Kong, and the number was T-124. The work he was engaged in was the transportation of goods. On the 12th of last month, at the request of the cargo customers in Hong Kong, the ship was fully loaded with goods (worth about 3,000 yuan) and anchored in the ×××× sea area. Just as it was about to continue sailing, a × ferry boat came from Donggulang and broke into ××. When approaching the cargo boat, more than a dozen × soldiers jumped onto the cargo boat, immediately exposed their weapons and subdued everyone, and ordered a sailor to point a gun at the helmsman, forcing him to drive the ship out of the Chinese boundary, Linxi Ferry, and anchor for a week. × then dragged it to Guangzhou, drove more than 20 people on board ashore, and forced them to work as fast workers. Zeng Xiangsheng took the opportunity to escape when × soldiers were lax in their defense. He returned to this port yesterday to report to the office. The × soldiers broke into ×××× this time and wantonly searched and looted civilian ships, which is really disregarding international law.

Dozens of Boatmen Died in the Sea

According to the report received by the Fishermen's Association, on the 31st of last month, more than a dozen fishing boats were fishing in the Gaosha sea area. While they were engaged in fishing, a × warship came from Gulang. They feared that it was not a good sign, so they fled in a panic. Unexpectedly, the × warship was a hundred feet away and suddenly fired dozens of artillery shells at the fishing boat. Two of them could not avoid it and were sacrificed under the × bullets. They sank immediately in response to the sound. Dozens of people on board died in the sea. Their cruel actions are really infuriating. They were fortunate to have quickly avoided along the coast, otherwise it would have been difficult to escape.

What better way to arouse children's interest, encourage children to move upward, and truly make children the masters of the country and the nation in the future than to give children picture books and guide children to read children's publications?

If he is an enlightened parent or elder, he will understand that giving children good food and good clothes, "loving them and feeding them"; the only way to choose children with children's books and newspapers is the best way.

Today is the most joyous Children's Day for children. Adults are as usual to celebrate the birthday of the little masters. However, the problem is immediately in front of us:

Let's watch a movie. Poisonous movies should not be shown to innocent children. Candies and toys. Thinking of the miserable pictures of refugee children, those with a little conscience will definitely feel that they must save money. Books and newspapers. The serial pictures of flying signatures and walls are of course poison, and even those "speaking ancient words" and "speaking adult words" books in the bookstore are not spiritual food that children need after all. Then, what else will we do for the children on Children's Day besides taking them to the commemorative meeting and telling some patriotic stories?

If you are giving a gift to children with great consideration, for the sake of frugality, and the children miss this day in vain, needless to say, the children will be very disappointed. If he or she is obedient, he or she will definitely ask adults and elders: "Protecting children! This is a lie! May I ask what benefits do you give us children?"

The problem is in front of the caring parents and elders, how can it be solved well?

Taking children to the bookstore to buy beneficial children's books is certainly a way. In addition, there is another good news that readers will be excited to hear.

The fact is this:

The Shanghai Daily publishes a "Children's Weekly" every Sunday specifically for children. It has been published for four years now and is still continuing. Because the writers are all well-known children's literature writers in China, the newspaper has become a rare children's publication in China. Enlightened parents and teachers all use the Children's Weekly of the Shanghai Daily as the spiritual food for their children or students. To facilitate readers' requests, it has also been compiled into a "Children's Friend" hardcover edition. It has long become a famous children's publication. In order to improve the level of children's literature in Hong Kong and encourage children to pay attention to extracurricular reading, this newspaper specially brought a large number of "Selected Compilations of the Shenbao Children's Special Issue: Children's Friend 1" from this newspaper in Shanghai. At the same time, in order to commemorate Children's Day, we will give another 50% discount on the lowest price. The first collection is sold for HK$0.20, the second collection is sold for HK$0.20, and the third collection is sold for HK$0.10. —This is only part of the recovery of printing costs.

The materials, words, and pictures of Xu Shu are all excellent children's publications from the perspective of children-oriented education. The content includes: Children's Forum, Children's Science, Labor, Common Sense, Anecdotes of Celebrities, Civic Training, Poetry, Pictures, Children's Literature, Tong Gu Stories, Recreation, Life Knowledge, Boy Scout Sleeves, Children's Creations, etc. Each collection reaches about 400 yuan in 16-mo format, and the text capacity reaches more than 100,000 words in each collection. It can be used as a reference book for teachers, as a supplementary teaching material, and also as an extracurricular reading material. It is truly a "Friend of Children" in the true sense of the word. If you spend a dime or two to buy a copy for your children, your hopes for your children, whether they are patriotic, scientific, self-cultivation, literary... will definitely embark on a bright ancestral path from now on. This is the gift of this newspaper to commemorate the Children's Day. In order to improve the level of children's literature in Hong Kong and make our next generation grow up healthily, I sincerely hope that enlightened parents and teachers will immediately use this newspaper's "Children's Friend" as a gift for children on Children's Day.

### A Gale Devastates Hong Kong; Many Boats Capsized; Many Men and Women Fell into the Sea but Were Rescued; Material Losses Amounted to More Than 9,000 Yuan

At 1:00 pm yesterday, a gale suddenly rose in this port, and the momentum was very strong. Many boats and boats on the sea, large and small, capsized due to the suddenness of the gale. Many men and women fell into the sea, but they were all rescued fortunately. The total material loss was as high as 9,477 yuan.

Gale Rises Suddenly; Boats Capsize and People Drown

It is found that six people, including Suo Fei, Bi Da Peter, Li An Saileiqi, Mi Duodun, and women Zha Feilisi, all Western employees of China Power Company, were driving the sailing ship "Adam Ma" before the gale and passing through the sea surface of Angshipu Island. Suddenly, a hurricane suddenly rose. Before they could unload, it was blown sideways by the wind. Then, another gust of wind blew it down. The men and women all fell into the sea. Fortunately, they all knew how to swim and swam to the side of the capsized ship. Together, they managed to right the 30 planks. At that time, the wind and waves were strong, and the situation was very dangerous. They waited on the boat for rescue. At half past one, a Guang'an small transport ship passed by, and they shouted loudly. The small wheel heard the sound and drove forward to rescue the six people onto the wheel. Fortunately, there were no injuries. Only Mr. Suo Fei lost 25 yuan.

The Number of Boats in Distress Reached Nine

On the same day, a total of nine boats and boats encountered danger due to the wind and reported to the Ship Administration Department and the Marine Police Department afterwards. It is said that the woman Zhang Rongmiao's boat was moored in Xudi Street, opposite the sea, and was blown down by the wind. 37 dan of scrap iron on board fell into the sea, worth 800 yuan, and another back boat, 400 yuan. The woman Zhou San's boat was also blown down while moored in the nearby sea, losing 400 bags of rice, worth 4,000 yuan. Another boat lost 300 bags of rice, worth 2,700 yuan. 17 thin pieces of paper were all soaked in water, losing 1,700 yuan. Another three bags of paper sank into the sea, losing 300 yuan.

The Most Material Losses Were Rice

On the sea opposite Kennedy Town, there were three cargo boats carrying 2,200 bags of rice. When the wind rose, the boats were blown to the stone ridge. 300 bags of rice fell into the sea, losing 3,300 yuan. In the sea area of Tseung Kwan O, a certain cargo boat was carrying live pigs, piglets, mountain goods, etc. It was blown down by the wind. The people in the boat all fell into the sea and were almost drowned. Fortunately, they held on to the capsized boat and waited for four hours before a San Da Company steamship passed by and rescued everyone. The goods that were loaded have already been washed away. In addition, the man Zhou Guifa also went to the Marine Police Department to report that his cargo boat was blown down by the wind. The boat lost 300 yuan, and the goods lost 277 yuan.

### Lawsuit Lasting Over Two Months: Insurance Claim – Plaintiff Stops Proceedings, Willing to Settle Out of Court

The Qichang Foreign Firm was sued in the High Court by Changsheng Firm, represented by two prominent lawyers, Mr. Delay, Mr. Liao Yali, Mr. Ma Zida, and Mr. An De Chen, demanding compensation for the loss of a large consignment of seafood destroyed in a fire in January 1938. The goods were insured by the Qichang Firm. Two prominent barristers, Delay, Shao Liao, Yali, Ma Zida, and An De Chen, defended the case, submitting a plea for dismissal. The case had been heard more than ten times, lasting over two months. Yesterday morning, it was heard again by Assistant Judge Mackenzie. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Hugh Da, told the judge that the plaintiff no longer wished to continue the litigation and was willing to settle out of court with the defendant. However, the court fees should be borne by the defendant. The defendant's lawyer, Shao Liao Yali, said that he could not decide on the court fees until he had consulted with the defendant. Mr. Ma Zida continued that if the defendant had any objections to the court fees, they could be raised for discussion the next day. After hearing this, Judge Mackenzie declared the case closed, ending the civil lawsuit that had lasted over two months and set a record for the length of a civil lawsuit.

### Preparing for Public Performance: Hong Kong Government Staff Association's "Phoenix City" – Fundraising to Help Refugees

The Hong Kong Government Staff Association has always been at the forefront of various charitable causes. In the past, it has achieved remarkable results in purchasing bonds and donating to disaster relief. Now, taking advantage of the anniversary celebration, it is staging the four-act anti-Japanese war drama "Phoenix City," which will be performed in a theater soon. All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to help refugees. The play "Phoenix City" was written by playwright Wu Yeguang and published by the Life Bookstore. It depicts the stories of Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army leaders Ma Zhanshan, Miao Kexiu, Zhao Tong, etc., filled with grief, indignation, and stimulation, making it a worthy wake-up call for us. To increase fundraising income, the association has specially hired Li Chenfeng to serve as director, and Madam Tang Rong Kunyu (playing Miao Kexiu's wife, Xia Wanbing) and Madam Cen Qiu Sanniang Hu Baoyan, among others, are participating in the leading roles. The first preview was held at the association last night at eight o'clock, and the results were excellent.

### Hongyu Partridge Vegetable Store – Celebrating Children's Day

Special Refreshments and Toys Offered

The company has always been praised by the community for its dedication to children's health. In celebration of Children's Day today, the company is holding a grand celebration. The commemorative activities include children's toys and refreshments. Customers who purchase partridge vegetable worth more than two dimes will receive a children's toy as a gift and enjoy exquisite and hygienic refreshments.

It is reported that the case will be brought up for discussion at today's monthly meeting of the directors of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

### Save Our Children!

Talking About Hong Kong Children on Children's Day – Please Don't Forget the Poor Children in the Grand Celebration

The annual Children's Day arrives with the warm spring. On this day of great significance, we know that many happy children are holding grand celebrations, meetings, speeches, performances, and exchanging gifts, all full of joy and vitality. However, we must also know that besides this small group of happy children, there are countless unfortunate and poor children, struggling in small rooms, in factories, on street corners, under arcades, striving for survival, and living in terrible environments, experiencing misery and suffering. Moreover, their number is many times greater than that of the happy children. They are also the future masters of the country and the nation, and we cannot forget them in our grand commemoration.

I bring a group of children who would rather not speak because they are dirty to the readers, causing the readers to frown, turn their heads, sigh, and then talk about the children of the general middle and upper classes, which is already enough to make people sigh!

"Every inch of land is precious, and twenty or thirty people live on one floor. Under such an environment, the health of Hong Kong children has been fundamentally shaken. Let's see, how many children in middle-class families have their own room, or even their own bed? It is common for a mother and four or five children to share a bed, and for brothers to share a 'double bunk' and sisters to share a bed.

If living is like this, what about eating? It is probably not much better than living. The cost of living is so high, and the citizens have to pay rent that is already so high that it cannot be higher. In fact, the "adult" landlord can increase it at any time; they have to socialize, support the face of a small citizen; they have to wear beautiful clothes... Under heavy burden, are they still able to pay special attention to what the children eat? What the adults eat, the children eat, whether it is nutritious or not, who cares.

Cheap and inferior snacks sold on the streets have harmed countless of our children!

Clothes, except for the children of a few aristocratic families who are dressed a little beautifully, are generally very poor. It is rare to be able to be clean and decently dressed.

Going out? Heavens! How many children in Hong Kong are innocently injured or killed by cars on the road every year? We only know that "the road is like a tiger's mouth," but why do we let the "city tigers" roam around? Is it possible that people with cars, the servants of the car-owning class—the drivers—are special?

In addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, there is school. An ordinary residential building is mixed in with a 'residential school,' the blackboard is black, and the desks and chairs are black... In the dimness, forty or fifty children gather together and recite "The Master said..." and write "The Great Man Above..."

A small floor is a classroom, a playground... it is everything. Larger schools also only have a 'veranda' used as a ping-pong room and library, and a small open space as a playground. There are such magnificent and comfortable clubs, tea houses, and taverns in Hong Kong... but there are such dilapidated schools.

In such an environment, the life of our future masters, our little angels, ah! It's so pitiful! But please don't sigh yet, there is a large group that is even more pitiful and miserable than the ones mentioned above.

Boys and girls running early in the morning on the streets, shouting, "×× newspaper × newspaper..." Boys and girls near the markets—like Graham Street in Central, the market in Sheung Wan, the market in Wan Chai, the market in Sai Ying Pun, the market in Yau Ma Tei...—holding vegetables, scallions, garlic, melons... trying to sell them to people. They are all 'monkey-like' and 'vegetable-colored,' dressed in rags, and very dirty. Running around from morning to night, the most fortunate day, they earn no more than three or four dimes.

We all know, right! What they are doing is "illegal" because they have not obtained a license. The 'law-abiding' police can arrest and fine them at any time. There are many such cases, and a judge publicly discussed them not long ago.

What about the future masters and citizens who are used to living a "law-breaking" life? This is a serious social problem.

Those who share the same fate also include:

Shoe-shining children, they are boys aged fourteen or fifteen, six or seven, and even three or four, holding a "shoe-shining box" made of broken wooden clogs and old box boards, two boxes of shoe polish, an old bristle brush, and a few rags, squatting on the street to make a living.

It costs two cents to shine a pair of shoes. By shining twenty or thirty pairs a day, they could earn more than four dimes. However, there are too many people looking for a living like this. In Hong Kong and Kowloon combined, there are at least two thousand five hundred people. "There are more monks than porridge." Some people shine a pair of shoes for a penny, and many don't even earn a dime all day long!

At night, there are many girls in thin clothes, with pale faces and a small yellow braid, holding corsage flowers at the entrance of dance halls, trying to sell them to gentlemen who come to have fun. They are shivering in the north wind. Only a few lucky ones are pitied by a dancer who gives her a five-cent nickel for a corsage flower.

There are many little beggars, with dirty faces, snotty noses, bare buttocks, and bare feet, four or five years old, who can be seen at the entrance of every theater, restaurant, department store...

Late at night after twelve o'clock, in front of big hotels and dance halls, there are many such beggars doing somersaults on the ground, continuously all the way, rushing to ask for money from the honored guests... In the dirtiest and darkest corners of the city, there are more than one hundred thousand pitiful children living on the hunger line.

They are the future masters, no one can deny this. Why do we have the heart to let our future masters encounter such a pitiful life? Let Lu Xun tell us: —

'Save the children!'

### Work Report of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association

I. Establishment Process

Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the war zone has expanded daily, and wherever the enemy's iron hooves reached, homes were reduced to ruins. The orphans of our nation's defenders and the young children in the disaster areas were either killed by the Japanese invaders or died from hunger and cold. Furthermore, there were many displaced, armless, and legless individuals everywhere. Particularly tragic was the fact that many young and uneducated children were transported by the Japanese invaders to the rear areas to implement their insidious policy of "using Chinese to invade China."

Children are the lifeblood of the nation and the key to the prosperity of the people. To alleviate the burdens of our compatriots and eliminate the worries of our fighters, thereby achieving the goals of national resistance and reconstruction and fulfilling the aspirations for national revival, we must provide practical guarantees and comprehensive education for the millions of children trapped in the disaster areas.

Seeing this, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, President of the Association, initiated a nationwide movement to establish the Wartime Children's Welfare Association in Hankou, taking in over a dozen orphans and establishing branches in various provinces to facilitate rescue efforts nearby.

In April of last year, the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association received instructions from the General Association and immediately mobilized local women to start preparations. Three meetings were held over three weeks to draft the articles of association and write the declaration. On the afternoon of May 11th of last year, at 3:00 PM, the establishment was announced. Officers were elected in accordance with the articles of association, and tasks were divided among the groups. Prominent figures in society were appointed as honorary directors for consultation. The office was initially located at the Women's War Relief Association and was later moved to the Women's Comfort Association in November of last year.

Since its establishment half a year ago, thanks to the support of people from all walks of life, progress has been very smooth. As we compile and print the report on the Association's work and financial income and expenditures for the past six months, we will briefly describe its establishment process here.

II. Sources of Funding

Originally, an organization has two prerequisite questions when it begins: the first is the issue of location, and the second is the issue of start-up costs.

Regarding the previous question, the Women's War Relief Association borrowed a room for office use, which was considered resolved. Regarding the latter question, the Women's Comfort Association donated HK$200 as start-up funds, which was also considered resolved.

With these two prerequisite questions resolved, our organization can be said to have had some basic framework.

On May 19th, the Association's second standing committee meeting resolved to invite Dr. Mei Lanfang to volunteer to raise funds for the Association. He agreed to the request, and on the 28th and 29th of the same month, he performed a play to raise funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic help of people from all walks of life, more than 15,000 yuan was raised. At the same time, honorary directors were responsible for the expenses of five or more children, and directors were responsible for the expenses of one or more children. Letters were also sent to various community schools to sponsor the expenses of five or more children in the name of the organization. In addition, there were many private donations. As for donations of goods, there were also frequent occurrences every day. These are all sources of funding for the Association. The detailed figures for financial income and expenditure are reported separately by the Finance Committee, so I won't go into further detail here.

III. Establishment Process of the First Orphanage

The Association raised more than 10,000 yuan in charity funds, plus about 10,000 yuan in children's protection fees donated by directors and sponsoring organizations, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. So it began to set up the orphanage and looked for an address in early June of last year.

Initially, the Guangdong Provincial Government allocated a building of the Shenzhen Hotel, which was quite spacious and could accommodate more than 1,000 people. After the members of the "Economic Design" team went to see it twice, they all felt that the house was close to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where enemy aircraft frequently came and went. In addition, it had been in disrepair for a long time and was quite leaky. It was estimated that repairs would cost about 6,000 yuan. For safety and economic reasons, although the allocation was appreciated, it was ultimately not used. At the same time, enthusiastic people from all sides sent letters, willing to offer their ancestral halls or villas for free, or introducing their relatives' houses for use. However, either the transportation was inconvenient, or there were too many mosquitoes, so they were not borrowed. The Association is extremely grateful for the enthusiastic support of the people of Hong Kong.

Later, it was decided to borrow the Po Oi Hospital in Yuen Long. The hospital was originally run by gentlemen from Yuen Long, including Deng Boqiu, Cai Baozhu, Deng Weitang, Wu Hua, etc. Mr. Deng and others were always enthusiastic about charity work. This time, they generously agreed to let out the entire upstairs and downstairs living room of the hospital to the Association for use as the first orphanage, which is especially appreciated. A cleaning room was added next to the house, and it was officially opened in mid-July, with Ms. He Ailing appointed as the director to manage all the orphanage affairs.

The first orphanage accommodated a total of 83 children. In addition to a small number who were taken in in Hong Kong, most were sent by the Refugee Relief Association's Guangdong branch.

As for the personnel in the orphanage, they followed the General Association's purpose and used the most economical method to try to employ as few people as possible. In addition to a warden who managed hygiene affairs, other assistant nurses, teachers, general affairs personnel, and workers all performed multiple tasks. The only regret is that due to the limited space, many people could not be accommodated.

IV. Establishment Process of the Second Orphanage

Because the site of the first orphanage was small, accommodating more than 80 children already felt too crowded, and there were still many external requests for continued accommodation. Moreover, since the full-scale war of resistance began, the disaster areas have expanded daily. Since the hospital is in a safe area, it should accommodate more children. In addition, the Association's planned 500 people was only the first step in the work, so although the first hospital was established, the preparation for the second hospital could not be delayed.

Therefore, at the same time as the first hospital was established, the search for the site of the second hospital began. First, the government was requested to allocate 100,000 square feet of open space. The land bureau officials led the group to see more than a dozen open spaces in the New Territories for several days. In the end, the open spaces in the New Territories were all planting areas with many mosquitoes. The ancestral hall and empty houses closer to Kowloon were too small to accommodate many people.

In August of last year, Wuhan was under machine pressure and evacuated the population, and the General Association rescued thousands of refugees in the occupied city. At that time, for safety reasons, they were immediately sent to Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming and other inland areas. At the time, the refugees were already on their way, so the establishment of the second hospital was even more urgent, and the personnel sent to escort them totaled 350 people. When the General Association received the telegram, they immediately contacted all parties overnight to arrange for accommodation. Mr. Zhou Zhaowu, the chief executive of Tung Wah Hospital, accompanied the Association's staff to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department to request a solution. As a result, they agreed to lease Block B of the old National Hospital for the Association's use.

When the batch of refugees set off from Wuhan, they were escorted by 10 scouts and 4 staff members from Wuhan. When they passed through Guangzhou, the local Women's Comfort Association hosted them and dispatched scouts to escort them. They arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of September 9th of last year. However, it took several days to travel from Hankou to Guangzhou. The journey was already hard, and they had to take refuge in air raids along the way, going down to the army several times. As a result, a few of the weaker children became ill upon arrival in Hong Kong. The reception staff from the Association immediately sent them to the hospital for treatment and transported the other children to the Xian Shu College. Since there were so many children and they were old, and they all spoke northern languages, except for the escorts, all the nurses, teachers, and general affairs personnel were hired from the north to reduce the gap and prevent malpractice. However, it was difficult to find such talents in Hong Kong, so it took half a month for the hospital to establish its internal organization.

However, the old National Hospital was originally used by the Hong Kong government for the annual winter refugee shelter, and the maximum time it could be lent to the Association was only three months. Since the permanent address of the hospital had not yet been decided, it was agreed with the Hong Kong government to designate Diamond Hill near Kowloon as the site of the hospital. This matter was also agreed to by the Association's advisor, Hu Wenhu. Unexpectedly, the result of the negotiation was another disappointment because the government was going to reserve it for a dairy farm.

In December of last year, the Hong Kong government was unable to allocate Diamond Hill and agreed to lend a part of the newly built refugee camp in Ma Tau Chung, Kowloon, to the Association for use as the second hospital. However, this was also temporary, so it was decided to request the Hong Kong government to allocate the open space on the right side of the refugee camp, which was about 90,000 square feet, for self-construction. At the same time, honorary advisors of the Association, Luo Xuzhao, Luo Wenjin, and Zhou Shoushen, were asked to make strong contact with the Hong Kong government, and Mr. Situ Yongjue also assisted from the sidelines. Finally, at the end of December, the Legislative Council officially approved the loan for a period of three years and was allowed to be extended to nine years. This time, the Association was able to achieve such satisfactory results, which was naturally due to the enthusiasm of the advisors and the trust of the Hong Kong government in the Association. The Association should especially thank them.

V. Establishment Process of the Third Orphanage

After the fall of Guangzhou, the number of refugees in the New Territories increased sharply, and abandoned children were everywhere. The head nurse and staff of the first orphanage rescued them at any time and temporarily kept them in the first orphanage for care. At the same time, other charitable organizations also took back the abandoned children for care. At that time, the Hong Kong government believed that it was difficult to concentrate the power to take care of the children in separate groups, and it was difficult to complete the care, so it decided to hand over the batch of children to the Association for management. As a result of negotiations between Mrs. Situ Yongjue and Director He Ailing, the Hong Kong government lent a maternity ward of the old National Hospital for use as the third Ruan.

After the third Ruan was opened, the first Ruan transferred 10 newly and old accommodated infants, plus more than 70 children sent by charitable organizations.

From then on, the children accommodated in the first Ruan were between 2 and 6 years old, the second Ruan was designated for children between Xuesui and 14 years old, and the third Ruan was purely for infants. This made the work of each Ruan easier, and the manpower and financial resources could be more economical.

VI. Preparation Process for the Permanent Address

The addresses of the first, second, and third Ruan mentioned above were all obtained with the assistance of various parties. During this long-term war of resistance, the work of the Association was certainly not temporary. Everyone believed that the experience and effectiveness of running children's orphanages in the past made it necessary to exist and expand permanently. The Kowloon Ma Longtou oil-more than 10,000 feet of land previously granted by the Hong Kong government was indeed quite wide, but it was limited in time. This not only had no guarantee on future construction costs, but also had to be relocated after the expiration of the term, which was considered inappropriate. On the same day, it purchased a piece of land at the junction of Fanling and Sheung Shui, which required more than 30,000 feet and cost 14,000 yuan. It could accommodate 500 children. Now that the land has been purchased by Mr. Hu and donated to the Association for use as a construction orphanage, the first and most important problem that the Association considered before has been completely and satisfactorily resolved.

Mr. Hu has now handed over the construction affairs to the Yong An Tang office, which is planning the dormitory classrooms, medical room, library, gymnasium, workshop, farm, auditorium, science laboratory, bath room, toilet, etc. As soon as the survey is clear, it will soon be able to publish the report and call for workers to vote for construction. (In the future, when the construction is completed, our children will also raise a glass to Mr. Hu for his birthday.) Since the establishment of the Association for less than 11 months, it has accommodated more than 400 children and borrowed 3 orphanage sites, all of which have received the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. As for the Association's permanent address this time, it is entirely due to Mr. Hu Wenhu's generous donation. On the occasion of the Association's work report, the 400 orphans would like to thank all the sponsors!

### Commemorating Children's Day and Developing Children's Work

— Liu Qingxuan

As the war lengthens and the war zones expand, the cruel devastation suffered by Chinese children increases daily. Therefore, rescuing war orphans and protecting children are crucial tasks for upholding a sustained war of resistance.

Children are the future generations of our nation. They are a force for fighting the war to the end and striving for final victory, and they are the capital for building a new country. Since the start of the war of resistance, to protect future generations and rescue war orphans in the war zones, we have organized the China Children's Protection Association and the Wartime Children's Relief Association, establishing branches in various regions. This is an important step in coordination with upholding the war of resistance. Simultaneously, to organize the strength of children, children's organizations have been established in various regions.

However, up to now, our work in rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children's propaganda is far behind objective needs and has not yet exerted the effectiveness it should. Today, as we celebrate Chinese Children's Day, we should conduct a review to serve as a basis for our future improvements and enrichment.

First, we should point out that the reason children's work has not exerted its due effectiveness and cannot meet the demands of the war of resistance is based on the fact that the mobilization of the entire nation has not yet met the needs of the war of resistance. However, the lack of effort on the part of children's workers is a significant problem.

Second, rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children require a comprehensive plan to achieve significant results. Currently, we lack a comprehensive plan, so the work remains superficial and has not been expanded or deepened.

Third, rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children are integral parts of active war resistance work. However, some colleagues only treat it as passive relief and neglect its active significance, thus failing to improve work efficiency.

These are just some of the shortcomings I personally feel. In the future, we should promote work such as rescuing, protecting, and organizing children in a planned manner, improve work efficiency, and break incorrect perceptions of children's work. Only in this way can the work of rescuing, protecting, and organizing children exert its due effectiveness.

Although Hong Kong is located outside the front lines, due to its geographical relationship, it is close to the mainland's zone of war. Therefore, effectively carrying out the work of rescuing war orphans and protecting children is the responsibility of every compatriot living abroad. We must not only uphold a sustained war of resistance and leverage the vast land and abundant resources of our Chinese nation, but also do everything possible to rescue and protect the second generation of our nation, cultivate the nation's vitality, and serve as capital for war resistance and national construction.

Today, as we celebrate Children's Day, we should take on the responsibility of rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and further organizing children with a fighting spirit, so that children in the war zones can be rescued. At the same time, we appeal to peace-loving people around the world to ××××××××××× and assist Chinese children in distress. This is a task that we, as compatriots living outside the front lines, must urgently carry out!

### How to Spend This Year's Children's Day

— Fan Zheng

This is a work by a young member of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, who recently arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland. He is only thirteen years old this year and was originally a member of the Xin'an Traveling Troupe. After the war of resistance, he traveled to various places in the mainland and made significant contributions to the work of salvation propaganda. In this short article, we can see how Chinese children are growing up amidst the flames of war and how they, like adults, are doing their best to dedicate themselves to the struggle for national liberation! — The Editor

How joyful and meaningful it is to celebrate our own festival during the war of resistance!

"Children's Day" is our own festival for us children. We should think of ways to make this festival very meaningful.

Recalling past Children's Days, they were meaningless. We would just hold a meeting, listen to the lectures of the adults, shout a few slogans ourselves, and then the school would buy some sweets, towels, etc., to distribute to everyone for fun, as if that was how these "little masters" were celebrating the festival—we feel that such celebrations are meaningless to us?

If we want to have a happy Children's Day, we must do it ourselves and contribute our own small strength.

Now, the children in the interior are celebrating Children's Day on their own. They have their own groups, and there are also general children's organizations. When they have work to do, representatives from many groups meet to discuss plans and arrange work.

Take Guilin in Guangxi, for example (I just came out of the Xin'an Traveling Troupe, a children's organization in Guilin, to join the China Salvation Drama Troupe). There are seven children's groups there. They have a symposium to discuss how to carry out work. This time, to celebrate Children's Day, they must do a great job.

They have their own people as chairpersons, performing dramas and singing, creating street bulletins, and cartoons, … doing work. They don't want any sweets, but the work they do is sweeter than sweets!

In a big city like Hong Kong, apart from schools, there are very few children's groups. If the children in the mainland knew about this, they would definitely laugh; of course, there are special difficulties. But we must overcome all difficulties and bring out our own strength.

Dear children, Hong Kong seems to be lifeless. Some compatriots are still living in a drunken dream. They don't care about the war of resistance at all. Some even advocate peace like Wang Jingwei—we children must become small alarm clocks to wake up these people in their dreams!

To commemorate Children's Day, we must organize ourselves and become small soldiers of the Chinese nation, competing with the children in the mainland who are doing salvation work to see who does better. - On the eve of Children's Day by the China Salvation Drama Troupe.

### Starting with "Night-Shining Cup"

— Li Qinian

We all know that Cantonese films, due to talent and financial constraints, inevitably tend to be somewhat careless in terms of technology. However, this carelessness leads to increased disappointment among viewers with higher standards. As a result, some company owners believe that serious viewers do not watch Cantonese films. This leads to even more careless efforts to cater to the tastes of low-level viewers, resulting in numerous deviations. Consequently, they are criticized and rejected by public opinion and society, and some even believe that Cantonese films are being used by × people to numb viewers. I believe both of these points contain considerable errors: On the part of the company owners, they do not know to raise the standards of Cantonese films to attract serious viewers, and instead, they make careless films to cater to careless viewers. This is a major mistake that everyone knows. On the part of public opinion, they adopt a critical or dismissive attitude because Cantonese films are of low quality, refusing to discuss them at all. This is not a good strategy either. To expand propaganda among the broad masses and to correct the decline of Cantonese films, I believe that public opinion should offer more criticism of Cantonese films, praising what is good and directly pointing out what is bad. We must turn carelessness into seriousness, so that Cantonese films can fulfill their important cultural propaganda role in this war of resistance!

I am filming "Night-Shining Cup." This is truly considered a fortunate event. When last year, everyone was competing to make films based on folk tales, I was still a long-term actor at Nanyang Company. I was truly afraid of being caught up in this whirlpool. Fortunately, the owner of Nanyang Company treated me well, understanding my personality and knowing my reluctance towards those meaningless popular scripts. Therefore, he chose this famous national defense script, "Night-Shining Cup," for me to film. This is a good attempt. Although I dare not say what kind of harvest I have gained from this film, I always feel that my emotions are consistent with the characters in the play, without the drawback of stiffness. After filming, Director Gao Lihong gave me a copy of Mr. Jing's original book "Night-Shining Cup," and wrote a few words: "In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, I collaborated with Ms. Nian to produce this film. Due to Ms. Shi's efforts, we achieved unexpected success. I hereby express my gratitude." Indeed, when I was filming this film, on the one hand, I was doing my best for the responsibility of my profession, and on the other hand, I always believed that the way for us film people to serve the country lies in filming meaningful films. If I can portray the inner world of the characters in the play one by one, so that I can touch the hearts of the public, then it will be of small help to the propaganda for the war of resistance and national construction. When filming "Night-Shining Cup," I often thought like this in my heart. Therefore, as Mr. Gao said, I did put in effort, and it was what I should do, but I dare not accept what he said about "success."

In "Night-Shining Cup," from beginning to end, I was very satisfied. Therefore, I once wrote a small essay saying that if we could avoid inspection and cutting, then this film would not fail in any way. However, after it was released, I watched it. I really had a bit of a headache. Many important parts were all gone. What is the reason for this? Please think about it, viewers! I know that many viewers who do not understand the content must be very surprised and think that the editing of this film is so poor. But they do not know that the reason for this is another reason!

In the past, some stage plays have failed when they were brought to the screen. We believe that this cannot be blamed on the script. I always believe that this "Night-Shining Cup," which has a very strong sense of national defense, is unsatisfactory only because it was cut too much and messed up.

I believe that national defense films are not incapable of attracting viewers. As long as we strictly review ourselves, put more effort into filming, expand the propaganda of this sense of responsibility and create a movement, so that serious viewers pay attention to it and believe that Cantonese films can also occupy a position in terms of artistic standards, then the atmosphere will naturally change. Business opportunities will also come.

### Yesterday's Tennis Match Baojia Liu Found Life from a Dead End The Potential Defeat Suddenly Revived and Won the Victory Da vs Xiaolin Zhen Xiaolin Postponed Due to Illness

The Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament, there was originally a single game that attracted attention yesterday. It was expected that Xiaolin Zhen was ill and requested a postponement. Xu Weipei, the opponent, rested for one day. The scene of Li Guangjun vs He Jialiu, there was some head. In the first game, Li tried his best to fight and easily won He. In the second game, He used softness to control and endurance to cope, and tied the game with a score of seven to five. In the last game, Li exerted his strength too early and lacked stamina. He was put in the palm of his hand by He, and won the final victory with a score of three, and bid farewell to the slaves. Gao Shannu and Lei Miti, a pair of doubles, had good luck, and repeatedly encountered weak players. Yesterday, they defeated Ji Li and Bin, a pair, with two consecutive victories of nine to seven and six to four.

The battle between He and Li was extremely tense, because both of them were experienced, so the battle was very spectacular. Li's short attack was very pertinent, and he was able to hit left and right, intercept and save dangerous balls, and he also had his own unique skills. He was down-to-earth and steady, and he was slightly better than Li in strength. Intercepting and long shots often made Li run to block. However, Li played extremely hard, but unfortunately he often missed the net, and intercepting and slashing balls often fell into a desperate situation. He then reversed the defeat with a tie, and won with a score of two to one.

At the beginning of the battle between the two sides, Li dismounted and exerted his power, and immediately used left and right strokes, which he often took advantage of, and lost with a score of one to six first. In the second game, he took advantage of the victory and once took the lead with a score of 4 to 1. At this point, He was aroused his ambition, and in order to save the difficulty, he desperately fought back, slashing and attacking, and also tried his best to hold on. Li was only caught by the vigor of the whole spirit, and caught up head-on. In the fierce battle to the score of four to five, He first made short contact, and then took advantage of the fierce attack. Li did not know his intention, so he was taken advantage of and turned the score back to seven to six. The turning point was also in this.

In the second final, Li's strength gradually weakened, and he lacked stamina. He often needed flaws. He was happy and happy, and split three levels with force. Li Guangjun was in a desperate situation when he greeted the interception, so He won the first game with a score of six to three.

Yesterday's results (single) Xu Weipei vs Xiaolin Zhen (postponed) Ci Jialiu wins Li Guangjun one to six, seven to five, six to three, Tan Lianchen wins Hou Huo (forfeit)

### Desiring a Champion's Position, South China B Must Win: Today's Match Against Scots at So Kon Po Field. Later at 5 PM, South China A Also Plays Scots

[Our Correspondent] Today's football league features a South China brothers double-header against Scots, with the B team playing at 3:30 PM and the A team at 5 PM, both at So Kon Po Field.

The outcome of the A team match is no longer of great importance, but it will proceed as scheduled. If South China A fields its full strength, they should be able to win and complete their final match.

In the B team match, Scots is already lagging behind in points, so the result is not crucial for them. However, this is not the case for South China. They see this match as a championship final. If they win, they will reclaim the B team championship, which has been absent from our team for many years. If they unfortunately lose, even second place will be out of reach. Even a draw and the loss of a point would put them equal in points with the 5th Battalion Royal Artillery and the Middlesex Regiment, requiring a play-off to determine the champion and runner-up. In short, South China must win today. The latest standings of the top three teams are listed below. (Hu Feng)

Shen Bao Children's Day Special Issue

### From Children's Day to the Children's Welfare Association

— Wang Xiaoying

What is Children's Day? Simply put, it's a day of commemoration for deeply protecting children. Why do children need protection? Because children are the future masters of the nation and the reserve force for national liberation. Didn't the philosopher Laplato say, "As are the people, so is the nation"? Meaning, "To have a better nation, we must first have better citizens." We know that today's citizens grew from yesterday's children, and we also know that tomorrow's citizens are nurtured and shaped from today's children. So, if we want to know what tomorrow's citizens will be like, we only need to look at how they are being cultivated now, which is to say, how they are being nurtured. This is very clear.

In the past, the responsibility for nurturing children rested primarily on the shoulders of mothers. However, what mothers provide is family education, a part of education that is completely different from the socialized nature of child welfare. It's even more different from the nature of welfare during wartime. Therefore, socialized welfare and militarized welfare involve gathering a large number of children in one place, without distinction. They are given strict social and military education, which, in addition to intellectual development, emphasizes spiritual education and physical training. This cultivates healthy citizens and lays the foundation for national revival. Because a "healthy citizen" refers to all adult people of a nation, to win the final victory of the nation and build a free and happy country, all citizens must unite and fight with blood and flesh. This kind of national struggle cannot be achieved by a small number of people, nor can it be achieved by ordinary education. Therefore, the socialized and militarized education that we need now requires all women to share this responsibility.

For these young masters of the nation and the reserve force for national liberation, we should not only love them, but also enlighten their national consciousness and instill anti-Japanese war education, so that they have the ability to shoulder the task of defending the nation and reviving the nation. Therefore, our method of caring is called "welfare."

Since the start of the anti-Japanese war, I have traveled from the war zone through many difficulties to Hong Kong. I believe that since our uncles and brothers have all gone to the front lines to fight, our aunts and sisters, even if they don't have the strength to carry guns, should also shoulder the important responsibility of caring for children in the rear. Moreover, since the beginning of the all-out war of resistance, wherever I have gone, I have seen the orphans of soldiers who died for their country and the young children trapped in disaster areas. The number of children who have * * * * * * * * * * and died from epidemics or starvation is unknown. And the children who are missing arms and legs and are displaced can be seen everywhere. Especially terrible is that the * are actively using the vicious strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese," * * * * * * * * *, * * * *, providing them with enslaved education, so that the * who will attack our great Chinese nation in the future are actually a group of children who we consider to be the most beloved and pitiful today. When I think of this, I cannot help but shed tears. Therefore, as soon as I unpacked my luggage, I quickly joined this work of caring for children.

In essence, women and children are inseparable, like links in a chain. Children cannot receive the loving and considerate care they need if they are separated from women. And women cannot participate in social work if they are not liberated from the family. Therefore, to enable half of the nation's women to participate in the work of national salvation, we must liberate them from the shackles of the family. The purpose of the Wartime Children's Welfare Association that we have established is to have a small number of women take on the work of caring for children, so that the majority of women can organize independently and stand on their own. The orphans of soldiers fighting in the war, the children from the war zone, and the children of refugees whose parents died in the *'s artillery fire and whose children are wandering the streets are all our urgent tasks and the responsibility of the Wartime Children's Welfare Association. To date, we have indeed achieved some results in our work, but there is still much more to be done. Moreover, the war zone is expanding, and there are hundreds of thousands of afflicted children. It is impossible for * Welfare Association alone to shoulder this important responsibility. Therefore, we not only hope to enrich the quality of existing education, but we also want to expand its quantity. We not only hope for the enthusiastic support of society, but we also hope that women in Hong Kong will put aside their entertainment and participate in the work of protecting wartime children, protecting the future masters of the nation.

Recently, a priest in the New World named Flanagan founded a Boys Town, specializing in educating homeless children. He not only provides them with food and shelter, but also educates and molds their character. His goal is to reduce the number of vagrants in society and increase the number of good citizens—good citizens. This Boys Town can serve as a mirror for us. Today is Children's Day. I am ashamed of my lack of talent and have nothing to offer, so I encourage myself with this and also encourage my sisters!

### A Humble Plea to Our Overseas Compatriots!

— Wu Yanzhuang

—Written in Commemoration of the April 4th Children's Day—

I remember that on the day the China Wartime Children's Association was established in Hankou last year, Madame Chiang said, "Children's welfare is by no means an ordinary and commonplace task, but a fundamental task that is closely related to the nation and the people. Children are the future citizens and the seedlings of the nation. In peacetime, they should already be loved very much, let alone in wartime, when a large number of national soldiers are sacrificing themselves. If we do not cultivate children well, how can we make up for the losses to the nation?"

Today, the anti-Japanese war has entered its second stage, a most critical moment for the survival of the nation, and it is also in the midst of the prelude to the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction and revival. With excited and enthusiastic hearts, and with the indomitable will to sacrifice the individual and jointly face the nation's difficulties, we commemorate Children's Day. We cannot help but think of the brave soldiers at the front who are loyally fighting and shedding blood on the battlefield. We cannot help but express our spirit of loving the country and caring for children thoroughly in our work and careers as a commemorative offering.

Since the International Child Welfare Association convened its first conference in Geneva in August 1925 and adopted the basic principles for protecting children, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States decided to designate one day each year as a day to commemorate children. In our country, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the China Child Welfare Association suggested that the National Government issue a decree designating April 4th as Children's Day. Since then, there has been a warm commemoration throughout the country every year.

We know that how to develop children's innate abilities, how to transform children's environment, and how to promote children's physical fitness are the most important and urgent matters for modern civilized countries. In particular, in today's harsh environment of foreign aggression, we can more deeply appreciate that our children are not only the continuation of our lives, but also the continuation of the life of the nation. Sun Yat-sen also said, "Our youth are our continuing life." We keep the Premier's last words in mind and feel even more strongly the importance of our responsibility. We should redouble our efforts in child welfare work, and this is the true meaning of commemoration.

Everyone knows the tragic plight of our refugee children during the difficult process of these twenty months of the anti-Japanese war; everyone knows the efforts and hard work of our government in rescuing children in the war zone; and everyone also knows the child welfare work that the Wartime Children's Association has done in the year since its establishment. But let us think, this war is a total confrontation between justice and fairness and violence and power, and it is also a total review of the manpower and material resources of our nation. To support the week's long anti-Japanese war, we need to fully protect our children. To complete our great task of building a new China, we need to fully protect our children!

The so-called "welfare" means that both "protection" and "nurturing" must be done together. The two are mutually causal and mutually supportive. "Protection" cannot be done without "nurturing," and vice versa. This is a natural cause and effect. However, it is futile to have only "protection" without "nurturing." To complete our work of "protection" and "nurturing," we must rely on a large amount of material support. This depends on the enthusiastic support of our compatriots at home and abroad.

Our overseas compatriots, residing in distant lands, care about their motherland. In the past, they have had a glorious history of supporting revolutionary work. This time, as we struggle for the freedom of the entire nation, our compatriots are enthusiastically dedicating their hard-earned savings and material resources to the country. This is worthy of respect from people across the country. In this short article, I will not bring up many specialized issues related to child welfare for research. I only wish to express my sincere feelings and plead with our overseas compatriots on behalf of the millions of refugee children in our war zone and to express my sincere gratitude. We look forward to more spiritual encouragement and material assistance. This is not only fortunate for our children, but also fortunate for the future of our nation!

### Commemorating Children's Day

— Hu Mulan

The Difficult Responsibility We Should Bear

Today is such a joyful and commemorative day, our Republic of China's Children's Day. Children are the foundation of a nation's survival and the future masters of the nation. The significance of commemorating Children's Day is truly great. Our country designated April 4th as Children's Day only in the 21st year of the Republic of China, at the request of the China Child Welfare Association, and the Ministry of Education formulated and promulgated commemorative measures. After the general order, commemorative activities were held every year on April 4th in primary schools, kindergartens, and social education institutions across the country, and Children's Day was born in China.

The purpose of commemorating Children's Day is to encourage children's interests, inspire children's love for groups, love for the country, and love for the family, and to arouse social attention to children's undertakings and welfare work. Society should stand in a position of actively supporting and maintaining it, so that children can obtain the greatest happiness. The government should try its best to expand children's welfare undertakings. This can be said to be a truism, which everyone knows, but in today's situation of * invasion and serious national crisis, the most urgent task for us to commemorate Children's Day is to relieve refugee children.

Our war of resistance has been going on for one year and nine months, and the occupied areas will reach half of the territory. Due to the vastness of the occupied areas, the number of compatriots who have been displaced has increased day by day. The number of lovely children who followed their parents to flee and were deprived of education or who were not taken care of is countless. We often see reports of * army * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * on the newspaper. Our children will become the reserve soldiers of * country, our children will become the foundation of * country's survival * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.

Therefore, today, when we commemorate Children's Day, the biggest and most important thing is to find ways to relieve refugee children. First, for children in the occupied areas, people should be sent immediately to try to rescue them as much as possible and move them to safe areas. In places close to the war zone, the families of soldiers on expeditions; Children without carers should also be transferred to safe areas first. Second, the rescued children should try their best to arrange them properly and give them appropriate education according to their age. Infants should pay attention to nursing, those of primary school age should be allowed to go to school, and those who are older should be allowed to learn production skills and receive military training. These examples are only a rough summary. Effective implementation must await detailed planning. However, we can say with certainty that this work is to seek happiness for children and also for the welfare of society and the country. It can also be said that rescuing a child in the war zone is tantamount to cultivating a new force for the country. The China Relief of Refugee Children Association was established in Hankou last year, and all the work is being actively promoted. Today, as we commemorate Children's Day, we see that the most urgent and important relief work for refugee children is already underway, which is indeed a most gratifying thing, but such an important work cannot be done by the government or a small number of people. It is possible to get things done; the various parties in the society must unanimously be responsible for participating in order to achieve a magnificent effect. I hope that my compatriots who are suspended in Hong Kong's young children's undertakings will pay attention to the tragic suffering of the war zone and share the responsibility of relieving refugee children with money and effort. To secure the happiness of * children. To develop the new life of the nation. This is what I pray for for the most beloved and greatest children in this year's commemoration of Children's Day.

### Save the Children

— Zhang Chunfeng

If it is said that the most pitiful people in the world are the Chinese, then the Chinese children are the most pitiful of the most pitiful. If it is said that half of China's entire population is children, then there may be more than 200 million of the most pitiful of the most pitiful children. But how many people care about the lives of children?

Napoleon, who once conquered a third of the world, also left behind these words about children: "The fate of children is in the hands of their mothers." It is a pity that the mothers in China have never received the treatment of human beings in the world before. Can the little things in the hands of slaves be called free and happy people?

The Western world seems to be more civilized than the East. So the Western children seem to be happier. For example, Busey Dong said: "The first obligation to children is to make them happy." Such famous sayings are readily available. However, the most lacking thing is that Western children have not received a reasonable education. What they inherit is nothing more than the enjoyment and anesthetic life of adults. For example, in the recent survey of young students in the United States on the future world, more than 60% of young people opposed even wars that would strike down villains and maintain justice. The idea of young people's complacency is probably not far from the children's mind. The hope that children have for children in the world of enjoying advanced material civilization should not be too delusional.

At present, China is fighting the anti-Japanese war. Not only adults have received such a full education in this war, but even the toddlers who are learning to speak are full of baptisms from this "from heaven" and believe that all unreasonable treatments and locks can only be achieved by relying on hands and feet. In action, the upsurge of the Chinese people today in welcoming the head-on blow to Japanese imperialism can be liberated.

It is painful that since the Anti-Japanese War, we have not done our duty to protect children to the extent that we should. What have our writers, artists, university professors, rescue teams and propagandists given to the children? Every time, after winning a "considerable price" in the battlefield, there were, however, countless lives and children left behind. The literature and artists and even the university professors probably only gave the children strangeness and fear!

Whenever a town and a town are retreating, the boats and cars are mostly crowded with weak * children. The abandoned ones are also children. What about our compassionate police officers and religious figures?

What about the children in the quiet rear? If the father is an official class, then the children will also enjoy pleasure and debauchery with their fathers; if the father is an ox and horse who is driven and unfree, then his son will be discarded waste. In short, it is abuse.

I don't believe that if all of this generation of children dies, there will be a prosperous next generation, let alone what anti-Japanese war and nation-building are!

Lu Xun's words in the Diary of a Madman, "Save the children," are still powerful calls today. In the great anti-Japanese war to win national independence and freedom. Let us shout out this tragic cry for help again:

Save the children!

### Little Neighbor

— Du Ai

Almost every day it was like this, that voice more charming than anything else, making me unable to help but vaguely open my eyes. Ah! How precise it was! As soon as morning arrived, like a sparrow announcing the evening, it would sing that childish yet moving song.

"My! Home!..."

And so, with a vague feeling, my day would begin.

At first, I was disturbed by this new little neighbor. So, I went downstairs to inquire.

"Hey! Little friend, where is your home?"

He stopped singing, his eyes rolling around.

"On the Songhua River," he said, giggling.

"Really? Do you know where the Songhua River is?" I asked, brushing my teeth while talking to him across the dividing wall.

"No." He looked sad. This sadness seemed to be something he caught from the song.

"Then, are you from Guangzhou?"

"Neither. We came from Xiqiao."

Gradually, we became familiar. It turned out that he and his mother had fled last November, but his father had marched west to De'an before Guangzhou fell. To this day, there is still no news of him. Perhaps he is fighting in some Lushan guerrilla army. And he and his mother settled down in a house on a street called Ranbu (Dyeing Cloth) Street. They lived a homesick life every day, and by the first month of this year, they couldn't hold on any longer. So, they moved in with his aunt. That was my rarely seen neighbor - a middle-aged woman who worked in a wind lantern factory and was also a landlord.

The days passed slowly, and his singing continued in the morning. Another child in the neighborhood taught him. One morning, the two of them sang and laughed strangely. I listened carefully and realized that they had deliberately changed the words "Zhonghua qunxiong" (Chinese Heroes) in the "March of the Volunteers" to "Congcai niurou" (Scallion and Beef). And they sang it particularly excitedly and loudly, until some woman came out and scolded them for being improper, and then they stopped.

Although he was an eleven-year-old child, he knew a lot. After dinner, he often talked to me about his Xiqiao. He said that he was not afraid of Japanese airplane bombs, but he was very afraid of the machine guns that shot down. Once, he was frightened by the bullets that flew like heavy rain on the ground. Speaking of this, he clenched his fist like an adult, unwilling to admit defeat: "We only lose to Japan because of airplanes. If we had as many airplanes as the Japanese, wouldn't we have driven them back long ago?" And then he thought of Xiqiao again, his face shining, because he heard people say that there were many guerrillas there now, and even the bandits who used to rob people were fighting the Japanese. But he was also saddened by the papaya tree he planted, as well as some things and companions he loved.

I often gave him some books and newspapers to read. One day, I pointed to the children's corps there and said,

"Look, they are also fighting the Japanese."

He said with disdain,

"I can do this too."

I remember one day, some friends of mine who were going back to the mainland to serve, brought many elementary school students to my house, saying that they wanted to take a photo in the suburbs. I invited my little neighbor to go with them. In the suburbs, a few friends talked to the children about the children's corps in the mainland, how the children in Shanxi and Shaanxi could shoot guns, and how the children's corps active around Dongjiang promoted to the common people under Japanese planes. These stories greatly agitated the children, and they stubbornly said that they wanted to go back to their hometowns with the teachers to serve. Especially two fourteen-year-old girls, asked the teachers to allow them to join the service corps, making Lao Lin unable to cope. On the way back, my little neighbor was silent all the way. When he reached the stairs, he suddenly said very solemnly: (To be continued)
