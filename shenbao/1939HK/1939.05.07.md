### Wang Jingwei's Responsibility in Law for His Words and Actions

— Chu Fei

Note: Wang Jingwei, formerly the Vice President of the Kuomintang, Vice Chairman of the Central Political Committee, Deputy Speaker of the Supreme National Defense Council, and Speaker of the National Political Council, suddenly held a dissenting opinion against the established national policy of unity and resolute resistance to the insults, deserted his post without authorization, issued a farewell telegram, and echoed the statement of Konoe Fumimaro, causing an uproar throughout the country and a chorus of verbal and written condemnations, leaving Wang Jingwei utterly discredited. However, he stubbornly clung to his views and published the article "Giving an Example" in his controlled ×××× newspaper, ××××××××××××, creating a great uproar and becoming the target of public criticism. As a lawyer, I live by the law and base my arguments on facts and evidence. Therefore, regarding the secret agreement between him and Hiranuma, as reported by the Chongqing Dagongbao, the translator obtained information. Other evidence includes the spreading of his infamous telegram by airplane, the Nanjing puppet "Great People's Association" acting as a broadcasting station, the Jiaxing puppet "Great People's Association" responding with a telegram, the puppet "East Asia Anti-Communist Association" sending a telegram of support, and especially the continuous praise and flattery from a certain puppet newspaper. In criminal cases, the principle of discovering the truth is adopted, so concerning Wang Jingwei's actions.

What is discussed here is that Wang Jingwei, holding important positions in the Party and the state, at this critical time of national crisis, abandoned his post and fled the country to show his non-cooperation with the government. This is an act that should be held accountable under Article 2, Section 2 of the Public Servants Disciplinary Act, which concerns "neglecting duties or other acts of dereliction of duty."

According to general practice, the minority obeys the majority, and once a vote is passed, there is no room for opposition except for reconsideration. Although the rules of procedure for the Supreme National Defense Council and the National Political Council have not been seen and cannot be cited, according to the principles of popular sovereignty, they should not deviate from this principle. The national policy of resistance was decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Political Council repeatedly issued declarations of support. Wang Jingwei, as Deputy Speaker of the Supreme National Defense Council and Speaker of the National Political Council, could have expressed his confident views within the meetings if he believed they were beneficial to the country. However, since his views were not adopted by the majority, no matter how bright and righteous his views were, and if there was no background support, he could only sacrifice his own views and obey the consensus, in accordance with the general rules of the meeting. However, he rashly sent telegrams outside the meeting to oppose the publicly decided case, which is extremely contrary to the spirit of democratic politics. This is another responsibility he should bear under the parliamentary procedure.

Between countries, and between governments and the people, there are indeed confidential matters that should be kept secret. Although the proceedings of the 54th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council did not concern national defense plans, they were sufficient to show the government's diplomatic strategies, and there is no doubt that they should be kept secret. Wang Jingwei also admitted that these facts, for the sake of national interests, needed to be strictly kept secret, but he claimed that "past facts can be made public as an example." Then, which facts are not in the past? Wang Jingwei once served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he knew many facts related to foreign affairs, which are all in the past, but can they all be made public? How absurd! This is another responsibility he should bear under Article 132 of the Criminal Law, which concerns "leaking confidential documents or information other than those related to the national defense of the Republic of China."

Moreover, freedom of speech and action, without adhering to party discipline, is especially a responsibility to be borne from the party's standpoint, which goes without saying. As for what Wang Jingwei mentioned in the original text of "Giving an Example" about what Chairman Chiang said to the German ambassador at the time, it clearly stated that "there is no trust in Japan" and that there was a statement "proposing that Germany first encourage Japan to stop the war." This indicates that there was no definite recognition of the points raised by the German ambassador, and the citation is obviously a distortion of the meaning. Since it is not related to legal arguments, it is not within the scope of this discussion, and I will not elaborate on it here.

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From April 30th to May 6th, 1939

Entering a tragic and heroic May of battle!

The evolution of current events in the world and China further increases our courage and determination to advance the tragic and heroic battle.

After entering May, the battle on the two fronts began with small fluctuations and changes. On the side of democratic and peaceful countries, the British authorities' policies have not yet shown positive performance, affecting the slow progress of the anti-aggression front. The Soviet Union finally took decisive action. War? Peace? More obvious performances will come soon!

On the side of the aggressor countries, new conspiracies are underway. The leaders of Germany, Italy, and Japan have been meeting for a whole week, and it has not yet ended! However, Japan, the aggressor in the East, has more clearly started to ××××××××××××, and has launched more inhuman bombings and ×× against China. On the one hand, this proves its desperate "jumping over the wall" situation, and on the other hand, it has increased the hatred of all righteous people towards it.

(1) Britain's Anti-Aggression Stance

The "anti-aggression group" under the leadership of the British capitalist government still has considerable progress, such as the continued negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, the continued progress of British-French cooperation, the regular visits of the British King and Queen to Canada and the United States, and even the news of the simultaneous organization of a "Thirteen-Nation Anti-Aggression Grand Alliance" based on the five countries of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Turkey (London电 from Havas News Agency). However, all of these have not fully demonstrated that the British government has already decided to abandon its compromising policy in practice. Moreover, in reality, the British government still has a kind of fantasy, attempting to use this "anti-aggression Grand Alliance" posture to divide the aggressive groups of Japan, Germany, and Italy, to revive the Four-Power Group, to encourage Germany to move eastward, and to raise the already broken anti-Soviet banner again. Therefore, newspapers representing the British government have spread the news that Hitler's speech contained "room for peace," and the news that Japan has decided not to participate in the German-Italian military alliance. However, in negotiations on cooperation with the Soviet Union, they insisted on their opposition to the collective security system, insisting that the anti-aggression line would never include the Far East. This behavior is obviously hindering the advancement of the anti-aggression front, and has once again helped Germany, giving it an opportunity to bargain, and in fact has increased the crisis of world peace!

(2) Activities of the German and Italian Leaders

The unrealistic and incomplete stance of the "anti-aggression group" actually gives the fascist aggressors an opportunity to take advantage of, and helps them to calmly prepare for further aggressive challenges.

The first is the staff meeting held by the army authorities of Germany and Italy. The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Brauchitsch, led many officers and arrived in Rome on April 29th, where he met with Mussolini and held important talks with the Italian army authorities. On April 30th and May 1st, he again had lengthy discussions with Mussolini and the Spanish military delegation, and flew to Libya on the 1st. Second, Goering, the German Minister of Aviation, arrived in Rome on the evening of May 4th by special train, and immediately held talks with the Italian leadership. Third, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his wife, accompanied by the Deputy Minister and other important foreign affairs figures, took a fast train to Italy on the evening of the 4th, and began talks with the Italian Foreign Minister on the afternoon of the 5th regarding important issues such as dealing with Poland and the status of Yugoslavia. Fourth, Germany continues to compete for the satellite states of the democratic countries, first by wooing the Nordic countries, so that the countries maintain "neutrality" in wartime. The official announcement on May 4th was that a non-aggression treaty had been concluded with Latvia, and now it is proceeding with activities with Estonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Fifth, Germany and Italy continue to expand their military forces. Germany is conducting the construction of six new-style armored cruisers and other projects. Italy, due to the heavy military losses suffered in Spain, is striving to strengthen its military strength. On the 29th, the Italian cabinet passed a bill to enhance the army, allocating 500 million lire to adjust the army, and at the same time intensifying the training of air vehicles and expanding the strength of the air force. This shows that relaxing on the aggressors actually increases the threat to democracy and peace!

(3) Implementation of Japan's New Strategy

Seeing through the existing defects in the anti-aggression movement. Seeing through the exploitable points in the current policies of the democratic countries, especially Britain. Japan, the aggressor in the Far East, has become more cunning and rampant in implementing its new strategy.

Japan and the leaders of Germany and Italy have been in constant contact over the past week. The fact that the authorities in Berlin denied on May 4th that "Germany, Italy, and Japan are conducting military negotiations" can be used to prove the opposite. The Japanese leadership has also held continuous meetings over the past week and decided on the so-called policy towards Europe, outwardly declaring: "Regarding the conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, Japan has its own independent foreign policy, but Japan does not want to offend democratic and totalitarian countries, but wants to maintain and promote friendly relations with all countries in the world." This clearly shows that they have seen through the compromising nature that still exists in the current foreign policies of the democratic countries, especially the British government, and are carrying out their cunning tactics of enticement.

But at the same time, first, Japan has begun to put pressure on the Shanghai Concession. Although the Concession authorities are courageously succumbing, such as repeatedly exerting pressure on Chinese-language newspapers, Japan still insists on exclusively controlling the Concession's power. Second, Japan has again begun to carry out brutal ××× indiscriminate bombings of major cities in China and South China, especially when Ambassador Zhang Ying was in Chongqing consulting with our central government to promote Chinese-British cooperation. On May 3rd and 4th, they carried out large-scale bombings of Chongqing.

The Japanese aggressors are implementing enticement on the one hand and implementing threats on the other. The fundamental reason is that they have lost their grasp on victory in the war of aggression against China. Moreover, under our firm and united resistance, Japan is getting deeper and deeper in the quagmire. Therefore, they are trying to use the bait of "friendship" to prevent Britain from supporting the Soviet Union and aiding China; at the same time, they want to use the tough means of completely destroying British interests in China and South China to help with the "enticement strategy," ×× Britain ××. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Aoi, had already warned Britain on April 27th, urging it to abandon its policy of aiding China. The British Foreign Secretary said: "Britain is not pursuing this policy, so there is no need to change the current policy towards China." This is diplomatic rhetoric that pleases both sides, but it can be regarded as a blow to the traitors who serve the × people? However, this is so insufficient!

(4) Important Declaration of the Communist International

At this time of extreme danger in the international situation, it is even more necessary to point out the disasters of some democratic and peaceful countries continuing their policy of compromise. It is even more necessary to point out the fact that fascist aggressors not only threaten small countries but also have their knives aimed at all people who demand democracy, freedom, and peace in the world! It is especially necessary to point out the urgent tasks of all mankind, especially the working masses, in the current struggle on the two fronts.

On May 1st, the great international Labor Day, the Communist International issued an important declaration that has a decisive force on the fate of the world. This declaration called on the workers of Britain, the United States, and France, and all anti-fascist and anti-aggression fighters, to unite and impose economic, military, and political sanctions on the fascist aggressors. This declaration also solemnly called on the working masses of the world to help China, who are bravely resisting aggression, and to strive to liberate Czechoslovakia, Albania, Spain, and Abyssinia.

In the Soviet Union, May 1st was the most enthusiastic day in the world. Grand celebrations were held throughout the country, with demonstrations against fascists and aggressors. A grand review was held in Moscow's Red Square, and large exercises were held in Minsk and Kiev. The Red Army and the laborers joined hands with the vast collective farm peasants and socialist intellectuals. Everywhere, roars of "Anti-Fascism, Anti-Aggression" were issued, shouting the slogans of "Aid China, Liberate the Oppressed Nations." This roar and slogan will not only inspire the working masses, forward-thinking people, and the people of democratic and peaceful countries all over the world, but will also arouse all the masses who are currently oppressed by the fascist aggressors in their own countries and their colonies.

The consolidation and expansion of the united front of the working masses of the world, and the advancement of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement by this united front, will be the main force to stop the Second Imperialist War that has already broken out! But everyone must know that it is time to rise up, not wait!

(5) The Soviet Union Takes Positive Action

This week, the Soviet Union took positive and decisive action.

First, the Soviet Union is working hard to organize the collective security of the Black Sea countries to replace the weak British and French unilateral guarantee to Turkey. (One-day Central News Agency Tokyo Power. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin discussed with the Turkish authorities the establishment of cooperation between the Black Sea countries and Britain and France. This plan stipulates that the Dardanelles Strait will be opened in wartime, allowing warships of anti-aggression countries to pass.)

Second, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet held large-scale exercises on the southeastern Turkish coast of the Black Sea, which successfully concluded on May 1st. Fleet Commander Oktyabrsky expressed his complete satisfaction with the fleet's combat capabilities, believing that at a time when German forces are invading the Black Sea, the Soviet fleet is sufficient to cope with all emergencies.

Third, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland has become closer, and Poland has also dared to start insisting on a tough attitude to deal with Germany's gradual approach. On May 5th, Polish Foreign Minister Beck also delivered a reply to Germany amid worldwide attention.

Fourth, the Soviet Union replaced Litvinov with People's Commissar Molotov as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. This move can be said to be a serious lesson for the two-faced policies of Britain and France, and the rumors that the Soviet Union has agreed that the anti-aggression line will not extend to the Far East, which was spread by the previous telegrams, have also been shattered. The Soviet authorities have repeatedly declared to the world: "The Soviet Union is capable of defeating any aggressor attacking from both the East and the West at the same time"! "The Soviet Union does not need any military alliance, triangular alliance"! Now that Molotov is concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and has also ordered the abolition of censorship, it is even more refreshing to international people. It proves that the unprecedented unity and the abundance of power in the Soviet Union are no longer afraid of any conspiracy or poison plan! The active actions of the Soviet Union naturally show that the Soviet Union's efforts in the anti-aggression movement are entirely to realize the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining world peace and liberating oppressed nations, and to realize the policy of maintaining democratic politics and promoting the progress of human culture. There is absolutely no selfish or other attempt. Therefore, we believe that the Soviet Union's actions will promote the current democratic and peaceful countries that still hold on to compromise and anti-Soviet fantasies, will warn all countries that are embarking on the road of aggression and expansion of imperialist war, and will further prove the greatness of the Soviet Union's strength and increase the Soviet Union's prestige in truly maintaining peace in the international community.

(6) Recent Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan

In this struggle on the two fronts, the Chinese anti-Japanese troops, as the main force and vanguard of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front, continue to gain the victories they deserve. According to statistics, in the second half of April, 504 battles were fought, killing 31,965 Japanese officers and soldiers, and capturing 512 Japanese officers and soldiers. In addition, military supplies were seized, transportation was destroyed, Japanese ships were sunk, and Japanese aircraft were shot down. This is not included in the summary. This week, the anti-Japanese army continued to win on all fronts. In northern Jiangxi, they continued to counterattack Fengxin and Nanchang, making the Japanese army exhausted and stabilizing the situation in Hunan and Jiangxi. In central Hunan, the Japanese army again showed signs of invading westward, aiming to capture Guanchang. However, our anti-Japanese army took the initiative to launch an offensive and crossed the Xiang River on May 3rd, attacking in multiple directions, capturing three key points on the Hanyi Highway: Luohan Temple, Sigang City, and others. At the same time, Shaodong and Macheng were also captured, so the Japanese army in central Hunan was also defeated. The situation in the South China battlefield was slightly quiet, while the situation in the West River turned for the better. In North China, the Japanese army received a large number of new recruits, but generally they have no ability to move. The war has entered a phase of stalemate. The counter-offensive military operations in the East China battlefield have made slightly more progress than last week. There were battles in northern Jiangsu and on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, and the New Fourth Army won a victory on the Jinghang Road, using Henglin and Yixing to commemorate May Day. After three days of bloody battles, they inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese.

The Japanese aggressor army encountered attacks and defeats everywhere, and the internal situation became more unstable. The entire 31st company of the 23rd Regiment of the 1st Division of the former puppet Mongolian army, led by company commander Yang Xinghua, defected to our side (Guilin Electric on the 2nd). The news that the Japanese army in Tianjin revolted and set fire to warehouses on the 24th of last month has also been confirmed. Moreover, many officers and soldiers of the Japanese army in North China were involved, which made Lieutenant General Sugiyama Gen anxious. At the same time, political conspiracies were also frustrated. Wang Jingwei's anti-communist and peace activities encountered the hatred of the entire Chinese nation. Diplomatically, his enticements and threats to Britain did not gain much under our firm attitude. The economic and financial policies in the occupied areas suffered heavy blows, and the poison of the puppet currency has almost completely failed. In order to save the day, the Japanese × decided to disregard everything and temporarily inspect madly, and carried out continuous crazy bombings of our major states and cities in central, southern, and western China on the 3rd and 4th of the month, bombing Chongqing in total madness. Ningbo in Zhejiang and Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong were also subjected to crazy bombings in recent days. After such inhuman bombings, so-called large-scale advances may follow. However, precisely because the difficulties of the Japanese army are becoming more and more serious, we will not shrink back or compromise, but will increase our hatred and determination to resist aggression, and will increase our confidence in winning the war of resistance. Therefore, the Japanese army is bound to fail, which can be said to be predetermined. However, when we look back at our motherland, with beacon fires everywhere, cities in ruins, and compatriots suffering, how can anyone with a heart not feel sorrow? Supporting the front line, rescuing refugees, serving the country, expanding donations, etc., are more urgently needed for us to work hard to carry out!

### Our Troops in Jiangxi and Hubei Launch Another Offensive Nanchang Southeast Suburbs See the Resumption of Major Battles Steady Victories on the Hanyi Road Front

[United Press Shanghai, June 6] According to reports from Chinese sources, a Chinese team flew to Nanchang yesterday and bombed Japanese military defenses and the concentration of a thousand Japanese soldiers, launching bombs to schools and strafing with machine guns, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army and then returning to our defenses safely.

[Central News Agency Dongxiang, May 5] The battles in the southeastern suburbs of Nanchang suddenly became tense last night due to the arrival of a large number of our fresh troops. The battle in the suburbs of Nanchang resumed.

The War Situation on the Hunan-Hubei Border Is Stable

[Central News Agency Miluo, June 6] After our troops repelled the Japanese forces that were moving towards Pingshuipu from Xiang on the morning of the 5th, the Japanese troops launched a counterattack from Linxiang towards Pingshuipu with an armored vehicle fully loaded with reinforcements that night. A certain unit of our army ambushed a certain key point on the route from Xiang to Pingshuipu in advance, and concentrated artillery fire to strike when the Japanese vehicle approached, destroying the Japanese vehicle, overturning it to the side of the road, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, and seizing more than eighty rifles and many military supplies. Almost none of the Japanese in the vehicle survived.

[Central News Agency Miluo, June 9] The Japanese troops in Linxiang moved towards Pingshuipu again on the 5th, attempting to retake the area, but were intercepted by us, suffering more than two hundred casualties. Pingshuipu is still in our hands.

[Central News Agency Changde, June 6] There have been no battles in various parts of the Hunan border in the past two days. Our troops in central Hubei crossed the river to launch attacks and have achieved great results in recent days.

[Central News Agency Yichang, May 4] After our troops on the Hanyi Road front captured two major strongholds, Luohan Temple and Duobao Temple, our main forces continued to pursue eastward. The Japanese troops retreated to Zaoshi and Yingcheng. Our troops on the highway front have advanced to Yonglong River and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese forces. Our troops occupying Zhangjie and Jieyu Xinhe are also advancing forward, and at the same time, they are adopting an encirclement formation against the Japanese forces in Tianmen. The Japanese forces have been extremely disorganized after suddenly encountering our night raids, and have left behind a large number of supplies and equipment, which are currently being inventoried.

[Central News Agency Yichang, June 6] Fierce battles are ongoing in the Yangjialing, Maqi, and Lingshan Temple areas northwest of Zhongxiang. More than two thousand Japanese forces, under the cover of more than ten cannons, are fiercely attacking us, and multiple Japanese aircraft are constantly bombing. Our defending soldiers are fighting to the death, and the battle is extremely fierce. Our troops on the Hanyi Road front have recaptured Yonglong River and are adopting a surveillance posture towards the Japanese forces.

Our Cavalry Advances into Eastern Suiyuan

[Central News Agency Yulin, May 3] According to military news, a certain unit of our cavalry has advanced into eastern Suiyuan and entered the Liangcheng area. The Japanese troops of the Kō region are blocking our advance along the way, and the Japanese aircraft are following and bombing us. Our army defeated them at both the north and south of the Red River, killing more than a hundred Japanese troops with strong forces. Because of our involvement, the Japanese forces in southern Suiyuan are in a state of panic.

[Central News Agency Hequ, May 4] According to communications, the Japanese troops between Qingshuihe have recently conscripted civilians to forcefully build bridges, attempting to cross the river and invade westward. The Japanese troops in Jin Sui fired dozens of shells across the river yesterday, but we suffered no losses.

[Central News Agency Yuji, May 5] On the morning of the 1st, a unit of our army attacked Dawu Town in Xishan (north of Xixian), first sending troops to attack Dawu and restraining the Japanese reinforcements. Our troops attacked from Xishu Mountain in the west to the east and west mountains, and more than a hundred Japanese troops opened fire near Xishan and engaged us. Our troops in the east mountain entered Ru Village and launched a brave attack on the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops suffered more than twenty casualties.

[Central News Agency Xi'an, May 5] According to military news, after Cai Qingshan, commander of the Huang Xie Army in southern Shanxi, defected to our side, the troops of Li Yao, commander of the Third and Fourth Regiments stationed in Yuncheng, also defected to our side on the 2nd, moving their troops to the area between Yishi and Linfen and conducting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese forces. Currently, Qi Wenping, commander of the puppet Huang Army in southern Shanxi, is preparing to defect to our side recently due to the fact that his subordinates have defected one after another and he lacks the ability to command. The Japanese conspiracy to control China with Chinese finally came to naught.

[Central News Agency Xingji, May 5] On the 30th of last month, a certain unit of our army encountered more than two hundred Japanese troops in Heishan in Zhongyang. Our army made use of the terrain and lay in ambush, waiting for an opportunity. When the Japanese troops advanced to the mountainside, they were unable to shift. Our army concentrated its firepower and launched a fierce attack. The Japanese troops fled in panic, and our army pursued them, killing more than fifty Japanese troops. We suffered no losses.

### Weekly War Situation, April 28th to May 4th ... Military Affairs Commission Announcement ...

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that on the northern and southern fronts this week, our forces, under the relentless pressure of our attacking units, have achieved numerous victories and recaptured many areas, causing the enemy to suffer a disastrous defeat with unstoppable momentum. Key results are summarized as follows:

Guangdong Front

Around Guangzhou, following the successive recaptures of Huaxian Xin Street last week and the double capture of Zengcheng, along with the capture of key strongholds such as Fuhe and Shiken, in the Paitan area, over 800 enemy officers and soldiers, including enemy regiment commander Eka Getaro, were killed. The periphery is now entirely under our control, and the encirclement is tightening. This week, a portion of our surprise troops briefly entered the city, killing over 500 enemy soldiers. Enemy officers' dependents are successively evacuating, causing extreme panic. Furthermore, 3,000-4,000 enemy troops from Xinhui and Jiangmen have been invading Heshang, Daze, Zhuliuhe, and other areas westward in recent days with great force. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in bloody battles for three days and nights. Although these areas were temporarily lost, by the morning of the 30th, they were all fully recaptured. In the battles of Zhuliuhe and Daze, over 300 enemy soldiers were killed in each location. In the Heshang battle, enemy casualties exceeded 1,000, including 15 officers of the rank of major and lieutenant colonel. Hundreds of barrels of their gasoline were seized. Now, we are taking advantage of the victory to press forward towards Xinhui and Jiangmen. On the eastern, western, and northern fronts of Guangdong province, our forces have gained absolute superiority. In their desperation, the enemy may resort to a last-ditch struggle.

Jiangxi Front

Our troops active in northern Jiangxi, since capturing Gao'an last week, advanced towards Wuning and approached Wuchang. Since the beginning of this week, although the enemy has exerted all its strength to counterattack, our troops, with the momentum of sweeping away remnants, continue to advance, completely shattering the enemy's attempts to resist. Currently, the commanding heights around Wuning are entirely in our hands, and we have once again penetrated into the city. The strongholds of Xiangfuguan, Dachengzhen, and Gaoyou City, northeast of Gao'an, have been successively captured. In recent days, our troops have encircled Fengxin on three sides and launched fierce attacks. A major fire broke out within the city, and enemy barracks and other facilities were reduced to ashes. On the Nanchang front and both banks of the Fu River, key locations such as Hengxi, Liantang, Xiangtang, Shengmi Street, Xiefu City, and Shimin Street have been successively recaptured. Joining forces with the elite troops from Dacheng and Gaoyou, we launched a fierce offensive. The enemy, relying on defensive positions, stubbornly resisted and retreated in defeat. Currently, our vanguard has advanced near the city gates to eliminate remaining enemy forces. In recent days, the number of enemy troops from Wuning, Gao'an, Nanchang, and other areas killed is no less than 2,000. The enemy is doing its best to conscript reinforcements. Approximately 2,000 enemy troops from Nabaping, Zhe River, Haojiadian, and Xujiadian launched a fierce attack from the morning of the 30th towards Sensilin Temple, Dushan Town, Jiuliquan, and Kou Dian. Under the fierce attack of our main forces, suffering over 1,000 casualties, their offensive was thwarted. On the east bank of the Han River, enemy forces near Luohan Temple bombarded Shayang with heavy artillery all day on the 2nd and launched a large number of poison gas shells. At dawn on the 30th, our main forces crossed the river in two columns to launch an attack. The enemy on the east bank, unable to resist, immediately collapsed. Before long, Luohan Temple, Yiduowan, and Sigang City, all key strongholds, were recaptured. Currently, taking advantage of the victory, we are pursuing the defeated enemy in three columns towards Tuochuanbu, Yonglong River, and Yangjiawei. Yuxin River is also under fierce siege. The enemy in Tianmen is extremely shaken. Our troops attacking Macheng in eastern Hubei recaptured the county seat on the 30th and, taking advantage of the victory, successively captured Zhongguanzhen on the 1st and advanced towards Songbu. On the same day, they attacked the Ertaokou enemy airfield, annihilating over 100 enemy soldiers guarding it and burning all 15 aircraft within the airfield. After capturing Xintanbu in southern Hubei, we are now besieging Tongcheng and Chongyang. Furthermore, our main forces are advancing in two columns, one approaching Daye and the other heading directly towards Xianning.

Shanxi Front

Our troops in Shanxi province launched strikes against the enemy who were making disturbances. In southern Shanxi, fierce battles took place from the morning of the 2nd in Quwo, Shouyang, Zhangdianzhen, Wenxi, Anze, Fushan, Jiangcheng, and other locations, killing over 1,500 enemy soldiers and completely destroying all lines of communication, making it impossible for the enemy to coordinate with each other. In eastern Shanxi, the enemy invading Pingyao, Taigu, and Qixian along the Baijin Highway has been engaged in bloody battles for ten days since last week. By the 28th, the enemy on all fronts was defeated and routed, abandoning over 3,000 bodies. In the Lingluozhenshi area of western Shanxi, our troops encircled and fiercely attacked the enemy with the force of a sudden storm, annihilating 500-600 enemy soldiers. In northern Shanxi, the remaining enemy forces entrenched in Jingle and Shenchi are still surrounded by us and will soon be completely wiped out.

Great Victory

Statistics show that in the past ten days or so, our forces on all fronts have killed approximately 8,000 enemy soldiers. Enemy divisional commander Taniguchi was seriously wounded in the battle of Fushan and is reported to have died. In the battle of Anze, regimental commander Mita was also killed. Having suffered these heavy blows, the enemy is extremely fearful and, confined along the Tongpu Railway line, is on the verge of being overwhelmed. In addition, in northern Henan, we captured Xuliang, a key stronghold belonging to Bo'ai. In eastern Henan, we once again attacked the western gate and railway station of Kaifeng on the morning of the 1st. In southern Henan, we defeated the enemy attempting to break out northwestward from Xinyang. In Shandong province, we recaptured Wendeng county seat. In northern Jiangsu, we captured Qiuxian. Yixing and Lishui in Jiangxi, which had fallen into enemy hands for 18 months, witnessed the national flag once again on the 3rd and returned to our control. Severing the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, encircling Bengbu, and controlling Nanjing represent a great victory marking a new era in the eastern theater of operations. In Suiyuan province, we destroyed the Ping-Sui Railway and the Baotou-Baibaimiao Highway, making it impossible to restore the enemy's transportation network between Guihua (Hohhot), Suiyuan, Datong, Baotou, and Baibaimiao. The entire northwestern theater of operations is under our control. These are all important events of the past week, which are of great significance in exposing the enemy's conspiracy and promoting the power of our army.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] Newspapers here are vigorously promoting the seizure of management rights over the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession, citing the inability of third countries to maintain order as justification. "Asahi Shimbun" stated, "Japan will demand temporary control of the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession. While there may not be sufficient grounds for such a demand, if the concession authorities do not give satisfactory answers to Japan's reasonable proposals, then Japan will ultimately be forced to make a demand to control the Shanghai concessions." "Kokumin Shimbun" criticized the government's weak policy, saying that the Japanese government should adopt a tough policy towards the Shanghai concession authorities.

### The Battle for Gao'an

— …Fan Shizhi… (Part 1)

[Central News Agency, Gao'an Huibu Air Dispatch] "The enemy's strategy is generally cautious, rarely taking risks. However, in their tactical and combat actions, they often take bold chances." There are many past examples that prove this, and the enemy's recent capture of Nanchang is an excellent example. The frontal battle begins.

The Frontal Battle Begins

After successfully crossing the Xiu River at Liaojia and Zhanggongdu on March 19th and 20th by taking advantage of strong winds, the enemy quickly used its mobile mechanized units to occupy Anyi, Fengxin, and Jing'an within three days. On the evening of the 22nd, some enemy tanks and armored vehicles even infiltrated Dacheng. However, their main infantry force was still far away in Zhangxi, revealing their audacious and risky tactics. At this time, our troops on the Xiang-Gan Highway, to prevent the enemy from outflanking us on the left and right, not only used a portion of their forces to block their advance east towards Nanchang in the Xishan Wanzhuan Palace area, but also transported a certain unit, which had dealt a major blow to the enemy's 101st and 106th Divisions at De'an Wanjialing Zhanggushan last year, to Shanggao by truck, and then proceeded to Gao'an, arriving at 7:00 AM on the 25th, thwarting the enemy's westward advance and completing the most magnificent battle since the beginning of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance.

Spring in central Jiangxi is known for its rainy season. During the battle, there were continuous rains, and the river water rose, effectively restricting the enemy aircraft that had been rampaging for days. After our troops arrived in the Sigongshan Xiangfuguan Lianhuashan area northeast of Gao'an, they first drove out all the enemy scouts and advanced units, built fortifications, and established forward positions at Chitu Ridge and Zhanggu Ridge northeast of Xiangfuguan, with a reserve position near Yuncheng Bridge, less than a mile outside the north gate of Gao'an, and maintained their main strength near Gaoyou City. On the 26th, over a thousand enemy infantry arrived at Dacheng and advanced rapidly towards Gao'an. By evening, some of them had made minor contact with our guard troops. On the 27th, the majority of the enemy advanced to Hucun and Liucun, four miles northeast of Xiangfuguan, and began a frontal battle with us, with little change by evening. On the 28th, the enemy's main force arrived and began to harass our positions everywhere, but they were all repelled. At this time, the enemy's mechanized units were moving from Dacheng towards Gao'an. Therefore, we divided our forces and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's flank and rear in Longpi Juxia, five miles east of Xiangfuguan, that night.

Two Company Commanders Who Bravely Charged Despite Their Wounds

After taking fire from their flank and rear, the enemy retreated slightly. At 6:00 AM on the 29th, eight enemy tanks arrived and attacked us again, but one was destroyed by our steel-core bullets. Having suffered this setback, the enemy retreated again, and we sent troops to destroy the damaged tank. We suffered over 100 casualties, and the enemy suffered 200. At 3:00 PM, the enemy received support from its rear guard and launched tear gas and suffocating gas in Hucun, four miles northeast of Xianfuguan, while simultaneously launching a fierce attack with tanks and infantry. Company commanders Li Yiming and Jin Jizhong, despite being wounded, inspired the entire army with their spirit of bravely charging despite their wounds, and crushed the enemy forces. At 4:00 PM, another 500 enemy soldiers, launching poison gas, attacked Zhanggu Ridge, northwest of Xiangfuguan, under the cover of seven tanks, but they were repelled by us. The enemy suffered over 250 casualties, and we captured 24 rifles, dozens of steel helmets, documents, and other items. After four days of repeated defeats, the enemy transferred two or more regiments from Wanshou Palace to Xianfuguan and, at dawn on the 30th, launched a fierce attack on our Zhanggu Ridge position. The intensity of the battle far exceeded the battles of the previous four days. However, our officers and soldiers calmly resisted and fought bravely. After half a day of battle, the enemy suffered over 500 casualties, leaving over 200 bodies in front of our positions and retreating. (To be continued)

### British Consulate in Chongqing Bombed Britain Lodges Strong Protest Clark Kerr Visits Japanese Foreign Minister One German Woman Also Killed in Bombing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Tokyo dispatch: According to reliable sources, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has verbally protested to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the bombing of the British Consulate in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, stating that the matter is extremely serious and hoping that the Japanese side can take appropriate measures to prevent such incidents from recurring.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Shanghai dispatch: The British Embassy stated that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that a bomb landed on the British Consulate's dormitory when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing the other day, killing eleven British staff members. After receiving instructions from the British government, Craigie will lodge another strong protest.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] The major fire caused by Thursday's Japanese air raid is still raging. The total number of dead and wounded is currently estimated to be around 5,000. Foreigners have now formed an International Relief Committee to assist the Central Relief Commission in aiding homeless refugees. President Chiang Kai-shek has allocated 1 million yuan to the effort.

Two miles of the Yangtze River bank are filled with refugees, sleeping in the open air. Others are carrying their few belongings across the river to take shelter. The road from Chongqing to Chengdu is teeming with refugees. There are fewer pedestrians on the streets of the city.

Chongqing was shrouded in heavy fog yesterday, and there was heavy rain in the early morning, which helped to extinguish the flames. Only two fires remain unextinguished, but they are also under control.

Rickshaw pullers and boatmen are making several times their normal profits by transporting refugees all night, and some are even taking the opportunity to raise fares exorbitantly.

Foreigners are also preparing to cross the river and move to safer places, but they lack food and drinking water.

Most of the shops in the city are closed, and shopkeepers are moving their goods. Some telephone lines have been repaired, but some streets are blocked by rubble and cannot be accessed. President Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the mobilization of all public and private vehicles in the city to evacuate residents.

According to Chinese reports, Japanese aircraft scattered leaflets saying they would destroy the entire city within seven days.

The heavy rain today is hindering rescue work. Corpses are piling up, and the stench is overpowering. Chongqing has many rats, and since the Chinese people traditionally bury their dead, there are fears of an epidemic breaking out in the city.

The Chinese government has allocated another 2 million yuan for relief, bringing the total to 3 million yuan.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] After days of relentless bombing by enemy aircraft, Chongqing residents have begun to evacuate to the surrounding countryside. Yesterday alone, the number of people leaving here totaled approximately 100,000. It is reported that several refugee camps have been built in the suburbs of Chongqing.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] After yesterday's air raid, fires broke out in many parts of the city, but all have been extinguished by this morning. Several streets are blocked by rubble and debris and cannot be traversed. Electricity, telephone, and water services have been partially restored. The exact number of casualties from this air raid is not yet known, as rescue work has not yet been carried out in the vast areas that have been destroyed, so the extent of the casualties is unknown. Many are believed to be buried in the rubble. The number of casualties from this air raid is the largest in the twenty-three months since the start of the war. According to estimates from a reliable source, the number of wounded, dead, and buried is between four and five thousand. Reuters reporters patrolled Chongqing last night, where several places were still burning. Apart from that, the entire city of Chongqing was completely dark. The only people on the streets were those who had fled the bombing the day before, returning to their homes to try to retrieve some essential items. Relief workers are continuing their arduous work. Some government officials have formed an organization to evacuate refugees. President Chiang Kai-shek has appointed General He Yingqin to be fully responsible for relief efforts. President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife's personal vehicles have been made available for transporting refugees. The nine newspapers in Chongqing published a joint issue today. The main editorial stated, "This is one of the most tragic pages in Chinese journalistic history, but it also shows China's determination to continue the war of resistance under any circumstances. We will strengthen our organization to respond to the enemy's barbaric actions. Our unity and organization will shatter the enemy's ambitions."

### British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Reply to Soviet Note Avoids Military Alliance Re-proposes Joint Defense of Eastern Europe

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting today to discuss the French government's memorandum (regarding the British government's proposed counter-proposal to the Soviet Union, which had been sent to the French government for its opinion). It immediately drafted instructions to be sent to Sir William Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to send a note verbale to the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov. Diplomatic circles here believe that the British government's intention is that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov does not mean that the Soviet Union has changed its foreign policy. If not, it would not have sent another note verbale to the Soviet government. The contents of this note are not disclosed by official sources.

[Associated Press, London, 5th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee recently passed a memorandum stating that the UK cannot accept the Soviet Union's demand for a three-nation military alliance under current circumstances. After the memorandum was passed, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax immediately sent it to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union for transmission to the Soviet Foreign Minister. The content does not reject the Soviet proposal but merely states the reasons why it cannot be accepted at present. According to a British spokesman, the UK is not closing the door to a future military agreement, despite making such a reply. Chamberlain is now awaiting the Soviet Union's reaction to this and hopes to clarify whether Soviet foreign policy has changed due to Litvinov's resignation. The British reply solemnly declared that only when Britain and France are actively involved in assisting oppressed nations will they expect the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front. This move by the UK is clearly intended to allay Soviet concerns, as the Soviet Union fears being dragged into a whirlpool while Britain and France stand idly by.

[Associated Press, London, 5th] Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax intends to instruct British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Seeds, to visit Molotov today and present the British response to the Soviet proposal. It is understood that the UK intends to avoid the Soviet proposal for a British, French, and Soviet military alliance and re-propose that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be prepared to defend the countries of Eastern Europe and prevent aggression.

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British government will shortly issue instructions to the British Ambassador to Moscow regarding the British reply to the Soviet government's proposals. London believes that the contents of the British reply will, in principle, maintain the Soviet proposal while adding the opinions of major allied nations regarding various plans to resist aggression.

[Reuters, Tallinn, Estonia, 6th] The Estonian cabinet has approved the German proposal for a non-aggression treaty in principle. Latvian Foreign Minister Vilhelms Munters will arrive here tonight to discuss the German proposal with the Estonian government.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Undersecretary of State Butler said in the House of Commons today that the British government currently has no intention of including the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the British protection or mutual assistance agreement.

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] The Soviet Supreme Soviet is scheduled to convene on May 25th.

### Poland's Attitude is Firm: Denies Germany's Right to Repudiate Treaty; France Declares Support for Poland

[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] The Polish government's reply to Germany's recent ultimatum declaring the abandonment of the 1934 German-Polish agreement refutes that the Anglo-Polish understanding cannot coexist with the German-Polish non-aggression pact. It firmly states that Hitler has no right to abandon the treaty. If the German government can value a good-neighborly policy and make formal suggestions, the Polish government will, based on the Polish viewpoint, be prepared to sincerely consider them.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 6th] When Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck concluded his speech yesterday, thunderous applause erupted. When the parliament passed the address, even the Ukrainian representatives joined in praise. General Śmigły-Rydz, the hero who captured Vilnius for Poland, who had always opposed Beck's policies, also rose from his seat, stepped forward, shook Beck's hand, and congratulated him. No representatives from the Axis powers attended the session. Observers generally viewed Beck's speech as moderate yet firm, sufficient to show Poland's sincerity in upholding peace, but only on the principle of not compromising its honor.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] Demonstrators gathered in front of the Polish Foreign Ministry today, demanding to see Foreign Minister Beck. Responding to the enthusiasm of the people, Beck appeared on the balcony to meet with them and gave a brief speech, declaring that the era of diplomatic competition has passed, and from now on, the whole country should adopt a resolute attitude.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 5th] Regarding France's determination to faithfully maintain its commitments to Poland, Daladier issued a declaration to confirm it. This morning, all newspapers prominently published Daladier's declaration, but the editorials of the newspapers differed slightly. According to political circles, the Prime Minister's move was due to an article published in the newspapers by Marcel Déat, a representative of the Social Republican Party, arguing that the French people should not fight for Poland's excessive demands regarding Danzig and East Prussia. Therefore, he issued a declaration to reaffirm France's credibility. According to news from the 'Le Temps' this morning, the Polish Ambassador, Juliusz Łukasiewicz, yesterday specifically sent a note to Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet to inquire about Marcel Déat's article. The Foreign Minister immediately assured that the article would absolutely not affect France's attitude, and the French government was determined to abide by its agreements. It was also reported that Léger told the Polish Ambassador that once Poland felt that its vital interests were threatened, France would automatically come to its aid. The so-called vital interests referred to the Danzig area. The Polish Ambassador expressed satisfaction with the Prime Minister's declaration.

Favorable Impression in Britain and France

[Reuters, London, 6th] The press here warmly supports Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, saying that the speech is firm in substance and moderate in wording. The "Daily Telegraph" stated, "If Foreign Minister Beck's speech fails to ease the tense situation, it is not Beck's fault. Hitler has no excuse for refusing friendly negotiations." The "News Chronicle" stated, "Beck's speech does not contain any provocative elements, but clearly states that any attempt to seize and annex Danzig will meet with the resistance of the entire Polish nation." The "Times" stated, "Foreign Minister Beck has given a good account of Poland's attitude. This statement includes a strong national sentiment and constructive suggestions. Both sides can resolve the relevant issues through calm and rational negotiations without the need for war. However, if an attempt is made to implement a forceful solution, it will turn a local dispute into a major problem that the world is no longer prepared to tolerate."

[Reuters, London, 5th] Beck's speech has been carefully studied in London, and the impression is extremely favorable in all quarters. However, no official announcement has been made. Diplomatic circles regard the moderate and clear wording of the speech as its most outstanding feature. Everyone is now watching what Germany's reaction will be. The two leaders of the Nazi Party in Danzig are currently holding talks with Hitler in Berchtesgaden, which is noteworthy, as the Czech situation can serve as a precedent. Diplomatic circles further pointed out that Beck's speech mentioned the unilateral abandonment of the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. Those who have treaties with Germany should also be wary of this.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The speech by Colonel Beck is considered peaceful, resolute, and statesmanlike. Regarding the Danzig section, the intention is certainly to reject the German demands, but because of its skillful wording, no one can regard it as provocative. Those who hope that Germany will take the opportunity to change course and seek a peaceful solution with Poland can be slightly more optimistic. Rome intends to offer itself as a mediator in this matter. It is generally speculated that Beck's resolute tone this time, coupled with the recent declarations by Britain and France explicitly stating that if Poland is invaded, they will certainly stand up to help, should let Germany know that the democratic countries are not just paying lip service. If they still rashly attempt to repeat their annexation of Czechoslovakia in the Baltic Sea area, it will inevitably lead to a major war.

German Officials Express Dissatisfaction

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Hitler spent the entire afternoon today in Berchtesgaden with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the leaders of the Nazi Party in Danzig discussing Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech. Ribbentrop is scheduled to leave for Italy tonight. Germany's attitude will not be formed until Poland's formal reply and Beck's speech have been thoroughly studied. However, the initial unofficial impression of Beck's speech is that Poland has become "depraved." The Germans are now engaged in heated debate, discussing the possibility of Germany occupying Danzig without firing a shot.

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] The German official opinion on Beck's speech will be published in the "Foreign Affairs Correspondence" tonight. Its thorough opposition to Beck's speech is quite like Hitler's recent reply to Roosevelt. It is claimed that Colonel Beck tried hard to embellish and defend the drastic changes in Polish policy since the end of March. But Beck is mistaken if he thinks that his sudden change of policy from 1934 and joining the British encirclement front can be tolerated by Germany. This must be stated. The official news agency also extracted a section of Colonel Beck's speech tonight and published it in a newspaper with the headline "Beck Wrongly Attempts to Distract Attention! Rejects German Suggestions." At the same time, newspapers are publishing a large number of rumors about Polish anti-German sentiment, including reports that Poles are marching in Poznan, deliberately creating an idol of Hitler, hanging it on a guillotine, and holding demonstrations outside the German consulate, shouting abuse.

Romania Values Soviet Policy

[Reuters, Rome, 5th] Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaetano, recently wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" commenting on Beck's speech, warning Poland to avoid adopting a "bluffing attitude" against Germany. He further advised Poland to only consider its own interests and not allow its interests to be set aside for the interests of others. Gaetano went on to point out that it was purely due to Mussolini's personal intervention and Italy's actions that the Polish-Hungarian border issue was resolved according to Poland's wishes.

[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 5th] Well-informed sources criticize Colonel Beck's speech as representing strength, dignity, and determination. At the same time, they say that his tone is not overbearing. Even regarding the section on Germany and Poland discussing the issue of Danzig and the Corridor on an equal footing in the future, Colonel Beck has not left room for consultation. In reality, what kind of policy the Soviet Union will adopt is even more important than Colonel Beck's speech. More than forty-eight hours have passed since Litvinov resigned, and the Soviet Union has not yet issued any statement clarifying its foreign policy, which is noteworthy. It is generally speculated that if Stalin intends to maintain Litvinov's policy (with slight changes in details), Moscow should have made a statement long ago.

### Franco's Army Parade Postponed Again to the 21st

[Reuters, London, 5th] It is reported that Franco's victory parade in Madrid has been set for the 21st of this month. The date of this parade has been repeatedly postponed. Now, authoritative sources claim that this date will not be postponed again.

### German Foreign Minister Arrives in Milan: Begins Talks with Italian Foreign Minister; Continues on Sunday

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 6th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, along with his wife and many staff members, arrived here at 11:00 AM today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the German Ambassador to Rome, von Mackensen, greeted them at the station. The German Foreign Minister got out of the car, inspected the honor guard in front of the station, and then rode with the Italian Foreign Minister to the "Grand Hotel." The crowd cheered until 1:00 PM. The Mayor of Milan hosted a luncheon at the City Hall. In the afternoon, the German and Italian Foreign Ministers will begin political talks.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] According to official sources, the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, originally scheduled to be held at Lake Como at 11:30 AM today, have been changed to a meeting at the Grand Hotel in Milan. The meeting will continue after lunch, and there will be no recess on Sunday.

### Serious Labor Unrest Occurs in US Coal Mining Area: 460,000 People Participate in Strike; Industries in Various Cities Greatly Threatened

[Associated Press, New York, 5th] The largest strike in American history began today, with 466,000 coal miners participating. The government is trying to prevent its spread. Coal is gradually becoming scarce, and industries in major cities are greatly threatened. One million metal miners have not yet joined, and they have agreed to continue negotiations until next week.

[Reuters, New York, 5th] The number of workers on strike in the Appalachian coal mining area has reached 460,000, and the supply of coal is already scarce. It is reported that the miners are still willing to continue negotiations. Several transportation companies are now considering importing coal from Europe if the coal shortage becomes more severe.

### Britain Decides to Send Consul to Slovakia: "De Facto" Recognition

[Reuters, London, 5th] The British government has recently decided to grant Slovakia "de facto" recognition and has appointed Mr. Barnes as the British Consul in the Slovak capital. This move has been agreed to by the Slovak government.

### Chen Youren Discusses the International Situation: Pays Close Attention to British Policy; We Will Definitely Reject Humiliating Peace

The famous diplomat, Mr. Chen Youren, received newspaper reporters yesterday and spoke freely about the Polish Corridor and the Danzig issue, as well as the impact of the Anglo-Soviet military alliance on the Far East.

Regarding Europe

He said, "If Hitler firmly believes that advancing towards Poland will not cause a major European war, then he will insist on resolving the status of Danzig in a Nazi manner and building highways to connect the Polish Corridor. But if the Soviet Union does not interfere with Germany's actions to support Poland, then a European war will not occur. Under such circumstances, Chamberlain can easily obtain Daladier's consent and follow the path of Munich to guide the 'lion of least resistance.' This is very possible. The exact reasons for Litvinov's resignation are not yet known. A certain right-wing newspaper in Paris claimed that Molotov, who succeeded Litvinov as Soviet Foreign Minister, strongly opposed cooperation between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. If this is true, then the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet military alliance may not necessarily be realized. If such a military alliance fails to materialize, it will have a serious impact on the new development of Chamberlain's European policy, but it will not be detrimental to China. China can make Voroshilov believe in the importance of the East and eliminate the threat of Japan before encountering the Nazi danger in the West. If an Anglo-Soviet military alliance can still be concluded after Litvinov's resignation, then what are the advantages and disadvantages of this alliance for China's war of resistance? Since this alliance is Britain's guarantee of the Soviet Union's European border, the Soviet Union's concern for the security of its western border can be reduced, and assistance to China can be increased."

Regarding the Far East

"If China is not included in the scope of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, then Britain will insist that Soviet military forces be concentrated in the West to cope with German aggression and will try to prevent Soviet military forces from being 'dispersed' in the Far East. The development of this British policy is not only extremely dangerous for China's war of resistance, but may also be used to mediate 'peace' in the hands of those who are focused on 'appeasement' like Mr. Chamberlain. The British ruling class has already shown this kind of omen. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, is safe in Shanghai and staying in Chongqing, which has been repeatedly bombed. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, met with Ambassador Clark Kerr in Shanghai on the eve of Ambassador Clark Kerr's visit to Chongqing. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, the meeting between these two ambassadors can be said to be 'the precursor to British mediation of the Sino-Japanese War.' At the London China Association banquet four days ago, the British Minister for Coordination of Defence, Lord Chatfield, also foresaw cooperation between China and Japan in the Far East. In theory, we cannot oppose Britain's mediation of peace, but the concept of true peace must mean that China obtains survival in this difficult and arduous war, and becomes stronger and continues to be a sovereign, independent, and territorially complete nation. China will resolutely reject peace negotiations that actually cede territory or are annexed to the Japanese Empire under the pretext of the 'New Order in East Asia' (such as the annexation of Korea). You cannot negotiate peace with someone who is determined to kill you. The only thing you can discuss with them is your funeral."

### German Fleet Arrives in Lisbon

[Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 6th] The German warships "Spee" commanded by Admiral Boehm, the cruiser "Köln," the transport ship "Wasner," and six submarines arrived here on the 6th for a five-day stop.

### British King and Queen Depart for Canada: Thunderous Cheers at London Station; US Prepares Warm Welcome

[Reuters, London, 6th] Prime Minister Chamberlain and other cabinet members were on the platform at Waterloo Station to see off the King. The King boarded the train a few seconds before it departed and had a brief conversation with Foreign Secretary Halifax. The scenes at Buckingham Palace and Waterloo Station were televised. After the King and Queen kissed Queen Mary and members of the royal family, the royal family left the station to see them off. The crowd of well-wishers was very large and the shouts were deafening. When the King's special train arrived at Portsmouth at 2:10 PM, the crowd there also gave enthusiastic cheers. Later, the King and Queen walked through the square to receive the keys to the Portsmouth fortress.

[Reuters, London, 5th] All preparations for the British King and Queen's visit to Canada and the United States have been completed. They will depart from Portsmouth tomorrow on the Empress of Australia of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company. The entourage totals thirty people. Lady Nunham and Lady Seymour will serve as ladies-in-waiting, and Lord Airlie will serve as lord-in-waiting. The King is accompanied by two secretaries and two military attaches. The Empress of Australia has already left Southampton for Portsmouth today. As soon as the King and Queen board the ship, the British naval ensign will be hoisted on the ship. This is the first time that a merchant ship has hoisted the naval ensign without being in service. The British battleship "Repulse" will escort the ship to a certain distance in the Atlantic Ocean. Only two Reuters news reporters and one photographer are allowed to accompany the King. Reporters from other British and American newspapers will gather at the locations where the King and Queen will be staying.

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Interest in the British King's visit to the United States is gradually increasing here. Newspapers are vying to publish portraits of the King and Queen. When the King and Queen arrive in Washington, President Roosevelt, members of Congress, and diplomats will welcome them. A ceremony will be held, and the King and Queen will be escorted to the White House by a cavalry unit, an armored vehicle team, and thirty tanks as guests of President Roosevelt.

### French Cabinet Discusses the Current Situation Yesterday

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th] Well-informed sources say that Litvinov's resignation, Beck's speech, and Poland's memorandum to the German government will be the main issues discussed at the French cabinet meeting this morning. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Bonnet will clarify the French government's attitude towards the Polish memorandum and explain the reasons for Litvinov's resignation and Molotov's appointment as Foreign Minister. At the same time, Prime Minister Daladier will present his speech on France's foreign policy stance, which he will deliver to the parliament on Thursday.

### International Current Situation Column: A Horizontal Discussion (Continued)

— Liao Chongsheng

According to news confirmed in early February, the US authorities have specifically authorized France to purchase military aircraft from it, with a value rumored to reach a huge sum of £13 million. It is also reported that President Roosevelt stated at a hearing of the Senate Military Committee that the United States has the necessity to help democratic countries fight against dictators; and said that he would implement his proposition with actions. Selling aircraft to France is one aspect of this. If the opportunity arises, other democratic countries will be given the same assistance. It is even said that Roosevelt said that 'the American front line is in France'. For a time, the reaction of domestic public opinion was mixed with praise and criticism. Those who supported it said, "The move by Britain and France to purchase aircraft is tantamount to obtaining the privilege of consolidating the outpost of its national defense (referring to the United States) at the price of cash. This transaction is very fortunate for us. From a national defense standpoint, currently supplying Britain and France with one aircraft is equivalent to increasing the US Air Force's aircraft by ten in six months. Because the outer defense line of American peace and security is Britain and France, not the Atlantic Ocean, which is almost obvious." (See New York World Telegram). At the same time, those who criticize it have three main reasons: (1) Selling military aircraft has the disadvantage of exposing national defense secrets. (2) Although there are no explicit provisions prohibiting the supply of German and Italian military equipment, in fact, it will undoubtedly be on the list of restrictions. Now, following France's request and providing it with assistance is tantamount to favoring one over the other, which will inevitably drag the United States into the whirlpool of the European war and then stop. (3) Selling aircraft to France will promote Germany to intensify the expansion of its air force, and at this point, the United States will find it difficult to lag behind others. As a result, it is only enough to increase the unnecessary burden of the people! Summarizing President Roosevelt's defense, in addition to solemnly declaring that the sale of aircraft did not reveal military secrets, he only said that the purpose of this move was twofold: one was to enable the factories to resume work and the unemployed people to be aided. The second is to promote the moderate continuation of the aircraft industry to meet the needs of national defense. As for the argument that favoring one over the other will drag the country into the whirlpool of the European war, it was refuted. When asked if the government would refuse if Germany and Italy applied to purchase aircraft, Roosevelt replied that this was a 'hypothetical' question and did not need to be answered. The implication is not only known by the wise!

President Roosevelt's determination to sanction aggression is already obvious, but to what extent can his proposition be implemented? This is what we are eager to explore. The United States is a country of tripartite checks and balances. According to the provisions of its constitution, the head of the executive branch is the commander-in-chief of the national army, navy, and air force, and has the power to conclude treaties and appoint envoys; however, any treaty concluded and any envoy appointed must be approved and agreed to by the Senate before it can take effect. As for the power to declare war, it is entirely in the hands of Congress. In this situation, the President's influence seems very weak; however, according to historical records, the country's major diplomatic plans have been secretly negotiated by its head of state and envoys without the approval of Congress. Examples are everywhere. For example, the Monroe Doctrine, which is known to everyone, was secretly negotiated by the US President and the British diplomatic authorities, obtaining Britain's tacit agreement to use force as a backing; its establishment was only officially announced by President Monroe and Secretary of State (John Quincy Adams). It was neither requested the approval of Congress nor approved by the Senate, but the whole country was bound by this policy. Another example is when President Theodore Roosevelt served as the mediator in the Russo-Japanese War, he secretly warned Germany and France not to help Imperial Russia; otherwise, the United States would not hesitate to help Japan to resist. This is the most extreme example of the country's president conducting secret diplomacy. After the Treaty of Versailles, which was drafted by President Wilson in person in 1920, was rejected by the Senate, successive presidents, learning from the past lessons, were cautious about secret consultations on international relations. For example, in 1931, President Hoover, in order to alleviate the European economic panic, specifically sought the opinion of the Senate before daring to negotiate the postponement of European war debts for one year, which was so cautious. Although the restrictions of Congress are strict, there are still many ways for the President to control diplomacy.

Brief commentary

### Youth Day Celebration Assembly

The entire Hong Kong Youth League will jointly hold a Youth Day celebration assembly at the Confucius Hall today. In this day when our nation is suffering from indiscriminate bombing and slaughter by the invaders, in this day when our motherland's resistance war has entered a new and difficult stage, we feel that we should give this grand gathering of all Hong Kong youth our utmost attention.

Youth Day was born from the blood of countless martyrs and advanced individuals who have strived for national liberation since the May Fourth Movement! Therefore, when we commemorate Youth Day today, everyone should be extremely solemn and vigilant. Everyone should remember the spirit of the martyrs and advanced individuals who sacrificed themselves for the country and the nation and bravely fought against the invaders, traitors, and national betrayers. Now that the situation is so difficult, the invaders and traitors are even more crazy and vicious, and the lifeblood of the country and the nation is in our youth's hands. How should we respect ourselves and spur ourselves on!

The great alliance of all Hong Kong youth is unprecedented and a day worth commemorating. From today onwards, we must unite closely, advance hand in hand, and form a solid united front. If, after the "ceremony ends and the meeting is adjourned," we are still a scattered pile of sand, this will not only be a betrayal of the significance of this great alliance but also a grave disservice to our country and compatriots! It would also be a great disservice to our martyrs, advanced individuals, and ourselves! Everyone must be determined to self-reproach. If I cannot strive to advocate or promote the regular unity of youth groups in this grand event, it will be a serious failure, and I should be ashamed!

The Youth Self-Renewal Movement is indeed very important to the youth of all circles in Hong Kong. However, we hope that the youth of all circles, especially the youth leaders, can also pay attention to the current issues of learning and self-cultivation in the youth circle. Because the motherland's War of Resistance urgently needs young cadres, and the construction of the rear area and the nation-building cause also require new talents. We cannot be satisfied with merely passing grades in our daily studies. We must also learn the knowledge of striving for national liberation in this great era and cultivate ourselves into pillars of national and social undertakings. These knowledge and self-cultivation can only be obtained in all practical salvation and mass movement work. We youth should no longer be self-enclosed! We should no longer be content with temporary ease! We should take the lives of Jews without a country as a warning; and the spirit of hard struggle of the martyrs and advanced individuals since the May Fourth Movement can be an example for us. Collective learning systems, such as current affairs seminars and lecture meetings, and movement cultivation methods, such as participating in practical salvation work, are all major roads that we should take today. "If the times are not difficult, what use are we?" Let us all move forward from more arduous struggles! The glory of victory? is already beckoning us! Liao Chongsheng

### Western Merchants' Association Forms Special Committee to Study Land Lease Terms Requirements for Extension of 75-Year Lease Terms

The enjoyment and management of building lots in Hong Kong is based on the lease system. Most major cities in the world follow this system. The true owner of all building lots in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong government, and the party with management rights is only the lessee. The lease term for building lots in central Hong Kong is

Lease Term

Some are for 75 years, some are for 999 years, and some are for 75 years plus 75 years. Generally, after the lessee bids and wins from the government, they pay the land price and also pay a certain amount of land tax annually according to the stipulated grade. When the lease term expires, the Hong Kong government can take it back at any time and put it out for bidding again. If the lessee (commonly known as the owner) wants to continue the lease management, they must re-determine the price of the land according to the market price at the time, as well as the amount of land tax to be paid annually in the future, and then pay the government according to the amount before they can obtain the continued management rights of the land. This is the

Land System

The land system in Hong Kong is as described above. However, the lease term for land bidding is divided into three types. Therefore, the initial lessees feel that it is unfair that the building lots under their lease management are only for 75 years, compared to the two lease terms of 75 years plus 75 years (i.e., 150 years, but divided into two terms; after the first 75 years expire, the land price and tax amount must also be re-determined before the second 75-year term can be continued) and 999 years. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the Western Merchants' Association, which forwarded it to the Hong Kong government, requesting that the lease term for the building lots under their lease be

Extended Term

to 150 years without re-determining the land price and tax amount. However, the government department believes that the current land price is quite different from that of decades ago. This kind of request cannot be easily granted. However, according to the original system steps, it is not impossible to re-determine the increased price and tax amount after the expiration. Therefore, it instructed the Western Merchants' Association to conduct a thorough study of the issue and submit a detailed reply for consideration and disposal. Now, the Western Merchants' Association has organized a special committee to start a detailed discussion and study of the current land system in Hong Kong to determine whether it is necessary to modify or change it.

### Concentrate Efforts to Relieve Compatriots Overseas Chinese Association Established Yesterday Inauguration Ceremony Held in Kowloon Yesterday Plans to Establish Branches in Various Places to Work

In order to concentrate the power of overseas Chinese to connect with overseas Chinese, relieve compatriots in distress in various places, and assist in the production of overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese Association held its opening ceremony at the Kowloon Restaurant in [place name unclear] at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a hundred members and guests attended, and the atmosphere was very warm. When the time came, Chairman Zhang Bai [name unclear] led the unveiling ceremony and delivered the opening speech. He briefly stated that the association began preparations in March last year. Although the progress was quite smooth at the time, the drafting of the association's articles of association and the reporting to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs took a long time. At the same time, the fall of Guangzhou caused the preparatory members of the association to be scattered. This really affected the association's progress a lot. Thanks to the joint efforts of all members to maintain and uphold the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's great selflessness, they continued to work hard, hence today's achievements. At the same time, the opening ceremony was delayed until today. The association has a very important responsibility in the midst of national crisis, and the road ahead is long. It is hoped that everyone will work hard on the association's affairs, establish branches in various places, concentrate the strength of overseas Chinese, relieve our displaced compatriots in distress, and abide by the spirit of the general mobilization promulgated by the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, and strive for final victory. After the speech, congratulatory messages from various parties were read, including the Wan'an [name unclear] Association, Zhonghe Academy, Vietnam Tokyo Comrade Society, Zhongshan Longzhen Association of Compatriots, Tengxing Pingle General Labor Union, Wenhua School, and Vietnam China National Salvation Association.

### A Group of Youths Forced to Come to Hong Kong to Fight for the Issue of Hanging Flags in the Shanghai Concession — Qi Zhuo

They Hate Workers Who are Pessimistic Due to Threats from Evil Forces

"Report! I caught three patriotic elements today!"

"Report! I caught five patriotic elements today!"

"Report! There's another meeting going on somewhere, and they've hung up the Chinese flag!"

"..."

The amount of money a petty English traitor can earn each day is directly proportional to the number of patriotic elements they can catch each day. Under the threat of the [unclear] people, the French Concession in Shanghai cannot see the light of day. Compatriots who are separated from their motherland are swallowing their tears and yearning for "Give Me Back My Freedom!"

It was around the 20th of last month when the citizens of Shanghai uniformly hung up the national flag to carry out the spiritual mobilization campaign. A series of moving and tragic events then followed.

Hanging the national flag is a thorn in the side of the [unclear] people and traitors. Fortunately, the International Settlement still has freedom, but the French Concession absolutely forbids it. After the "no permission," what happens? Although the methods are different, the intention of hanging the national flag is the same.

Some adopt a "guerrilla" style. "You tear it down, I'll put the national flag back up. You tear it down, I'll hang the national flag back up." Some sacrifice their businesses by closing their shops and hanging the national flag on the glass windows to see if you dare to smash them. Some hang the national flag in front of locked doors to see who you go to interfere with. ... The French Concession is still a world of national flags. This is where the national soul is entrusted, this is a symbol of indignation.

Then, the tragedy of tearing down the national flag, insulting the national flag, and arresting citizens was openly staged in broad daylight! Young students and the general public could no longer tolerate it and fought with the evil hands, eventually being arrested and thrown into dark iron windows. The entire citizenry became indignant and went on strike.

Collective action forced the evil hands to make some concessions. The "regulation" that originally only allowed the Chinese flag to be hung on National Day was finally increased from one day a year—National Day—to eight days—eight important anniversaries. Although they reluctantly resumed work and the market, the spark of hatred spread and deepened. The "terrorists" who were deemed to be "disrupting the peace of the concession" were finally forced to leave schools and families. Shanghai.

The Shanghai Student Wartime Service Corps was forced to leave Shanghai and was a new salvation work team organized on the ship after leaving Shanghai. There are eleven or twelve of them, four of whom are women, all of whom are middle school students or above, and many of them come from wealthy families. When they were in Shanghai, they belonged to various salvation groups. In order to participate in the struggle for the county flag, they were finally forced to "leave the country immediately," otherwise they would have to "go to jail." Because they had to "leave the country immediately," they fled in a hurry without sufficient preparation. Because they were afraid of being stopped by their families, they secretly left the dark world. Their families still don't know, and it goes without saying that they didn't bring clothes or money. Each person only had a few dozen yuan of national currency hastily borrowed. After paying the fare, they were already "penniless." They arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and are now living in a small school. What about their lives? Thirteen people eat for six cents a meal, either dry bread or porridge, supported by some comrades who still have things they can pawn. They have endured all kinds of hardships while working in Shanghai and are prepared to endure even more hardships in the future. They hate the general workers who are threatened by evil forces and become passive and pessimistic, so their enthusiasm burns like fire and their will is as firm as iron.

Now they are preparing to go to Guilin. When they arrive in Guilin, organizations will contact them, and they will be able to find work opportunities. But how to get from Hong Kong to Guilin? How will they maintain their lives during their stay in Hong Kong? This will depend on the help of the Hong Kong Salvation League and enthusiastic overseas Chinese!

They are a group who have fought against the [unclear] people and traitors in Shanghai; they are a group who have been in prison and suffered hardships; they are a group who are unwilling to be passive and pessimistic due to the threat of evil; they are a group who have escaped "privileged lives" and participated in the arduous national liberation struggle; this group needs our sympathy, help, and encouragement to allow their vitality to develop and grow well in suffering.

### Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senator Hu Mulan Avoids the Road Submits a Telegram to the Authorities Requesting Permission to Resign

The first meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senate is about to be held. All senators are required to report to the meeting between the 11th and 14th. Ms. Hu Mulan, a senator currently residing in Hong Kong, believes that senators must be selected from among those who have made meritorious service and are of outstanding virtue, and from among those who are exceptionally talented in all aspects, so that they can offer novel ideas and wisdom and turn the tide. In recent years, I have been living in Hong Kong to care for my mother and have only occasionally participated in women's work. I am simply following the example of advanced individuals and fulfilling my duty. I believe that I have made very little contribution to the party and the country, so how could I have any other expectations? Yesterday, I sent a telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senate of the Supreme National Defense Conference, requesting permission to resign from the position of Guangdong Provincial Temporary Senator to avoid blocking the path of the worthy.

### New World Theatre Site Lease Will Soon Expire Hong Kong Government Invites Bids for Lease Bidding to be Held on the 15th of This Month

Recently, the number of residents in Hong Kong has increased sharply, and all kinds of retail businesses, due to the large number of consumers, have suddenly become prosperous, especially entertainment venues such as stages and cinemas, all of which are making great profits. Therefore, those who are proceeding to establish cinemas are still actively planning. The New World Theatre, located on Des Voeux Road Central and adjacent to Wing On and Sincere companies, has been specializing in Cantonese films in recent years and has been quite successful. However, the property of the theater belongs to the Hong Kong government. Each time the government grants a lease, it is limited to three years. The lease of the current lessee of the theater will expire on September 1 this year. The government authorities published it in the gazette yesterday, inviting bids for the lease. Those who are interested in undertaking this business can submit a deposit of two thousand yuan to the Hong Kong Land Registry before noon on the 15th of this month. Once the bids are opened in public, the authorities will be able to choose a lessee to grant the lease, which is also for a term of three years. It is reported that there are many people who have been committed to this film entertainment business in recent years, so there should be many contractors competing for the bid at that time.

### Xu Shiying Flew to Chongqing Yesterday Morning to Handle Urgent Relief in Chongqing

It is reported that the exhibition will be officially opened today in the lobby of the Central Theatre on Queen's Road.

### Hong Kong Government Complies with the Situation and Guarantees the Tenants Law Extends the Implementation Period to June 1, 1940 The Attorney General's Revised Draft Will be Submitted to the Legislative Council for Approval

Regarding the Hong Kong government's measures to protect tenants, the authorities enacted the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance last year, limited to one year, and June 1 will be the expiration date. In March, the reporter obtained from semi-official sources that the Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that there have been no major changes in the situation and that the housing problem for residents remains serious, is awaiting the government's continued legal protection, and therefore has the intention to extend the term of this ordinance for another year. At that time, Chinese representative Luo Wenjin also stated that any government with a good political structure will extend the effective term of this ordinance, because the severity of the housing problem when the ordinance was first promulgated was no different from the present. This matter has attracted the close attention of people in society, who are eager for the authorities to extend the term of the ordinance. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Government Gazette published a draft amendment to the ordinance signed by Attorney General [name unclear] Yian, requesting that the effective term of the ordinance be extended to June 1, 1940. In that case, the general public in Hong Kong who are oppressed by some unscrupulous landlords will have more legal protection from the authorities in the coming year. According to the draft ordinance, the 1938 Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, as amended by the 1939 Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, is now re-enacted and amended, and will be approved by the Governor of Hong Kong and agreed to by the Legislative Council to be effectively implemented. The amended articles are as follows: (1) This ordinance may be called the 1939 Eviction of Tenants Amendment Ordinance No. 3. (2) Section 8 of the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance is re-enacted as Section 8 of the 1939 Eviction of Tenants Amendment Ordinance, changing "June 1, 1939" to "June 1, 1940." As for the purpose and reasons for the amendment, there are the following two: (1) Section 8 of the 1938 Eviction of Tenants Ordinance, which is re-enacted as Section 8 of the 1939 Amendment Ordinance on Eviction of Tenants, stipulates that the effective term of this ordinance shall expire on June 1, 1939, and shall not be exceeded unless otherwise amended in this ordinance. (2) The purpose of this draft is to extend the effective term of this ordinance by two years.

### A Harmonious Atmosphere

— Ouyang Yuqian

……Regarding the joint performance of "Huanghuagang"……

Under the principle and goal of resisting the war and building the nation, theatrical workers should unite sincerely and complete their great mission. No one can deny this. Therefore, this joint performance of "Huanghuagang" is of extremely significant meaning. However, joint performances are the most difficult thing to handle. I have participated in two or three joint performances elsewhere before, and none of them proceeded as smoothly as this one.

This time, it was originally scheduled to be staged on March 29th, but due to problems with rehearsals, roles, stage performance and ticket sales, and theater negotiations, it was extended to now - May 3rd, when it was performed at the Taiping Theater. Although the time was delayed and it did not correspond to the March 29th scene, the significance of this joint performance is not simply limited to holding a memorial ceremony on a certain day, but to publicize the historical traces of the revolution, to let people know the difficulty of creating the country, and how we should follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and maintain its glory. The seventy-two martyrs did not die. The heroism of "Huanghuagang" will shine through the ages. We can commemorate it anytime, anywhere. This historical drama has absolutely no time limit.

This joint performance, at least for the most part, broke the situation of each acting on their own and not consulting with each other, demonstrating that the theatrical workers remaining in Hong Kong are standing on the same front line. Just look at the members of each participating theater group, all of them are joining together with twelve points of enthusiasm to form a strong whole, and watching their entire work, revealing excitement and joy. There is no jealousy, no idle talk, only upward progress in work. Moreover, the most valuable thing is that no one used any method or means to organize, but completely automatically united and pushed forward. Based on this spirit, continued efforts can overcome any obstacle. This is worth mentioning.

This performance also went through many difficulties. Just the costumes alone took a lot of effort, and there were countless troubles in many other things, but there were no personnel disputes. This shows the great progress of Chinese youth.

This play uses a lot of actors, and there are several crowd scenes, which are quite difficult to handle. In addition, these crowd actors are played by several different non-professional theater groups, so it is even more difficult. Some friends thought that at least the first day of the performance would be chaotic and unbearable, but unexpectedly it was neat and lively, which shows that the director handled it well. What cannot be ignored is that the young comrades who played the crowd are unusually sincere, so they can get very pleasant cooperation. Especially those groups organized by workers, they are not only on time, but also know the lyrics the earliest. How inspiring this is!

Precisely because so many people are used and they do not perform regularly, all the troubles that joint performances should have are indeed worrying; but in the course of work, one does train oneself. When rehearsing on the dance floor of the Taiping Theater on the afternoon of May 3rd, everyone was worried. A group of workers were extremely busy. The stage installers stayed up all night the night before and did not eat for another day, rushing to put up the scenery. The people in charge of costumes, makeup, and lighting also had no chance to sit down. The directors looked at each other silently, and it seemed that they did not have full confidence in success. Mr. Hu Chunbing, in addition to rehearsing the play, rushed to write many articles for the special issue overnight, with a sleepless, greenish face, constantly walking back and forth, and contacting many people.

The curtain opened, and the play progressed scene by scene. Everyone also gradually put down the stones in their hearts. Serious and tense faces gradually showed smiles. The emotions on stage and the emotions off stage became one, rising to the peak. The audience listened silently, with concentrated and attentive expressions, and the applause that erupted at the end and the slogans echoing the characters in the play gave everyone infinite courage. After the play was over, everyone was exhausted, but after one thing was accomplished, they unconsciously felt a kind of intoxicated joy. This kind of joy, I have directed so many plays since coming to Hong Kong, and I feel that it is the first time I have obtained it. True happiness must come from work!

Of course, the script of "Huanghuagang" still has a few minor points that can be discussed, and the next rerun will definitely be more organized. As for all the actors, some have rich stage experience, and some have only been on stage once or twice, but they cooperate harmoniously, and there is no desire for any particular role to be particularly good or particularly bad. Moreover, those actors who play the crowd and party members naturally reveal their inner passion, which is very moving, exceeding their technical cultivation. This is particularly worth pointing out.

This joint performance of "Huanghuagang" not only proves that the Hong Kong theater community has united under the same goal, but also proves that many young people have broken down the barriers of guilds and factions and achieved pure unity. How touching this is!

### A Living Record of Drama · A Special Feature on the War of Resistance

— Bai Jiang

The Chinese national revolutionary war is a great epic that will never perish, and it is also a great drama that shakes the world. This epic, this drama, is written by gathering the lives of millions of Chinese people, gathering the heads and hot blood of millions of soldiers, and an indestructible spirit. No matter how many poets and dramatists' ideals and activities have been throughout history, they cannot compare to the greater performance manifested by the sacred war in this era and at this stage. Because it is the historical struggle that makes a group of violent murderers and robbers in the world - fascist aggressors - surrender, allows many groups of people who love peace and freedom to win survival, and gives birth to a new era. This struggle is the narrative of a great poem and the performance of a great drama. — The Special Feature on the War of Resistance is one chapter of a living drama record. Since before and after the full-scale War of Resistance broke out the year before last, the China Film Studio has begun to operate, mobilizing Lei film workers in the front and rear to record all the real situations. This is an extremely important task, and its importance is like the weapons and food needed in the front. It is a spiritual weapon and food, transported to support our compatriots at home and abroad, and international friends who care about the safety of this nation.

The Special Feature on the War of Resistance, from volumes one to five, has been released in Hong Kong one after another, each time bringing extremely valuable and rich materials. Now, volume six has also been released in Hong Kong, and the materials are also extremely rich. The recording time of this volume is particularly long, from before the retreat from Wuhan to the present day, which includes the transitional period from the first to the second stage of the War of Resistance. People who have seen volumes one to five can make a comprehensive comparison after seeing volume six. When the first few volumes were released, although we could see the bravery of the warriors and the hardship of the people, we also saw countless weaknesses; but volume six showed a rapid progress in the transitional period of the War of Resistance, which made us have new impressions and new expectations for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The orderly retreat from Wuhan, the efforts of the people to assist the government authorities, the plans and confident deployments of the military, etc., are obviously different from what was seen in the previous volumes, indicating clear progress. A year ago, in the first volume, we saw the disguised Wang Jingwei enthusiastically and pretentiously playing the expression of his patriot and old revolutionary party, and expressing those unfulfilled and irresponsible remarks, but in volume six, this kind of character is no longer seen. Only President Chiang Kai-shek and the majority of military and political leaders who are unyielding and insist on a protracted war of resistance are in the Nanyue Conference in volume six, and they are always consistent, doing their best to carry out the great plan of resisting the war and building the nation. In addition, there are also scenes of civilians in the rear rescuing wounded soldiers, and our army treating wounded soldiers well, and educating prisoners. We clearly see the suffering of soldiers and people in the rear, but volume six records that the people do not give up because of this kind of suffering. On the contrary, they are more willing to see the strengthening of the people's hatred of the enemy, and their firm belief in future victory, when the conspiracy of the traitors to take advantage of the people's suffering as an excuse to seek peace is shattered. Although some of the materials in the entire volume were photographed months ago, and seem to be a little too slow in terms of reporting significance, this situation is of course because the China Film Studio also withdrew west to Chongqing during the retreat from Wuhan, and re-organized and edited it. This was delayed for some time, but the authenticity and richness of the materials in the film will not reduce its value and significance.

A wonderful scene from the Special Feature on the War of Resistance: The Lushan Lone Army calmly fighting.

Drama Movement Status

### The Joint Relief Association of All Circles Urgently Requests the National Salvation Drama Troupe to Perform a Benefit Performance on a Large Scale in Late May

Since the China National Salvation Drama Troupe prepared to go abroad to promote national salvation, and arrived in Hong Kong last month, because of their efforts and remarkable achievements in various parts of the country in the past, they have been warmly welcomed by various cultural groups, women's groups, etc. in Hong Kong, causing a sensation for a time. Now, the Hong Kong Joint Conference of All Circles for the Relief of Chinese Refugees, admiring the troupe's dramatic art, and in order to expand publicity and raise funds to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees, has decided to urgently request the troupe to give a large-scale fundraising benefit performance for the association before going abroad, which will be held in a certain large theater in late May. In addition to actively rehearsing various great anti-war dramas, the troupe has also begun to produce magnificent scenery and lighting. It is believed that the significance of this performance, the artistic essence, the grandeur of the scenery, and the wonderful lighting will break any theater troupe's performance record. In addition to the theater rent, all scenery and performance expenses will be borne by the troupe, which is an unprecedented and meaningful feat in the Hong Kong theater community!

### Discussion on the Historical Facts of "Huanghuagang"

— Pan Jie'an

In order to give the general public a deep and universal understanding of the prelude to the Xinhai national founding revolution and the heroic deeds of the "Seventy-Two Martyrs" who attacked Guangzhou, so as to commemorate the Huanghua Festival; at the same time, in order to raise some money to comfort the families of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, so as to make the commemoration of the Huanghua Festival more meaningful, the Hong Kong Relief Association General Assembly finally accepted the proposal of the Hong Kong drama troupes and staged the great historical drama of the seventy-two people who were buried in Huanghuagang and heroically sacrificed their lives for the country.

Now that the performance has been realized, when the author's yearning for the fruits of this great contribution can really be realized little by little, we naturally have unspeakable ten thousand points of joy; at the same time, the author's many concerns about the arrangement and textual research of this great historical event on that day have also been unfortunately confirmed.

Because of the heavy workload, I didn't even have time to buy and read the script, so I only relied on considerable faith—after more than 20 drama writers' work, and many cultural people's arrangement and review—while waiting for this unprecedented performance.

Undoubtedly, this great performance, as Mr. Hu Chunbing said, has already "organized a subject matter that is difficult to grasp and even more difficult to handle into a script that has flesh and blood, soul, modern meaning, and can be coordinated with the current politics." Whether in the art itself, the anti-war propaganda, especially in the united front of war drama workers and the effect of self-education, it has already laid its considerable results. However, the problem lies in this "difficult to grasp and even more difficult to handle." When the author saw the end, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh and say "difficult"!

As for the concentration of the central force of the drama, it has been done to the best of its ability; as for the fixation of the authenticity of the facts and the retention of more important materials, the author has his own opinions on this, and would like to put them forward for discussion, but because of time, space, and the search for historical facts, they cannot be allowed, so I have to put forward the more easily changed ones, which also belong to the outline, for discussion with everyone.

Here, please talk about three areas: Wen Shengcai. After assassinating Fuqi, it would be best if he could be entangled by a patrol police officer after escaping, and Wen voluntarily disarmed and surrendered to be arrested. This not only conforms to the real fact that Martyr Wen said to the patrol police officer that day: "We are all Chinese people, don't kill compatriots!" It also fully shows Martyr Wen's courage and the great spirit of loving his own race.

The second and third counties. Regarding the issue of postponing the date, according to the old comrades, Chen Jingbo's proposition was a traitor, Hu Yisheng's proposition was too persistent, and Chen Jiongming's was a kind of concern and restraint (which was probably related to the council), and Yao Yu's was to wait clearly. Everyone had different psychological states. However, the performance did not show them one by one, nor did it give any hint of who was good or bad. Naturally, everyone excluded Chen Jingbo. Third, Huang Keqiang's "suicide" after being forced to issue the order to postpone the date is superfluous here in terms of the form of the performance. Of course, because this suicide issue has been discussed by many people; Ba Jin, Mao Dun, etc. believe that Huang felt sorry for the overseas comrades and for Mr. Sun, and had to die to thank them; however, we should know that with Huang's life and qualifications as the leader of the Changjiang secret society for many years, the idea of suicide would not arise in their minds at all. His so-called death to report to the Hong Kong planning department was to imitate Shi Jianru. Wen Shengcai and others sacrificed their lives by fighting alone, so he wanted to rush out and fight Li Zhun after being angry and frustrated. There is no need to have suicidal thoughts and then change his mind to fight.

(2) Use of Names and Terms

It is really nothing to find out the shortcomings of this performance; however, the above-mentioned details show many shortcomings. There are many examples that cannot be remembered, so I will only write down the most important ones; in the prologue, Fuqi is a Manchu, not a Han official. He is loyal to their "Manchu" family and "Manchu" race, but Wen Shengcai laughs and scolds: "Killing one more traitor and one more slave, China can have one less pest!" The biggest mistake in this chest is that Fuqi is not a "Han" traitor, so Wen's scolding is equivalent to not knowing what he is talking about. Moreover, Fuqi's position is General, called Governor, or Master, and whether subordinates or anyone else, they all call him "Commander"; but regardless of Wen Shengcai, or even his subordinate "Commander", he actually calls him a Fu "General." He is not surnamed "Fu," and who would dare to directly call the surname and name of a member of the imperial family? In the second scene, Lin Juemin's wife is actually called Mrs. Lin by comrades. Of course, Juemin's identity and name are problematic. Even if that were the case, how could revolutionaries call her "Mrs." in the same tone as a Manchu slave? This is a bit that! In the third scene, Huang Keqiang and Xu Zonghan actually talk about "love." Isn't this like a Song dynasty person looking up the "Kangxi Dictionary"? Because there was no "love" title at that time. As for the Kuomintang at that time, it was not reorganized and was still the Chinese Revolutionary Party. The name of the premier was not established (established after the Kuomintang-Communist joint in the 13th year of the Republic of China). Even the general party members only called Sun Yat-sen "Mr." without mentioning his surname or name. Qing officials never called them revolutionaries, but directly called them bandits or rebellious parties. This is most in line with what Zhang Mingqi's staff said. It is also incorrect for Qing officials to say that an uprising is a "revolt." It is most appropriate for the staff to say "rebellion" when interrogating party members. This is the most important thing, and other details cannot be listed.

(3) Costumes and Makeup

This is also a military matter. The disguise must be authentic—the most confusing thing here is Zhang Mingqi's long beard. According to what I know and what friends and relatives in Guangzhou at the time said, Zhang was the youngest of the Qing Dynasty governors. He was about 39 years old when he was governor, and at most 41 or 42 in the years of Hai and Xin. Where did he get such a two- or three-inch-long "Gan Zhongsi" thing? Moreover, Zhang was a handsome man. People said that he had a beautiful concubine mother who was always with Zhang. Watching him that night, he was about to die. Second, Chen Jiongming's behavior in the party was always undesirable, but everyone knew one or two about his simplicity. His blue cloth gown in the council era and his gray cloth gown after the uprising can represent his rank. However, Chen actually put on a gorgeous silk gown and added a vest that Guan officials in Xiguan did not have. This made the author dare not believe that it was him if Keqiang had not called him Jiongming.

The above briefly expresses my personal opinions for everyone to discuss. Because of the rush of time, if everyone is very happy, we can talk about it later when we have time.

Editor's Note: The performance of "Huanghuagang" promoted strong cooperation in the theater community and enthusiastic resonance from the audience. However, we also want to discuss technical issues. This is necessary to expand the field of drama. Mr. Pan's article is just the beginning of a discussion. In addition to asking the gentlemen of the "Huanghuagang" directing team to be responsible for answering questions, we also hope that readers will actively participate in the discussion.

### The 741st Performance

— Wang Ying

On the second evening, Xuzhou City was still immersed in darkness. The wind and sand hit the windows of our house in gusts, and all the glass was broken by shrapnel.

In the morning, we wrote several news reports, one of which was published in the Xuzhou Min Guo Daily, describing what methods we would take in the future to perform dramas in rural battlefields and other places without stages, and how to achieve the effect of propaganda among the vast public. In the afternoon, we arranged the small auditorium; a small colored cloth was hung in front of the curtain. Three screens were arranged on the stage, which was all of our stage equipment.

More and more people came, filling the temporary small theater. There was no light, and the audience waited in the dark for the opening.

Backstage, on the narrow aisle, there was a table and a few long wooden benches. All of us were squeezed together, busy with makeup under the dim candlelight. Everyone roughly drew the characters with brushes and lead powder.

Donglin (played by Jinshan), who was extremely vicious in "Since September 18th"

At about 8 o'clock, the lights came on and the program began. "Dear Comrades," the blue curtain was opened, and applause and speeches were carried out enthusiastically at the same time. We explained the significance of coming to Xuzhou this time, and told the audience that we were going to abandon the road of drama we had taken in the past, and open up a new road in the War of Resistance—to use drama as a weapon of propaganda to participate in the War of Resistance. Finally, we said: "If there is an air raid alarm, because there are too many people, please do not go outside the theater. All of us will sit on the stage and talk with you and tell stories."

The curtain closed and then opened.

Living Newspaper "Defend the Motherland"

Prologue, allegorical drama "Since September 18th": In the Northeast, a peaceful and happy family, the whole family is living in harmony. One day, a Donglin, who is full of kindness, co-existence and co-prosperity, suddenly broke in and forcibly took away the eldest daughter (the three northeastern provinces). Just as the whole family was sad and indignant, the short and vicious neighbor, greedy and unscrupulous, then snatched away the second daughter (Rehe); at this time, the father and son felt that peace was at the mercy of others, and they were determined to defend themselves. If he comes again, I will definitely drive him out! The father said in grief and indignation. As a result, when the neighbor came to snatch the third daughter (Pingjin), the whole family united and resisted unanimously, and finally drove Donglin out of this peaceful family. At the end of the curtain, the audience shouted loudly: Completely drive ×× out of China!

Act 1: The night before "August 13th", representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai and Mayor Yu Hongjun were meeting at the city government. Each representative expressed their determination to resist, "We are all prepared," they said. The clock stopped pointing at 3:50, ten minutes away from the final time limit; the electric bell rang, it was ××'s final time-limited reply. When the mayor took the telephone receiver to prepare to speak, a collective roar was emitted from behind the curtain: No Surrender! No Surrender! There were our comrades in the audience responding, and as a result, the audience also shouted: No Surrender! No Surrender!, the stage and the audience roared together, Mayor Yu said simply and powerfully into the telephone receiver: We will give you a reply at 4 o'clock.

Act 2: The Eight Character Bridge in Shanghai, the flag of Blue Sky, White Sun and Whole Earth is majestically flying in front of the trenches, the brothers are quietly aiming, the officer is looking at the watch, 3:56, 57... One minute after another passed, and at 4 o'clock, a loud noise, sparks erupted, the brothers bravely rushed out of the trenches, and the bugle of Wei Feng was sounding sadly.

Act 3: Place a loudspeaker in front of the closed blue curtain; first report the name of the radio station, and then broadcast the Supreme Leader's Lushan Declaration to the audience in an impassioned form. The venue was very quiet, and the faces of the audience were filled with grief and indignation.

Note: The actors who played the eldest daughter, second daughter, and third daughter sewed a piece of white cloth on their backs with the words—Three Northeastern Provinces——Jehol——Tianjin——etc. to symbolize these places, but they were not allowed to be seen by the audience when they were taken away by Donglin. (To be continued)

### After the "Huanghuagang" Performance

— By Si Conghuimin

…A salute to the great successes within many failures…

Theater

If judged from a purely technical or aesthetic standpoint, perhaps this performance of "Huanghuagang" could be deemed a failure, as there were many unrefined shortcomings in the script and the acting. However, we can also see great successes within many failures: we can observe the audience's soaring emotions, the unified response between the stage and the audience, and the extremely full realization of the effect that "Huanghuagang" aimed to achieve. This performance of "Huanghuagang" has undoubtedly established an unprecedented beacon for wartime theater movements in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the depth of emotion felt by the audience was also unprecedented in Hong Kong. I was moved by this kind of passionate fervor and, like the audience, forgot about the shortcomings of the performance, deeply respecting the efforts of the comrades involved.

This performance involved theater groups from all over Hong Kong, with over 300 backstage and front-of-house staff participating. This is not only unprecedented in Hong Kong but also rare in the history of Chinese theater movements. I recall that after the July 7th Incident occurred the year before last, playwrights in Shanghai also swiftly created a play script to defend Lugou Bridge and launched a joint performance by all Shanghai theater practitioners on the eve of the August 13th Incident. This event was a significant stimulus to the theater scene at the time. Who would have known that just over twenty months later, Hong Kong, previously considered a barren land for wartime theater, would also experience a similar, great stimulus in the theater world. Generally speaking, the collective effort of many individuals and groups is powerful and effective. However, on the other hand, the more groups and people involved, the easier it is for the work to become chaotic. Before the performance, I was concerned for the comrades working on this project, not to mention the pre-production, rehearsals, and various stage setups. With so many people on stage and such a tight performance schedule, the work backstage and front-of-house during the run would be troublesome enough. But the facts proved my worries unfounded. The performance showed us that it was conducted in a very orderly and planned manner. The transitions of actors, scenes, and set changes were all handled smoothly. Apart from the slightly longer transition time from Act III to Act IV, the rest were at most fifteen minutes, with the fastest being ten minutes. Given the limitations of the less-than-perfect facilities, this was already very satisfactory.

The entire performance lasted from 8:15 PM to 12:00 AM, a total of more than three and a half hours. For a play with four acts and six scenes and a considerable amount of dialogue, this performance time was appropriate. This indicates that the performance was able to harness the advantages of teamwork while overcoming the shortcomings mentioned earlier. Deep respect should be extended to all those who participated in this work, especially those working backstage and front-of-house!

Based on what I saw on the first day, there were still many shortcomings, but there should be some improvements in the following two days. Now, I will offer a brief opinion based solely on the situation on the first day, hoping that theater comrades will provide corrections and supplements:

The prologue was relatively well-rehearsed in the entire play, and the set and lighting were good. Unfortunately, due to the shallow stage depth, the backdrop was too close, and the lighting for the scenery and the front of the stage could not be adequately arranged. The scenery on both sides obstructed the actors' performance. Among the actors, the one playing the Wei army commander, Nuchao, was better, while the others, such as Xi Feng playing Huang Xiayi and Mo Yan playing Passerby B, were also very diligent. The roles of the honor guards and Wei soldiers were too casual, somewhat resembling the "extra" roles on the opera stage. This was a significant flaw in the performance and ruined the theatrical effect. Throughout the play, many actors playing crowd scenes and similar roles made the same mistake. This situation may be due to the allocation of roles or negligence during rehearsals, or perhaps it is due to the actors' own misconceptions about the concept of collective activity in theater. In old-fashioned theater, the focus was often on the acting skills of a certain individual, with other roles serving as supporting characters. However, this misunderstanding cannot be retained in new theater. Everything on stage, every character that appears, regardless of their position or time on stage, is deeply connected to the entire performance. If a part is neglected, it is equivalent to neglecting the whole. This is a very common and easily made mistake.

Huang Zongbao, played by Wen Shengcai, worked hard, but it seems that his personality was not entirely appropriate for portraying this national hero of Huanghuagang. As soon as Wen Shengcai appeared, he looked like a fierce and somewhat inhumane traitor, as seen when he collided with Passerby B upon entering. If the intention was to portray someone whose personality had become abnormal due to extreme persecution and stimulation, it should only be a certain degree of irritability, stubbornness, and resentment. However, for someone like Wen Shengcai, a sense of justice and chivalry must be expressed, which was not achieved. Perhaps this was due to the script. The assassination and arrest scene was a failure. The fight between Wen Shengcai and the Wei soldiers was so perfunctory that the audience laughed at the most tense moment. Furthermore, the sound effects were not properly utilized during the assassination, which were all factors contributing to the failure.

The arrangement of characters and stage activity in the first act were very appropriate. However, the pace of the second half of the act was not appropriately rehearsed. Actors such as Huang Ninglin playing Yu Peilun, Wang Keng playing Yao Yuping, Xu Guoyu playing Fang Shengdong, and Lu Dun playing Huang Kecheng were all very good, and each character's personality was expressed quite clearly. Li Chenfeng, who played Lin Juemin, was slightly lacking. For someone as passionate and witty as Lin Juemin, there was not enough emotion felt in the entire performance, especially in the section where he recounted past events with suppressed pain after Mrs. Lin left. The atmosphere of terror in the scene of the Qing officials' search was insufficient. The movements of the party members indoors were forced. In the moment when Zong Han opened the door and the officials entered the room to search, the people inside showed no startled reaction. The dangerous key moment arranged in the script, the revealing of the list of party members, was not well executed in terms of visualization and timing.

The scene in the second act was well-positioned, but unfortunately, it lacked splendor. Of course, this was due to the limitations of economic conditions. The alternation of events in the entire act was not clear, and the tension was not as strong as it should have been, which was the biggest shortcoming. The scene where the maid teased the servant A in the first part was not well-rehearsed, so it became a burden and did not achieve the desired effect. After Ying Bosheng entered and reported, the pace of the play's development should have sharply increased, but due to the slow movements of the actors and their lack of familiarity with the lines, the transition was significant. Zhang Chishan, who played Zhang Mingqi, did not move quickly enough, and his lines were not very fluent. Deng Zhujun, who played Zhang's concubine, lacked naturalness in her performance, with many movements being too vulgar. Jiang Ming, Qiu Xinghai, and others who have always played important roles in the China Arts Theater only played extremely unimportant roles such as male servants in this performance. Breaking the old notions without considering the status of professional theater troupes, this attitude and this work ethic are very commendable.

The lighting change and set design in the third act were the best in the entire play. The positions of the characters and the stage activity were also quite appropriate. At the beginning, the movements of the characters in the dark room and the tones of their lines were not properly coordinated with the atmosphere of the stage. The performers seemed to be working just as hard as in the first act. In terms of the play's development, this act should have gradually accelerated and heightened until the brief pause in the play's tension when the debate over postponing the date was hesitant and unresolved. The director probably attempted to achieve this effect, but it failed due to the performers' lack of familiarity with their movements and lines. In the scene where Huang Kecheng announced the postponement amid conflicting emotions and then retracted it, the inner pain, disappointment, and impulsiveness of Kecheng were not visually effective enough. Qu Ai, who played Xu Zonghan, was not stern enough in her performance in the scene where she persuaded Kecheng, and she also seemed to lack genuine emotion. The ending of this act achieved a good effect, but unfortunately, the actors' tones were not strong enough, and they did not elevate the lines and the audience's emotions in unison.

The fourth act was performed the worst, mostly due to the script. I remember the shortcomings I saw in the Guangzhou performance last year are still present, especially in the part about attacking the governor's office later on. It was simply chaotic. The audience's emotions were not stirred up but rather became indifferent, and some places were so perfunctory that the audience burst into laughter. Furthermore, there were many shortcomings in various aspects. The stage atmosphere in the scene where Chen Gengxin and Rao Guoying were interrogated lacked a sense of terrifying pressure. Zhang Mingqi should not have been smiling during the interrogation. It was absolutely necessary to avoid the soldiers spraying water to awaken Rao, as this would cause the audience to laugh with counter-effect. Zhang Mingqi's performance when he left the court was too exaggerated. The conversation between the soldiers about the revolutionaries that followed interrupted the tense atmosphere. The scene where the revolutionaries broke into the hall was not enthusiastic enough. The lines, sound effects, and movements were not organically interwoven. The positions and movements of the extras were not appropriately arranged, and there were too few of them. These were all shortcomings that caused the fourth act to lose a great deal of theatrical impact.

The epilogue was, of course, the decisive moment of the entire play. Zhong Qinan's speech, the speeches of the soldiers and young audience members, moved the audience's emotions word by word. The performers responded to the audience's emotions with the most passionate and genuine feelings. This act can be said to have been a complete victory, a complete victory for Hong Kong theater.

The above are all my personal shallow opinions, and what I have discussed is only a very small part. There may be inappropriate places. I hope that theater comrades will provide corrections and supplements.

In short, the performance of "Huanghuagang" was indeed a great success within many failures. I hope that the theater practitioners staying in Hong Kong will cherish this valuable experience, improve its shortcomings, and make this large-scale, united performance a solid milestone in the progress of the theater movement!

### Baseball Game Worth Watching Today: Chinese Team Battles American Sailors; A Fierce Clash Is Inevitable When the Two Champions Meet Today; South China vs. Hong Kong Club Game Postponed

At 10:00 AM today, there will be an open baseball league game at Caroline Hill, with the Chinese team facing the USS Mindanao team. According to the original schedule, the second game was supposed to be between Hong Kong Club and South China Club. However, because South China's preparations were not yet complete, they requested a postponement, which was approved. It is rumored that baseball recorder Smith stated that South China may be able to field a team today for an exhibition game against Hong Kong Club. Whether this is true will be known at the time.

The Chinese team is the champion of last year's league and international competition. The Mindanao team is also a strong team. A fierce battle is inevitable when the two champions meet today. However, the lineups of both teams have changed this year. Some good players from the Chinese team have left. Coach Liu Dacheng is currently far away in Honolulu, catcher Luo William is studying in the South, third baseman Chen Lianyao is on Rhodes Island, and Huang Guoqing is also studying abroad. This year's strength seems to be less than last year's peak. However, the team is organized by overseas Chinese from various places and will not suffer from a lack of talent. Recently, there have been rumors that players from Canada and Honolulu will participate, so repeating as champions in the future is well within expectations. It is said that the players who will play today will be Huang Jun, Chen Lunying, Lin Ye, Chen Fang, Zhong Cansen, Cai Bingfen, Hu Zhengqu, Zheng Limen, Chen Lian, Lu Jiaxing, etc.

The Mindanao team also has a group of good players. Pitcher Lu Ailu fills the role of catcher, and his skills are high. Others such as Zha Shi and Ma Shi are all outstanding talents. The team's roster is listed below:

USS Mindanao

(Pitcher) Ailu (Catcher) Tan Mashi, Zha Shi, (First Base) De Jilishi, (Second Base) Jia Yunuo or Zha Shi, (Shortstop) Mai Jinmi, (Third Base) Diao Shi, He Dun, (Left Field) Hu Yili, (Center Field) Qi Luchen, (Right Field) Ta Li, (Reserve) Du Chi,

Yesterday's Friend Beer Wins Over Occidental

At 2:30 PM yesterday, the first game kicked off, with the Occidental Club playing against the Friend Beer team. Many Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen came to watch. Before the game, the two teams lined up. Li Anna (captain of the Friend Beer team) and A Luweishi (captain of the Occidental team) introduced the players to American Consul General Edison Yixiuda and Sir Shoushen respectively. Then, the American Consul performed the opening ceremony.

The Occidental Club's lineup lost Da Gaoshan Nu and Bi Lude, which had an impact on their offensive and defensive strength. However, those who started later all made progress and fought quite hard. In the first two innings, they were still able to compete evenly with Friend Beer. However, from the third inning onwards, due to several new players lacking experience, Friend Beer took the lead and soared upwards. Friend Beer eventually won 8-4.

Friend Beer is the incarnation of last year's Volunteer Army team. This year, they received sponsorship from the Friend Beer Brewery, and their equipment is complete and their uniforms are neat. They played with extra vigor. At the same time, T. Anna, who has over ten years of experience, filled the role of first base. Yesterday, countless opposing players died at his hands. In the last three innings, the defense was especially solid. The Chinese team should pay attention when they meet them in the future.

The Occidental Club got ten hits in total, and there were opportunities to score. Unfortunately, there were as many as six errors, which prevented them from winning. Instead, they allowed runners to be out. This was the main reason for the defeat. Friend Beer got eight hits and three errors. The ratio was better than the Occidental Club, but three errors in total is not a good sign for a strong team either. The names and scores of both teams are recorded below:

Occidental Club

(Pitcher) Pala Ci, (Left Field) Ding A Luweili Shi, (First Base) Ba Luoshi, (Second Base) Wen Dusha, (Third Base) Bu Le Da, (Catcher) A. Luweishi, (Right Field) Fei Jialidu, (Center Field) Ma Kuishi, (Shortstop) A Luweishi,

Friend Beer Team

(Second Base) Susha, (Right Field) Shou Nabi Shi, (First Base) T. Li Anna (Shortstop) Li Anna, (Pitcher) Xia Gaoli, (Third Base) Xia Xian, (Left Field) Bei Shi, (Right Field) Bo Liannu, (Center Field) S. Li Anna, (Catcher) Rong Li,

Scores of Both Sides

Occidental 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 = 4

Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total

Friend Beer 1 2 2 0 3 0 0 = 8

### A Good Soccer Match Today: Eastern Battles Macao Team; Huang Wengui Helps Eastern; Meet at Hong Kong Club at 4:30 PM

…This afternoon, there will be an exciting soccer match at the Hong Kong Club in Happy Valley. The Macao All-Stars team is coming to Hong Kong to play against the Eastern Club team, the runner-up in the First Division League. The game is scheduled to start at 4:30 PM. Tickets are priced at one dollar, fifty cents, and thirty cents. Previously issued honorary tickets are invalid (because these honorary tickets are limited to the league, and now that the league has ended, they are invalid. Reporters must enter with their business cards). Open at 3:00 to avoid crowding…

…Milo, the director of the Macao Football Association, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon and immediately visited Hong Kong Football Association and Eastern Club directors Schopfer and others. Matters relating to today's game have been properly discussed. He also stated that the Macao team is coming to Hong Kong with a determination to win. The Macao team has made significant progress in recent years, having drawn with the British Gordon team (1-1) and defeated the Philippine Intercity team and the Singapore Chinese team (both 2-0). They are confident in their strength and have much to offer. The last time they lost to the Hong Kong Intercity team was because the central Asian player Ashu was absent, forcing forward star Ga Laisu to retreat to midfield, which slightly affected both offense and defense. At the same time, Hong Kong goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai performed excellently, leaving no gaps to exploit, and they suffered defeat. This time, they guarantee to give Hong Kong soccer fans a good impression. Mr. Mi said this with considerable self-confidence, so he advised the Eastern players not to be overconfident and to be cautious in order to maintain the "Red Army" name…

### Friendly Soccer Match: South China Defeats Foreign Sailors; A Spirited Performance with a Score of 6-3

The South China football team is preparing to head south for the campaign. To intensify training, a group of them went to the Caroline Hill stadium at 4:30 PM yesterday to compete with the British Navy's HMS Medway football team.

Yesterday, the South China players were all in high spirits and worked together. Although the foreign sailors tried to resist stubbornly, they were ultimately unable to shake our army in the slightest. As a result, South China won with a score of 6-3, achieving a great victory.

During the game, South China initially fielded Zhong Yongsen, Lin Depu, Xie Jinhong, and other players. Because their coordination was disorganized, there was nothing very exciting to see. Except for Shui Yi's goal seven minutes after the kickoff, thanks to Zhong Ye's wonderful pass, there were no further gains. This was all due to a lack of understanding and coordination.

Although Yongsen tried his best to perform yesterday, he lacked accuracy because he had not practiced for a long time. Jin Hai was somewhat satisfactory. Although Bei Hua was brave, he was not as formidable as he was in his prime. The two central defenders were only average. Zhao Zheng was quite satisfactory.

In the second half, the situation changed quite a bit after Ying Qi, Genbao, and Bai Wei came on the field. The attack was sure to succeed, and the defense was as solid as a rock. The game was more exciting than in the first half. First, Ying Qi took advantage of Shui Yi's corner kick and headed the ball into the net. Then, Navy player Xisaludun scored a goal in the key area during a counterattack. In the blink of an eye, left midfielder Jiashouba charged forward and regained a goal, tying the score at 2-2.

A little later, Shui Yi got another opportunity and scored again. Jin Hai also added the finishing touches twice, creating a stable winning situation again. At this time, the foreign sailors seemed unwilling to lose and launched a large-scale attack. Finally, Gaolusi scored a long-range shot, and Yin Gelun and Xisaludun took the opportunity to put the ball into the net, making the score 5-3. South China still had the advantage. As the game was about to end, Ying Qi took advantage of Shui Yi's high pass and scored another goal, winning 6-3. The players from both sides are as follows:

South China Club (First Half)

Zhu Zhaoheng, Li Guo, Ruan Shu, Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Qingcai, Yang Shuiyi, Lu Dakeng, Zhang Jinhai, Ye Bei Hua, Zhong Yongsen

South China Club (Second Half)

Zhu Zhaoheng, Liang Baiwei, Ruan Shu, Li Guo, Liu Qingcai, Yang Genbao, Lu Dakeng, Jin Hai, Yingqi, Zhang Jinhai, Yang Shuiyi

Medway Team

Chi, Chawen, Buluogan, Jia Hubo, Luo Aohua, Jia Lelu, Gelu Ling Shi, Yin Gelun, Jia Salupo, Gaolusi, Yan Shi Youdu

It is learned that South China will play against the Navy teams again next Tuesday and Thursday. Which team they will play against will be reported in the next issue.

### Two Former Chinese Soccer Stars Die in the Line of Duty in Lanzhou; Patriotic Heroes Fu Jiaxing and Ye Pengfei

[Our Reporter] Many soccer fans will not forget the names Fu Jiaxing and Ye Pengfei. Six or seven years ago, they were admitted to the Guangzhou Aviation School to practice flying. After graduating, they served in the Air Force.

When the Chinese Sports Association soccer team was gradually declining, they joined the Chinese team along with Chen Ronghe and Xu Yahui, who were classmates, and shed a lot of blood and sweat on the soccer fields of Hong Kong.

At that time, soccer was also flourishing in Guangzhou. The Navy, Air Force, and Police teams were competing for supremacy. Fu and Ye were the mainstays of the Air Force team at that time.

Since the outbreak of the war, Fu and Ye were ordered to transfer to Kunming for training and lived a hard-working life. They were passionate youths with a strong desire to serve the country. They thought that after training, they would be able to participate in the war, drive God-like planes and kill the enemy to fulfill their soaring ambitions.

Who would have known that their ambitions would not be realized before they died in the line of duty? The tragic news is saddening. Fu and Ye died in the line of duty in Lanzhou on a certain day last month.

The reason for their deaths was that they were practicing flying together in a plane, but for some reason, the plane crashed and fell from a high altitude. Thus, these two brave and promising flying heroes unfortunately perished with the plane. (Dong Lang)

Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines - by Li Binghong

Three Generations of Guerrillas - by Ding Cong

### Starting with Cartoons

— Li Fanfu

The War of Resistance has entered its second stage, and the responsibility borne by us cartoonists can be said to be growing heavier day by day. Chairman Chiang has hinted to us that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the ideological war is more important than the military war. Therefore, the expansion and intensification of cultural work is an inevitable path from now on!

Today, as we intensify cultural work to strengthen the ideological war, the demand for cartoons will become more urgent. In the past, education in China has not been popularized, so there are many illiterate people! Propaganda through words will feel quite difficult. To solve this difficulty, cartoons have this power. To stimulate the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people, to enhance the people's belief in victory, to promote the spirit of the people, and to raise the people's awareness, cartoons can go where written propaganda cannot. It can penetrate into the people, and it can make even the illiterate feel fond of it and understand its meaning.

China has been resisting for twenty-one months. The invaders are heading towards the grave, but we are heading towards the bright path. Final victory is absolutely certain. Although in the past twenty months, we have sacrificed many hot-blooded heroes and given up many towns and cities, the deeper the invaders go, the deeper their feet sink into the mud. Our current difficulties are precisely the harvest of the future—and we knew about these difficulties from the beginning of the War of Resistance. We will never change our established plan for the War of Resistance because of the current difficulties. Only the insane and cowardly would utter any talk of peace in the midst of this final victory. Precisely because some people are uttering talk of peace, our responsibility is all the more heavy. Therefore, at this critical moment of life and death, we cartoonists, in this turbulent era, can only work harder! Work harder! Work harder! Until the fascist Japanese army is driven out of Chinese territory!

Exile - by Mai Fei

### Let Us Learn from the Cartoonist Raemaekers!

— Huang Ding

To go back to the time of the European War, when the unarmed Belgian merchant ship *Lusitania* was sunk by a German submarine in the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds of children who were about to be taken to safety were killed tragically at the hands of the invaders. They could not see their parents, they could not see their beloved toys, they lay quietly on the deck of a corpse-retrieval ship, large and small, and the sailors arranged their bodies on both sides, waiting for the heartbroken people to come and claim their beloved children. What a tragic scene it was! The anti-aggression painter Raemaekers sincerely depicted this cartoon, so that everyone who saw it was moved, and people with children wept when they saw it.

Raemaekers was very sympathetic to Belgium, which was invaded by the German army at the time, but he was just an unknown Dutch cartoonist. Because he hated war and the atrocities of the invaders, he expressed his passion for human love in his own works. As his immortal cartoons were printed in newspapers in the Netherlands, the propaganda effect of cartoons against aggression quickly penetrated the eyes and hearts of just and fair people all over the world. Therefore, newspapers and magazines in countries that upheld justice reprinted the works of this great cartoonist in the shortest possible time, and Raemaekers' name spread throughout Europe and the United States, and he received the most sublime praise. The *Times* praised him as "the greatest war writer in Europe or America." This is very accurate.

Raemaekers' achievements are entirely due to his noble feelings and his righteous conscience. At the same time, he also had particularly skilled painting techniques. He was very faithful and did not compromise on the form of things. Every one of his cartoons had his soul, and everyone, young and old, was moved by them. His technique is an extremely faithful and simple expression. His depiction of the atrocities of the German army in Belgium at that time is completely a true record. Witnesses in the British court would swear to his published collections, saying: "Honest, completely honest, and nothing but honest." From this sentence, we can see Raemaekers' attitude towards drawing.

He not only left an indelible impression in the minds of righteous people, but he also made those who were satirized feel uneasy. He once wrote a cartoon called "Innocent Slaughter," which depicted the ghosts of many children and women who were killed by the German army appearing in the blurry smoke, surrounding Emperor Wilhelm, the main culprit of the war, causing Wilhelm II, who heard the voice of justice, to feel terrified. This cartoon made Wilhelm feel the greatest shame, and he could only offer a reward of six thousand yuan to hunt down Raemaekers as a means of revenge, but Raemaekers had already moved to London at the time.

Raemaekers' greatness deserves a prominent place in the history of the European War, and his sublime artistic soul is what we deeply admire! His spirit of fighting for human justice is what we should learn!

China is now being ravaged by the invaders. The suffering that China is suffering today is probably no less cruel than that suffered by Belgium during the European War. Today, the aggressors who are oppressing China are believed to be even more brutal than Germany during the European War! The Chinese people have all risen up to resist. However, what we currently lack is someone like Raemaekers who can faithfully record the atrocities of the invaders.

Chinese cartoonists! Do you want to be a Raemaekers?

### Strengthen the Power of the Intellectual War

— Lin Chen

Resistance is the Only Way Out - by Chen Yanqiao

According to military experts, the determination of a war depends on three conditions: armaments, money, and personnel. However, the morale that controls the entire war is even more powerful than these. If your armaments are complete, your money is abundant, and your personnel are sufficient, but you lack the morale of war, then you will definitely be the victim of this war. Therefore, some people say: intellectual war is actually more important than material war.

Looking at the wars in history, there are countless examples of success due to intellectual war. The success of the Russian October Revolution and Kemal's rebuilding of Turkey are both good examples. As long as we apply it properly, a pen may be more powerful than a gun.

In China today, we need international understanding on the outside and the people's understanding on the inside. Pictorial propaganda is more effective and profound than written propaganda. "Cartoons" have thus become a powerful sentinel in the intellectual war. Since the War of Resistance, cartoonists have unanimously focused their pens on the internal organs of the invaders, clearly narrating and frankly exposing them, making the Japanese, who are accustomed to lying and deceiving, extremely embarrassed. However, the cartoon movement may be a bit unfamiliar and has not yet gained the understanding of all our compatriots. Due to objective circumstances, the progress of this movement has been very slow. Does this mean that cartoonists have abandoned their mission? No, this is purely because the environment does not allow the cartoon field to grow independently, forcing the cartoon movement to take a curved development path.

Although this exhibition of modern Chinese cartoons does not have many works, it can give a further understanding of the prototype of today's Chinese cartoon movement to people who do not understand it, so that they can understand the task of the cartoon movement, give correct criticism, and cultivate it with sympathy, then the Chinese cartoon movement will develop smoothly step by step.

In order to enrich the ability to resist the war, we must improve the ranks of the intellectual war. In order to improve the ranks of the intellectual war, we must actively carry out the cartoon movement. This exhibition is just the beginning of the work. We hope that comrades from all walks of life can give us some correct guidance to strengthen the power of the intellectual war.
