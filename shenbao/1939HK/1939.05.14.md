### Post-War Education in Jiangsu

— Ma Fangyuan

In the past, the educational endeavors of Jiangsu Province were the most developed in the entire country. Apart from the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, there were eight colleges and universities, forty-one provincial secondary schools, thirty-three provincial elementary schools and compulsory education experimental zones, fourteen provincial social education institutions, sixty-eight county secondary schools, and one hundred and six private secondary schools. In total, there were over one thousand secondary school classes, accommodating over fifty thousand secondary school students. Each county had over eight thousand county-run elementary schools and junior elementary schools, with over fifteen thousand classes in total, accommodating over seven hundred and fifty thousand elementary school students. (The above figures are approximate for the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, not including compulsory education classes.) In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, the total provincial education budget was over six million four hundred thousand yuan, and the total county education budget was over eleven million two hundred thousand yuan. The prosperity of the endeavor was unparalleled. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Jiangsu Province has become a war zone. At first, the scope of the war was limited to the corner of Songhu, but it later expanded to both sides of the Yangtze River. Educational institutions in Jiangsu Province were either raided by air or burned down, resulting in incalculable losses. However, China's strength in the War of Resistance and the spirit of national reconstruction in the War of Resistance have been increasing day by day. Under the arduous struggle of the military and political authorities in various counties in northern Jiangsu, complete institutions have been maintained. Although the educational endeavors of Jiangsu Province have undergone many changes this year, fortunately, they have not been interrupted. Even amidst the raging flames of war, the sound of learning can still be heard. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of colleagues in the Jiangsu Province education sector. Now, the recent educational situation in Jiangsu is described in detail below:

(1) Changes in the Provincial Education Administrative Organization: The internal organization of the Department of Education originally consisted of the Secretariat, the Inspectorate, the Compilation and Review Office, the First Section (managing higher and secondary education), the Second Section (managing local education administration and primary education), the Third Section (managing social education), and the Fourth Section (managing education funding). In addition, there were the Education Funding Committee, the Secondary School Teacher Certification Committee, the Elementary School Teacher Certification Committee, the Compulsory Education Committee, and the Compulsory Literacy Education Committee, each responsible for various tasks. In the spring of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the provincial government temporarily moved to Huaiyin, and the internal organization of the Department was slightly reduced, consisting of the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding matters), the Second Section (managing local education administration and primary education matters), and the Third Section (managing secondary education matters). Later, the Third Section was merged into the Second Section. The most recent organization consists of the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing education endeavors), the Inspectorate, the Compilation and Review Office, and a Shanghai Office to handle all matters related to the resumption of classes by schools in the province that have relocated to Shanghai.

(2) Changes in County Education Administrative Organs: Before the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, the education bureaus in various counties of the province were divided into five levels based on the amount of education funding. The internal organization of each bureau was divided into three sections: General Affairs, School Education, and Social Education. In the first semester of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Department of Education formulated the "Methods for Consolidating and Reducing the Departments and Sections of the Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province," stipulating that education bureaus in counties where the actual revenue of education funding was more than 80,000 yuan and the county's education endeavors could mostly be maintained as before could continue to exist. The internal affairs of the bureau were consolidated, and the staff and administrative expenses were reduced, with the internal affairs of the bureau being managed by the General Affairs and Education Sections. In counties where education funding was less than 80,000 yuan and most of the education endeavors were suspended, the original bureaus were temporarily merged into the First Section of the county government. As for the education administrative organization in the occupied areas, it was completely destroyed.

In the second half of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Department of Education, in order to restore education endeavors in the occupied areas, re-established the education administrative organization in the occupied counties, and set up education supervisors in each administrative region, responsible for inspecting, assessing, guiding, and urging education in their respective regions. County inspectors were set up in each county (education bureaus and sections could still be set up when necessary), working with the county government and handling all education matters in the county under the leadership of the county magistrate. In each district below the county level, no separate education committees were set up. The head of each autonomous region was responsible for planning, promoting, supervising, and guiding education. In districts where county-run elementary schools had already been established, the county government could order the principals to concurrently serve as education committee members, undertaking education guidance in the district.

(3) Measures in Education Administration: In recent years, the important measures in education administration in Jiangsu Province have included the following points: (1) The "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education in Jiangsu Province" and the "Wartime Custody Measures for Various Provincial Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province" were formulated. As Jiangsu Province became a war zone, planned measures should be taken in advance for education institutions at all levels. Therefore, these two measures were formulated to provide appropriate measures for all education endeavors, and personnel were assigned to take custody of all provincial education institutions in the province that had entered a state of suspension. (2) Graduation Examinations were held. In August of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, graduation examinations for senior and junior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools were held in different regions in Lianshui, Siyang, Dongtai, and Xinghua, with senior and junior high school graduation examinations held in four areas, normal school graduation examinations held in Huaiyin, Taixian, and Liyang, and rural normal school graduation examinations held in the Huaian area. (3) Measures for grade placement examinations were formulated. The "Measures for Grade Placement Examinations for Junior High School Students from Various Wartime Suspended Secondary Schools in County Secondary Schools and Private Junior High Schools in Various Counties of the Province" and the "Measures for Grade Placement Examinations for Various Temporary Secondary Schools" were formulated to adjust the grades of junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools. (4) Registration of Secondary School Faculty and Staff: Registration was carried out for faculty and staff in various secondary schools, and they were introduced to provincial and county secondary schools to provide relief. (5) Personnel were sent to supervise provincial and county education institutions, strictly assess their work performance, and promote education endeavors in the province and counties.

In order to promote War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Education, orders were repeatedly issued to all primary and secondary schools in the province to step up the implementation of wartime curricula. Regarding secondary schools, the "National Secondary School Curriculum Outline" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the "Special Education Outline for Secondary Schools," and other wartime secondary education laws and regulations were distributed to various schools for reference. Regarding primary schools, the "Special Education Outline for Primary Schools" and other wartime primary education laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education were also distributed to various primary schools for compliance. In addition, the Department issued five measures for training primary school students during the period of resistance against the enemy and measures for the implementation of special wartime education in primary and secondary schools in various counties, and circulated them to various primary and secondary schools for reference and implementation. Seven, Collect Teaching Materials for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction: Orders were issued to all provincial secondary schools to organize subject teaching material research associations, collect teaching materials related to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, report them to the Department of Education, and the Department of Education reviewed and distributed them to various schools for adoption.

### World Trends of the Week

— Pan Lang

From May 7th to 13th, 1928

In the second week of May, the international situation has seen new developments. On one hand, Britain's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal for guaranteeing peace has allowed Germany and Italy to calmly arrange a new offensive, sign political and military treaties, and formally establish a military alliance. The crisis of the globalization of a new imperialist war is becoming even more serious. On the other hand, people all over the world are more clearly recognizing the main path to seeking survival and freedom, and Soviet diplomacy is achieving new successes. Although these achievements are only at the beginning, they already indicate a new and bright future for the anti-aggression front.

Our War of Resistance against Japan continues to have new victories, but has not yet escaped from suffering. Moreover, due to the Japanese ××'s reckless gamble, they are preparing for their last adventurous speculation. However, the progress and preparation on our side have not fully reached the necessary level. Therefore, our future may be more difficult, darker, and more dangerous! We must use greater strength to crush all new offensives and conspiracies of the Japanese ×× and traitors in order to guarantee the achievements of the bitter struggle since 22 months ago and strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

(1) Germany and Italy Prepare New Offensive

In the past two weeks, we have clearly pointed out that countries such as Germany and Italy are preparing to launch a serious blow before the anti-aggression collective front has been consolidated and expanded. Since last week, the German military delegation and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been gathering in Italy for secret talks. This week, the news of Germany and Italy agreeing to form a military alliance finally jumped out in alarm in newspapers all over the world! This military alliance is the result of the Milan meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Although the content of the alliance is kept strictly secret, Berlin shamelessly declared: "It has dealt a major blow to the 'encirclement policy' of democratic countries" (Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 8th). Rome even claimed: "After Italy decides to sign the German-Italian military alliance, it will promote the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. If the Soviet Union reopens negotiations with Britain and France and declares its willingness to join the British-French-Soviet military alliance, Germany and Italy will accept Tokyo's proposal and sign a tripartite military alliance (Associated Press, Rome, 8th)." As for Japan, although there is no clear expression, it has greatly confused the few stubborn elements among the British and American capitalist rulers. The British Foreign Secretary even re-examined British-Japanese relations with the Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu on the 8th. But in fact, it has taken the opportunity to further threaten Britain, France, and the United States. Japanese Army Minister Itagaki has clearly stated that "Japan may as well conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy to promote the deep-rootedness of the Anti-Comintern Pact." Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso said that "Germany and Italy must fully cooperate with Japan." (Both seen in Reuters, Tokyo, 8th). This kind of military alliance of aggressor countries, the so-called "anti-communism" is all lies, and its actual power is also slim. The main thing is to intimidate Britain and France and deploy new offensive steps. Now that Germany and Italy are taking advantage of Britain's pro-German position that has not yet been determined, they are actively preparing for military action. According to a Berlin dispatch on the 10th, in order to implement ×× military, Germany is extensively conscripting employees in various industries, and 8,000 retail stores across the country have closed down as a result. In addition, German ×× Air Minister Goering has transferred from Italy to Spain to meet with Franco to prepare for new aggressive conspiracies. An 11th Rome ×× claimed that the Italian House of Representatives also passed a new naval budget on the 10th. At the same time, while building aggressive bases on the border between Albania and Greece, they are also increasing troops in Libya, spying on the British ×× colonies in Africa. In addition, although Germany's activities in Northern Europe have temporarily failed (the small Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland declared on the 9th that they refused the non-aggression pact offered by Germany), its conspiracy has not slackened at all, and the threat to Poland is particularly severe.

(2) Soviet Union's New Success in Peaceful Diplomacy

In today's increasingly serious war crisis, the new success of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy, like a torch in the darkness, has aroused the pursuit of peace and justice around the world, and its enthusiastic anti-aggression call has gained a wider response from the population.

Following the announcement of the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs taking office on the 6th, there was a series of diplomatic victory news. The entire Soviet population and the Red Army and Navy demonstrated for this victory. First, through the efforts of Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin, the foundation for cooperation between Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, and other countries and the Soviet Union was obtained. First, the Soviet Union and Turkey issued a joint communique on the 6th, "establishing consistent goals" to enhance mutual relations and maintain collective security. All issues related to common interests should be closely contacted and information exchanged at any time" (Havas News Agency, Istanbul, 6th). Paris also reported the content of the Soviet-Turkish talks, which focused on the joint defense of Middle Eastern countries. In the future, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan will be closer. Second, the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Romania ×× Poland are becoming increasingly better, especially after Potemkin held talks in the two countries. Ambassadors to Romania and Poland have been appointed one after another. Only the anti-aggression situation and preparations in Romania and Poland have become greatly tense, and the twilight of humiliation and retreat of the Baltic Sea countries will also be swept away. Secondly, they are assuring Britain that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has not changed in the slightest, and clearly advising Britain and France. "The Soviet Union has always insisted that if Britain and France want to create a dam in Eastern Europe to stop aggression, they should sign an agreement with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as the basis, based on the principle of mutual benefit, to create a united front to protect countries that may be attacked by enemies.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The rumors and fallacies advocated by aggressors and ignorant people, such as "Soviet diplomacy turns to isolation policy" and "Germany changes its policy toward the Soviet Union," which are intended to undermine British-Soviet cooperation negotiations, have also been shattered by various facts. The British government also expressed its satisfaction and stated that it would maintain the principles of cooperation proposed to the Soviet Union. Therefore, although the British-Soviet negotiations formed a stalemate for a while, they are now showing signs of development again. In addition, France has expressed extreme disappointment with the British government's actual rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal, and has specially expressed to the Soviet side that the French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty concluded in 1935 will continue to be effective. The United States also warmly welcomes the Soviet Union's appointment of Umanzky, the Chargé d'affaires in the United States ×× Grig, as the Ambassador to the United States, and the current US-Soviet relations are friendly.

(3) British and French Prime Ministers Roar Like Lions

All hypocritical, cowardly, so-called non-interference, compromise, and capitulation policies have been settled by clear facts and have reached the point of declaring complete bankruptcy! The status of Britain and France in Europe and even in the world has reached the tragic moment when they have to be re-evaluated! The vast majority of people in Britain and France and people with great foresight, even most government officials, have also become alert, shouting and protesting to defend their country and resist aggression! In Britain, when the news that Germany had announced the abolition of the ×× Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the conclusion of the German ×× military alliance reached Britain, the whole country sighed. Newspapers solemnly pointed out the new crisis in Europe and unanimously shouted, "We need the Soviet Union," urging the government to immediately understand that the hope of dismantling the Axis countries had been shattered, and that it should now work harder to realize the British-French-Soviet alliance (Haitong News Agency, London, 8th). Workers in various parts of England also held demonstrations from the 7th ×× movement, opposing the foolish policies of the British government. Labor Party free leaders also participated in speeches, condemning all false ×× compromise policies, calling for assistance to small countries to protect themselves, and calling for the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet alliance. (Same as above) In addition, Lloyd George warned the British people loudly not to be comforted by the Japanese statement that they would not care about European events, pointing out that Japanese affairs are like spears aimed at Britain. Britain must immediately strengthen its steps to unite with the Soviet Union and aid in restraining Japan in order to save the crisis (see Havas News Agency, London, 8th). In France, the emotions of the masses were equally high. The Socialist Party ×× scheduled to hold a national congress from the 27th to the 30th of this month. Party leader Blum ×× and ×× wing leader Zyromski both advocated the implementation of a tough, uncompromising foreign policy, to unite all nations determined to defend freedom, and organize an anti-fascist group. They have prepared proposals to fight against fascist aggression and strive for the independence and freedom of their country, and to strive for the defense of socialism and peace (see Havas News Agency, Paris, 8th). In this environment, the British and French governments cannot but be alert! What has been shown in the affairs of the week is: First, the British King and Queen set out on the 3rd to visit Canada and the United States. The government and the public warmly welcomed them, and the United States has also prepared a grand welcome, which will be of considerable help to British-American-Canadian relations. Second, the British, French, and Turkish governments have agreed to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, the content of which includes the establishment of a mutual defense agreement in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and all areas related to Turkish interests. Third, the French government declared that the French-Soviet agreement remains in effect. Fourth, the British-Soviet cooperation negotiations continue. Fifth, the British and Japanese trade agreement was signed on the 11th. Sixth, Britain is urgently seeking to strengthen its Far East defense forces. On the 11th, a Reuters dispatch from London reported that the British naval commander in the East Sea will hold a meeting in Singapore to discuss plans for coordinated operations in the East and West during wartime. Finally, British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech on the 11th that was considered a "lion's roar," warning Germany not to invade Danzig, otherwise Britain could not stand idly by. French Prime Minister Daladier also reiterated France's firm stance on the same day, preparing to resist any aggression, and hoping that the Soviet Union would participate in mutual assistance. Under the pressure of the situation, the British and French governments will have to embark on a united front against fascist aggression!

(4) Japan ×× Seizes the Opportunity to Agitate

As the European situation becomes increasingly urgent, the Eastern aggressor, Japan ××, who has suffered heavy military injuries, will naturally seize the opportunity to agitate in order to solve its current difficulties and then attempt to realize its dream of dominating East Asia. But its main strategies are still nothing more than deception and threat. And its main targets are Britain, France, and the United States, especially Britain.

Its first step is still to deceive the country and tempt it. When the news of Germany and Italy agreeing to establish a military alliance came out, it was silent and even unofficially expressed that Japan would not participate in the German-Italian military alliance, and maliciously rumored that the alliance's foreign policy had changed after Litvinov resigned, and maliciously rumored that Germany and the Soviet Union were approaching, which would cause Japan ×× to take a policy of being friendly with democratic countries. On the one hand, it also expanded its anti-communist propaganda as if it were a real thing, stating that its military aggression against China was only for the purpose of anti-communism. Although this deceptive and tempting performance temporarily touched the "hearts" of a few stubborn elements among the capitalist rulers of democratic countries, its fox tail and sharp blade could not be hidden after all. At a meeting of the British House of Commons on the 8th, Lloyd George loudly pointed out: "Japan's advancement is like a spear aimed at the border of British ×× land. Since the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet, Japanese troops have advanced 200 miles towards India!"

Moreover, the threat of Japan ×× is even more alarming. First, in order to seize the concessions of Britain, the United States, and France in China, they are intensifying their threats to the Shanghai concession. On the 3rd of this month, they issued a note to the British and American ambassadors, demanding the thorough reorganization of the administrative organization of the public concession. Then, they expanded the propaganda for the Japanese government to take over the concession. On the 7th of this month, they also pressed the concession to ban anti-Japanese organizations and publications and arrested anti-Japanese reporters. On the 9th, they sent plainclothes to the concession to kidnap five Chinese people, accusing them of being anti-Japanese elements. On the one hand, on the second day of the first anniversary of the fall of Xiamen (the 12th of this month) ×× traitor ×× was erected and killed, and they even landed in ×× Lang ×× and bombed Asia Oil ××, further threatening Britain, the United States, and other countries. We know that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China and the capital of a small number of civilians who have escaped from the artillery fire have mostly been concentrated in the concessions and leased territories that have not been reached by the ×× army. This time, the intention of Japan ×× to threaten Britain and the United States to loot them is very obvious. Second, continue to carry out crazy bombings in large, undefended cities in China and South China. Its intention is not only to target the Chinese people, but also to thoroughly destroy the economic activities of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly countries in China. If this is not enough, the ×× Army's newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" published an article on the 11th threatening the personal safety of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. We must recognize from here that this kind of agitation by Japan ×× is planned, and its purpose is to destroy the international assistance of our country's adherence to the War of Resistance and to thoroughly strike at the rights and economic activities of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly countries in China. If the British and American authorities still allow the Shanghai concession authorities to adopt the same humiliating and compromising countermeasures, then what was Tianjin yesterday, what is Shanghai and Gulangyu today, and what will be Hong Kong and India tomorrow and the day after tomorrow? A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 10th has revealed that Japan ×× is planning to demarcate the territory north of the equator as its jurisdiction and to assist overseas Chinese in carrying out conspiracy activities to intensify its southward advance. "Nichinichi Shimbun" even advocated the establishment of a governor-general to specialize in the affairs of Japanese residents in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Singapore in order to support the southward advance plan.

(5) Wang Jingwei and others Intensify their Activities

The new agitation of the aforementioned Japan ×× is aimed at striking at the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East, striving for a large amount of brutal oppression and the status of ××. On the other hand, it is aimed at striking at the friendly assistance of our insistence on the War of Resistance. In addition to attempting to weaken our War of Resistance forces internationally and then attempting to force us to surrender, Japan ×× continues to use Wang Jingwei to carry out the national policy of using Chinese to control Chinese and using Chinese ×× Chinese. First, the "anti-communist, peace" movement is used to destroy our anti-Japanese national united front and alienate the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all ethnic groups in the country, and the people and the government. According to a special telegram report from a Hong Kong-based ×× correspondent stationed in Shanghai, Wang Jingwei recently went to Japan and returned to Shanghai on the 10th of this month, accompanied by Kagesa Konoe and others. That night, the traitor Xiao An held a grand banquet to welcome Wang. According to the results of Wang's direct consultation with Japan ××, the Tokyo side has generally approved the conditions that Wang discussed with the Japanese representative in Shanghai, so Wang rushed back to carry out everything with his party members. As for the so-called conditions discussed with the Japanese side in Shanghai, they are roughly: (1) Announce that the state affairs will be directed by ××; (2) Announce a truce with Japan; (3) Do not ask Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to arbitrate; (4) Chiang Kai-shek steps down, the party is handed over to Wang, the army is handed over to ×××, and the government is handed over to ××; (5) Recognize the two puppet governments of Weixin and temporary as local governments, do not exclude them, and then negotiate with all parties to establish a puppet central government; (6) Sign an anti-communist agreement and an economic agreement with Japan, hire Japanese technicians ×× consultants, Japan has commercial leases in the mainland, and recognize the puppet Manchukuo, etc. According to a special telegram from the Zhujiang Daily in Hong Kong on the 12th, Wang went to Tokyo on April 27 and returned on May 3. In Japan, he negotiated with the Japanese government to organize a puppet Chinese Commonwealth government. Wang once requested the Japanese government to provide 30 million yuan per day for the central government's expenses. Although the true content of Wang ××'s future conspiracy activities is not yet known, it is already confirmed that Wang's current conspiracy activities are continuing and intensifying ××. We have said before: "When Wang Jingwei's peace movement fails, he can only. go to ×× openly." This kind of behavior violates the interests of the entire Chinese nation and violates the public will of the entire Chinese people. It is not necessary to point out that its future destiny cannot be stronger than that of Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, and Wen Zongyao. What we think is particularly important to awaken everyone's attention is that the Central News Agency's Kunming telegram on the 3rd published by Hong Kong newspapers on the 7th of this month released a letter from Yunnan Chairman Long Yun to Wang Jingwei. From this letter, we can see that Wang Jingwei has been secretly bewitching military and political officials in our government until recently, and has been carrying out various conspiracies within our anti-Japanese united front: Therefore, today we must not only step up the mobilization of the national people to resolutely oppose Wang Jingwei's kind of open ×× actions, oppose the kind of activities that are openly organizing and inheriting the puppet central government ××, but also especially ask the national officials and people to raise their political vigilance. We would like to express our greatest enthusiasm and highest respect to all those who are being instigated by Wang ×× and hope that they can all learn from Chairman Long Yun's loyal, brave, and righteous behavior, at least if they want to "not be driven by temporary anger and fall into thorns!" At the same time, we ×× resolutely demand that Wang ×× and others be given strict ×× sanctions, and that all anti-communist and equal remarks and actions that violate the War of Resistance and national reconstruction be thoroughly cleaned up. We resolutely demand that the united front be further consolidated and expanded. The spirit of democratic politics and the improvement of people's lives should be more appropriately developed and more effectively implemented in order to fundamentally block the road of ××××× ×× activities!

(6) The Situation of the War of Resistance against Japan in a Week

Finally, we will report on the recent week's War of Resistance situation. First of all, on the Japanese ×× side, the new offensive that has been preparing for nearly half a year has not yet succeeded. On the contrary, the severity of the domestic crisis in Japan and the degradation of its military strength in China. Looking at the telegrams of this week alone, first, Japan's domestic embarrassment is even more severe: (1) The Reuters Tokyo telegram reported on May 9 that Agriculture Minister Sakurauchi claimed that "Japanese rural areas all feel that there is a shortage of manpower. Because most of the strong men ×× are conscripted to attack China, and farmers in various places are also working in munitions factories, etc., agricultural production is on the verge of despair. At the same time, due to the lack of raw materials, many industries have fallen into stagnation!" (2) The surge of anti-war sentiment, the Zhujiang Daily Shanghai telegram on the 12th claimed. "The anti-war sentiment in the × country is increasing day by day, and the public order is unstable. Therefore, it was decided to convene a judicial meeting on the 15th to discuss the elimination of those who violate economic control and communist elements, etc., and the judicial chiefs of Korea and Taiwan will also participate!" (3), Quick News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. (Shanghai Translation Newspaper, May 9) "In the past few days, Tokyo ×× has been in ×× In the city, a large-scale search and arrest of members of the Seiyukai who were not members of the National Assembly has been carried out. So far, more than 200 people have been arrested and will be accused of disrupting the order ××". Second, regarding the decline of the fighting power of the invading Japanese army, it can be clearly seen from the recent progress of our army's counter-offensive ××. At the same time, news of internal riots and ×× army counter-reports is becoming even more of a daily event than before! But this does not mean that Japan ×× has lost its remaining power to launch a new offensive. On the contrary, Japan ×× is still exaggerating this kind of ×× in order to show off its military strength, such as the continued crazy bombing ×× of various cities in South China in the past week, which is one example. According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 9th, Japanese officials announced on the 9th that in order to "end the war against China," ×× they will immediately ×× fully implement Japan's General Mobilization Law and unify the command of the Japanese army and navy." From this, it can be seen that Japan ×× is about to prepare its possible, but even more crazy and cruel final bet! As for us, in order to prevent the new offensive of Japan ××, since the launch of the counter-offensive on all fronts, we have been fighting hard and reporting victories everywhere, which has encouraged the people and ×× has given international importance ××. In the past week, there were 32 members of the British House of Lords and the House of Commons ×× ×× ×× Weier and others who telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their respect and congratulate our country's entire army and people on their bloodshed and victory in the War of Resistance for national freedom. In the past week, there has been important news from the front lines of various routes: On the northern battlefield. Our army in southern Jin attacked Fushan, Yicheng, and Xinjiang. ×× The military killed more than 7,000 people. In eastern Jin, about 2,000 people were killed. In recent days, the area around Jing ×× in northwestern Jin has ×× about 10,000 people. The He Long Department of the Eighth Route Army, with more than 3,000 people, captured Jinci on the 5th and has entered ×× Taiyuan. In Shandong, the counter-offensive along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines was also very successful, and once attacked Dezhou and raided Yantai. There are still fierce battles near Kaifeng ×× and around Xuzhou on the sea line. According to a Quick News Agency report from Chongqing on the 7th, Deputy Commander Feng Yuxiang flew from Nanyang to ×× Zhou on the 5th to convene a meeting of generals, instructed the counter-offensive on the Longhai Line, and sent a large number of elite troops from Luo to the front of the Longhai. On the eastern battlefield, there were also victories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in recent days. The Liao Lei Department of the Fifth Route Army attacked Anqing on the evening of the 6th, and street battles continued until the 8th, causing heavy losses to the ×× army. According to an Shanghai telegram on the 12th, General Gu Zhutong ×× strengthened the eastern line counter-offensive ×× and decided to transfer 100,000 elite troops to advance into the guerrilla area of Jiangnan and appointed a commissioner to command the 8th Chang and Fu ××. On the South China Southern battlefield, the encirclement of Guangzhou by our army continued to make progress, and the guerrillas mixed into the Guangdong market and cooperated with the people in the Guangdong market to resist ××. In recent days, there have also been achievements, such as attacking the Bank of Taiwan, etc. In the Jianghui area, ×× continued to ×× fierce fighting and recovered Xinhui on the 11th, defeating the ×× army's plan to invade southward. Since General Bai Chongxi went on a tour of the Southern battlefield and convened a meeting of ×× political officials and stained people and gave a speech, there will be important instructions for the future War of Resistance. Finally, in southern Hubei and northern Jiangxi, which became the center of the war in the past week, our army also won victories, such as re-entering Nanchang, and recovering ×× Xianning Fengxin, approaching Tongcheng, making the ×× army's plan to invade Changsha Zhuzhou suffer a major blow. And the ×× army's propaganda "encircling more than 20 divisions of the Chinese army" The war east of ×× Fan is actually our army carrying out a dismemberment ×× of ×× based on its superior position. Even if the ×× army has further adventures in the future, it will inevitably suffer greater blows.

Summing up the war situation in a week, we can say that we are still standing on the superior side! However, in order to effectively attack the new offensive of the ×× army, we should not only enhance the combat effectiveness of the ×× Guandong to Chaozhou, enhance the combat effectiveness of the ×× Hunan-Jiangxi border and the front line of Xijiang on the south road, but also step up the expansion of the combat behind the ×× army on the eastern battlefield and the northern battlefield, and all of these depend on political progress, the consolidation of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the thoroughness of the traitor elimination movement, and the smooth implementation of the mobilization of the people.

### Intensify Production and Persist in Resistance (Continued)

— Li Fuchun

5.  Production Campaign and Preparatory Work

Regarding preparatory work, first, we must seize the opportunity. A year's plan starts in the spring; when spring arrives, the opportunity must not be missed! We must "not delay the farming season." Before the spring plowing, we must complete all preparatory work. So, what should we prepare?

First, survey the land—the government and the Party Committee should issue a notice to complete the survey work within a time limit; in Ansebao and other counties, the survey should be completed clearly within half a month; the area within twenty li around Yan'an should be surveyed clearly within five days. After the survey is completed, we can appropriately regulate the land and the labor force.

Second, preparation of ploughing oxen, seeds, and fertilizers—regarding the preparation of ploughing oxen, seeds, and fertilizers, on the one hand, each department should find ways to solve a part of the problem themselves; at the same time, the Finance Department should plan to purchase a large number of ploughing oxen and whole batches of seeds and distribute them to various departments. From all aspects, we can certainly quickly complete our preparatory work.

Third, preparation of agricultural production tools—in addition to each agency solving a part of the problem themselves, a plan should be made to send special personnel to various counties outside the border region to purchase a large number of agricultural tools. If this still cannot solve the problem, some scrap iron should be collected immediately, and the General Labor Union should be asked to mobilize blacksmiths to manufacture a large number of agricultural tools.

Fourth, preparation of personnel: At present, we should search for agricultural specialists and experienced people from all aspects to provide good guidance when carrying out production work.

Fifth, completion of mobilization work: In the countryside and among the people in agencies, schools, and troops, mobilization meetings for the production campaign should be convened immediately to carry out full explanation and mobilization work and to greet the new tasks with a new spirit.

6.  Organizations Leading the Production Campaign

After the correct policy and specific plan are determined, the organizational work determines everything! How can we ensure the completion of our unprecedented great production plan? This requires us to have a strong organizational leadership to solve problems regularly, supervise and inspect work, and ensure the completion of production tasks. Otherwise, the so-called "great plan" is just a piece of empty talk. Hundreds of thousands of dan of grain will not fall from the sky.

First, establish a production campaign committee—large departments should establish a general production campaign committee. (For example, the central agencies should establish a general production committee directly under the Central Secretariat.) Each department and each mess unit should also establish a production committee for that department or unit, which is led by the general production committee. The production committee of each unit should have a specific division of labor and should have: cadres specializing in managing organization, labor, and allocation of labor; cadres specializing in managing economy and production tools; cadres specializing in supervising and inspecting work; in the Party system, each branch should set up production cadres to ensure the smooth progress of production work. After the establishment of the general production committee and the production committees of various departments and units, they should actively carry out work.

Second, the specific work of the production committee.

1. Carry out mobilization work for the production campaign.

2. Carry out education work for the production campaign, so that every member participating in the production campaign understands the importance of the production campaign politically and understands how to carry out production technically.

3. Organization and regulation of labor force: the labor force should be well organized; in the process of production, the phenomenon of fatigue is unavoidable. We must regulate the labor force, not only to carry out regular encouragement work but also to allow the fatigued to get proper rest.

4. Establish a work inspection system.

5. Establish an award system to reward model comrades and comrades with good production results.

6. Conduct research work: Because the production campaign is unprecedented, our leading organ, the Production Campaign Committee, should continuously study the experiences and lessons learned in production practice as the basis for improving and developing work in the future.

7. Publish the results of the research in all publications in the entire border region—newspapers, magazines, and broadcasts—to guide our production campaign, exchange experiences, and promote the progress of the campaign, so that it advances by leaps and bounds.

Comrades! Under the call of the Central Committee, how should each of us complete our tasks?

We must use tenacity and combativeness to overcome all difficulties and fight to complete the arduous and great tasks given to us by the Central Committee! We believe that in the summary of this year's spring plowing and autumn herding, victory will surely be ours!

### Large Army Concentrated on Henan Border; Preliminary Battles Erupted Between Xiangyang and Zhongxiang; Our Fresh Troops in Western Henan Attacked Tanghe

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] The battles on various fronts are more intense in central Hubei. Over the past week, forces attacked from the Hua-Xiang Road and Zhongxiang. We first killed over a thousand and inflicted heavy losses. Fierce fighting is currently taking place near Zhongxiang. The enemy's rear has been cut off and is quite panicked. In Jiangxi, we annihilated no less than three to four thousand enemy troops in Nanchang.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] In southern Guangdong, after we captured Xinhui and Jiangmen, morale was greatly boosted. Our guerrillas are attacking the enemy everywhere, achieving considerable gains. Earlier this month, the enemy amassed over a thousand troops and launched a multi-pronged attack southward, which we repelled, killing three hundred enemy soldiers.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] Among the various occupied areas, our troops have been active recently. Recently, we recovered Tancheng County in southern Shandong, and the county magistrate entered the city to reassure the people. The provincial government allocated two million yuan to relieve the disaster victims. On the Jinpu Railway at Dawenkou, south of Guozhuang, we destroyed an enemy military vehicle. It is reported that recently three smoke bombs exploded in the commercial area of Jinan, causing a great deal of panic during the chaos as someone distributed leaflets. Our guerrillas are active near Qingdao. Prices of goods are soaring, and counterfeit currency has become worthless paper. Anti-British sentiment is quite high in the area. The British颐中Company and祥泰Wood Factory have both suspended operations, and British nationals are preparing to return home en masse if necessary.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese sources report that 10,000 Japanese troops were discovered southeast of Xiangyang today, attempting to invade the southern part of Henan Province. Chinese troops are now concentrated along the Xiangyang-Fuyang Highway and the Henan-Hubei border with 100,000 soldiers, awaiting an opportunity to annihilate the invading Japanese forces.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 12th] Over a thousand Japanese troops who fled north from Zhongxiang on the 8th arrived at a place more than forty li from Xiangfan. After a fierce counterattack by our troops, the enemy fled northeast. On the 12th, our fresh troops suddenly attacked Tanghe from western Henan, engaging the enemy in fierce fighting south of Tanghe. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered a major setback, with more than half of them killed or wounded. Another unit of ours is rapidly pursuing the enemy in the direction of Zaoyang, also achieving significant results.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the morning of the 12th, over two thousand enemy troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, advanced towards Xihe in three routes: one route from Zhangdian Town (southwest of Tanghe), one route from a village (south of Tanghe), and one route from Yingku (south of Tanghe), launching a fierce attack on us. We are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese sources report that a squadron of Chinese aircraft assisted the Chinese army yesterday in attacking Japanese troops near Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway. As a result, the Japanese army's depot and arsenal were completely destroyed, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. This squadron previously achieved success in Yingshan, launching a surprise attack on the Japanese army assembled there. Subsequent battle reports indicate that the Japanese troops in that area were completely annihilated.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the 10th, about one thousand enemy and puppet troops who infiltrated Xinye were attacked by our large forces from Nanyang, Zhenping, Dengxian, and other places. On the 11th, the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, fled southeast of Xinye. We are currently in pursuit.

[Central News Agency, Shanggao, 12th] On the evening of the 11th, our army captured Husu, eight li north of Anyi, killing dozens of enemy soldiers. When enemy reinforcements arrived, we left with our spoils of war.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 12th] Frontline report: (1) Yesterday, a certain unit of our guerrillas launched a fierce attack on Matang, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (2) Enemy boats anchored on the dikes of Yueyang do not dare to roam the Dongting Lake. But as soon as our garrison fires with guns, they flee far away.

### Our Troops in Northern Jiangsu Recovered Pizhou County

[Central News Agency, Tunxi, 13th] On the 4th, a certain unit of our troops in northern Jiangsu launched a second fierce attack on Pizhou County. Over four hundred enemy soldiers stubbornly resisted. Our troops shouted and rushed into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the enemy. After three hours of bloody battle, over three hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and the remaining enemy troops fled towards the south bank of the Grand Canal. On the 5th, our Pizhou County Magistrate Gan Huayun entered the city to reassure the people.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 12th] Military news: Our scattered commando units in the eastern battlefield, along with several regular army divisions, have launched fierce battles with the enemy, posing a major threat to the enemy army and cutting the Sujia Railway into several sections, closely monitoring the enemy and puppet movements around Songjiang and Tongli. In addition, Yangtang Town, southwest of Suzhou, was fiercely attacked by our army on the 10th, annihilating over fifty enemy soldiers and recovering the town.

### Guangdong's Occupied Area is Becoming Increasingly Small

[Central News Agency, Qingyuan, 12th] Over the past week, the war in Guangdong has turned silent. The enemy has adopted an offensive posture on the southwest front, launching an all-out attack on Jiangmen and Xinhui on the right flank of our western line, attempting to sweep through Siyi and Liangyang and directly attack the southern route. Our military authorities, aware of the enemy's plan, not only ordered the defending troops on that front to fight hard but also launched counterattacks with extremely mobile movements. In the Sanshui area, we recovered Makou and attacked Sanshui and other places, directly approaching the outskirts of Qingshui City. The enemy had no choice but to withdraw the troops attacking Jiangmen and began to retreat to the defensive positions of Hancheng and Xialegang. On the left flank of the western line, at Lubao on the southwest highway, we recovered Yangmei and Baorutang. After the enemy counterattacked, we did not retreat. On the roads of Chan (Foshan) and Tan (Bu), we counterattacked and captured Guanyao, advancing to Zhaogang. The enemy was greatly threatened and had to withdraw troops from Foshan and Jiangmen to fight back. Our army then moved from Guanyao to Tanbu and steadfastly defended Sanjiang. Later, the enemy increased its deployment of infantry and artillery to over a thousand troops to attack. We firmly defended our positions and fought back. The enemy did not succeed. Tanbu and Sanjiang are key points for connecting our northwest rivers. Cutting them off would not only allow the enemy to "mop up" the guerrillas in the junction area of Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian counties and relieve the threat to the enemy's left flank at Jiangcun and Tangtang on the southern section of the Yuehan Road but also allow the army to plunder old Qingyuan and force Yingde. On the Gaoyao and Gaoming roads on the right flank of the western line, the enemy sent speedboats and rubber boats to attack Sanzhou, but they were repelled by our army and could not land. On the Jiangmen-Foshan highway, west of Pishan, the enemy attacked Gubao. Our army gathered national troops and fought five times with the enemy. The enemy was defeated and collapsed to the east. Our troops on the front line of the Ningyang Railway were able to calmly attack the enemy and launched a protracted war in the Xinhui area. For more than ten days, the enemy could not cross our defense line. The enemy occupying Jiangmen has now changed its attack to defense. From then on, the enemy in Guangzhou, is living in constant panic. They have recently built a defensive line in Kuabei's Longyan , preparing for a final stand. The outer perimeter of the defensive line is the Yuehan Road's Xin Street and Jiangcun in the north, and the Guangzhou-Conghua line's Shengang and Taipingchang in the northeast, preparing for a final stubborn resistance.

### Japanese Conduct House-to-House Searches on Gulangyu; U.S. Warship Ordered to Sail from Fujian to Protect Nationals; British Warship Closely Coordinates with Consulate General

[Reuters, Shanghai, 13th] According to sources on Gulangyu, Japanese marines have begun conducting house-to-house searches on Gulangyu. The British destroyer HMS "Curlew" is constantly in contact with the Consul General. As of now, no reports of infringement on British interests have been received. Cargo from Swire & Co. ships has not been unloaded because workers are afraid and refuse to work.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 13th] The U.S. destroyer USS "Bulmer" has been ordered to sail from Fuzhou to Gulangyu and is expected to arrive today. The ship carries Rear Admiral Starke, commander of the U.S. South China Patrol.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Foreign dispatches from Gulangyu on the 13th: A total of two hundred Japanese soldiers have landed here, and a large number of Chinese have been arrested by the Japanese.

[Reuters, Gulangyu, 13th] Since the assassination of the puppet "Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Chairman" Hong Lizhu on Thursday (i.e., the 11th), the Japanese have sent two hundred sailors to land here, arresting many Chinese. Hong's injuries remain critical. The assassin is still at large. Japanese marines are closely monitoring all entrances and exits here, intending to prevent Chinese from fleeing. The Japanese have warned Chinese that anyone wanting to leave Gulangyu will be regarded as anti-Japanese elements.

### Tensions Increase in Shanghai; Rumors of New Japanese Residents' Association Plans; Japanese Aircraft Drop Leaflets in Concession Central Area

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 13th] Tensions rose again today after Japanese reports that the Japanese Residents' Association is stepping up efforts to organize residents to assist Japanese officials in modifying the Shanghai land regulations in an attempt to repel British and American forces and gain control of the Public Concession. However, there have been no new developments on the diplomatic front. This morning, a Japanese plane repeatedly flew over the office of the Municipal Council and dropped a large number of leaflets. Everyone originally thought they were propaganda against the Municipal Council, but it turns out that they were recruitment advertisements for the puppet government's water police school, saying that they want to recruit two hundred people for training, with a monthly allowance of eight yuan per person.

### Japanese Land on Gulangyu; Britain and the United States Express Importance; U.S. Has Contingency Plans for Incidents in Shanghai Concession

[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] Political circles here believe that the Japanese military's landing in the Gulangyu Concession in Xiamen does not violate the original text of the treaty, but if the Japanese military intends to interfere in the Concession administration, the consequences will be extremely serious.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 13th] Authoritative sources in the United States remain tight-lipped about the Japanese military's seizure of the Gulangyu Public Concession in Xiamen. According to private sources in political circles, the United States is closely watching the actions of the Japanese military, especially the steps the Japanese military is attempting to take towards the Concession. It is rumored that this may lead to economic sanctions against Japan. Secretary of State Hull told representatives of the press that he had not yet received a formal report from the Ambassador to China and therefore could not comment on the importance of the Japanese military's actions. When asked whether the United States would impose economic sanctions if the Japanese military took similar steps in Shanghai, he said that the U.S. Ambassador to China had been instructed to deal with all situations in serious times.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Hull stated that difficulties may arise at any time in Shanghai, the Far East, and other places, so the State Department has authorized diplomatic representatives in those places to deal with the situation there nearby. Regarding the remarks made by a Japanese spokesman that the Japanese side may find it necessary to seize the British and American defense areas in Shanghai, there have been no official reports received here. As for the saying that if the Japanese side attempts to occupy Shanghai, the British and American authorities will study taking a certain attitude, the official side here has not made any comments.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Washington telegram: A senior official of the State Department, after learning of the Japanese military's occupation of Gulangyu, declared that the United States is very concerned about this and is closely watching the development of the situation.

### Japanese Aircraft Bombard Various Locations

[Central News Agency, Yin County, 12th] At noon on the 12th, six Japanese aircraft came from Longshan, invaded the city's airspace, and dropped eleven bombs in the Jiangdong District and five bombs in the city area, destroying a total of 180 houses and killing and wounding five people each.

### Chongqing's Air Defense Has Improved Significantly; City Orderly During Japanese Airstrike the Day Before Yesterday

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th] At 6:20 p.m. yesterday evening, a general alarm sounded. At that time, the streets and markets were lively, but in a moment, the people of the city dispersed, and the order was in good order. When the Japanese bomber squadron intruded into the city sky, it was already dusk, so the targets of the Japanese aircraft were completely inaccurate. Most of them fell into the Jialing River and on the beaches along the river. The city's police and soldiers went to the streets to maintain order and strictly enforce fire control. Twelve police officers accompanied the Associated Press reporter on foot in the street. When they suddenly saw a faint light on a building on a certain street, they went to investigate and extinguished it. A big fire suddenly broke out in two villages in Jiangbei, and thick smoke covered the area. Most of the people who moved to live there were those who moved from Chongqing, which was originally considered quite safe. Several bombs also fell near the German Consulate, but there were no casualties. The French Navy barracks reported the work of the Health Department.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 12th] Chinese sources report that 27 Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing today, and Chinese anti-aircraft guns shot down three of them. Japanese aircraft bombed the new refugee area on the north bank of the Jialing River yesterday, with casualties estimated at over a thousand. One middle school, with 600 students, was also hit. It is reported that most of the students have escaped, but foreigners in Chongqing have heard screams from that area.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 13th] When Japanese aircraft bombed here last night, they completely focused on the east bank of the Yangtze River, at the confluence with the Jialing River. The small towns on the north bank of the Jialing River were the most targeted by the Japanese aircraft. Rescue workers crossed the river overnight to provide aid. It is said that the casualties were light, only about 300 people, because most of the residents had fled after hearing the alarm. Japanese aircraft bombed near the French Navy barracks, and a fire broke out immediately. The American-owned衛利韓Shipping Company, located 200 yards away, was completely destroyed. French sailors helped firefighters to fight the fire to prevent it from spreading to the French barracks. Report of the work of the Health Department

### Yan Fuqing Talks About Reporting on the Work of the Health Department

[Reuters, Chongqing, 13th] Director of the Health Department, Dr. Yan Fuqing, declared that Japanese aircraft cruelly bombed Chongqing on May 1st and 4th, killing 5,000 people and injuring 2,000 people, and 2,391 houses were destroyed. Speaking of the results of this war, Yan said that, to date, the enemy's casualties have exceeded one million. Approximately six million children have lost their parents and must be cared for and educated by the government. The number of refugees is as high as five million, of whom 1,600 are currently fully supported by the government. Speaking of the lack of doctors and nurses, Yan said that China has trained 9,000 doctors and only 6,000 nurses, which is far from the number needed. The military medical department in the army currently has 300,000 wounded soldiers and 20,000 staff.

### People in Southern Shanxi Unable to Bear Oppression; Organize Righteous Army to Kill Japanese; Japanese in Central Shanxi Invade Wenshui in Three Routes; 5,000 Japanese Soldiers in Taiyuan Reinforce Wutai

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] The people of various counties in southern Shanxi, unable to bear the cruelty of the Japanese, have risen up in revolt and organized righteous armies. The people who voluntarily participate are very enthusiastic.

[Central News Agency and Collection, 12th] The Fenan Japanese army is planning to build four roads connecting Tongguan Road, Shuitou Station, Chazhuang, Hejin, and Yuncheng. Our various units are cooperating with the local people to attack them. Wheat seedlings on both sides of the Hejin-Jishan highway. The Japanese army has been forcing Liu for days. In addition to the people of Fenxi hating them to the core, the people in other places are also using the slogan of safeguarding food and rising up to attack the Japanese. The Japanese and puppet troops in Xinjiang Jishan were frequently attacked by us and recently sent several armored vehicles to drive on the highway day and night to prevent our attacks. On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese in Xinjiang killed eleven soldiers who had previously been captured by us outside the city. That night, the Japanese in the city suddenly spread rumors that our army was attacking and most of them drove out of the city and bombarded the northwest for several hours. In fact, our army did not take any action. The panic of the Japanese can be seen.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] The Northeastern compatriots have been oppressed by the Japanese and the puppets. On the 4th of this month, more than ten Japanese puppets forced them to cut down trees in Zhoucun. More than forty of them, seeing that the time for rebellion had come, rose up and tied up all the Japanese soldiers who were supervising them and surrendered to a certain army of ours. Our army gave them comfort and incorporated them.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] More than 4,000 Japanese troops from Qixian, Pingyao, Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng launched a fierce attack on Hujia Village and Xiejiacai, northeast of Wenshui, in three routes. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely with the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat dozens of times and finally broke through the encirclement. It is estimated that over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the 4th and 5th, the Japanese sent more than 5,000 Japanese troops and ten artillery pieces from Taiyuan to reinforce Wutai. At the same time, more than 1,000 troops were also added to Dongpan Town. On the 7th, they fought fiercely with us.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 12th] A certain detachment of our army destroyed about three miles of railway east of Zhengtaiyangquan on the evening of the 5th. Another unit attacked Xiyang City on the night of the 6th and fought fiercely for two hours. The Japanese stubbornly resisted the city, and our army withdrew automatically at dawn.

### The Possibilities of Economic Reconstruction in the Rear Area

— Cao Zhang

I. Introduction to the Problem

[A Communication from the Shanxi-Western Suiyuan Area of the Kuomintang] In addition to military offensives, the Japanese also employ a variety of economic, political, and cultural schemes and conspiracies. A particularly serious issue is economic aggression coordinated with military activities. They exhaust all means of blockade, destruction, and plunder, attempting to weaken our economic structure to compensate for their own economic difficulties. Modern warfare is a final showdown involving the mobilization of manpower, materials, and financial resources. In a prolonged war, if the condition of manpower does not become a problem, then the final victory depends on the duration and extent of financial and material resources. At the same time, in our national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, the defense-oriented economic construction in the rear has laid a solid foundation and enhanced the conditions necessary for a certain victory in the war of resistance. However, we believe that what is insufficient is that the nation, both government and public, concentrates its attention in one corner, only focusing on the investigation and development of the southwestern defense base, neglecting the overall nature of national construction, and neglecting most of the fertile land that has become war zones. On the land between several railways and inland waterways, the political power is ours, the army is ours. Although these anti-Japanese base areas in the rear are surrounded by the Japanese and are subject to attack at any time, in such difficult circumstances, we still have to consider the economic construction of the base areas. This is easier said than done, but we cannot give up this arduous task just because of the difficulties. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed us long ago: "The Japanese blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic recovery." Therefore, this article will first present the necessity and possibility of economic construction in the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear, and report on the construction situation of the southeastern Shanxi anti-Japanese base area, which has been working hard for half a year and has achieved remarkable results. This will show how it has enriched the new tasks of the guerrillas, protected the lives and property of the people, established the economic foundation of rural areas, laid the foundation for the revival of national industry, and tell our compatriots in the rear that national construction does not have to wait until the day after the Japanese are driven out beyond the Yalu River to begin. Nor is it enough to retreat to one corner of the southwest to build the nation.

II. The Necessity of Economic Construction in the Rear Area

A. Consolidating the economic structure of the anti-Japanese base areas and directly supplying the needs of the army.

The Japanese policy of economic aggression against us is to blockade the sources of our necessities and essential goods, and to use shoddy and substandard goods to sell goods and daily necessities, using unscrupulous merchants to dump them in various places, absorb our legal currency, and mix in counterfeit money and counterfeit legal currency to disrupt our financial and monetary system. Secondly, it is the large amount of raw materials that we usually export, such as fur, raw silk, cotton, hemp, peanuts, tobacco, etc. At this time, hoarding leads to inability to convert to cash. We even have to resort to good merchants to sell some of the raw materials at a reduced price into the hands of the Japanese. Moreover, the transportation links between the anti-Japanese base areas and the rear areas have been or will be cut off. The supply of military and civilian supplies will be difficult, which means that there will be difficulties in supporting the long-term war of resistance. A powerful countermeasure to solve these difficulties is to develop the economic construction of the anti-Japanese base areas. First and foremost, run small and medium-sized production enterprises that are most urgently needed, and use the raw materials accumulated on the spot to maintain self-sufficiency in military and civilian needs within the base area, break through the Japanese control in the economy, and cultivate a greater counterattack force.

B. Increasing wartime production to solve the refugee problem. Wherever the Japanese go, a group of refugees is added. The number caused to date is estimated to be no less than 50 to 60 million. This is a major problem for the War of Resistance. Although the central government has allocated a huge sum of millions of yuan and sent personnel to the war zone to distribute it, the war zone is too vast and there are too many refugees. Apart from temporary emergency relief, the fundamental solution is to recruit them to join the army and engage in production, assign them to wasteland reclamation areas to increase food production, and to send them to ordnance factories and military supplies manufacturing factories, to transport teams, and laundry teams.

C. Developing rural economic organizations, promoting political organizations, and carrying out mass movement work for farmers with low cultural levels and strong feudal consciousness, especially rural women, to organize and arm them is very difficult. If we use mass organizations and production organizations to absorb their small shares of capital and recruit them to work in factories, so that they have economic and work relationships, it will be very easy to promote the work of educating and training them.

In the initial stages of the war, several transportation lines and several large cities quickly fell into Japanese hands. Some businessmen still stayed in the occupied areas. Some local gentry believed that it was difficult to operate with money in the countryside, so they tried to invest in the occupied areas or remit money abroad. Some even took large amounts of assets to major cities or concessions. There were also a large number of workers trapped in the occupied areas working in Japanese factories. These escapees must be recovered. It is no less important to win over these manpower that has fallen into Japanese hands than it is to disintegrate the Japanese, destroy the puppet organizations, and win over the puppet troops. That is, to establish production enterprises and bring back the manpower and financial resources that have fallen into the occupied areas, and combine them economically, so that they can no longer leave their homeland.

III. Difficulties and Possibilities

It is very difficult to engage in economic construction in the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear, but there are also possibilities. With the protection of the army, the assistance of the government, and the mobilization of the masses, it is possible to carry out rational production control, transportation control, and consumption control. Moreover, it is possible to widely establish rural production units and establish a large number of small industries related to military and civilian needs - small-scale machinery industries. The following is a breakdown:

A. Increasing food production. As the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear are established and consolidated one by one, the more progress they make, the more they are hated by the Japanese and puppet forces. Especially as the war enters a stalemate, the Japanese have already surrounded and attacked various anti-Japanese base areas. They exhaust all means of cruel and destructive attacks, and often choose the time of spring plowing and autumn harvest, so that you cannot plant anything or harvest anything. At the same time, in places where we have a large number of troops stationed, because of the need to cope with the war situation, the army recruits coolies and wants livestock, which inevitably hinders the countryside. However, in well-prepared anti-Japanese base areas, in addition to mobilizing all the manpower to quickly drive the Japanese away, the farmers have already been mobilized to grow more labor-saving organizations and to harvest grains that have a slightly flexible season, such as corn, sorghum, buckwheat, and wheat (autumn-planted wheat). Especially near the routes that the Japanese may attack, and in the mountains, wasteland reclamation and afforestation are being carried out more extensively. On the plains, agricultural water conservancy is being built very calmly. For example, in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, three short canals have been opened in Fuping, and one has been opened in Tangxian. Each canal can irrigate five or six qing of land. In the areas along the Fen River in northwestern Shanxi and western Shanxi, nine short canals have also been opened. In addition, in richer areas in the occupied areas, food is being controlled, and the masses are being educated to give the surplus food to the guerrillas in response to the Japanese blockade. In a few border areas, because the local area is poor, transportation is inconvenient, and there are many stationed troops, it is difficult to supply military food. However, these places where large armies are stationed cannot be connected with the rear and rely on supplies from the rear. (Continued on page 4)

### England and Turkey to Conclude Long-Term Mutual Assistance Agreement to jointly resist the Mediterranean war of aggression. Negotiations between France and Turkey are nearing completion

[Reuters, Ankara, 12th] When Prime Minister Sadarn announced to the National Assembly today that England and Turkey had concluded an agreement, all the members cheered repeatedly and the entire house enthusiastically supported the agreement. Sadarn listed the cordial friendship and sincere cooperation between England, Turkey and other peace-loving countries.

[Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 13th] The Turkish Foreign Minister announced in the parliament yesterday the process of concluding the agreement between England and Turkey, and said that if the two countries encounter a war in the Mediterranean, they must provide mutual assistance, but the detailed conditions are still under discussion and will be announced at a later date.

The two governments will sign a long-term mutual assistance agreement to seek mutual national security. Before the agreement is signed, the two governments declared that if acts of aggression cause war in the Mediterranean, the two countries will cooperate and do their best to provide assistance. This statement is not directed at any one country, but is intended to ensure that England and Turkey provide mutual assistance when necessary. The two governments believe that some matters need to be further clarified and are currently under consideration. The two governments also believe that the security of the Balkans must be sought and are currently discussing together to achieve this goal as soon as possible. However, the two governments may still conclude agreements with other countries to consolidate peace. Attlee, the leader of the Labor opposition party, expressed satisfaction with Chamberlain's statement and asked whether the two countries would hold staff talks after the agreement was concluded. Chamberlain replied that he did not think this could be discussed before the agreement was concluded. Subsequently, Labor Party member Henderson asked whether the two countries had decided to allow troops to enter the Black Sea so that British fleets could enter the Black Sea to assist Romania if they were attacked by Germany. Chamberlain replied that his statement did not mention detailed regulations. All parties in the House of Commons expressed satisfaction with Chamberlain's statement on British-Turkish relations.

[Associated Press, London, 12th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain confirmed in the House of Commons today the rumor that England and Turkey had agreed to sign a mutual assistance agreement. The two countries had signed a temporary agreement that England and Turkey should provide mutual assistance when a war in the Mediterranean is caused by foreign aggression. This is to prevent attacks from Italy. As for the long-term mutual assistance agreement being planned, the purpose is to make Turkey a member of the anti-aggression front. Turkey guarantees to cooperate in preventing German and Italian aggression, and Britain also assists Turkey in completing its implementation and guarantee. However, it is expected that Turkey will not want to sign a broad agreement until Britain and the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance pact, because it believes that Soviet assistance is necessary for the defense of the Balkans, Poland, and the Baltic countries. Once the British-Soviet mutual assistance agreement is established, Turkey will assist Eastern European countries and allow British ships to enter the Black Sea to assist Romania.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Chamberlain's statement on Turkey was unanimously and warmly welcomed here. As for the French statement, because the negotiations between France and Turkey involve the Mediterranean, a small part still needs to be studied, but it is not difficult to resolve. Therefore, the French statement will also be published soon.

[Reuters, London, 13th] All newspapers here unanimously reported this morning that France is likely to cede the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey as a basis for the signing of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and France. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Times" said that after only a few points have been discussed, the matter of ceding land can be decided. The political correspondent of the "Daily Mail" said that an agreement on this matter may be decided in the middle of next week. The "Daily Herald" is more cautious, only saying that the Sanjak problem can be finally resolved, but the newspaper did not reveal its nature. The newspaper also said that this problem may be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council for approval next week. The "News Chronicle" said that the Paris correspondent reported the matter. The "Times" editorial said that the Sanjak should be incorporated into Turkey this year. This method can remove the final obstacle to the establishment of an agreement between Turkey and France and incorporate it into the political track of signing a mutual assistance agreement.

[Reuters, Piraeus, 12th] British and French authorities are constantly conducting experiments to improve air defense in the eastern Mediterranean. During an air defense exercise last night, the lights here were completely turned off. The Palestinian government is also making various air defense preparations, and is separately studying the problems of evacuating densely populated areas and protecting buildings.

### Tense Situation Between Germany and Poland; Nazi Party Disturbances in Kienia; Poland Sends Additional Artillery to Increase Defenses

[Reuters, Kienia, 13th] Today, when the Polish people here celebrated the anniversary of the birth of their national father, General Pilsudski, a group of Nazis rioted in the streets, destroying Polish restaurants and newspaper offices, and throwing stones at portraits of Pilsudski. When this incident occurred, the Senate here, which was manipulated by the Nazis, was apologizing to the Polish authorities for the bombing of the Polish customs office and the sniper attack on the Polish stationmaster. In order to avoid further deterioration of the situation, the Polish authorities in Danzig canceled the commemorative meeting originally scheduled for tonight because the Danzig police refused to protect it.

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 11th] The Polish authorities have recently sent two additional artillery units to increase the defense of Kienia, ten miles from Danzig. The official explanation is that "in view of the international situation, the Polish people in the area have been greatly disturbed, which is why they are stabilizing people's hearts."

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 12th] Political figures here denied the rumor that Japan was mediating the dispute between Germany and Poland.

Strict Border Defenses in Danzig

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 12th] The Polish authorities have now begun to arrest members of the German minority in Upper Silesia, southern Poland. There have been many cases of those arrested for minor offenses being sentenced to weeks of imprisonment. The crimes they committed were no more than listening to foreign broadcasts or spreading alarming news. Some were even publicly rumored to have had their homes destroyed by the Polish people. This is regarded as spreading alarming news and is punishable by short-term imprisonment. In recent days, in the Katowice mining area and other parts of Upper Silesia, a large number of German miners and employees have been suddenly fired. In the Katowice area alone, hundreds of people have received notices of dismissal in recent days. The reason given by the person in charge is that it is a necessary step for restructuring work.

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 12th] The Chairman of the Danzig Municipal Senate, Greiser, gave a speech at a reception for German labor leaders, explaining the attitude of the Danzig government towards the international situation. He said, "Our wisdom will not be lost because of the alarmist talk in foreign newspapers and the mobilization of large armies on the border. Our fate will be in the hands of the German leader Hitler. The problem of Germans in Eastern Europe will be resolved sooner or later, and our fate will be decided at the same time. Although the borders of the Free City of Danzig are heavily guarded, Danzig will still maintain its customary calmness."

[Danzig, 12th] The Danzig Free City Senate was prepared to protest to Poland. It is said that the reason for the protest was that two Danzig people were shot last night when they crossed the Danzig Polish border bridge because they refused to answer the Polish army's slogan.

Goebbels Attacks Polish Policies

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th] After German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently wrote an article entitled "Where is Poland Going?", he wrote an article this morning attacking Poland's current policies, entitled "The Road of Poland with Bayonets." This article will appear in this morning's organ of the National Socialist Party and the People's Observer. Goebbels said that the majority of the residents of Danzig are Germans, and other issues such as Poland's rights are secondary. The German leader's proposal on the Danzig and Corridor issues is enough to show that Germany does not want to cut off Poland's sea route, but the Polish press has fiercely attacked it and aroused Polish so-called patriots to hate German expatriates in Poland. If the Polish government is determined, it is not difficult to restrain these events. In order to eliminate the seriousness of the situation, Germany will never incite public sentiment and make counter-German regulations to Polish public opinion that have reached the point of unbearable. All German citizens should ask themselves whether Polish expatriates in Germany have been abused by Germans, whether they have been scolded or insulted the Polish leader and other important figures. Also, German courts have never made unfair judgments against Polish expatriates. Therefore, the Polish people mistakenly believe that Germany is a cowardly country. Moreover, recently, Polish newspapers even said that Poland had once defeated Germany and would fight near Berlin in the future. Although it is Poland's freedom to seek its own interests, it has nothing to do with us to answer with bayonets to lead the way. We only hope that the road led is not to change Poland's territory. If it is said that this road does not end even if it reaches outside Berlin, then we cannot but use bayonets as defense, because German territory must not be destroyed by others. Now we are prepared and waiting for the evolution of the situation.

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in Daladier

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] French leader Daladier won the Chamber of Deputies' confidence in his handling of diplomatic events today with 375 votes against 230.

### U.S. Department of the Army Announces Enhancement of Air and Sea Defenses; Coastal Artillery Unit to be Reorganized on July 1; Leahy Appointed Governor of Puerto Rico

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Department of the Army announced that the coastal artillery unit will be reorganized on July 1 to enhance air and sea defenses. It is said that personnel from the army's administrative side will be transferred to combat personnel, which can increase the artillery unit by 18 teams. If six of them are equipped with modern mobile anti-aircraft guns that have already been manufactured, the regular army's air defense force can be increased by 83 percent. Some artillery units will be equipped with long-range heavy artillery to enhance the defense of the Atlantic and Pacific sea lanes, and four teams will be stationed in New York.

[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 12th] About three U.S. battleships and auxiliary ships arrived in Pacific ports today. The country's fleet deployment (i.e., transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific) is now complete.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] General Leahy, Director of Naval Tactics, will soon retire. President Roosevelt has ordered him to be the Governor of Puerto Rico to replace General Winship.

### League of Nations Covenant: The Problem of Amendment Will Be Discussed at the Regular Meeting of the Administrative Council

[Central News Agency, London, 12th] Certain diplomatic figures here recently declared that the League of Nations Administrative Council may discuss the amendment of the Covenant at its current regular meeting. This proposal was initiated by the Soviet Union or one of the Balkan countries, and supported by Turkey. The current plan is to divide the member states of the League of Nations into two categories: active and ordinary. The former must accept mutual assistance obligations, while the latter does not. British political figures recently commented that this plan, although not as good as the general collective security system advocated by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, is better than the establishment of an agreement between England, France, and the Soviet Union to implement a partial collective security system and is highly approved by the Soviet Union.

### Military Conflict Between Greece and Bulgaria; News from Budapest

[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 15th] It is reported that a conflict occurred between the Greek and Bulgarian border guards on the 5th. Initially, six Bulgarian defense forces attacked a Greek patrol team, killing a Greek officer and three soldiers on the spot, and wounding five soldiers. It is reported that after the Greek army received reinforcements, it counterattacked, killing ten Bulgarian soldiers and wounding nine.

### Close Relations Between Lithuania and Poland; Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief Returns Home

[Reuters, Lithuanian Capital, 12th] Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Rashtikis returned here from Poland today. It is expected that the political and military cooperation between Poland and Lithuania will become closer due to General Rashtikis's visit to Warsaw. However, no special agreement was signed during his trip. However, the fact that Poland has fully agreed with Lithuania's attitude towards Eastern European issues is highly valued here.

### British Ambassador to the United States Broadcasts Speech: The Ocean is Not Enough to Separate the Relations Between Britain and the United States

[Reuters, New York, 12th] The British Pavilion at the World's Fair was opened today by British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay. The monument is inscribed with the words "This pavilion commemorates the permanent peace and friendship between the people of the United States and Britain." The British Ambassador broadcast to the world, "The United States is a happy land for us to visit. Those we come into contact with here are all friends with the same interests and ideals." He also hopes that the British Pavilion will show that the ocean is not enough to separate the two countries, but is just enough to connect them.

### First Anniversary of British King's Coronation; Escorting Warships Fire Salutes

[Reuters, London, 12th] Today is the anniversary of the British King's coronation. When the royal Canadian special ship "Queen of Australia" was sailing through heavy fog and ice floes, the three cruisers accompanying it fired 21 salutes as a tribute.

[Reuters, London, 13th] A Reuters special correspondent on the "Queen of Australia" reported that the heavy fog suddenly cleared this evening, but ice floes were gathered on both sides of the special ship. The King and Queen stood on the deck, skipping over the special ship sailing between the white training. The sunset reflected, and the scenery was excellent, but after an hour, the mist fell again and no figures could be seen.

### Possibilities for Post-War Economic Construction (Continued from Page 3)

B. Establishing Small-Scale Production Enterprises: Establishing various types of production enterprises in rural areas. Due to the lack of machinery, capital, and technical personnel, as well as limitations on raw materials, consumption, and transportation, only small-capital, small-scale enterprises are possible. In fact, even small industries are targeted by the [Japanese] invaders. Therefore, factory sites must be selected in remote areas or mountainous regions where raw materials are not concentrated and transportation is difficult, or on plains near the [Japanese] occupied areas, adopting a system of dispersed production and centralized management. In nature, they are mostly government-run or jointly operated by government and private entities, and even the few private factories should be subject to government supervision.

Initial fundraising will be relatively difficult. Investing in production enterprises during wartime is perceived as a risk. Only after the military has secured the base areas to a sufficiently stable degree, and the government promulgates new factory laws guaranteeing shareholder dividends, coupled with explanations and persuasion by national salvation organizations, will even wealthy farmers slowly become active.

Small machines and handicraft tools are mostly borrowed from existing local sources and a portion brought from fallen cities, which are felt to be insufficient. In addition to making every effort to repair and improve them, it is necessary for the rear areas to find ways to supply them.

Due to the shortage of workers and technical personnel, workers' wages are higher than those of soldiers, and the salaries of technical personnel and specialists are two to three times higher than those of administrative officials. Besides training apprentices locally, it is hoped that technical personnel and specialists working in the rear areas can be allocated to the [Liberated] rear areas.

C. Self-Sufficiency in Military Supplies and Daily Necessities: Various anti-Japanese base areas surrounded by the [Japanese] inevitably face difficulties in transporting many special products and producing certain essential goods. However, these difficulties are easily overcome. This is because of the self-sufficient system passed down in Chinese agricultural society. Although it has been undermined by capitalist imperialism, it is still easy to restore. In the plain production areas, most land has been converted to planting miscellaneous grains since last year, and in some areas, the cultivation of indigo, which was common decades ago, has been restored. Following the government's instructions, a path of production control has been naturally embarked upon. As for the various resources for military production, such as the production of coal, iron, sulfur, and niter, they are mostly located in the mountainous areas of the base areas. Some base areas, such as Jin Southeast, have reserves estimated to be sufficient for four years of supply. Moreover, the damaged bismuth rails from the edges of various base areas are the best raw materials. The issue of salt seems to be more serious, but in reality, the common people have their own methods. Inland, they rely on rock salt, well salt, and pond salt. Coastal provinces rely on Changlu salt, Qing salt, and Huai salt, as well as the niter produced locally. After the salt fields fell into [Japanese] hands, efforts to seize salt were immediately launched. The people have long been trained in the ability to smuggle salt. Now, with the encouragement of the government and the assistance of the military, the results are quite considerable. What needs to be stated is that the [Japanese] blockade lines are not impenetrable. Many sections can be freely traversed, and we will not sit idly by and be besieged.

IV. Economic Construction in Jin Southeast in the Past Six Months

The Jin Southeast Anti-Japanese Base Area includes 25 counties in Shanxi Province south of the Zhengtai Railway and east of the Tongpu Railway. It has an excellent terrain, the most battle-hardened troops, a relatively enlightened government, and the widespread development of mass salvation organizations. The great power of the combined military, political, and civilian efforts, after crushing the [Japanese] nine-pronged offensive in March last year, has deterred the [Japanese] from directly confronting this base area again. Although they are constantly seeking opportunities to encircle and attack Jin Southeast, the base area is also preparing to repel the [Japanese] offensive and, in order to further consolidate and strengthen its resilience, began economic construction in the base area in September last year. The necessity and possibility of economic construction have been discussed earlier. The reporter will briefly report on the achievements of the construction:

In Shanxi, there are three densely populated areas: the Taiyuan Basin, the Jin Southwest Triangle, and the Changzhi-Jincheng area. Changzhi, Changzi, Tunliu, Xiangyuan, Lucheng, and Qin County are located within a basin, densely populated and rich in resources, making it an ideal base area. The coal and iron produced in Jincheng and Changzhi are comparable to Kouquan in northern Shanxi and Yangquan in eastern Shanxi, with iron reserves sufficient for four years. The millet produced in Changzhi and Tunliu is sufficient for three years in a good harvest. Other products such as liquor and vinegar are also famous. The population of Changzhi County is now over 30,000, making it the largest city in North China in our hands and the military, political, and cultural center of North China. The reason for this achievement, besides other factors, is the sustainability of the economy, which is the main reason. In addition to wasteland reclamation and ensuring food supply, the most important aspects of economic construction are the establishment of various industrial sectors:

I. Military Industry: Almost every county has a small-scale arsenal, and the production capacity is sufficient. Other factories, such as textile mills, sewing workshops, military shoe factories, leather factories, and paper mills, total no less than 200. Hemp is being improved to facilitate printing. Jixian has improved textile machines that can produce 60 to 70 bolts of cloth per day.

II. Self-Sufficiency in Daily Necessities: Production cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and production-consumption cooperatives, as well as work-relief factories, are very common. Production-sales cooperatives have been established in almost every county and village. The capital of village production-sales cooperatives is mostly over 500 yuan, the capital of district production-sales cooperatives is over 2,000 yuan, and the capital of county production-sales cooperatives is over 6,000 yuan. The capital of county production-sales cooperatives in Changzhi, Changzi, and Jincheng has reached over 10,000 yuan. This capital is mostly collected from farmers, with a small amount of government subsidies. In addition, loan offices are established in each county, district, or village using funds from confiscated and confiscated traitor properties. The funds of county loan offices are mostly over 6,000 yuan. The loan office funds in Changzhi, Jincheng, Gaoping, and Yangcheng counties are currently over 10,000 yuan. With guarantees from mass salvation organizations, low-interest or interest-free loans are provided to poor farmers or small business owners to encourage the transportation of scarce essential goods from neighboring areas, such as purchasing cotton, firearms, and salt. In addition, there are considerable achievements in transportation control, production control, export blockade, increased taxation, resisting counterfeit money, and eliminating counterfeit currency.

The above measures are all progressing rapidly, so only a brief overview can be provided. Detailed statistics are not yet available. Even if they were available, they would not be publicly disclosed. However, we can understand the situation by looking at the number of workers engaged in economic construction. The population of the 25 counties in Jin Southeast is slightly over 3 million, and the current number of workers is no less than 200,000. The membership of the National Salvation Association alone has reached 700,000. Adding their family members (who have separately joined women's salvation and children's salvation organizations), the proportion of the total population is considerable.

[Reuters, London, 12th] The UK and Romania have concluded a trade agreement, the content of which is that both governments will encourage their respective merchants to organize an appropriate body to promote it. The Romanian government will grant special permission for the establishment of a free port in a Romanian seaport to facilitate British merchants. The two governments will also study the establishment of direct air and sea transport between the UK and Romania. The agreement provides details regarding the £5 million UK guarantee, most of which will be used by Romania to purchase arms. This point will be discussed in detail later.

### Spain in Process of Borrowing from France and Holland

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] It has been learned that representatives of the Spanish government have approached three banks in Paris, France, and one bank in Amsterdam, Holland, to borrow £20 million. However, it has not yet been finalized. French banking circles say that this matter is largely political and depends on how the British and French governments decide.

Short Commentary

### Commemorating Mother's Day!

Today, the second Sunday in May, is Mother's Day, which has long been established in various countries!

Today, when the flames of war of fascist aggressors have ignited or threaten the entire China and the world, our commemoration of Mother's Day has special and significant meaning!

Who among us does not have a mother? Who among us has not enjoyed the great love of a mother?

Our mothers, for the sake of great love, have endured countless hardships! Until terrible wrinkles creep onto their foreheads and hands, they still fearlessly face all pain for the sake of their children's lives and happiness!

Our Chinese mothers today, for the independence, freedom, and happiness of China, have sacrificed their husbands and sons. They have even endured unimaginable humiliation and slaughter by [Japanese] and traitors!

Our mothers today are playing out a great drama of defending the Chinese nation and defending human culture. Yet they believe that unity is still lacking, and they do not receive any sympathy, comfort, or respect! Think about it! Children of the world, children of China, shouldn't we be ashamed?

Greeting this great Mother's Day, from today onwards, we must value the great significance of the efforts of mothers today! We must not only give them sympathy, comfort, and gifts, but we must also launch mass movements to comfort the families of soldiers fighting at the front! To comfort the mothers who are exiled in various places! To educate and organize the vast numbers of working women! To promote the movement of Chinese mothers to protect and nurture the next generation! What is particularly important is that we must also rescue the hundreds of millions of mothers who are suffering from humiliation, starvation, cold, and death under the guns, axes, ropes, and all the horrors of the [Japanese] and traitors!

Greeting this great Mother's Day, we also hope that enlightened mothers and mothers with capital will contribute more! You must respond to the Central Government's National Spiritual Mobilization and implementation measures, practice frugality, diligence, and hygiene in the family and among relatives and friends! No more going to dance halls, indulging in opium and entertainment, neglecting household affairs, and ignoring the lives of your children! You must encourage your husbands and children to have a tense, serious, lively, and united spirit! You must encourage your husbands and children to take responsibility for saving the country and the nation! You must expand your maternal love to love the country and the nation, to care for the tens of millions of refugees and soldiers! You must also detest the traitors' advocacy of peace and anti-communism, because this is helping the [Japanese] destroy China! Know that if the country and the nation do not gain independence and freedom for one day, then the interests of any family will not be guaranteed for one day!

I remember a famous female leader once said in an article "Chinese Women and Families": If Chinese women do not value luxury, then Chinese officials will never be corrupt; if Chinese women strive for the country, then Chinese men will definitely be able to defeat the [Japanese] (the general idea is like this). We sincerely hope that Chinese mothers will think about the great significance of these words!

We wish the Chinese mothers of the great era all the best!

### Constructing a Modern New City: Hong Kong Government Forms Urban Design Committee to Advance Municipal Construction in Hong Kong, Plans Divided into Four Departments: Transportation, Construction, and Industry, Draft Bill Already Prepared, Awaiting Legislative Council Approval Before Implementation

Urban construction in Hong Kong is mostly based on old designs, with buildings piled on top of each other and narrow, uneven streets. In terms of the entire Hong Kong, it is still far from the ideal of a modern city. The Hong Kong authorities, recognizing the need to improve urban construction, have appointed an Urban Design Committee to be responsible for designing the construction of new urban areas. The organizational law of the committee has also been drafted by the Attorney General and was published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette yesterday.

### Women's Joint Council Suddenly Ordered to Dissolve, Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Dissolution, Funds Raised Donated to Manufacture Short Shirts and Pants

The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Joint Council, after being recently ordered by the Hong Kong government to cease its organization, held a meeting at the Chinese Women's Association at 7:30 pm the night before yesterday in order to comply with the laws of the host country to discuss the issue of dissolution. Representatives from various women's circles attended the meeting. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely tense, and they all expressed regret over the suspension of the organization, believing that the purpose of the council was purely for relief work for wounded soldiers and refugees, and there was no other meaning behind it. After discussion, the representatives decided to dissolve the council immediately, and at the same time resolved to donate the sum of 1,023 yuan, which the council had previously earned from the drama performed by the China Travel Troupe at the Queen's Theatre, less expenses, together with 100 yuan donated by the Chinese Women's Association, to the Hong Kong Office of the Women's New Life Movement to manufacture short shirts and pants and send them to the soldiers at the front.

### High Rents and Poor Business, Stalls in New Central Market Mostly Losing Money, Rents Two to Five Times Higher Than Before, More Than Ten Stalls Preparing to Close Down After a Month

The Central Market in Hong Kong has not been open for long, but the business of the stalls in the market has been extremely weak. Most of them are losing money every day, and some stalls are preparing to close down and return the lease. The reporter went to investigate yesterday and visited Mr. Tot, Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, who is responsible for management, to inquire about his opinion on this situation. It is divided as follows:

Business Conditions: Heavy Losses

According to the vendors in the market, they all regret setting the rough amount too high when bidding for the stalls. Moreover, even now, some of the stalls have not been opened, and some have been closed due to excessive losses. Among the beef and mutton stalls, 14 are preparing to return the lease after two months (because it is stipulated that the rent must be paid two months in advance). One vegetable stall closed down three days after opening. The biggest reason for this is that the rent is too high, and business is very slow during the day, so they have to sacrifice two months' rent to avoid excessive losses. Currently, the rent value of the stalls in the Central Market is about two to five times higher than in the past on average. This excessive price is contrary to economic principles. According to the owner of a pig stall with a monthly rent of 688 yuan and 50 cents, although his rent value is not too high, his daily business losses have reached about 6 yuan. Another meat stall with a rent value of 150 yuan closed down four days after opening. The business of other stalls is also not good, and most of them blame the authorities for allowing shops on nearby streets to sell fresh fruits, which has affected the business of the market.

Mr. Tot Expressed Disbelief

The reporter also visited Mr. Tot, Chairman of the Health Bureau. He claimed that he has not received any reports regarding the poor business in the Central Market and the closure of some stalls, and that this matter is not credible, because the market regulations stipulate that all stalls must pay two months' rent in advance. They have already paid the rent and are giving up their rights to enjoy it and not doing business. Furthermore, it is stipulated that any stall that returns the lease must give one month's notice in advance to facilitate the procedures. However, according to the report of Chairman Tot at the Municipal Health Bureau meeting held on Tuesday, the new market has a total rental value of 348,315 yuan and 60 cents. The total construction cost of the market is only 800,000 yuan. Such a high rental value exceeds economic principles. Whether it affects the market business or raises prices has not yet been confirmed. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the people in the stalls in the Central Market, due to the new opening, do not dare to raise prices, and even lower prices to seek business improvement and development.

### Early Summer in Hong Kong

— Yu Lang

Special Feature

The weather is still cool, but the bare legs and arms of women, revealed through the loose weave of silk gauze, have already begun to tell us—summer is here.

Summer is here, women are liberated from their fur coats; thin and short summer dresses display parts of their bodies; the streets are filled with vibrant colors and a light, lively atmosphere.

The department store windows are displaying light-colored outer clothing fabrics, white handbags, white, light gray, light white high heels… everything, everything, is supplying women to adorn themselves for the early summer, early summer! This is a season for women.

Of course, men's perception of the weather is not much slower, "Changing seasons, changing seasons," white "Saxons," light-colored suits, pale yellow "Pompadours"... replacing their wool suits.

"Changing seasons, changing seasons," forgive me, let me send you a reminder—

Newspapers report that goods from East * * , especially clothing fabrics, are increasing in imports; * -made goods have arrived in large quantities and begun to dump prices. What should you do when "changing seasons"?

The second point is: summer is coming, you are busy "changing seasons," and the anti-Japanese soldiers shedding blood on the front lines also need to change seasons: what they need to change is not "Saxons," suits, or "Pompadours,"… but truly short clothes worth less than a dollar a set. The short clothing donation movement is underway. When you "change seasons," will you think of changing seasons for the soldiers shedding blood on the front lines?

Hong Kong, an island country, with its deep blue sea water, golden sandy beaches, is most lovable in summer. Many swimming pools have already opened, the swimming season has arrived, and the swimming pools are becoming more lively day by day.

Truly, "cool and refreshing water," after a swim, "one can have ice cream, pastries, sandwiches... and other Western-style delicacies. If you want to escape the heat or escape the heat and the summer, why not live in Repulse Bay? Wealthy people can also build private swimming pools on the Repulse Bay beach!

In anticipation of the swimming season, presidential ships and queen ships have transported large quantities of 1939 or 1940 swimming suits from foreign countries, colorful, made of silk, cotton, yarn, wool, revealing the entire back and belly, filling the department stores.

For the past few years, manufacturers of swimming suits have focused on reducing yarn and increasing the exposed parts of the body, from exposing thighs to exposing backs, exposing bellies… continuing until many people thought it would lead to complete exposure without swimming suits; but manufacturers who want to do business will not be so foolish. This year, instead of working on the "exposure" aspect, they are working on the "color" aspect, with various patterns, designs, mixed colors, gold and silver, all available. Of course, the prices are not cheap, the cheapest costing more than ten dollars, and the more elaborate ones costing twenty or thirty dollars, or even seventy or eighty dollars!

This year, Hong Kong swimming pools will definitely be more lively, and the girls wearing colorful new swimming suits will definitely be more beautiful; beauty, dressing up beautifully, this is the greatness of urban women!

Early summer is here, early summer brings you beauty, joy, but it also brings you a bit of terror—the terrible summer epidemic of cholera is also coming fiercely. According to the health authorities, many cases have already been discovered, and this year we must start taking precautions early.

The distribution of ice cream and cold drinks will be restricted, but you don't have to worry about not having ice cream to eat. A certain ice cream company announced that it made a profit of more than one hundred thousand yuan last year. Wasn't cholera very prevalent last year?

Cholera will naturally be a serious problem this year. You see, the population has increased by more than 300,000, and the standard of living is getting higher day by day. How can the poor talk about hygiene?

Perhaps it is only those wearing black sunglasses who can see clearly (?)—In the sun, many poor people are washing clothes in mountain streams and drinking water with their hands. There are also often groups of women and children drinking cold water from street taps.

Under the evil pressure of rent increases, those who used to live on the first floor now live in one room, and those who lived in one room now live in a bed space? Those who lived in bed spaces end up on the streets. As the weather gets warmer, the streets and alleys are filled with people: there are men, women, old women, and also nursing children. Dirty clothes are piled up on the side of the ditch, and they eat leftover food from the previous night in a bowl on a brick board. The children eat rotten fruit picked up in front of the fruit stalls… In such a life, with the arrival of cholera, aren't they heading to the front lines of death?

However, do not ignore that cholera is a very contagious disease. Cholera does not recognize the rich and the poor. If the poor get cholera, the rich will also be infected. In order to save themselves, the rich should also help the poor improve their lives and prevent it early.

Early summer is a naughty child, he brings people many beautiful summer clothes, swimming girls, and also brings many homeless people sleeping on the streets.

He gives people ice cream, swimming, waltzes, … and also brings people the terrible cholera.

Exile for Work

### Shanghai Refugee Student Work Team Hosted a Report to All Sectors Yesterday, Now Planning to Go to Guilin to Continue Working Hard, Hoping to Provide Spiritual and Material Assistance

The Shanghai Refugee Student Work Team held a meeting in Shanghai last month. Because of holding the National Spiritual Mobilization and hanging the national flag, they were arrested by the French Concession as terrorists and ordered to leave the country. Those who were forced to leave the country include Shen Ziren, Wu Wenpu, Dongfang Hun, Zha Yunqing, Tian Peifang, Sun Zhibing, Shen Heshi, Cao Houchu, Yang Jie (above males), Yang Yang, Huang Xia Hua, Lu Qing, Gao Jing (above females), a group of thirteen people, recently took a ship to Hong Kong, planning to transfer to Guilin Province to engage in salvation work. However, all members of the team, in order to look at the road ahead, retain life, and hastily leave Shanghai, did not carry money. In addition to the Yanlian Association and the Bingzai Association each donating HK$100 upon arrival in Hong Kong, and the Aberdeen Teachers' Association donating HK$6, the travel expenses to Guilin are still huge. Therefore, the team yesterday afternoon, held a meeting at the Bingzai Association, inviting all sectors and representatives of overseas Chinese to report on this forced exodus from Shanghai due to work, and to ask for assistance from all sectors to depart for Guilin.

Hope for Spiritual and Material Assistance

The meeting was opened by Shen Ziren, chairman of the team, who briefly said that he was very grateful to everyone for taking the time out of their busy schedules to participate in the team's reception today. The reason why we were forced to leave Shanghai was entirely due to our efforts for the future of the motherland. Therefore, disregarding everything, we privately left our beloved families and fled to Hong Kong. This sadness has long disappeared in excitement. Although we have left our beloved hometown, we still feel very excited. The first point to be said today is to report our past work in Shanghai and our organization, so that everyone can know and give us greater sympathy. The second point is how we will carry out our work in the future. The third point is to realize our ideals and go to Guilin to do our work. At the same time, we hope that everyone will give us spiritual and material assistance. Then, Wu Wenyang reported on the situation of working in Shanghai.

Work in the Past Four Periods

Briefly said that in the past, our work can be roughly divided into four periods. The first period was after the July 7th Anti-Japanese War broke out. The comrades participated in the Shanghai Youth Summer Rural Service Corps to work in the countryside, and also participated in the Shanghai Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Aviation Exhibition Propaganda Team, responsible for propaganda work, etc. After the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, our work entered the second period, actively participating in the Anti-Japanese War. Also, because of the different schools, we participated in various organizations. Like the Shanghai Garrison Allied Team, we also participated in the Shanghai Student Battlefield Service Corps, the Shanghai Student Salvation Association, the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, and various frontline and rear work of the wounded soldiers' hospitals and refugee relief associations. After more than three months of work, the National Army moved west and withdrew from Shanghai. Later, our work entered a new period. In addition to some familiar comrades leaving Shanghai with the army, many others stayed in Shanghai for environmental reasons and began to organize the Shanghai Refugee Student Team, using this spirit to continue working in various anti-Japanese areas. After the first successful departure, five teams were organized in succession, mobilizing more than 300 people. When the sixth team was about to depart, because the power of the × people in Shanghai was increasing day by day, our collective actions were noticed and the Concession authorities were forced and instigated by the × people's Military Police Command to arrest all our comrades from the departing ships one by one. Most of them were disbanded, and the team leader, Comrade Shen, was driven to Shantou. However, in this harsh environment, we changed the way we worked and entered the fourth period, which can also be said to be our most difficult period.

Hope for Guidance and Supervision from All Parties

During this period, we planned commemorative meetings on every anniversary day as an opportunity for our activities, and we used ghostly guerrilla methods to distribute leaflets and slogans in every bustling entertainment venue on last year's "July 7th", "August 13th", and "September 18th" anniversaries, which had a great effect. Especially on "August 13th", Comrade Yang was arrested by the ×× Military Police Command for his work, and suffered very severe × ×. Team leader Comrade Shen, after arriving in Shantou, received the sympathy and assistance of Mr. Zhou You, a director of the ×× Support Association, and returned to Shanghai to work, and joined the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union. On March 28, the anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Puppet Municipal Government, Comrade Shen was ordered to mobilize more than 3,000 dockworkers to swear never to cooperate with the × people, and the emotions were very enthusiastic. Until the near-upper month, on the 20th, due to the Shanghai City Industry and Commerce community publicizing spiritual mobilization, an affair took place because of the hanging of the national flag. Three of our comrades were arrested, and we received a final report from the × people's side. Under the environment of having to leave, we abandoned our families and secretly left Shanghai in a rush of time. "The past work is roughly like this. Regarding the present," because we left in a hurry, our poor economic strength, except for the boat tickets, the rest was finished in Hong Kong in less than three days. Although life is very hard now, we only feel happy in spirit. As for the future, we will return to the motherland to help the army and work with the army. We are willing to find and do all the work that the army needs to do, or help the local government do civilian work, so that our army and people can be united. We are determined to do the most difficult and hardest work that others are unwilling to do in order to obtain our supreme and glorious price. Our report is over. We hope that everyone can sympathize with us, help us, and hope that all parties will give us unreserved guidance and supervision. Then the guests gave speeches, and the team answered questions before the meeting adjourned.

### Hong Kong Government Will Seek a Proper Solution to the Kowloon Walled City Pig Farming Problem, The Commissioner of Health Surveyed Ngau Chi Wan Yesterday, Planning to Move the Pig Farms Near the Urban Area to the Mountainside

The incident of banning the residents of Ngau Chi Wan, Kowloon City from raising pigs and livestock has been repeatedly petitioned to the Chinese Affairs Secretary by the local residents, earnestly requesting the transfer to the Hong Kong government and the municipal health authorities, calling for the cancellation of the ban, so that the livelihoods of thousands of local farming households will not be trapped in a tragic situation. This matter has been going on for many months. The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to carefully consider and properly handle the matter, have not yet resolved it. However, thousands of local residents have signed their names, because in this situation, the impact on their daily lives is not small. Recently, the local gentlemen convened a meeting of representatives of residents and farming households to discuss appealing to the authorities again, so as to resolve the matter and allow the local farming households to avoid being at a loss.

Petitions to the Authorities, Earnest Statements

After several consultations, it was decided to hire a lawyer to be responsible for contacting the Chinese Affairs Secretary and the municipal health authorities, requesting that on the one hand, they would again jointly submit a petition to the authorities, earnestly stating the detailed explanation of the current living conditions of the local residents raising livestock. If they obeyed the order to move to a quiet area in the New Territories to continue raising pigs and livestock, the situation would be extremely difficult. Because thousands of local residents engaged in livestock farming have little or no huge capital, and the raw materials for daily livestock pig livestock are all personally obtained from the waste water from the residents' buildings in the Peninsula and Hong Kong, and the rotten vegetables from the vegetable market. Once they move to the New Territories, which is far from the urban area, it will be extremely difficult to obtain all the waste water and rotten vegetables, and the construction of all the moved wooden huts will require money. Judging from the current capabilities of the Kowloon farming households, it is impossible to bear the burden.

Authorities Plan, Proper Solution

Yesterday, the reporter went to interview Mr. Yang, the representative of the Kowloon City farming households, who said that after the joint petition was submitted by the farming households, the Hong Kong government authorities have expressed their determination to seek a proper solution under the principle of not increasing the difficulties of the local farming households, so as to carry out the plan to expand Kowloon City. However, it is necessary to beautify the city appearance and strictly maintain the health and hygiene of the general buildings and residents, so it is necessary to consider it in detail, but also take into account the difficult situation of the general farming households. Therefore, moving to the New Territories seems to be forbidden by the environment, but if it is not properly managed, it will not be without considerable obstacles to the city appearance and the health of the local residents. The only solution is to move the pig farming wooden houses near the buildings in the Kowloon City area to a more remote area near the mountainside of Saam Shing Wan, which is considered suitable for the south side and is also considered to be easily feasible.

Health Personnel Go to Survey

The Municipal Health Bureau is currently planning this stable measure. Yesterday, light personnel were sent to survey the mountainous area near Ngau Chi Wan to investigate the land situation in that area and give it detailed consideration as to whether it can be conveniently implemented. As for the opinions of the general farming households, they believe that although it is easier to obtain various feeds when raising pigs and livestock near the urban area, the authorities must comply with the authorities' instructions in order to maintain the hygiene of the local residents and beautify the city appearance, and move to Ngau Chi Wan near the mountainside. Although it is slightly farther from the urban area and it takes a considerable amount of time to travel back and forth, it is far better than moving to the New Territories. If the authorities decide this way, the general farming households will be happy to comply.) It also said that regarding the resolution of this matter, the authorities will convene a meeting of local gentlemen and representatives of farming households in the coming days to discuss the matter in detail. It is expected that the resolution of this matter will proceed smoothly in the future.

### Eliminate the Spread of Seasonal Diseases, Strictly Ban Dirty Housing, Health Authorities Have Instructed Staff to Conduct Serious Investigations, Those Who Fail to Clean Up Within the Deadline Will Be Prosecuted and Punished

The recent weather is erratic, with frequent changes between cold and hot, causing seasonal diseases to multiply and posing a great threat to the health of Hong Kong residents, and even causing some to lose their lives. Among them, the most harmful is tuberculosis, which has been spreading for a long time, and the recently developing smallpox and cholera (also known as cholera). The harm of cholera is especially frightening. Cases have been discovered continuously in recent days. The municipal health authorities, in order to strictly protect the lives and health of residents, have repeatedly issued announcements to the general public, advising them to be careful about their diet and properly adjust their personal hygiene. On the one hand, they advise the general public to go to various public hospitals and police stations to get injections.

Preventive cholera injections, and prepare to send staff door-to-door for injections when necessary, showing the health authorities' concern for the health of residents. According to sources, the health authorities are paying close attention to the gradual spread of cholera. In addition to the various appropriate preventive measures mentioned above, it is also recognized that the dirtiness and unhygienic conditions of general housing, especially the street food, lower-level restaurants, tea houses, and cafes, are especially important. In order to eliminate the threat of cholera and fully

protect the health of residents, it is necessary to strictly ban these unsanitary places. Recently, the Cleanliness Bureau personnel in various districts of Hong Kong Island and the Peninsula have been ordered to conduct serious investigations. After receiving orders, the Cleanliness Bureau personnel in various districts have been dispatched one after another to carry out investigations, paying more attention to residents' housing. If the setting of rooms and attics in the building is considered to hinder the air circulation in the building, they will be warned immediately and ordered to demolish and improve it within the specified time. Those who fail to comply within the deadline will be prosecuted and punished without leniency.

They are also specifically ordered to clean the kitchens, toilets (or night soil buckets), and bathrooms in the building at all times to meet hygiene principles. Recently, many buildings with dense populations in Central, Sheung Wan, and Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island, and Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Kwun Chung on the Peninsula have been investigated and warned by health personnel. This is because the population density in these areas is the highest in all districts. Each building often houses forty or fifty people. The beds in the building are stacked on top of each other. Regardless of the space under the stairs and

the connection to the building, they are all filled with residents. The large number of people and the lack of cleanliness fill the building with dirt, which has a great impact on the health of the residents. As for the middle and lower-level restaurants, tea houses, restaurants, ice cream parlors, herbal tea shops, and other public places in various districts, they are also investigated one by one, strictly requiring cleanliness and hygiene, and food must not be contaminated in any way, so as not to harm the citizens. The cleanliness of food stores on street shops and various stalls in "food streets" in various districts is especially monitored by cleanliness personnel. Those who still do not meet hygiene standards after repeated education and persuasion will have their licenses and stalls revoked. Recently, street vendors in Sham Shui Po and Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and other districts, because the weather has gradually become hot, have sold a lot of ice water and other cold drinks, and have now disappeared from view due to the crackdown by cleanliness personnel.

### Masses, Revolution, Historical Drama: Problems of Writing and Staging

— Hu Chunbing

(1)

Mass drama is a play where the masses are the masters. In ancient times, the masters of dramas were emperors, nobles, or semi-divine figures. After the medieval period, knights, wandering poets, and young ladies appreciated by the powerful and wealthy appeared on stage. The barber as the master of the drama was a pioneering record of modern drama because the petty bourgeoisie gradually rose at that time. Using a lively social collective, using the masses as the masters of the drama, is a modern and very modern matter. Thanks to the great poet Emile Verhaeren, his "Dawn" transformed previously anonymous hero soldiers into a collective with souls, with a common will, turning aggressive wars into bright wars. Romain Rolland's "July 14th" is a glorious epic of the French Revolution on stage. Tretyakov's "Roar China!" depicts the united struggle of a suffering nation. After the War of Resistance, "Defend Lugou Bridge" and "Huanghuagang" even more express and shout out the common will of the Chinese people who are unwilling to be slaves to resist aggression and build the nation.

Greek dramas were not without masses. However, the masses only served as a chorus. In their call and response with the protagonist, they praised the great power of fate. Sometimes, the masses represented fate, like eerie ghost shadows. The masses in Shakespeare's plays are merely followers and soldiers. They are used as decorations to show how great the master of the play is or to help create an atmosphere. They have no blood or flesh, like silhouettes. In Ibsen's and Rusi Huasui's plays, the masses only fulfill the role of villains, which is even less significant.

The awakening of the masses is a modern event, and the emergence of mass drama is an even more modern event. The performance of mass drama with blood and flesh in China is a modern experiment that began after the War of Resistance.

(2)

The term "revolutionary drama" was created for convenience. In general, any action depicting the life of a society or an era is called a revolutionary drama. Revolutionary drama can be said to be "the drama of drama" because "there is no drama without struggle," and revolution is the most direct and greatest struggle. Furthermore, it does not necessarily have to write about the front lines of struggle or war. As long as it can meet the needs of the revolution and has rich revolutionary content, it can be called a revolutionary drama.

Revolutionary dramas usually have two sides: the revolutionary camp and the reactionary camp. The climax of the play must be a conflict or a fight. The revolutionary must have a typical character—an organizer, or a Raisonneur who speaks out the guiding theory. There are also those who are passionate but lack work experience, and even internal spies. Among the reactionary camps, there must be characters that can reflect the corruption, brutality, and inevitable targets of the revolution. In addition, there are people in the reactionary camp who sympathize with the revolution, or even revolutionaries who infiltrate the inside to do work. In short, any angle of social life that embodies a revolutionary action, or the causes and effects of a revolution, can be called a revolutionary drama.

The agitational dramas of the Soviet Union following the October Revolution and the propaganda dramas during the first phase of the Chinese National Revolution were the first phase of revolutionary dramas. Now, the content has been enriched, the scope has been expanded, the artistic level has been improved, and the theoretical image has been enhanced. The Soviet Union's Advanced Theater and the Chinese War of Resistance Drama under construction are the mature stages of revolutionary drama. In writing, it overcomes the shallow propaganda of slogans, the simplistic approach of killing and fighting, and overcomes all the clichés and similar problems. It makes revolutionary drama the most exquisite and visualized display of ideology, making revolutionary drama the achievement of strictly progressive dramatic art. This is precisely the most serious task currently facing War of Resistance drama creators.

In staging, revolutionary dramas are in principle mass dramas. For the organic unity of revolutionary consciousness and mass action, for the handling of exposure, satire, preaching, and organization in revolutionary dramas, and for the portrayal of humanitarianism and human affection in revolutionary dramas, the greatest efforts are needed to overcome the difficulties that vulgar and mediocre theatrical performances cannot imagine.

(3)

The writing and staging of historical dramas are topics with the most opinions and are difficult to reach the best conclusion. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three typical types:

The first type is the expressionist method. This term does not refer to European writers who admire speed, movement, and power and are dizzy from the impact of science, but rather to our folk professional opera. This deformed expression is particularly clear in Cantonese opera. The clown can play the protagonist in any play, and it is not considered strange for the four dynasties of Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming to be in the same hall. "Xi Shi" can be trapped by Zhao Zilong, and "Guan Yunchang" may as well "fight Yuchi Gong." The father is dressed in the Tang dynasty style, the mother is in the Song dynasty style, and the maternal grandfather may be in the Qing dynasty style. The son is from the early Republic of China, and the daughter is in the most modern style of 1939. All of this is not a problem because the play is always a play.

The second type is the representational method, which can be distinguished by Drinkwater's "Lincoln" and general European and American historical biographical films. They research, they imitate, they seek to be as similar as possible in every detail, and every move is antique. However, they often produce lifeless antiques, or the meticulous realism hinders its emotional effect.

The third method is critical, which is to reorganize historical materials through modern people, permeate the power and demands of the current masses into the remains of history, and give new life to the dead corpses with our fiery and strong will to survive. Under the ancient clothes, there is a lively, current, and combative spirit. This is an active method, which is to critically accept history from our perspective, making the visualized ancient times a symbol of our demands. In this way, we are different from the so-called expressive style. Our attitude must be absolutely rigorous, our research work must be practiced together, we must understand the society of that era, and study the social causes, historical significance, and current impact of an event. We cannot allow any puppets or clothes racks to walk onto the stage. Our understanding of history, critical attitude, and artistic performance must be integrated.

At the same time, our greatest effort is not to passively follow the trivial and cumbersome details of history, but to arouse the public's awareness of current tasks in the ancient images.

Especially today, when everything is subject to the War of Resistance and everything serves the War of Resistance, our academic cultivation, work experience, and material conditions are extremely scarce. We only have this one standard, which is also the only method.

(4)

The trinity of mass, revolution, and historical drama is an urgent topic for today's art lovers. To expand the field of drama and win over a large number of masses with lower cultural levels. There must be a recreational and enlightening effect in the high level of defense. We must overcome all kinds of difficulties to realize this task.

This will be a glorious tradition, and all drama workers must rise up to be the creators of this tradition!

### The China Salvation Drama Troupe: Preparing for the 742nd Great Performance - A Large-Scale Charity Performance at Lee Theatre on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this Month

— Qi Zhuo

For more than a year, the China Salvation Drama Troupe has traveled all over the north, south, east, and west, performing 741 times on the front lines, in the rear, in cities, and in rural areas. These are my tears, your tears, and the tears of others! These are the words I want to say, the words you want to say, and the words everyone wants to say! This is my experience, your experience, and everyone's experience. This is my way out, your way out, and everyone's way out—such dramas have moved countless compatriots and inspired countless compatriots!

In Shangcheng, peasants who came to see the play from all directions refused to leave and slept under the stage, bringing rice to cook and prepare to watch again the next night and the night after.

In one place—Xuzhou—after the performance, the moved soldiers said to the "China Salvation" friends, "You are performing us. The officers on your stage are exactly like our officers."

In another place—Luoyang—before the performance was over, it suddenly rained heavily. The officer ordered the brothers to temporarily return to the team to avoid the rain and wait. However, the brothers were reluctant to leave and preferred to be soaked in the rain for more than two hours to continue watching.

In another place—Dabie Mountains—the peasants who had watched the play asked the "China Salvation" friends, "Is what you are performing real or fake?" The "China Salvation" friends showed them the "Records of the Brutalities of the × People." The shy women covered their eyes and dared not look, and they all scolded ×××. From then on, they started visitation and organization work, becoming a strong force to defend the Dabie Mountains.

Recently, they arrived in Shaoguan and moved countless generals and soldiers in a troop-comforting performance. General Zhang Fakui, on the "March 12" Arbor Day, gathered all the soldiers and personally directed them to salute the "China Salvation" friends and earnestly exhorted them.

...Such facts are truly endless. Why do they have such appeal? The answer is very simple. The members of the troupe, in addition to Jinshan and Wang Ying, the fourteen comrades who departed from Shanghai and the partners absorbed along the way are all outstanding young people with high enthusiasm and correct political awareness. Because of their hard work and strict lives, they have won the sympathy and help of all parties, which is naturally not an accident.

They will go abroad to comfort overseas Chinese, using facts to let the overseas Chinese know that the money and efforts they have spent in the past have not been wasted. They will also mobilize the financial resources of overseas Chinese to complete the great tasks of the "Wounded Soldiers' Hospital," "Cultural Food Supply Center," and "Rear Handicraft Institute" in the war zone. This is an urgent task, a task that China Salvation friends can complete, and a task that we should help with.

After the "China Salvation" arrived in Hong Kong, the climax of "welcome" and "reunion" surged. What about the drama? Because of their meticulous preparations, they have not yet met us. "Hurry up and perform"! "Hurry up and perform"! Many people are waiting so earnestly.

Over the past month, the "China Salvation" friends have been preparing for出国 procedures and rehearsing new dramas, continuing to maintain the spirit of serving in the war zone with their tense lives and hard work. They are scheduled to go abroad in early next month. The performance? There are already signs, which readers will be happy to hear!

Now, the Hong Kong Valley Realm Relief Refugee Joint Committee, because of its admiration for the troupe's outstanding achievements and refined dramatic art in domestic work in the past, has decided to invite the troupe to perform a large-scale charity performance for the association before出国 for the purpose of expanding salvation propaganda and raising funds to help wounded soldiers and refugees. Members have been sent to obtain the troupe's consent, and the China News Reporters Association has been recommended to host this performance, and the Four Women's Federation, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, and the Chinese Artists Association and other organizations have been recommended to form a special charity performance committee to be responsible for handling it. The first special committee meeting was held the day before yesterday, and after detailed discussions, the main points were decided: 1. The performance venue is at Lee Theatre. Performance time: This month's 25th, 26th, and 27th, three consecutive nights. Performance repertoire: "Defend the Motherland" on the first night, "National Eternity" on the second night, and "Spring of Taierzhuang" on the third night. 3. Ticket prices are divided into five types: two cents, five cents, one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan.

In recent days, they have been rehearsing vigorously at Lee Theatre, and all the friends who have visited praised their serious attitude. The Youth Drama Association and other drama workers have been invited to help perform supporting roles and have been deeply moved. This is a very good influence.

The reporter visited China Salvation friends yesterday and went to the backstage of Lee Theatre to carefully observe their work, and I believe even more that the plot and performance skills of the three plays will have great success.

Especially unprecedented in the Hong Kong drama world, their realistic scenery hall has everything, great and unique, costing a total of more than 2,000 Hong Kong dollars. The troupe's talented friends are carefully making it, and the several floors of the backstage of Lee Theatre have now become a workshop. City walls, hillsides, stone monuments, houses... are truly extremely vivid. The reporter even thought that several peach trees were real. As for the magnificent and beautiful various screens, Mr. Hui Shan said: "After the performance, the cloth strips can be folded up and the wooden frames can be separated and packed into boxes, which is very convenient to take to Southeast Asia."

"Thunder" and "wind" all have specially made equipment. When pushed, they sound like real thunder and real wind. The reporter was very interested and played with them several times, secretly admiring the experience. If I return to the mainland to do drama work, this will be the most practical lesson. Other sounds such as airplanes and gunshots also have ways to make them realistic.

As for the lighting, more than one thousand yuan was spent and many parts were purchased from the United States. In order to facilitate the control of the lighting, the steel mesh above the stage was recklessly removed. In the future performances, whether it is morning, noon, dusk, or night, it can be set off with lighting. The scenery and lighting cost a total of more than 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. This is an unprecedented miracle in Hong Kong. Coupled with the vivid plot and the refined actors, the performance will surely be a blockbuster and create a great new record for Hong Kong drama. At the same time, the troupe not only performs charity performances but also took out more than 3,000 Hong Kong dollars for performance expenses, which is also the pinnacle of charity performances.

The troupe's past performances were in mountainous wildernesses and streets... which is the stage. Why is it so particular now when they arrive? The answer is very simple: to let overseas Chinese and international friends understand that our New China's drama level can reach this point.

China Salvation's 742nd large-scale performance will meet with Hong Kong compatriots. This is their epoch-making record and also Hong Kong's drama scene epoch-making record. Let us enthusiastically help and promote it!

### All Hong Kong Drama Industry Swears National Oath - Scheduled to Be Held at Po Hing Theatre This Morning

Since the central authorities promulgated the National Covenant Oath for Spiritual Mobilization Personnel, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have also responded one after another. Major community organizations have held the National Covenant Oath several times, with a total of more than 100,000 participants. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for saving the country and the bright future of the national War of Resistance. Now, hundreds of film and drama workers in Hong Kong, under the call of the Huanghuagang Performance Committee, have scheduled to hold the National Covenant Oath for Spiritual Mobilization at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon at 9:00 this morning. Mr. Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, will be the oath supervisor, and Mr. Dishi Shan, Zhong Tianxin, and Xia Yan will be invited to give speeches. More than 40 drama groups, including the China Salvation Drama Troupe, the China Art Drama Troupe, the China Travel Drama Troupe, the Shishi Drama Troupe, the First Drama Troupe of the Guangdong Drama Association, and the Youth Drama Association, will participate in the oath. The oath ceremony has been recommended to be organized by Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Jinshan, Tang Huaiqiu, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Yi Guochi, Li Hua, and Lu Dun, and Liang Fuhe, Zhan Gefen, Huang Keshan, Zhong Ping, Xi Feng, Xu Guoyu, Zhu Baishui, Hai Yan, Chen Biyi, Ou Ai, Li Jieying, Lulu, Tang De, Deng Zhujun, Yang Wei, and Tang Ruoqing have been selected as cadres, with Liang Fuhe as the general secretary and Xi Feng and Zhong Ping as the deputy general secretaries, responsible for preparing everything. It is hoped that all drama workers in Hong Kong will actively participate in this sacred and great ceremony today!

Huanghuagang Will Be Re-Staged - Final Rehearsal at South China Middle School Today

The performance of the national revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang" mobilized more than 300 drama workers and more than 200 choir workers in Hong Kong, creating unprecedented cooperation in the drama industry. The enthusiasm of the audience, the greatness of the scale, and the tension of the emotions can be said to be an epoch-making event in Hong Kong drama. However, due to various reasons, the audience could not be popularized, which is a pity! In order to promote the publicity more widely and increase income, re-staging at a low price can be said to be a unanimous request. Therefore, after several discussions between the Hong Kong Drama Circle Huanghuagang Performance Committee and the All-Circles Joint Association Charity Performance Special Committee, it was decided to re-stage "Huanghuagang" at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon on the nights of the 20th and 21st of this month to raise funds for the Relief Association to comfort the families of the soldiers who died on the front lines. At the same time, the 20th of this month is precisely the 50th birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, the pioneer of our Chinese drama movement. In order to commemorate our drama pioneers' decades of arduous struggle in the drama field, and even more to give the vast number of latecomers a close study, this re-staging is also a charity performance to celebrate Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's 50th birthday. At the same time, a "Hong Kong Drama Circle Celebration of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's Fiftieth Birthday Charity Performance Committee" was organized to be responsible for the future performance work. Under the name of the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Joint Association, it is actively carrying out the work of re-staging "Huanghuagang" and is scheduled to hold the final rehearsal at South China Middle School at 1:00 this afternoon (14th). In a week, we can face this great national revolutionary drama again.

China Civil Servants Association Drama Group to Perform "Phoenix City" Tonight

The Hong Kong Government Civil Servants Association has been established for sixteen years. Their promotion of association affairs is always based on seeking the interests of civil servants, and they also spare no effort to respond to the cause of the motherland. Now, before the solicitation of members is over, the association has specially scheduled to hold the 16th anniversary celebration of its establishment at the association's clubhouse on the 8th floor of the China Building at 7:00 pm this evening (14th), to connect the feelings of new and old members. The purpose is to have the drama group of the association's entertainment department perform the drama "Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Integrity" (ie, Phoenix City) and other programs to celebrate. This play was performed twice by the China Travel Drama Troupe at the Last Theatre, and the whole hall was full, with many people unable to get tickets, winning a lot of praise for its artistic improvement. This performance by the association was guided by Mr. Li Chenfeng, a giant in the Hong Kong drama world, and performed in Cantonese. It is believed that there will definitely be good results at that time.

### 741 Performances

— Wang Ying

The curtain is still closed

A hawker with two large black plasters on his head, a half-smoked cigarette clipped to his ear, and a roll of paper tucked under his feet walks out in front of the stage. While the audience is paying attention, the hawker suddenly jumps off the stage, raises his hand high, and shouts loudly, "Hey, wanna see the extra edition, just published"! "Wanna see the Japanese are firing in Zhabei again"! "Wanna see the Chinese soldiers are extremely powerful"! "Oh, it's a newsboy"! The audience smiles at each other, grabs the leaflets from the newsboy's hand, and applauds enthusiastically. The actor playing the newsboy circles the venue several times, distributes all the printed slogan leaflets, and then quietly walks out of the Taiping Gate.

While the audience is looking for the newsboy, they suddenly hear a loud scolding sound from behind the curtain, "Go, go"! Accompanied by the heavy sound of leather shoes, several men and women are pushed out from the side of the stage, looking very embarrassed. An officer and four brothers are escorting them. All the traitors have a paper flag inserted in their backs, "Shoot the traitor ×××." Several people follow behind, pointing and scolding fiercely; each of the traitors remorsefully says that they were used by the × people and instigated by the big traitor. "Drag them out to be shot"! the officer orders, and the brothers immediately drag the traitors to the back of the stage. The people follow off the stage, and the officer then gives a very painful speech to the audience, saying that the traitors are pitiful and ignorant, and that conscience and spirit must not be lost. Even to the death, they should not forget that they are Chinese descendants and must never speak for the × people and harm their own motherland. Finally, he specifically mentioned that every Chinese should step up the prevention and detection of traitors, "If you catch a traitor, please send them to the headquarters immediately, I will be waiting there"!

The curtain slowly opens. The air is quite solemn. The nurses in white are constantly busying themselves. A small canvas bed is lying with various wounded heroes. In their moans, they recall the battle of Shanghai, the flesh and blood charge on the front lines. Just as they are talking with great relish, a wounded soldier near the stage suddenly cries loudly. He has not spoken all along. At this time, he says his regret in front of the shocked heroes, "I was deceived by the warlords of my country, I shouldn't have come to fight you, to fight this meaningless battle." From his words, we know that he is a prisoner who was caught not long ago. "I never thought you would treat me so well, I was wrong"! He continues to wail. At this time, our wounded soldiers and doctors comfort him and explain to him that the Japanese people have no hatred for the Chinese people. This war is not good for the Japanese people. He hoped ×××××××××××"! The prisoner also raises his hand and shouts loudly.

In neat steps, the curtain opens.

Holding long guns, holding knives, holding hoes, long gowns, short gowns, a team with incomplete weapons and incomplete clothing is listening to the officer's lecture, "You can't escape if you have fields on your shoulders. Follow ×× and do it"! The officer repeats this slogan, and says that as long as we persevere, ×× will definitely be driven away. The strong men listen intently. After the lecture, the flag-raising sound resounds. The people on the stage stand at attention, and all the people under the stage stand up. The great and solemn national anthem slowly rises up.

The whole play is over. The audience expresses unlimited goodwill in the long applause.

The comrades almost all go on stage in every scene. At this time, just as they are preparing to take a breath and wash their faces well with well water, the alarm sounds, and the whole city is immersed in darkness again. We rush to the backyard, and we have to spend the night in the cold air raid shelter again tonight. "Come on, ×× in the sky, the Chinese people can no longer be intimidated by bombs and massacres"!

A Vanguard of South China Drama: The Growth and Internal Conflicts of the Cangjiang Troupe

— Tao·Tao· Gaoming Correspondent

In the great era and great environment, humanity is educated by war, and war is also educating humanity. If any sector cannot dissolve itself into the war effort, it will only be eliminated and destroyed by the war. Therefore, in over twenty months of the war of resistance, the flames of war across the motherland have destroyed countless timid and opportunistic cultural groups and workers. At the same time, how many heroic and resolute cultural circles and workers have been newly born and grown! In particular, the theater sector has shown leaping progress in the flames of the war of resistance. The Cangjiang Troupe, which I am about to report on, is such a product.

They emerged from the painful stimulus of the September 18th Incident. The patriotic youth of the Third District of Gaoming County felt that the Chinese national liberation movement would inevitably develop strongly. To meet the needs of the future war, they actively improved their tactical requirements, and the Cangjiang Troupe grew. The initial organization's funding was very short. However, through arduous struggle, they also acquired tents, gas lamps, and many drama books and props. Regarding drama, each member had little cultivation or skill. Only filled with enthusiasm, they bravely participated in this new work. They wanted to learn from real life, find teaching materials and experience. At this time, from many criticisms, they heard a lot of "unreasonable" contempt. However, the more they heard this tone, the more spirited they became, and the more they wanted to fight. Thus, this new type of energetic commando team actually progressed and became stronger amidst this "unreasonable" contempt, and wrote a glorious contribution in the history of the drama movement.

The Course of Struggle In the spring of 1939, the Cangjiang Troupe began its commando life. All twenty members became a mixed team of primary school teachers, students, and young farmers. The scope of work was very broad, including Gaoming, Gaoyao, Hecheng, and Xinxing. They wanted to spread the passion of saving the country to the poor and remote areas of the above-mentioned places, to inspire the audience. Most excitingly, at that time, the Chinese drama movement was just budding, and the travel expenses for these three months were raised by themselves. Those farmer members who came from leisure gathered this group in a very difficult environment and bravely embarked on the journey. At that time, what they felt most helpless was the lack of contact and assistance from the upper echelons in various places, and the arrangement of the impromptu theaters in the countryside was not easy to mobilize. However, these shortcomings were not enough to shake their work, because they had a persevering spirit and the drama that the people liked most. Therefore, no matter where they went, they received sympathy and gained the masses. For example, every time they arrived, they lived in ancestral halls and temples. These places were considered by the villagers to be places where only beggars and hooligans could stay. After the work started, the villagers watched their plays and were moved. They felt that their sleep on the ground and their lives were even inferior to their own, and they were very sad. Some quickly found bed boards for them, or kitchenware and props, and others rushed to cook and carry water for them, and give them fish, rice, melons, and vegetables. In such close cooperation, they saw that the future of the movement was bright, so they had to work harder and endure hardship. After the July 7th Incident, they worked more closely to meet the needs of the war of resistance in a strong manner. From then on, they not only encouraged the people, but also organized them. The Qingfu Anti-Japanese Comrades Association and the Farmers' Association Support Association in various districts of Gaoming County used their greatest strength to assist in their growth.

Great Effect In the great national revolutionary war of resistance, drama that can truly achieve the effect of education and political action among the broad masses is the emerging drama of the current stage. Gaoming County is the root of the Cangjiang Troupe. Since the country implemented the conscription system, more than 400 pure and good farmers in the county bravely volunteered to join the army to fight for the opportunity to kill the enemy. This number cannot be matched by any other county. These strong men are all children of farmers. Not only did they not evade or find substitutes, but they were very excited to use their blood and flesh to defend the country. This supreme glory can be said to be the influence and excitement of countless performances of the Cangjiang Troupe. After Guangzhou retreated, the enemy troops advanced along the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Foshan Highway into Jiujiang, the downstream of Gaoyao and Gaoming, and became the front line. The enemy's malicious propaganda poured in, and many people were misled by this poison for a while. At the front line, the anti-Japanese sentiment in many villages suddenly collapsed, and even local forces were used to hinder their own troops. At this time, the Cangjiang Troupe quickly rushed to the rescue with its strong combat power, concentrated its firepower on the target and fired, and more strongly exerted the heat of the drama struggle. At present, the people in the area can closely cooperate with the troops in combat, which is also the achievement of the fighters of the Cangjiang Troupe who fought from the enemy's torrent.

In the villages and towns, after the drama performance, they began to visit the families of soldiers on expedition and collect condolences. They educated them on how to respond to the war, prevent poison, clear traitors, and strengthen the walls and clear the fields. Because the people had a good understanding of them after watching the drama and developed feelings, it would be unexpectedly convenient to do anything with this advantage. Everywhere they went, they organized children's choirs, taught children to sing, so that on the one hand, the children understood the meaning and function of the group, on the other hand, they popularized patriotic songs, and on the other hand, they used the children's choir to mobilize the audience along the street.

Indeed, the fact is so undeniable: only China's new drama can most easily move the Chinese people, and only China's new drama can most easily lead the Chinese people. When the War of Resistance opened, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared to us "...Propaganda is more important than combat, and the people are more important than soldiers..." Such heroic drama workers on the front line, their contribution to the War of Resistance is no less than that of the heroic soldiers. That is definitely not an exaggeration.

Organization and Funding Due to the abundance of work experience, the organization is also very strict and sound. The organization of the Cangjiang Troupe is a troupe leader, two deputy troupe leaders, and then divided into general affairs, public relations, documents, general affairs, and compilation. Each unit can strive to exert its own task and compete for the expected results. As for the source of funds, in addition to donations, they also received funding from the government, and sometimes they even took it on themselves. In this hard-working situation, they had to work hard to save resources, but the clever use of stage equipment had incredible skills. As long as they spend a little money, they can get good results with their rich experience and design. Because they are new drama people, great public artists.

Shortcomings and Difficulties The biggest disadvantage is that the location is too deep in the Yi village, and it is easy not to get the guidance and assistance from the urban cultural circles. For example, the acquisition of newspapers and periodicals, the changes in international and war affairs are known slowly, and even the progress of the Chinese drama movement is unknown. This greatly affects the progress of the work. There is also one thing that they can never forget, that is, they have not been able to transform to a wider land. As for the difficulties, according to the most serious problem at present, we must entrust that the funds have not yet been settled regularly. The future plan is to expand the organization to enrich combat power, such as increasing the purchase of projectors, radios, cameras, and simple mobile troupe so necessary scientific equipment, preparing to expand their guerrilla area, expand the scope of publicity. However, this more meaningful expansion requires more powerful forces, especially funding. For the future of China's new drama movement, for the life-and-death struggle of the national revolution, advanced groups and volunteers engaged in drama movement should be given correct guidance and practical assistance.

### A Seemingly Equivocal Draw: The Xu He Cup Remains Undecided; South China and Navy Tie 1-1; Decisive Battle Rescheduled for Next Wednesday

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the Xu He Cup final held at Mount Jia resulted in a seemingly equivocal draw. Consequently, the issue of the championship remains undecided and will await a rematch next Wednesday to determine the victor. Most spectators also extended their association with the match.

The situation during the match was more mundane than exciting. South China maintained a 1-0 lead from the start until the 20th minute of the second half. The gleaming silver cup appeared to be within their grasp. However, fate played a trick, and disaster struck suddenly. The Navy, with the referee's assistance, reclaimed lost ground. Many felt that South China suffered an injustice from this loss, but the referee's authority supersedes all. I refrain from expressing an opinion.

The lack of excitement in the performance was due to the hot weather, which significantly affected the players' spirits.

Judging by the circumstances, South China's forward line, although not performing to its fullest, still created numerous opportunities. Victory was originally within their grasp, but unfortunately, Yang Shuiyi and Ye Beihua were slow to capitalize, allowing the Navy to eventually salvage the perilous situation through arduous struggle.

Objectively speaking, South China should have won 2-0. However, due to the referee's differing judgment, the situation changed accordingly. On one occasion, Shuiyi shot a goal, and it was brilliant, but the referee called him offside and disallowed it. Conversely, Tuo Pan headed a ball that appeared not to have entered the goal but was hooked out by Li Tiansheng. However, the referee ruled it as a goal. A hair's breadth difference resulted in an enormous error. Truly, there is fortune and misfortune. According to Tiansheng afterward, that ball definitely did not enter the goal.

The comings and goings of warships are uncertain. Therefore, Navy players have the right to compete without registering with the association. Consequently, the lineup for yesterday's match featured a few new faces. Central defender Gu Ba was well-positioned, rarely attacking and focusing on defense. Hence, Feng Jingxiang found it difficult to exert his abilities under his marking. Wen Nei Ya was also steady.

In the forward line, Yan Shi Du Lang and Tuo Pan were the most active. New player Shuang Te was excellent at cutting the ball, especially on corner kicks. Thus, his indirect contribution to reclaiming a goal was significant.

Among South China's forwards, Shuiyi's performance lacked excellence, and it is inappropriate for him to insist on playing on the left wing. The team selection for next week should revert to Luo Douwen in that position. Cutting the feet to fit the shoes is not a good plan. Guo Yingqi's performance was also not as sharp as when he plays as a forward. Ye Beihua was too intrusive. Therefore, the entire forward line often suffered from a lack of coordination.

All six defenders demonstrated their skills, safeguarding the fortress with few flaws. Therefore, the failure to win yesterday was not due to defensive weakness but to the lack of ferocity in the attack. If Li Huitang or Li Zhaorong were to play in the rematch next Wednesday, along with central defender Liang Rongzhao, the attack and defense would be strengthened, and victory would come naturally. However, it remains to be seen whether the revised lineup will meet expectations.

Some say that the match lasted seventy minutes, and as no winner was determined, and no extra time was played, it benefited South China. If extra time had been played, South China, exhausted from the hard fight, might have been defeated. I agree with this view.

In the initial phase, the Navy seized the initiative. Yan Shi Du Lang and Mo Lishi attacked through the pass and advanced into South China's territory. Tiansheng rushed out from the side and kicked the ball out of danger. Subsequently, the ball was in the center, with both sides battling back and forth. At six minutes, Qingcai made a brilliant pass, which was intercepted by Guangsen Adou. He ran with the ball, bypassed the pass, and advanced. Upon reaching the key area, he cut in, and the ball dropped from the high altitude, not far from the goal. At this time, heads were seen bobbing, and bodies were interweaving. However, Jingxiang finally headed the ball into the lower square of the goal, bouncing off the post and into the net. Di Jia Chen attempted to save it but was too late. South China thus took a 1-0 lead. The Navy, starting the game again, launched a determined attack. Gu Ba passed short to Yan Shi Du Lang, who advanced from the side. He then passed back to Mo Yashi for a shot, but Mo's overhead attack was unsuccessful, and they retreated without success. Continuing their attack at the eighteen-minute mark, both Tuo Pan and Shuang Te had opportunities to shoot. However, due to inaccurate shooting, they ultimately failed to score. After a while, South China counterattacked, with Guangsen and Jingxiang shooting in succession. The former was caught by Huo Jia Chen's keen eyes and quick hands, while the latter went high over the top.

As the battle continued, the Navy grew bolder, forcing two corner kicks in a row, besieging South China's goal. Fortunately, the three armies of South China obeyed orders, reversing the situation. By the twenty-fifth minute, Jingxiang and Yingqi, after several short passes, had broken through the Navy's defense. Unfortunately, due to the two of them giving way to each other to shoot, Xuan Di seized the opportunity to save. Later, Shuiyi shot a ball in the midst of the chaos, but the referee signaled that Yang was offside, so it did not count. Soon after, the first half ended.

In the second half, the Navy's morale soared. In the blink of an eye, Shuang Te rushed into the key area to shoot, forcing a corner kick. It was kicked just right, and Rongcai punched it out, only to be caught by Yan Shi Du Lang. Fortunately, Yan shot aimlessly and fell into the desolate suburbs.

During the melee at seven minutes, Jingxiang and Beihua launched a dual offensive, but were blocked by Han Niwei Lu. As a result, South China gradually felt unsupported. At twenty minutes, a leak was seen, and finally, the pass turned to the side and delivered a high pass, which was headed in by Tuo Pan. Although Tiansheng saved it, the referee had already ruled it a goal.

With the score tied, the match became tense. However, both of Shuiyi's two shots failed to score, and the Navy's all-out attack also failed to yield further results. Before long, the game ended. Because both sides were unwilling to play extra time, the game ended in a 1-1 draw, and it was decided to replay at 4:30 p.m. on the 17th of this month (Wednesday). The lineups of the two teams are listed below.

### Yesterday's Baseball League: The Chinese Team Turns Defeat into Victory; Hong Kong Club's Momentum Falters; Two Matches Held This Morning

In the Open Baseball League, the Chinese team played against the Hong Kong Club team at the Jiaochu Navy Stadium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm.

Hu Guodong, a new player for the Chinese team, guarded first base and caught the ball steadily, but his hitting was still poor. Huang Rongjun served as the pitcher for the first two innings and was in a very bad state. He gave up a walk in the first inning and then threw inaccurately, allowing Sa, Walker, and Layton to reach base one after another, losing three points in a row. In the second inning, Huang's spirit was still wandering, and he gave up three walks, allowing Bo Dishida, Dora Da, and Ke Lihua to score three points.

The team's coordination gradually recovered from the third inning onward, and the lineup changed as follows. Qu Bingnan (i.e., Canary), who served as right fielder, gave a good performance, repeatedly catching the opponent's fly balls and defending firmly. Chen Fang and Lin Ye's hitting were also excellent, scoring points for China. They were able to turn defeat into victory with a score of eight to six.

Looking at the Chinese team's two games, there were often mistakes in defense and weaknesses in offense. Hitting, in particular, was not as good as last year, which may be due to a lack of practice.

The Hong Kong Club has recruited many good players and strengthened its lineup. The offense is quite fierce. Pitcher Rowland is steady and solid. Ke Lihua, Yisa, Bo Dishida, and Zhi Dun are all good players. Catcher Walker is quick on his feet and is a completely different person compared to last year. He reached base four times as a hitter and scored one point, which is commendable. The scores of the players on both sides are listed below.

### Exhibition Tennis Match: Performance Was Very Mundane, Few Spectators

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm, the exhibition tennis match held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club, all proceeds from ticket sales were allocated to the Hong Kong Branch of the British Fund. Before the match, there were not many spectators in the seats priced at $1.50 and $1.00. The general expectation was that the crowd would gather after the start of the match. However, the reality was different, and the number of spectators remained sparse. The ticket revenue performance is believed to be not very impressive.

A total of four groups of famous players participated in the performance. The Hong Kong doubles champion and runner-up teams, as well as the two strongest teams, all appeared on time. Unexpectedly, each of their performances was unremarkable. Perhaps they did not do so intentionally, but the performances were indeed a bit too casual.

The Xu brothers, the Hong Kong doubles champions, lost to the new partnership of De Fu and Gao Erman after winning two rounds of the Lin Zhen match, with a score of 2-6. In the final round, the Lin Zhen brothers faced De Fu and Gao Erman, and De and Gao were completely defeated by the Lin brothers, with a score of 6-1. Among the five rounds of performances yesterday, the Lin Zhen brothers performed the best. In addition to losing to the Xu brothers, they defeated the He Li team and the De Gao team with a score of 6-1 in both rounds. However, it was a pity that they were at a disadvantage in the battle against the Xu brothers.

Round 1 The He family and Li Rurong team faced off against the De Fu and Gao Erman team. The De Gao team gave a stern demonstration, winning five games in a row. Unexpectedly, they would rise up in this critical moment and win seven games in a row, turning defeat into victory. De Gao Team—7-5—He Li Team

Round 2 The Xu brothers against the Lin Zhen brothers, Xu Runpei, served first and lost two games in a row. Then, they pulled back the third and fifth games. After losing the sixth game, the Xu brothers shook their spirits in the seventh game and regained a game. Then, they tied the score and took two games in one go, winning with a score of 6-4.

Xu Team—6-4—Lin Zhen Team

Round 3 The Xu brothers against the De Fu and Gao Luman team, the Xu brothers gave a stern demonstration first and won one game. Then, they lost five games in a row. They were only a little energetic in the seventh game, but the situation was gone, and they were defeated with a score of 2-6. In this game, the Xu brothers' spirits were distracted, and there were many mistakes. On the other hand, De and Gao recognized that a major enemy was in front of them. Although it was a friendly match, winning would also be a glorious thing. Therefore, they always gave full play to their strength and finally won.

De Gao Team—6-2—Xu Team

Round 4 The Lin Zhen brothers against the He family Li Rurong, when enemies meet, they are particularly clear-sighted. The Lin family will remember the suffering they have suffered from Li in the past, and this time they will be extra careful and use their practiced methods to prevent He and Li from having the opportunity to deploy their tenacious strategy. Therefore, the He and Li only won one game and were defeated.

Lin Zhen Team…6-1…He Li Team

Round 5 The Lin Zhen brothers fought against De Ban Gao and Zhao, and Yulin Zhen fought with the remaining power of the He team, driving straight in. They won with a score of 6-1. The All-Hong Kong Tennis Friendly Tournament ended plainly.

Lin Zhen Team—6-1—De Gao Team

### Basketball Charity Game: China Overwhelms Mei Fang, YMCA Defeats Star Team

The YMCA held a men's and women's basketball charity game last night to raise funds for the army service corps. In the first game, the women's teams of China and Mei Fang both sent their full squads. The game lacked fierce competition. China's team was a mixed squad, and their coordination was lacking. Only individual skills were on display. Li Shenyu and Ye Mengzhen had strong attacks, and Liu Shouguang's posture was clever, but her shooting was inaccurate. The defender Rao Huizhen was quite responsible, while He Cui and others were not outstanding. Mei Fang's Ye Meilian did not play, but Lu Xian attacked openly and secretly, achieving good results repeatedly. Chen Yuemei and Huang Baozhen also had skillful shots. As for the defenders, they were neither good nor bad. Therefore, the two teams had their own strengths, and the outcome was not too one-sided. The first quarter was nine to seven, and the second quarter was seventeen to twelve. China maintained the lead. After switching sides, Mei Fang fought hard and tied the score at twenty-two to twenty-two. By the end of the third quarter, they had taken the lead with twenty-two to fourteen. The competition became more intense in the fourth quarter, and the two sides tied again at thirty-one. Until the end of the game, China finally won with thirty-six to thirty-three.

In the second game, the men's teams of the YMCA and the Star Team played. The former was a mixed team of Xingdao, South China, and Zhong Sheng, while the latter was a transformed Eastern team, with the addition of Qiu Mian from Pei Ying, and Guo Zhihong from Zhong Sheng. Since both sides considered this a performance match, the outcome was not important. Therefore, they avoided rough moves, and real skills were able to be displayed. Chen Ruzheng was the best player in the entire game. He and Liu Deyu cooperated seamlessly. Liang Guoyi, Li Peiyan, Jie Min, and others also played brilliantly. Star Team's Feng Nianhua's shot-faking and turning moves were able to avoid the opponent's defense and earned a lot of cheers. The other players also fulfilled their duties. Guo and Qiu had some misunderstandings due to their unfamiliarity with the team's coordination.

In the course of the game, the YMCA took the lead with eleven to seven and twenty-one to nine. At the end of the half, they still led with twenty-eight to nineteen. After switching sides, the YMCA's attack weakened, and they were forced to a tie at thirty-three to thirty-three, and then fell behind at thirty-three to thirty-five. Afterwards, the Star Team had a smooth run, taking the lead with forty-one to thirty-eight and forty to forty-six. Until the last six seconds, the Star Team was still winning with forty-nine to forty-eight. Then Chen Ruzheng got the ball and shot, and the ball went in just as the final whistle blew. The YMCA thus won with fifty to forty-nine.

### A Word to the South China Football Club

— A Member

Hong Kong people value sports. For decades, the most popular sport has been football. Our club – South China – has spared no effort in promoting it. Talents have emerged in large numbers, and achievements have been remarkable. The team has participated in various competitions and consistently won championships, maintaining its prestigious reputation to this day. However, accumulating greatness is not something that can be achieved overnight. It relies on the efforts of successive leaders in providing facilities, as well as the players' dedication to competition, to build this towering and admired position. This is truly a remarkable achievement.

Therefore, whether the selection of football club members is appropriate is crucial to the club's operations. As far as I know, for the past ten years or so, the club's officials have always been selected from those who are deeply familiar with the internal situation and have close relationships with the athletes, and who are also smart and capable. In the past, the football department was the busiest and most difficult to manage among all the club's departments. If the person in charge is not capable and the management is not thorough, it will be difficult to handle the numerous and complex affairs smoothly.

The new officials of the club have been selected this year and are all known to be quick-witted, promising, and enthusiastic about club affairs. It is appropriate to entrust them with these responsibilities. However, there are still some murmurs among the club members, saying that while the new officials are talented and capable, they may not be able to handle this responsibility fully. It is not enough to be talented and capable to manage everything without any worries of failure. It is because they are not deeply familiar with the internal situation of the club and do not yet know the difficulty of managing and taking responsibility. There are many deeply rooted and complex issues within the club, and it is not easy to handle them without experience. Now that this important task is entrusted to the new officials, whether they can meet the expectations of the club members in planning and handling internal and external affairs remains to be seen.

I have always regarded the club's affairs as my own and have high expectations for the new officials. I sincerely wish them success in their new endeavors and comfort the club members. As the ancient sages said, "It is difficult to start a career, and it is also not easy to maintain it." Now, the new team members are not just maintaining the status quo. Moreover, social undertakings do not belong to individuals but to the public. If the management is not appropriate in the future, it would be better to take a step back. I express my sincere feelings with deep intentions, hoping that the new officials will do their best.

### Sleeping Pills

— Dongfang

Before I set off, I received a letter from Teacher Yu, asking me to buy a bottle of An Gen Hua from Doctor Lin and send it from the post office. I hadn't seen Teacher Yu for a long time. I heard that he was very active in the guerrilla area and held an important position. Why did he need sleeping pills? So I made a special detour to his town to visit him and deliver the pills directly.

Teacher Yu was even thinner than before, but his spirit was radiant. When he saw it was me, he greeted me repeatedly, inviting me in with "oh, oh, oh" and settling down in the Baobing Pavilion. A maid brought tea, and I took out the bottle of pills and presented it with both hands, asking him why he needed the sleeping pills. He played with the decoration on the bottle, smiled gently, and said, "I have insomnia!"

Unexpectedly, a small courtyard, with green bamboo against the wall and a few artificial rocks underneath. I remembered when I used to study here and spend a lot of time here. I had been running around and achieved nothing. Teacher Yu had aged, and I had grown a beard. He asked about life on the isolated island and sighed: "Shanghai is not Shouyang Mountain after all, and wei (a type of herb) is just the money in your pocket. When the money is gone, you get squeezed out."

I was the one who got squeezed out. Hearing Teacher Yu's words, I felt unspeakable sadness. Teacher Yu continued:

"When the front line was in danger and my hometown was suffering, I once disposed of my family affairs and made a will, vowing to live and die with my country. I asked Doctor Lin to prepare a bottle of sleeping pills for me. I wrote eight lines myself, saying: 'A scholar cannot be humiliated, and the heart cannot die. What is the purpose of reading the books of sages and sages! To achieve benevolence and righteousness, I am happy in this. Heaven and earth, gods, bear witness to this!' My friends all knew about this. I made up my mind to fulfill my vow. As soon as I learned that the National Army in the city had retreated, I grabbed the bottle and poured it all down. Unexpectedly, I slept for half the night and didn't feel the slightest bit sleepy. I only heard my old wife laughing beside me. I knew I had made a mistake. This joke was not small, and people would scold me for deceiving the world and stealing fame. How could I bear it. I got up and hit my head against the wall, but I didn't die. When I woke up, everyone was surrounding me, some persuading, some talking. I didn't say a word, lying there blankly. My son spoke more reasonably. He said, 'The fall of the coastal cities was expected long ago. It cannot be compared with the loss of the country. Wen Tianxiang was loyal and upright, and when there was no way to save the situation, he died to repay the country. Now that the War of Resistance has begun, it cannot be compared with the loss of the country.' They guarded me, and there was simply no way to die. Later, my son went to the inland to participate in the War of Resistance. Before leaving, he knelt down to me, asking that his expedition be exchanged for my immortality. At this time, I myself really didn't want to die. I wanted to open my eyes and watch the great army counterattack and drive out the bandits. I sighed. Those who criticized me for not dying, I had no choice but to ignore them. Xiao Weng laughed at me: 'It is difficult to die throughout the ages. Is my heart not sad like Mrs. Xi?' Alas!

'Although my heart has not died, I have endured humiliation. The counterattack that we are waiting for never comes. This irritability is really unspeakable. Neither left nor right, looking at the shadow of the sun, listening to the sound, the days are like years, restless. Waiting, waiting, my nerves have become very tense, I often suffer from insomnia and become haggard. I am afraid I will wither and die. Fang Weng's poem: "When the royal army pacifies the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice," will be written for me. My old wife took out sleeping pills, which were very effective. This is really ridiculous. The earth did not kill me when I should have died, but saved me on the day I stole my life!'

"Now I have changed again. I feel that no matter what I do, I don't feel that time passes slowly. If I fold my sleeves and wait for others, that is worry! Rather than waiting for the counterattack, why not do it myself! I think that I have already died at that time, and now I am reborn. I have subtracted forty years from myself. I am young and strong, and I can contribute to the country. Mao Di! I am not older than you now, or even younger than you. I have learned to shoot and also know how to send and receive wireless telegraphs. We have driven away the invaders here, and this place is now a clean land. I am very happy now, and I feel a lot younger in spirit. However, I still often can't sleep at night, and I have to take medicine."

As I listened to him, I often raised my hand to wipe the sweat from my forehead, sitting quietly without saying a word.

He kept me for two days. When I left, he personally escorted me to the ferry dock, grabbed my hand, and said:

"If you can't become Yi Qi, go back and visit your parents. Still, come back here, definitely, I'll wait for you!"

His overly excited face, thin and haggard, made people uneasy. I secretly prayed that the pills could always maintain him!

### Manchuria's Snow

— Shu Qun

He knew this more clearly than they did, but he just stood there, as if to say:

"What else can I do?"

When she finished changing his bandages, he said:

"Thank you!"

"Don't thank me! Who wants your thanks! Everything is fake!"

"Have I deceived you, then?"

"What do you think?"

"I...I haven't!"

"Haven't? Have you already forgotten what you said yesterday? Yesterday you said I was one of your comrades...but--but today you're sending me home! You say you're not a traitor?"

"..." He indicated that he understood her current mood, and then he said, "Sending you home doesn't mean you're not one of our comrades. Of course you're still one of our comrades!"

"Then why don't you go home? Why do you want me to go home alone?"

"Let me tell you, the reason for you going home---"

Not listening, she cried and ran back to her room, kicking at the furniture in the room, all resounding with the solid determination of her anger. She grumbled, as if saying something:

"...Father...you've become a traitor...you have money...why do you need to see me again...you love money...why do you still love your daughter...your daughter doesn't want a father like you..."

She threw herself onto the bed, as if she had hugged the telephone pole when she came, unwilling to let go a single step; she thought of this temporary room as her long-term bedroom; she didn't listen to anyone's comforting words; other people's good words only irritated her; she harbored an excessively subjective thought:

"I won't leave, see what you can do to me!"

Her coming was that unexpected and difficult: her leaving was that unexpectedly uneasy.

Yu Wen comforted her, even drove her away, all to no avail; he keenly felt the unexpected consequences of his work.

Almost half an hour had passed. The other comrades had all packed their luggage, just waiting for her to leave; after leaving, they would immediately move to another secret address. If it took too long, something unexpected might happen: then, they would lose more than just 300,000 yuan; their heads were priceless. (65)

### Shameless Literary Style (Gleanings from Reading)

— Poor Man

To sing the praises of aggressors is not an easy task, because often even oneself becomes more and more unconvincing. However, our literary men have always had a good skill. That is, without regard to whether there are flaws, regardless of whether it's correct or not, just give it a boost, a boost. In fact, those flattering words are only a set formula, so there's really no way to tell if there are flaws or if it's correct. There should be a lot of historical material proving this kind of "literary style." But for the moment, the only thing I've found is "Ping Song Lu" [Record of the Pacification of the Song].

"Ping Song Lu" records the process of the Yuan dynasty's General Bayan pacifying the remnants of the Southern Song, a typical work of flattery. Liu Minzhong, the author, was considered a talented writer. The prefaces were written by Fang Hui, Du Daojian, and Zhou Ming. These people were probably not very skilled in "literary writing." Fortunately, I don't want to delve into their past reputations, so I won't say much more. But what should be particularly pointed out is that they were all Han Chinese. It would not be unfair at all to consider them writers of the "XX newspaper" school of more than six hundred years ago.

Liu Qi's preface says: "Our Holy Yuan's Grand Chancellor Bayan took Huaixi as easily as picking up mustard seeds, and pacifying Jiangnan was like turning over his hand." He also said, "Our Holy Emperor treats generals with benevolence and righteousness, and the Prince of Huai'an leads soldiers with benevolence and righteousness. People offered food and drink, and families celebrated together."

Fang Hui's preface says: "He did not enter the city with a single soldier or horse, did not seize a single civilian, did not plunder a single item, and it was so everywhere he went."

Du Daojian's preface says: "When using troops in the Jiang and Han regions, he did not enjoy killing. On the day the city fell, the people were all calm."

Zhou Ming's preface says: "He then led his troops to take dozens of states in Jianghuai, directly approaching Lin'an. Wherever he went, the wind swept away, and no blood was shed..."

These all sound very nice, but upon reading the book, one discovers many contradictory accounts, which really makes one feel that the book is strange:

In the year Gui Chou [1253], envoys were sent to Yangjiabao to persuade the Song generals, proclaiming the dynasty's might and virtue. The Song generals did not surrender. Xia Gui deployed over a thousand warships on the Great River, blocking the river's surface, its imposing manner seemingly unapproachable. In the year Jia Yin [1254], envoys were again sent to explain the blessings and misfortunes to the Song generals. The Song generals replied, "We have received great favors from the Great Song for generations and should fight to the death to repay the country. This is the time! How can there be any reason to betray and surrender? Prepare our armor and weapons to settle it. Today, we are betting everything on this one throw of the dice to determine the fate of the world." The Chancellor then directed the generals to attack Yangjiabao, but was unable to conquer it all day...

The Song soldiers were routed in the river. The morale of Yangjiabao collapsed. Of the hundreds of thousands of Song soldiers, almost all were killed or wounded, and their corpses blocked the river and flowed downstream.

In the year Ding Si [1277], the Chancellor hastily led his troops to Dingjiazhou... In the year Ji Wei [1277], the Chancellor directed the generals, assigning them routes, and set up cannons and crossbows along the riverbanks, attacking together—pursuing and killing for dozens of miles. Corpses floated on the river, turning the water red!

In the year Ren Wu [1277], they arrived at Changzhou. The advancing troops were locked in a stalemate... The Chancellor hastily summoned the generals, instructing them on strategies, ordering each to prepare siege equipment, and setting a deadline for a multi-pronged attack the next day. He also first placed men to shout loudly below the city. The city did not listen. In the year Gui Wei [1277], he again ordered clerks to write articles and shoot them into the city. They still did not listen. The Chancellor personally supervised several thousand troops from his personal guard in front of the south gate, and built many fire cannons and crossbows, attacking day and night without stopping. At Shen time [3-5 PM]... they conquered the city, and then carried out a massacre.

It turns out that "as easily as picking up mustard seeds" and "like turning over his hand" always meant "not surrendering" here and "not listening" there, "unable to conquer it all day" here and "attacking day and night without stopping" there. And what was called "not enjoying killing" and "no blood was shed" always meant "corpses floated down the river" here and "turning the water red" there, and "on the day the city fell, the people were all calm" always meant "massacring the city." In such a situation, it would be strange indeed if the army were so refined that not even a single "old soldier" in a tattered uniform or a horse ran into the city, nor did they capture a single civilian or steal a single item, and the people would happily prepare food and drink, with every family congratulating each other.

So, did the preface writers simply not read the book carefully? That's not the case. Even after reading it carefully, they still had to write in this way. The reason is, as mentioned above, because the words of praise are just this one set formula. At this point, the writers are actually quite pitiful, as they have nailed themselves to the cross.

However, there is another question: Since the book is mainly about flattery, why couldn't the author Liu Minzhong just say that the Grand Chancellor pacified the Southern Song without moving a single soldier or fighting a single battle? Wouldn't that have been more straightforward? But that wouldn't work either, because not only would that completely alter the historical facts, making people not believe your account at all, but it would also leave the main character in the book without any "merit" or "might." So the writer is also very pitiful at this point, just as much nailed himself to the cross.

Therefore, this is why it is a shameless literary style!

### Soviet Female Aviator (Part 2)

— By Paulina Osipenko, Translated from Moscow News

I earnestly begged the principal, I have decided I want to be an aviator! I will defend the country and will not lose to those men! The principal smiled. He suggested I take a medical examination, and the doctors said I was qualified.

After that, I was a student at the aviation school, I had a uniform and a room in the dormitory.

I don’t want to tell you about the difficulties at the beginning now. I pored over books, my desire was so great, I wanted to be a knowledgeable aviator, I treasured every minute outside of reading.

At the same time, I saw many aviators, and things I could not have imagined before. I saw a pursuit plane rocket into the sky, turning right, then left, rotating its body, performing somersaults, flying in loops, this beetle-like machine miraculously obeying in the air, performing extraordinary feats under precise calculation, it was as silent as a bird, as elusive as a swallow, soaring in the sky above Ukraine.

One plane after another landed, and I stared at the faces of these aviators coming out of the cockpit, they were all people, with incredible aerial skills!

He, the one who drives that pursuit plane, among so many people, what is different about his face, his pace, his smile from ordinary people? I thought, his story is nothing more than starting from a factory or a collective farm, the Communist Youth League, deciding to enter this aviation school. He started flying solo, not long before me. The students don't talk much about their first flights, and soon the matter turned to me.

One day, I came back from practicing with the instructor, and I made a very bad landing. At that time, I really didn't dream that I would be flying solo soon. My teacher didn't say a word about my bad landing, but turned around and asked me if I was tired.

"No," I said.

"Good, you can take a solo flight."

Happiness and surprise almost made me afraid to breathe, but I didn't abandon my senses.

"Very good, teacher," I replied calmly.

I went up, I will never forget that moment, I was alone in the air, the teacher was on the ground, I was flying solo. I made a satisfactory landing, and I took off a second time. Everything went well, and that's how my solo flight began.

But, I still have a long way to go, I decided I must become a successful aviator.

At the end of 1932, I graduated from aviation school and was sent to study to be a military aviator.

Soon I was appointed as a squad leader, and my work performance showed significant progress. In addition to my main job, I also did many social things, helping my husband with his studies and work. I continued to work hard, I learned to drive a tank, and at the same time, I focused on my education. I graduated from the workers' preparatory school, and I was preparing to enter military aviation school again. I flew for six years without an incident, not even a forced landing.

When I had enough confidence, I asked my commander to allow me to take a long-distance flight. He thought for a moment and said:

"I advise you to make a maximum altitude flight in advance, do you agree?"

"I agreed."

In September 1936, the commander called me and told me that I could make a maximum altitude flight to test the maximum altitude of the aircraft.

I drove the "Fenda" seaplane, I paused at an altitude of 30,000 feet for 19 minutes, the plane could still rise higher, but I didn't dare to go to its limit. When I landed, Officer Jiagen congratulated me,

You have flown higher than any woman in the world, he said.

My husband, who is also a squad leader, has also reached a great altitude, but I have surpassed him, surpassed everyone in our group. In this exercise, I reached 23,000 feet without an oxygen device.

In May 1938, my teammates Fulan, Lomaga and Malinovskaya and I made a non-stop flight from Moscow to Va, establishing a national women's long-distance flight record, flying around the ring in our seaplane, we flew one thousand and ninety-three two miles.

On July 2, 1938, we made another non-stop flight, from Sebasto to Akan, covering one thousand seven hundred and seven miles in ten hours and thirty-three minutes.

These records were created in the Aviation Games Committee, creating two all-Soviet women's flight records, straight-line flights and curved flights.

Under the orders of Lenin and the awards of the government, Lomaga and I both received the rank of captain. Skovalev was also promoted to electrical captain.

I will never rest on my laurels. I will continue to work hard, flying to higher altitudes and longer distances. (End)
