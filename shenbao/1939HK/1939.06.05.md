### Moscow or Tokyo?

The Anglo-Soviet negotiations for mutual cooperation are a blessing for democratic and peaceful nations and for human culture, but they are also a disaster for fascist aggressors and for those who instigate and profit from world wars. Therefore, aggressors and war profiteers are using all kinds of conspiracies and insidious schemes to sabotage the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. After the Anglo-French joint proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union with righteous and stern words, there was suddenly news of the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Needless to say, this news is also a manifestation of the insidious schemes of these aggressors and war profiteers. They hope to use this to undermine the Anglo-Soviet negotiations and to undermine the anti-aggression front. In China, they can naturally use it to shake the Chinese people's trust in the two friendly countries of Britain and the Soviet Union, and to shake the Chinese people's confidence in adhering to united and sustained resistance against Japan for final victory.

However, the facts will tell everyone that the signing of the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement is only a matter of time. If the Chamberlain government does not sign it, there will eventually be someone responsible in Britain to sign it! This is one. The facts will also tell everyone that the Anglo-Japanese alliance is ultimately only a terrible memory.

Finally, the facts will also tell everyone that the United States' attitude towards the Far East issue already has extremely important decisive significance, and the friendly relations between the United Kingdom and the United States are also becoming increasingly close and progressive, while the so-called "Anglo-Japanese alliance" is precisely and fundamentally incompatible with the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States! This is three.

Judging from these three points, we can already assert that these news, which originate from the insidious schemes of aggressors and war profiteers, will only be their pathetic fantasies and shameless curses! How can we judge the international situation based on news issued by a few people from fantasy and curses?

In addition, what we should not ignore is that since our country's resistance against Japan began, Britain, like the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, has had its interests completely aligned with our country! Especially the friendship between Britain and our country is progressing almost daily. Recent facts are particularly obvious. If we are unwilling to blind our eyes and ears, or if we are unwilling to be prisoners of the insidious schemes of Japanese × traitors, we will not imagine that the corpse of the Anglo-Japanese alliance will be active today!

### The Tasks of Youth in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction (Part Two)

— Special Telegram from Xi'an

We must fully recognize the importance of social service. Promoting literacy education, expanding production, rescuing wounded soldiers, plowing and harvesting wheat for the families of soldiers fighting against Japan, writing letters for them, investigating × films, investigating Japanese goods, and running cooperatives – all these tasks are directly or indirectly beneficial to the war of resistance and are urgently needed by the masses. The social service of young people often influences public opinion's sympathy towards young people. Because the effects of social service are easy to see. If we are indifferent to society, society will certainly be indifferent to us. If our youth organizations do not actively participate in the war of resistance and social service, it proves that our organizations are not good.

Youth also have a major task in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, which is the task related to youth themselves. In order to truly exert the role of youth in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, youth must pay attention to themselves. They must pay attention to cultivating their work ability, and protecting and promoting their own vital interests.

The best way to cultivate work ability is to learn. We young people are in an era of learning. Our learning is not limited to schools or books. When we participate in the war, we must learn from the war; when we participate in politics, we must learn from politics. Our learning is for work, and our work is also for learning.

We must study military affairs, study politics, study production, and we must study history, because history is the sum total of human past experiences. We must also study life, because our age is still too young, and we have not yet understood the breadth, richness, and subtlety of life.

We must learn morality. We must learn to be loyal to the country and the nation, loyal to the noble ideals and firm stance. We must cultivate a noble personality and integrity that wealth cannot corrupt, poverty cannot move, and power cannot subdue. We must oppose those who have no position or integrity, because they go with the flow, and change allegiance with the times, which is not in line with the moral concepts of the Chinese nation.

Love problems are often a major issue among young people. Bright young men and women should be particularly cautious about love. We are not against love, but love is not unconditional. It should be a combination of thoughts, it should be voluntary for both parties, and it should not hinder work. We see some young people being sacrificed for forced marriages and arranged marriages, and we feel that this is very sad, but we also see other young people who regard love as more important than anything else, and they spend their whole lives in love, and they don't even want their political life. And there are some young people who take love very casually, today they meet you and fall in love with you, tomorrow they meet a second person who seems better than you, and they fall in love with the second person again, and in the end they also spend their whole lives in love. These two kinds of young people are not only sad, but also ×.

We must learn to live a life that is orderly, planned, and disciplined. We must be able to be tense and serious, and be able to endure hardship. This is very important in the prolonged war of resistance. We must oppose × people like opposing smoking, drinking, whoring, gambling, and waste, and oppose the so-called being sloppy and careless.

We must learn how to treat people. We must have a great mind and spirit to work with people all over the world; we must also have a spirit of patiently guiding and teaching people tirelessly, and we must have a humble, kind, frank, and honest attitude to work with people all over the world.

We often only look at people for a moment or only one side, or only act on emotions, which is very dangerous. Two young people in a certain school in Shaanxi were originally close friends, but later one joined the Anti-× Association, and the other looked down on him and broke off relations with him. Isn't this acting on emotion? Our criticism of friends needs to be solemn, but it also needs to be tactful, and it is even more necessary to point out the source of people's weaknesses and mistakes and the methods of remedying and correcting them. Such criticism is helping to educate people, and we must not randomly put hats on people and force them to have nowhere to go. In a school, a female student's husband died, and she cried very sadly. This was originally human nature, but her classmates not only did not comfort and persuade her, but instead accused her of being an individualist and having no revolutionary worldview, as if revolutionaries could not have joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Isn't this kind of "criticism" completely irrelevant?

We must learn how to ×× entertainment activities. Some people look down on sports and recreational activities, saying that they cannot defeat Japanese imperialism. We won't even mention that young people need sports and recreational activities, just from the perspective of resisting Japan and saving the country, their contributions are not small. The children's singing troupe in Taierzhuang once moved a small Han traitor named Huang with salvation songs; our song and drama troupes on the front lines of North China often brought tears to the eyes of × puppet soldiers and prisoners. The need for military sports needs to be promoted, needless to say. ××××× Every village has youth clubs, and the clubs have sports and entertainment equipment, which is very worthy of emulation.

Regarding the protection and promotion of the vital interests of young people, on the one hand, we must rely on the government, and on the other hand, we must rely on our own mutual assistance. Comrades in all our youth organizations must cultivate the spirit of sharing life and death and sharing weal and woe. There was once a very famous labor union leader who was very attentive to this point. When a member's family member died and did not have money to hold a funeral, he initiated a donation of five jiao per person to help. Two hundred people raised one hundred yuan, and this difficulty was overcome. Because he often paid attention to these things, he was very trusted by the workers. The solidarity of the workers also developed very quickly. The more mutual assistance, the more unity, and the more unity, the more mutual assistance. In this way, our own problems can of course be solved a lot.

But many bigger problems, we ultimately cannot but demand political solutions. Although the lives of young people in the war of resistance have not been completely improved, various necessary improvements can and should be carried out. The issue of child care, the issues of bound feet and arranged marriages for young women, the labor conditions of child laborers, female laborers, and young people in general, and the issues of various freedoms and rights of young people all urgently need to be resolved. We have already pointed out that resolving these issues has a great impact on the development of the war of resistance. Also, the current age for participating in politics is stipulated as over thirty years old, so our youth have no possibility of participating in politics. We believe that youth are able to participate in politics and should learn to participate in politics. Therefore, we hope that the age for participating in politics can be lowered to over eighteen years old.

We have generally talked about the general work that young people should do. Finally, we will briefly talk about the special tasks of different youth and different regions.

First, let's talk about different youth:

The special task of working youth should first of all be to work hard in production. In today's world, working hard in production is almost the same as working hard in battle. In the protracted war of resistance, we will definitely encounter serious economic difficulties, so now it is of great significance to expand our industry and agriculture, increase our productivity, open up × land, and promote labor service. But working youth, whether for themselves or for the country, must strive to improve their own lives. In addition, working youth should also strive for leisure time to engage in learning military affairs, politics, and various anti-Japanese salvation organizational activities.

The task of students is to intensify their studies and cultivate themselves to become cadres for the war of resistance. There are now various military schools and political schools, which are good opportunities for us. Some schools have not yet implemented wartime education, and we should strive to get them to increase various wartime necessary subjects, but we still have to study general subjects, and studying them is still beneficial. Student associations can lead some research work, propaganda work, and mass education work outside of class, and also pay appropriate attention to the vital issues of studying.

In the war zone, young women can participate in the self-defense forces, participate in × traitor, arson, nursing, and comforting work; in the rear, they can try their best to go to work, which can appropriately exert their strength and send a large number of men to the front lines. In addition, women must also strive to organize and promote women's education, improve women's lives, and strive for various freedoms for women.

Children have a great role in the war of resistance. They can be sentries, couriers, organize drama troupes and singing troupes, and also do some simple labor; but no matter what work they are asked to do, they should always pay attention to their learning.

The youth of ethnic minorities and the youth of various religions all have special status in the war of resistance. × people are doing everything possible to provoke and alienate the unity of our various ethnic groups, and are spreading rumors in the name of various religions, so the work of our ethnic minority youth and religious youth needs to be aimed at these conspiracies of × people. Under the general policy of consolidating the great unity of domestic anti-Japanese forces, patiently unite the masses of their own ethnic group and religion, and rise up together with the people of the whole of China to carry out the war of resistance. Overseas Chinese youth, in addition to carrying out united front work among the overseas Chinese and providing practical assistance to the motherland's war of resistance, must especially take on more responsibility for international public relations.

Let's talk about different regions:

We can roughly divide China into three major regions, namely our rear, the war zone, and the × rear. In our rear, the main responsibility of young people is to assist the government in implementing various new policies that are beneficial to the war of resistance, to cooperate with the needs of the front and carry out various mobilization work, mass education, self-education work, production work, and fundraising and comforting work. Open many short-term training classes to cultivate a large number of anti-war cadres. In the war zone, the main task is to mobilize the masses to assist the army in combat and prepare for guerrilla warfare. There are two different situations in the × rear. One is the × people's base area. For example, various large cities occupied by × people. In these places, our task is to carefully and secretly accumulate and prepare strength to cooperate with guerrilla warfare in the countryside. The organization should not be large, but it must unite all levels and have a broad social foundation. And try to participate in various organizations permitted by × people in order to obtain cover. One is our base area, such as the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. Here, our task is to strive to expand it and consolidate it, to organize a large number of young people, arm young people, establish a democratic anti-Japanese regime, and vigorously develop guerrilla warfare.

Different regions need different working guidelines and working methods. We must study the specific situation of each region and flexibly decide on our work. At the same time, we must be able to recognize the focus of work. What region is the focus of our work today? We can answer: In the war zone × rear. Why? Because today the war zone and the × rear have the widest area and the largest population. The work is the most important. The war zone and the rear are our front line of the war of resistance, and the position of our young people should be in front of others, on the most difficult and most front line.

Brief Commentary

### England, America, France, and the Far East

Due to the rampant aggression of Japanese forces in the Far East, the infringement and exclusion of the rights and interests of England, America, and France in the Far East is an undeniable fact. Moreover, this kind of fact is becoming more serious day by day. Now that the situation in the Shanghai Concession is still tense, the news that the "Kulangsu Negotiations" have broken down was announced again yesterday.

Due to the stimulus of the greatly increased credibility of the Soviet Union's peace policy throughout the world, and due to the increasing contradictions between England, America, and France and Japan, which have made the contradictions between England and America decrease day by day, the conditions for a united front of England, America, and France to deal with Japan are becoming more and more complete. Today, the newspapers report that the talks between England, America, and France on the issue of resisting Japanese provocations have reached a satisfactory conclusion and that economic sanctions will be implemented. We believe that this is the only way for England, America, and France to save themselves and the world and that it will definitely be realized. What we hope is that there will be genuine cooperation and rapid and universal implementation. The main thing is to implement it in close coordination with the anti-aggression movement and our country's war of resistance. Otherwise, ××××××××××!

### World Student Federation Proposal Issues

The World Student Federation Congress is scheduled to be held in France in August of this year. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association is now soliciting proposals from Hong Kong students. Students and teachers in Hong Kong should not ignore this issue!

China, which has been bravely resisting aggression for nearly two years, has unprecedentedly raised its international status and reputation. Chinese students, whether at home or abroad, have also unprecedentedly increased their social and political status due to their heroic participation in this great national founding movement. Chinese students not only have the status to speak to the world, but have also acquired the status to call for unity and leadership. Therefore, we hope that every Chinese student will not belittle himself, let go of the opportunity to work for himself and for the nation and the world, and we hope that every Chinese teacher will assist and guide his students, pay attention to them together, and dedicate our efforts to defend the youth student movement, to defend national liberation, to defend democratic politics and world peace.

### Solidified Northwest National Defence

— Special Correspondent from Our Newspaper at the Front, Geng Ya

After patrolling within Tongguan City, I immediately followed the armed guide sent by a certain unit and walked upstream to a certain place to inspect a section of river defense works that I had never seen before. To summarize the valuable impressions gained from this trip and to quickly tell our readers, it is just one sentence: "The northwest national defense is extremely solid."

The conclusion that the northwest national defense is extremely solid is based on three objective and realistic conditions:

First, the solidity of the fortifications built along the river. The construction method of the defense works along the river is the most advanced and effective type of fortification construction. Its strength is not afraid of bombing by airplanes, nor is it afraid of attacks by artillery. Moreover, because it completely lacks "dead angles," its firepower can suppress and annihilate the enemy who is attacking and approaching. According to Mr. Zeng Jiyuan, deputy chief of staff of a certain group army who had inspected the river defense line from a distance, "Regarding this type of construction, military experts from England, France, and the Soviet Union have recently visited and praised it highly, saying that even the strong construction used during the European War was no more than this." At the same time, we are also fully equipped with the latest weapons, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mechanized units, and the like along the river defense line; especially the new artillery purchased from a certain country, its performance is particularly superior to that of the puppet artillery.

Second, the natural uniqueness of the river and riverbank. Because the Yellow River contains a large amount of mud and sand and has dangerous cliffs and precipices on both banks, it forms various characteristics that are different from other rivers. However, due to the large amount of mud and sand, it affects the uncertain changes in the navigation route; it is suddenly in the east today, and it rests in the west tomorrow; even the local people who are familiar with the nature of the Yellow River are often unable to figure it out. Moreover, along the river for hundreds of miles, there are only a few ferries. The difficulty of crossing at ordinary times, south of a certain place, takes at least two hours each time, and often five or six hours or more. For example, Tongguan Fenglingdu is a relatively ordinary ferry, but when the water rises, the river surface actually reaches two thousand seven hundred meters, the average depth is only about six meters, and the current is so turbulent that it can reach five meters per second. If there is a strong wind to help, it will be even more turbulent and easy to happen boat capsizing; therefore, there is still a saying in the local area: "It is not difficult to travel all over the world, but only the crossing of Fengling is difficult." As for the ferries north of ××, although there are ferries that take no more than two or thirty minutes, the water is particularly rapid, and both banks are full of high mountains and ridges, which are of course even more inconvenient for the puppet troops' activities. The natural characteristics of the Yellow River are such that it makes the puppet troops' sneaking crossing techniques extremely difficult: heavy weapons are obviously unable to cross the river, and light weapons can be crossed by rubber rafts at the risk of hundreds of deaths, but they will inevitably be annihilated by our long-deployed army and sharp weapons.

Third, the favorable progress of the outer perimeter war to defend the Northwest. The counter-offensive in the Zhongtiao Mountain area in southeastern Shanxi and the active guerrilla warfare in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, which protect the northwest's outer perimeter war, are major concerns for the puppet troops to cross the river and invade the northwest. The puppet troops certainly see this clearly: if they want to attempt to invade the northwest, they must, as they say, "first eliminate Shanxi." Otherwise, even if they can give up the dream of crossing the river, they would dare to send troops from Suiyuan to attack Xiasha and peep at Lanzhou, forming a large encirclement of the northwest center; however, after all, because Shanxi is still in our hands, we still have to transport troops north from Shanxi, causing them to feel isolated and threatened by the interception of their retreat from time to time. Therefore, before the puppet troops have a solution in Shanxi, they dare not rashly launch a large-scale invasion of the northwest for the time being. Naturally, their current attempt is to "eliminate Shanxi," and we will naturally target this attempt and try our best to attack it.

Based on the above three realistic conditions, it is said that "the northwest national defense is extremely solid." From a further step, in case the puppet troops suddenly have a kind of great strength, and can launch a combined land and air attack on a certain point of our river defense line, if it does not pay a price of at least more than three months of strength consumption, it must also stop thinking about taking advantage (sent from Tongguan)

### Wang Kemin Pulls Strings in the Middle - Wang and the Puppet Troops Collude

### The Insane Desire to Organize a Puppet Central Government Has Not Died

### Wu Peifu Refuses to Cooperate with Wang Puppet ×××

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] News from Tianjin: The puppet organization here has proved that Wang Jingwei is indeed colluding with the puppet side. In addition to Wang's volunteering to serve as the chairman of the so-called World Peace and Cessation of War Association, it is also heard that Wang plans to organize a puppet central government in Nanjing. The name of this puppet organization has not yet been determined, but the puppet New Government is afraid of being cancelled. The intention of Zizhi, etc., is still under negotiation. As for the puppet provisional government in Beijing, it will be changed to a local regime. All its diplomatic, financial, and other affairs must be subject to the command of the future puppet central government in Nanjing. Representatives from both places are currently in contact with the puppet side, and Wang Kemin is also preparing to go to Shanghai within ten days to meet with Wang. It is reported that Wang Kemin is the one who is pulling strings in the middle of this collusion between Wang and the puppet side. Wang had previously told the puppet side that if he could preserve his position, he could pull Wang into cooperation, but the puppet side does not seem to value Wang very much, and Wang cannot help but feel neglected. As for inciting Wu Peifu to come out of the mountains, in the past it was the intention of a small number of people such as the puppet Toyohara, and Zhang Xiongqing, Jiang Wuchen and others have been active in the middle. Although there was a lot of hype for a while, Wu's attitude was as firm as before and has not changed slightly, so this matter has become a thing of the past again.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Wang Jingwei sent a certain representative to Ping to meet with Kita, Wang Kemin, and others to discuss cooperation issues, and planned to set up a "Peace and Cessation of War Association" branch in Tianjin. The peace declaration was drafted by Wang and will be published after obtaining the puppet side's consent, it is said.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 4th] Mainland newspapers report that, according to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei is currently in Shanghai. The newspaper said, "Although his whereabouts are extremely secret, there is no doubt that Wang is in Shanghai." It also said: "Wang returned from Japan on June 2 and will soon go to Japan again." It also mentioned that Wang's residence in the concession is heavily guarded, with a large number of plainclothes and uniformed police stationed to prevent any terrorist attacks. Although the mainland newspapers claim that Wang is not currently living in the residence, it is believed that he must be living south of the Suzhou River.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 4th] General Wu Peifu yesterday sent a reply to the East Asia Anti-Communist Association, in response to Wang Jingwei's invitation to serve as the leader of the peace movement, saying: If the central government and the people of the country are willing to make peace, he will certainly obey the order and participate, but it must be attached to a condition, that is, peace cannot be dominated by the current military situation. In other words, China's sovereignty must be intact before it can be said.

### 100th Anniversary of the June 3rd Anti-Opium Edict - Chairman Chiang's Address to the Nation (Continued from Yesterday)

First, I hope that the farmers in various places who have already planted opium poppies will sincerely repent and never plant them again. You cannot think that you are in a poor area and can get away with it, and you must not rely on your strength to resist. You must know that the government has made up its mind to the greatest extent that from this year onwards, no matter where it is, there will be no tolerance for even one sprout, one leaf, or one flower to be discovered. Otherwise, once it is found out, no matter who planted it or shielded it, they will all be shot according to the law, without any leniency. And we are preparing to specially allocate troops to investigate and destroy opium poppy planting, and to carry out this task with all our strength. The more those who dare to deliberately resist, the more severely they will be punished. I cannot bear to punish them without teaching them, so I am specially asking you to pay close attention in advance. On the 9th of last month, I also telegraphed the military and political authorities of various provinces to prepare everything early for those who have ever planted opium poppies, and they must wake up as soon as possible. In fact, during the current period of resisting aggression and building the country, Southwest construction is being accelerated, and there are many agricultural products with high production value that can be sold to the international market at great profit. Farmers can follow the instructions of the construction departments of each province to find ways to change to other crops for good plans, and there is no need to test the law with their own bodies.

Second, I hope that the people who are addicted to opium should have the awareness of yesterday's death and today's life, and hurry up and quit. You must know that next year will be the expiration date, and after the expiration, the government will not allow opium to be bought and spent at all. At that time, even if you want to smoke secretly, because the government has also banned planting at the same time, there is no source at all, and there is no way to obtain it. Do not misunderstand that some places are still collecting special taxes, thinking that the government may be worried about tax revenue and may not actually implement the ban when the deadline arrives. In fact, when the opium suppression policy was originally formulated, some special taxes were collected, which was originally a ban in taxation, and this method was used to implement unified management of planting and smoking. This is to clearly understand the actual number of opium addicts, so as to gradually reduce them, until they are completely eliminated: this is to incidentally collect some funds to hold opium cessation facilities and help opium addicts get out of the sea of ​​suffering. It is a kind of benevolent heart and benevolent government, not to open up a source of wealth. This policy originally achieved great results nationwide before the war of resistance. The number of opium addicts in each province has been reduced to more than half. Although these two years have been affected by the war of resistance, some occupied areas have been disturbed by the puppet troops and implemented drug use, and the promotion of the ban is inevitably affected to some extent; but our opium suppression policy does not change. As I have already said, after the expiration next year, special taxes will of course no longer be collected. This tax revenue has nothing to do with national finances, and the government will certainly not cherish it slightly. If you smokers do not take advantage of this remaining period of time to step up quitting, you will become criminals at that time. You must follow the punishments of the law, and after the expiration, the current law on the punishment of drug criminals will inevitably be revised to be more serious. You must be especially vigilant in advance to avoid future troubles.

Third, I hope that our compatriots in the occupied areas will thoroughly recognize and resolutely abandon the puppet troops' drug use plan, because the puppet troops in those places arbitrarily humiliate, whip, strip, and slaughter you men, women, old and young. I myself and our compatriots in the rear are extremely grieved and deeply resentful of the suffering you have endured. In fact, the puppet troops know that this kind of devastation cannot eliminate the spirit of resistance of you compatriots. On the contrary, the hatred of all enemies will inevitably become more intense, so they resort to both soft and hard tactics, and use drug use policies to produce various addictive drugs to sell, in an attempt to get you compatriots to embark on the road to suicide. As long as a few years, all the poisoned people will become dry bones in the tomb and will definitely not resist. At that time, they can rest easy and be at leisure to slaughter. At the same time, since the puppet troops have been at war, their internal economy has been exhausted. Looking at the exhaustion of water and mountains, they will not be able to support themselves, so they want to plunder from our compatriots in the occupied areas. But they also know that our compatriots are not willing to contribute, so they use the opium and processed coffee, gold pills, red and white pills, and other potent drugs seized in the four northeastern provinces and Ningxia and Suiyuan provinces to absorb our people's legal currency in order to seize foreign exchange and buy arms, and to supplement her collapsing economy with the wealth of our compatriots. You see how vicious this poisonous plan with two layers of evil intentions is?

All of you compatriots—should understand this ghost business that wants both your life and your money, and resolutely make up your mind not to smoke or buy. Compatriots, encourage and supervise each other, and mutually prohibit it. If someone buys or eats it, even if he is a traitor who indirectly helps the puppet troops, and at any time and place, resolutely and without doubt kill the people who traffic in drugs, treating them like puppet soldiers. As long as we fight in this way and fundamentally smash the puppet troops' drug policy, we have made a great contribution to the war of resistance, and we will certainly be of great help to recovering lost ground and eliminating the puppet troops.

All sectors of the country have probably understood the common sense and responsibilities that should be had for banning opium. Now, to summarize it in one sentence, it is: Opium suppression has now reached the final and most urgent stage. We must fight against aggression and suppress opium at the same time. From this year onwards, we must actively add the power of the party, government, and military. Whether it is the front or the rear, compatriots in any place must work together with one heart and make concerted efforts to eliminate opium. Our Chinese nation's ancestors have a glorious history and a great legacy. Now, we must have the Three People's Principles of revolutionary nation-building. Anyone with a little conscience should have a thorough understanding and not allow opium to continue to spread and cause disaster among our nation. In any case, we must thoroughly eliminate it within this one or two-year deadline. Then, our great cause of revolutionary revival can certainly be completed quickly, and we will not fail the significance of today's warm commemoration. (The End)

### Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement - The Soviet Union Has Not Proposed a Counter-Proposal

### Requests Revisions to Anglo-French Suggestions - England and France Will Exchange Views Immediately

[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between England, France, and the Soviet Union, those in charge here recently stated that the Soviet government's reply did not include a counter-proposal, but only made requests to amend the original suggestions of England and France that were not satisfactory. In other words, the proposal for England, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance agreement has been accepted by the Soviet Union in principle, but it is argued that the countries guaranteed by England and France should include the Soviet Union's neighboring countries along the Baltic Sea, and the implementation of this guarantee should also be done mechanically. Regarding this matter, the governments of England and France will exchange views in early next week.

[Reuters, London, 4th] "The Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent stated today that the summary of the Soviet Union's document has been sent to London. The content is good and the attitude is good. It expresses acceptance of the establishment of a tripartite agreement with the suggestions of England and France. However, the correspondent pointed out that the Soviet Union's new method of guaranteeing the Baltic countries is to require that when the independence of any of these countries is directly or indirectly threatened, the three powers will allow assistance. The UK's guarantees to Poland are fully applicable to these countries, but the names of the countries are not explicitly listed, as the Soviet Union believes that Germany's aggression against the Baltic countries is an indirect threat to the Soviet Union. On this point, the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate closely with its allies. Regarding what constitutes an indirect threat to the Soviet Union, the views of the UK and the Soviet Union may be slightly different. The Soviet Union may believe that in addition to directly invading its neighbors, Germany's use of political pressure to divide its neighbors and attempt to dominate them is also an indirect threat to the Soviet Union. All the principles of the Anglo-French proposals have been accepted by the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Union Urges Romania to Clearly Express Its Attitude

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] A report from Paris states that the Soviet Union has proposed to Romania that the Soviet Union is willing to abandon all its claims against Romania regarding the recovery of the province of Bessarabia, but Romania needs to provide satisfactory assurances on the following two points: (1) Romania's attitude towards a European war in which both the Soviet Union and Germany participate, (2) Whether Romania is willing to form a Black Sea Convention with the Soviet Union and Turkey. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will visit the Turkish capital, and it is believed to be related to the latter.

[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 3rd] The Swedish government repealed the law on defending the neutrality of the Åland Islands on the 3rd. According to Finland's recent proposal to defend the Åland Islands, it was rejected by the Soviet Union. The Swedish government also repealed the naval treaty between England, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden established in London last December. This move was expected long ago, because since Hitler announced the abolition of the Anglo-German naval agreement, the naval agreement between England and the Northern European countries has become a waste of paper.

### Hopes of Saving the British Submarine Lost

### England United in Mourning

[Reuters, London, 3rd] After the hope of saving the "Thetis" was lost, the whole country mourned. A British Broadcasting Corporation reporter issued an official statement, stating that there was no hope of rescue, and asked the audience to be silent to express their condolences. He said, "These sailors and people have sacrificed themselves to fulfill their duties. We express our utmost sympathy and respect to them. We can feel the same way as the audience."

### Rescue Work Turned to the Submarine Itself

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Lloyd's Liverpool manager sent a radio message from the rescue ship "Lanna" at 7:35 tonight, stating, "The hope of rescuing the personnel inside the sunken submarine "Thetis" has been cut off. Now all rescue work is being added to the submarine itself. If the weather remains as good as it has been in the past few days, there is a good chance of success. It is known that a cable has been hit under the submarine, but the submarine will not be able to float to the surface before Tuesday."

### Eyewitnesses Talk About the Most Dangerous Story

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A sailor who witnessed the crew members of the "Thetis" escape today recounted the most dangerous story. He said that Lieutenant Olen risked floating to the surface to see the sunken location of the boat and whether there were rescue ships gathered nearby. When Olen floated to the surface, the "Larson" rescue ship was preparing to detonate explosive bombs into the water to notify the personnel inside the boat. This kind of explosive bomb was eventually detonated, and three more crew members came out of the water, but for some reason, no one was seen floating to the surface afterwards. The escape door seemed to have been damaged.

### Public Opinion Attaches Importance to the Question of Responsibility for the Accident

[Reuters, London, 4th] "The Observer" said, "The tragedy of the "Thetis" is the most serious submarine accident in peacetime. A thorough investigation of the cause of the accident is what the world hopes for. The "diving bell" instrument, which had been used in the past when the US submarine "Squalus" encountered trouble and more than half of the personnel in the boat escaped by using, may not be possible to use in the environment where the "Thetis" is located. However, it is necessary to find ways to research the method of saving the victims in the future, because these people do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves in order to safeguard the safety of the country and the nation. If there is no corresponding guarantee, it is really regrettable." "The Weekly Express" said, "In addition to the horror of the tragedy, this incident has aroused another kind of emotion among the public, that is, to resolutely understand why the rescuers and the victims are only separated by a thin layer of steel, but the victims cannot be rescued. The Admiralty may be able to give the public a satisfactory answer to this kind of question. I hope the Admiralty will elucidate it on ×day." "Reynolds Weekly" said, "How exactly did the accident happen and could it have been avoided at the time? This is what the whole country wants to know. We hope the authorities will publish the details as soon as possible, because this is the responsibility to the reputation of the dead and the condemnation of the survivors' conscience."

They gathered at labor employment agencies across the country, according to the alphabetical order of their surnames, to determine their arrival time. They included young people from all walks of life, including students, clerks, and workers, wearing a variety of clothes. Labor Minister Brown, after inspecting several employment agencies today, declared that the results of this national call-up were completely satisfactory, and the number of people registered now is in line with expectations.

If these principles are destroyed, no country can exist safely. Our country is willing to continue to fight for these principles.

### The Times of London Discusses the Economic Situation of Japan, Gold Reserves Dwindling Daily, Export Trade Increasingly Shrinking

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The Times of London correspondent in Tokyo recently published a commentary on Japan's economic situation, saying that the talk of economic collapse is talked about differently, but none of them are to the point. Now we assume that Japan's prices can be controlled perfectly. How the currency war it is conducting in China will end is still difficult to judge. However, it is undeniable that Japan's export trade is shrinking daily and cash reserves are dwindling daily. Japan may be able to support itself for a year or even two or three years. After all, trust is more important than cash reserves. If trust has not disappeared, it can support itself for several months. However, in terms of the economic situation and the people's livelihood, industry and commerce are becoming more and more difficult, and they will be subjected to new restrictions every week. The impact of the war on China will eventually force Japan to gradually use the control measures promoted throughout the country. Even if it wins militarily in the future, it will inevitably fall into a state of poverty and exhaustion economically, and it will be almost impossible to regenerate itself. Based on this, Japan should seek a peace that does not bankrupt itself at a certain time, rather than seeking an exhausted victory. The war between China and Japan has now progressed to a stage where economic power is more important than military power. In terms of military power, Japan has the advantage of aggression and is easier to do. In terms of economy, it is a weakness. Now it has to work hard to do it, and its difficulties are known. Regarding this, Japan may be able to prove that its strength is stronger than that of China, but the situation of being stretched is difficult to conceal. Although this matter is not serious, its momentum is increasing. As far as the currency war is concerned, Chinese legal currency can be used to purchase foreign exchange, but the Japanese yen cannot. This is where the advantage of legal currency lies. If the Japanese yen wants to knock someone down, it must freely purchase foreign exchange. Unfortunately, cash reserves are dwindling daily and export trade is shrinking daily, and it will eventually be useless.

### Roosevelt and Hull Advocate Immediately Revising the Neutrality Act, Pittman Discusses the U.S.-China Neutrality Act Issue, Points Out That the Prohibition of Arms Is Unfair

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Regarding the revision of the Neutrality Act, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in the Congressional lounge that the current Neutrality Act's clause prohibiting the shipment of heavy weapons to belligerent countries favors the aggressor countries and is unfair to the aggressed countries. For example, the countries in the Balkans have been unable to obtain sufficient military equipment to organize national defense since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and confiscated the Skoda armaments factory. The New York Times here also published a telegram from a Washington correspondent, stating that one of the reasons why President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull advocated immediately revising the current Neutrality Act is that the German government confiscated the Skoda armaments factory, thereby breaking the balance of power in European armaments and monopolizing the advantage.

### U.S. Navy Department Orders a Large Number of Warships, Warship Construction Plan Is Proceeding Smoothly, Part of It Completed Five Months Early

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. Navy Department has signed contracts to build 24 warships, including two 45,000-ton battleships and one 20,000-ton aircraft carrier, at a cost of approximately $350 million.

### Germany and Italy Are Maneuvering to Threaten Yugoslavia, Germany Shows Off Force to Prince Paul, Italy Is Rushing to Build Airports on the Border of Yugoslavia

[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to The Times correspondent in Yugoslavia, a large detachment of Italian military tanks recently advanced to Albania and is preparing to build an airfield near the border of Yugoslavia. This matter has aroused great concern in Yugoslavia. There are at least 60,000 Italian troops stationed in the country, but anti-Italian incidents in Albania continue to occur. Officials in the Yugoslav capital believe that Italy's move is to exert pressure on Yugoslavia, forcing it to join the Axis countries, but as a result, Yugoslavia will inevitably strengthen its border air strength, and at the same time, the Greek border defense forces will also be greatly increased. In Berlin, a large-scale military parade was held today, inviting Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, to participate. This is also a means of showing off force to Yugoslavia and forcing it to join the military alliance.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th] On Sunday, Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, accompanied by German Air Minister Goering, went to the Dubarez district of Berlin to visit the German Air Force camp, and then went to Gato to inspect the air defense school and the Air Force Academy. After the visit, Prince Paul and his wife and General Goering and his wife had lunch together in the Air Force officers' dormitory. In the evening, General Goering will host a banquet in Zelotenburg to entertain them.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th] Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, accompanied by the master of the court, Kolga, attended a banquet held by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on Saturday night. The German leader was also present.

### German Leader Inspects Retired Soldiers

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th] The German leader flew from here by plane to Kasel on Sunday morning to attend the 1939 German Veterans Congress. After Hitler arrived at 10:00, he transferred to a car to inspect 215,000 veterans in Kasweier.

### Philippines Sympathizes with China, Promulgates Refugee Entry Law, Consul-General in Philippines Notifies Related Organizations Here, U.S. Consulate Refuses to Sign Passports Issued by Puppet Organizations

[Local News] The Philippine government is sympathetic to the refugees fleeing from our war zone and grants them entry facilities. At present, ships sailing from Hong Kong or from various ports in our country such as Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou can carry 100 refugees per ship. Our Consulate-General in Manila has specially announced the procedures for refugees to go to the Philippines. Relevant organizations in Hong Kong have received this announcement. Regarding the procedures for non-refugees entering the Philippines, it is stipulated that they must hold passports issued by the authorities of each country. Recently, some people holding passports from the puppet Manchukuo or the puppet Shanghai Great Way Municipal Government have requested to enter the Philippines, but they have been refused landing by the Philippine authorities on the grounds that the U.S. and Philippine governments do not recognize the puppet Manchukuo organization. U.S. consuls stationed in various parts of our country and the U.S. consul in Hong Kong have also refused to sign passports issued by the puppet organization.

He also asked the reporter, "How many years did it take for your country's guerrillas to train? And there are at least hundreds of thousands of guerrillas throughout the country. Did this large number start training before the war of resistance?" The reporter smiled and did not answer.

(6) Doi Mitsuo, 23 years old, from Kobe, graduated from commercial school, a rice merchant, private first class (reservist). He was captured on May 1st of this year in Caocun (near Yixing) while on guard duty, when guerrillas launched three fierce night attacks. Doi is quite tall, and his face was full of smiles when he spoke, with no trace of pessimism. The reporter asked why he was so happy. Doi smiled and said that he received a letter from home the day before he was captured, saying that the whole family had moved to a remote countryside, his elder brother was serving as an important official in the military control area, and his parents were receiving government pensions. He expected that the whole family would be spared from military service and all kinds of war pain in the future. Although he himself was captured, it was a piece of luck in misfortune. It would have inevitably led to war if he had not been captured, and it would be better to survive in China than to die miserably and meaninglessly on the battlefield. The reporter then told him about the recent disastrous defeat of the Japanese army in northern Hubei and the depreciation of the Japanese yen. Doi sang sadly, but suddenly continued to smile.

(7) Kiri Kazumi, 24 years old, from Tokyo, graduated from elementary school, a department store clerk, private first class (reservist). After landing in Shanghai on August 28th last year, he was stationed at Songkou, then opened to Datong Bridge and Fengjing Bridge to build roads. On May 6th, led by Squad Leader Sazo, he went to Caojiadun to build roads, and was suddenly captured by the Chinese army at Datong Bridge. The reporter asked about his feelings about fighting in China. Qingdao replied that his feelings were very simple, that is, when the Japanese army arrived in any village or town, the intellectuals had already escaped, and the general villagers would not cooperate at all. Although they tried their best to perfunctorily deal with us on the surface, they were actually the most powerful soldiers. The Japanese army has recently felt very painful about this, because there is always the danger of being annihilated. The reporter asked if the Japanese army continued like this, wouldn't it become increasingly dangerous? He nodded repeatedly and said yes, and also said that defeating China is really the most difficult task.

(8) Nakajima Yoshio, 25 years old, from Tokyo, graduated from middle school, a salesman, private first class (reservist). He was captured on April 23rd of this year in Xintai Town, Pinghu County. Nakajima's father died early and his family was in decline. He told the reporter that he had been thinking of his family day and night recently and had difficulty eating. He also firmly judged that such a vast land of China would never be conquered by the Japanese army, but the Japanese army was stubbornly attacking, so the war seemed endless, and when would the dawn of peace be seen, which was worrying.

(9) Nishiyama Iwao, 26 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, graduated from elementary school, a steel factory clerk, private first class (reservist). He was captured on a bridge on May 6th. He landed in Shanghai in September of the 26th year, and immediately participated in the Battle of Dachan. Next, he fought in Nanjing, Bengbu, and Xuzhou. At the end of the battle, he returned to Nanjing. On May 6th, he saw a woman shelling clams on a bridge, but she was actually a plainclothes soldier who struck him from behind with a stick and captured him. The reporters paid close attention to the conversation with Nishiyama Iwao. Nishiyama Iwao was very strong, but his face was pale and he was listless. After the reporters repeatedly urged him, he briefly described his feelings about fighting in China. Nishiyama Iwao said that almost two years of war had been completely beyond his expectations. We asked why. He continued that the Japanese army had won all the major battles in Shanghai, Nanjing, Bengbu, and Xuzhou. At that time, he expected that China would definitely surrender. Especially after the Xuzhou meeting, all his comrades in the army thought that they were about to cease fire and return home. They secretly drank alcohol to celebrate and wrote letters home, competing to announce the good news. He did not expect that China had the strength to continue the war of resistance and would constantly attack them. At this point, it could not help but disappoint people greatly. Since the above battles could not conquer China, then future events would not be able to be realized as planned, and he was afraid that the Japanese army would be mired in the abyss, unable to advance or retreat, and would inevitably be besieged by the Chinese army. He and others were disappointed in life, so in the Hangzhou area, they tried to create a harmonious and close environment with the local people, as close as a family. At first, the general people were still kind and amiable. Then he discovered that as long as the war did not stop for a day, the two nations would never be able to coordinate. Therefore, many comrades were captured by the people. He was one of them. Life has reached this point, and it is indeed boring, and it is really better to die. The reporters finally asked if the Chinese villagers' actions were justified. Nishiyama Iwao replied sadly that he was not blaming the Chinese villagers for their insincerity. This remark was caused by the Japanese army's invasion and was indeed an invincible vanguard to protect the Chinese nation. Four-fifths of the Japanese army's future collapse will be defeated by the Chinese villagers.

(10) Kishino Kanmitsu, 44 years old, from Tokyo, graduated from business school, a stationery shop clerk, private first class (reservist). He was captured in Xintai Town on April 14th of this year. Kishino looked like a scholar, his manners were elegant. He briefly said that he did not want to go to China to fight. However, after arriving in China, he was responsible for guarding the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway and had not participated in a formal war. Now he was captured as soon as he encountered the Chinese army, and he had already realized that everything in life should be left to nature. Life and death are predetermined, so what about saving the country?

(11) Ohto Jiro, 23 years old, from Nara Prefecture, graduated from elementary school, private first class (reservist). He was captured in Yangjiashan on May 6th. After Ohto Jiro was repeatedly questioned by reporters, he briefly said that it was a disgrace for a soldier to be captured in his first battle after coming to China. But thinking carefully about our country's unjust use of force, even if he was captured, it was not a misfortune. What was unfortunate was that his elderly mother and younger brother would be oppressed by the government. Every time he thought of this, he felt so painful that he wanted to die.

(12) Ito Shinnosuke, 36 years old, from Kanagawa Prefecture, a Yokohama lumber mill clerk, was a machine gunner. He was captured on April 9th while crossing the river at Wuyangdu, Jinxian, Jiangxi.

(13) Kita Yoshio, 31 years old, from Kobe, graduated from the Faculty of Arts of Kansai University, a clerk in a large trading company, private first class (reservist). He was captured in a forest opposite Anqing on February 21st of this year. The reporter asked why he was captured in the forest. Kita Yoshio smiled and said that mentioning the experience was very funny. At first, he had the whimsical idea of ​​finding a thatched cottage in the mountains to hide from the war, surviving by reading books, and waiting for the end of the war before trying to return home to teach his mother filial piety. He did not expect that the forest was full of Chinese troops and he was captured. Although he explained his original intention, it was difficult for them to believe him as a Japanese soldier. Now that he has been captured, strictly speaking, there is nothing to say. (The End)

### Many Robbers in Hong Kong Hide in Border Areas; Chinese and British Military Police to Coordinate in Apprehending Thieves; Hong Kong Police Authorities Deploy a Tight Police Network to Maintain Order; Gold Shops and Silver Houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon Discuss Theft Prevention Measures

Recently, in various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, robbery and theft cases have occurred frequently. Although the police have been diligently apprehending criminals, and many thieves have been arrested, the momentum of robberies has not diminished. Recently, in the case of Wing Cheung Gold Shop in Mong Kok, thieves dared to gather in broad daylight, armed, to rob the store, and even opened fire on police officers on the main street to resist arrest, injuring and killing police officers and civilians. The rampant audacity has reached this point, and local security is severely threatened. The police authorities have investigated and learned that these thieves mostly hide in the border areas between China and Britain, or use the Chinese territories as dens, and sneak into the Kowloon and Hong Kong areas to carry out their activities. Therefore, the police authorities are now paying special attention to the border areas between China and Britain. Detectives from police stations in various districts of the New Territories have recently received orders to strictly apprehend the criminals hiding in the border areas, to eliminate the bandits, to maintain security in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and to protect the lives and property of residents.

Central Border Region: A Den of Bandits

According to a statement made by Chief Detective Inspector McPherson of the Hong Kong Police Detective Department to reporters yesterday, the increase in robberies in the New Territories and various parts of Hong Kong and Kowloon is closely related to the war in South China. Since the outbreak of war in the Chinese territories, many people driven by hardship have turned to crime, becoming bandits who infiltrate Hong Kong to carry out robberies. Currently, many of the robberies occurring frequently in various parts of the New Territories are believed to be committed by these bandits. After robbing in various districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, or the New Territories, they immediately flee back to the border area to hide. If the police investigation is too strict, they flee back to the Chinese territories, and after a considerable period, they re-enter Hong Kong to carry out activities. These people are a menace to Hong Kong residents and disrupt security. The police are now intensifying their investigation and trying to thoroughly eliminate the bandit dens in the New Territories. Regarding this matter, they are currently working closely with the military and police authorities in the Chinese territories to take effective steps to jointly prevent bandit activity and maintain security in the border area.

Deploying a Police Network to Maintain Order

As for the recent increase in robberies in various places in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the police have also paid close attention. In addition to ordering detectives to step up the investigation of robberies that have already occurred, they have also actively sought ways to prevent future incidents. A tight network of detectives has now been deployed, distributed throughout various districts, to ensure that thieves have no way to operate. Currently, the Hong Kong police have considerable contact with the police in Macau, Guangzhou Bay, Shantou, and other ports near Hong Kong. It is believed that the robberies in Hong Kong and Kowloon will not be as rampant as before. As for the residents themselves, the police hope to obtain their assistance. They should be cautious and vigilant at all times, and avoid showing thieves obvious targets. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, many residents who came to Hong Kong to seek refuge, and who possessed assets, did not pay attention to precautions, and were targeted by thieves. This also led to an increase in robberies. Therefore, it is hoped that residents in Hong Kong will be cautious and vigilant in the future, and that large amounts of cash or jewelry should be stored in safe places. This method will greatly assist the police in maintaining security.

Gold Shops and Silver Houses Seek Ways to Prevent Theft

Also, after the robbery of Tin Cheung Gold Shop in Mong Kok, gold shop owners in Hong Kong and Kowloon, given the rampant theft, have jointly discussed prevention measures. According to the person in charge of the Jewelers' Association yesterday, in previous years, thieves were rampant in Hong Kong and China. Since the Tianfu Trading Company robbery, the association felt that without close communication among businesses, it would be impossible to prevent thieves from coveting. At that time, a meeting was held to discuss this issue. As a result, it was decided to submit a request to the police commissioner to派police officers to provide protection, and for each business to install聯防警鐘 and hire guards. However, the police authorities stated that the number of police officers was limited, and the number of jewelry stores was not small. If each store were to be protected by additional police officers, it would be necessary to增設police officers, which was not possible. Therefore, it could only be the case that the police commissioner ordered police officers to pay attention to the safety of jewelry stores. The警鐘 measure has been quite effective, and some businesses have narrowly escaped robbery thanks to it. As for hiring Indian police officers, each officer requires an expenditure of more than thirty yuan per month, and businesses with較爲 薄 profit margins are unwilling to bear this expense. As a result,有各自僱用. Currently, some businesses in Central are implementing this. Since the Wing Cheung robbery occurred, the association has discussed theft prevention measures. Businesses have exchanged opinions with each other, but a concrete plan is still pending a decision at the next meeting. Currently, some businesses in the evening are closing early to prevent theft. However, this measure is not ideal, because recently thieves have been robbing gold shops during the daytime. The Wing Cheung robbery is a proof of this. As for silver houses, they have also stepped up security. Some money exchange counters are implementing early closing.

### Chinese Voluntary Registration Achieves Excellent Results; Registration to Close at the End of This Month; British Indian Man Prosecuted for Delaying Registration

The Hong Kong government, in order to conscript talent and contribute to the government's strength when necessary, organized British National Registration a month ago, which concluded at the end of last month. As for the number of registrants, the authorities have kept it secret, but stated that the results were very satisfactory. All eligible British people in Hong Kong have complied with the registration procedures. According to the registration regulations, British people in Hong Kong who delay registering beyond the deadline may be fined up to 500 yuan or imprisoned for up to two months, as a warning to those who delay. It is reported that a retired British Indian man has been prosecuted by the relevant authorities for violating the law by delaying registration. The trial will be held within this week. This is the first case of prosecution for violating the British National Registration Ordinance. Also, Chinese Voluntary Registration was organized after British National Registration. Since its inception, there have been days, and yesterday, according to Sir Robert Ho Tung, the Chief Chinese Representative, Hong Kong Chinese Voluntary Registration is proceeding very well. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs and the Chinese Representative of the Legislative Council have decided to close registration at the end of this month, and to submit the registered lists from each registration office for verification once a week starting tomorrow (today). The current number of Chinese Voluntary Registrations cannot yet be estimated, but the registration forms stored in the Robert Ho Tung office have been exhausted and have been continuously obtained from the Chinese Affairs Department for use.

After the speech, she announced the opening of the highlights of "Dream of the Red Chamber," performed by the elite women, which were described in detail in yesterday's newspaper. They were all able to perform purely and enthusiastically, and the reception was extremely strong. The local community on the island considers the charity performance by elite women to be extremely valuable. They believe that Ms. Lau Hing-hün, the organizer and director, made the play 'Dream of the Red Chamber' fragrant and警世.

Regarding awakening the masses, there is the famous patriotic play "Diaochan," in which Mr. Yuen Wai-yeung played Dong Zhuo, earning praise from Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Mrs. Liao Zhongkai.

### Pig Farmers in the Peninsula Request Postponement of Relocation Without Result; Those Without Licenses Must Relocate to the New Territories by Mid-Month; Those With Licenses Must Also Relocate by the End of September

The Municipal Health Bureau believes that raising pigs within the city affects the health of residents, and passed an ordinance to ban pig farming in 1935. However, there are approximately 4,500 families in the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and in Aberdeen, who depend on raising pigs for a living, totaling 35,000 people. If the ordinance were implemented one day, these tens of thousands of people who depend on raising pigs for a living would be affected. Therefore, it has been delayed until now, and the ordinance remains unresolved. However, recently, the health authorities have decided to resolutely implement the ordinance, and have set the date for implementation to begin on the 17th of this month. At that time, all pig farmers who do not have licenses should relocate to the New Territories for raising pigs according to regulations. As for those who have licenses, they must relocate their pigs from the urban areas by September 30th of this year at the latest. Therefore, pig farmers in the Peninsula and Shau Kei Wan areas have appealed to the relevant bureau, earnestly requesting that they withdraw the decision. As of now, the relevant parties have shown no sign of backing down. It is heard that they have decided to continue to appeal to the authorities, urging them to understand the difficulties of life, and even if the ordinance must be implemented, they are seeking help from the Hong Kong government.

### A New Force in the Hong Kong Drama Scene: The Ching Bak Drama Troupe Holds Its First Performance

—Bai Chan

Today, Two Performances: "Phoenix City" and "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful" at the Puqing Theatre

May, red pomegranate flowers bloom everywhere. In this great season, Hong Kong drama workers warmly and boldly wrote a glorious historical fact for the Hong Kong drama movement.

From the joint performance of "Huanghuagang" to the 742nd public performance of "China Relief," this colonial area has been continuously filled with pleasing phenomena. We naturally need to make greater efforts to continue and promote this phenomenon!

In early June, the Ching Bak Drama Troupe will welcome this new arrival with a pioneering attitude. They decided to hold their first official drama performance at the Puqing Theatre for two consecutive days and nights, starting today.

The Ching Bak Drama Troupe, at least in the current Hong Kong drama scene, is no longer an unfamiliar name. For the first time, two months ago, they raised funds for the San Kwong Troupe of the YWCA with the performance of Chen Baichen's famous play "Demons Dance Wildly" (also known as "Dog"), which received very good reviews. Until the recent Hong Kong Joint Drama Performance, their tenacious working ability in the work of "Huanghuagang" was deeply recognized, especially the stage design of "Huanghuagang," which was unanimously praised, was all the responsibility of the troupe members. Therefore, the stage design of the Ching Bak Drama Troupe has become the most excellent among the various drama troupes in Hong Kong.

This time, they also helped a lot in the great performance of "China Relief," and at the same time, they were preparing for their own plays in such a busy schedule? This calm and persevering working attitude is also very worthy of learning.

The plays presented this time are Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City" and Chen Zhuoyou's "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful."

Many people already know about "Phoenix City," so there seems to be no need to introduce it much. The China Travel Service performed it at the Queen's Theatre last month, and it was very well received. In addition to their own technical skills, the performance of the script itself was really excellent. After the War of Resistance, "Phoenix City" is the most excellent play that describes the positive and the bright. From the smallest trivial matters to the grandest scenes, it is full of countless strengths and promotes the highest degree of resistance spirit. It is a play that is never tired of watching.

"All Under Heaven Is Peaceful" is a three-act anti-Japanese satirical comedy. The author, Chen Zhuoyou, is a drama author with a long history in Guangzhou. The well-known Lan Bai Drama Troupe and Art Association Drama Troupe are led by him. He has indelible achievements in the drama scene in South China. Last year, before Guangzhou fell, the entire Guangzhou drama industry held a fundraising competition performance. "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful" was first performed in this fundraising frenzy, and as a result, it won the fundraising competition championship and received extremely good reviews, which shows the strength of this play.

Originally, there were very few plays in the form of comedies after the War of Resistance, and "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful" was produced under the most excellent materials and techniques. It portrays the tragic ending of high-ranking refugees who do not care about the interests of the country and nation, but only care about their own selfish interests. Surrounding him is a group of hedonists who live a life of drunken stupor. In short, it uses comedic techniques to expose the general state of the War of Resistance. It is indeed a rare play.

In this drama performance, the Ching Bak Drama Troupe has made some changes to the original work in order to achieve greater realism and depth. As a result, it has become a more complete and more excellent comedy.

They will perform for two days and nights, starting today (5th). Today's daytime performance is "Phoenix City," and the evening performance is "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful." Tomorrow, the 6th, the daytime performance is "All Under Heaven Is Peaceful," and the evening performance is "Phoenix City." This will make it convenient for many viewers to watch.

Undoubtedly, the Ching Bak Drama Troupe is a rising star drama group in the current Hong Kong drama scene. From their birth to their growth, they have been consistently炼 in calm and arduous struggles. May their performance this time have excellent results and leave a new page in the history of the Hong Kong drama scene!

### Hong Kong Children's Propaganda Work
### The Children's Theater Association's First Joint Public Performance

— Fan Zheng

Yesterday, several meaningful plays were performed on the open-air stage in Kowloon City.

Yesterday, in the corner of Kowloon, near the airport, and in the vicinity of Kowloon City, one could hear children singing. Hundreds of children marched in orderly rows, like soldiers, singing "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..." Several children also shouted loudly, "Come see a play! An open-air theater! It's free!... Welcome!"

Farmers and workers followed their ranks, crossing small bridges and passing through large and small alleys, until they reached a dilapidated and old stage! — An open-air stage.

It truly was an open-air public gathering. There were women, children, men, old people, all kinds of people. They were crowded together like at a festival, their eyes fixed on the curtain, murmuring songs in their mouths.

A child popped out from behind the curtain and conducted everyone in singing the "March of the Volunteers." This song seemed even more popular than the local ditties. Not only the children in the association, but also many of the audience members, old ladies, and children, sang at the top of their lungs. It truly was a scene of the stage and audience becoming one!

The audience was already anxious. The curtain slowly rose. The first act was an adult play, "Three Rivers Good." This was an adult play, and of course, it was not very suitable to be performed by a children's group in Cantonese. However, they combined the four larger ones, and it worked out.

They spoke entirely in Cantonese, and the audience's mood was very high. At first, they were very curious about what the old man was doing. Later, they realized that he was Three Rivers Good, the leader of the volunteers. Everyone applauded wildly, watching them (two policemen and Three Rivers Good) disembark. The curtain closed, and they began to discuss the scene seriously. Some said, "Good! Three Rivers Good is truly an extraordinary person!"

There were few pauses during the performance. As soon as the curtain closed, they sang, and after the singing, the curtain opened again. After this performance, more than a thousand audience members understood why we need to resist Japan and the responsibilities of every Chinese descendant.

Because the majority of the audience were farmers, workers, and people with lower levels of knowledge, plays like "The Last Lesson" could not make the common people understand more deeply. This was also a shortcoming, which they will change immediately.

After the performance of the four plays, there was a grand chorus, and then the meeting ended. The children dismantled the stage themselves, carrying their things home.

This performance was entirely for propaganda purposes. Everyone worked hard, which is why it had such a good effect.

This kind of work is necessary. It is hoped that many theater troupes will not only perform in the city and think that's enough. We must bring this work deep into the countryside! They are preparing to continue doing this, but because of funding constraints, their work cannot develop smoothly. They feel that this is the biggest difficulty, and they need strong assistance from people in society. — June 4th, China Salvation Theater

### Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee Drafts
### Plan to Mobilize the Entire Province's Strength
### Divided into Five Committees for Separate Implementation
### Economic Mobilization to Involve Extensive Hiring of Experts

(Shaoguan Express) The Provincial Mobilization Committee was recently reorganized and established, with Chairman Li concurrently serving as the Director. The internal organization was restructured, presenting a completely new look. The first meeting was held in the middle of last month, with the consensus that modern warfare is not merely a matter of military force; the result of victory is the sum of all the human, financial, and material resources of the entire nation. This province has always been known as an affluent region, and if mobilization can be carried out effectively, it will undoubtedly contribute the greatest strength to the nation. After careful discussion, the plans for mobilizing human, financial, and material resources throughout the province, as well as the steps to be taken, have been largely determined.

Five Committees Established to Take Charge

Currently, the Committee's work is proceeding with exceptional intensity. It has now been decided to first mobilize culture, civil affairs, economy, transportation, and defense. This is because the above five are highly related to military affairs and are the urgent priorities. In order to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and work progresses rapidly, five design committees have been specially established. These five committees were formally established yesterday, and experts in each field have been hired to serve as planning committee members, drafting various committee proposals to be executed by the relevant agencies. The selection of committee members and general secretaries for each committee has also been finalized, and there are plans to publish pamphlets, organize mobilization work teams, and strengthen the structure of the mobilization committees in various counties. In addition to its subordinate committees, the organization also has two groups directly under it, as well as a secretariat.

Economic Mobilization Divided into Five Departments

Furthermore, the Committee believes that the economy is of utmost importance during the war of resistance. The government attaches great importance to economic mobilization. A responsible person from the Economic Design Committee stated that the Committee has decided to extensively hire experts to design and plan in detail for economic mobilization throughout the province. However, such talent is extremely difficult to find, so the search for and recruitment of experts is still underway. The Committee's future work will be divided into five major departments for research, in order to provide information to the relevant government agencies for execution. The main content of the five departments is as follows: 1. Fiscal and financial countermeasures; 2. Grain management; 3. Trade and commodity control; 4. Rural economic revitalization; 5. Production. Once all the experts have been hired, the drafting of detailed implementation rules will begin immediately, and implementation will be accelerated.

### The War in Dongguan, Longchuan, and Taiping is Quiet
### The Japanese Army Adopts a Defensive Posture
### The Japanese Army in Dongguan Forcibly Recruits Villagers to Act as Pacification Forces
### Our Army Also Takes the Opportunity to Adjust, Eliminating the Weak and Retaining the Strong

(Shenzhen Express) The Japanese troops in Dongguan, Longchuan, and Taiping have recently been dormant in their lairs, not daring to move. Our army, with steady steps, has not made any major advances either, so the war on the south bank of the East River is quiet. Currently, both the Japanese and our forces are only facing each other in a state of high alert. The situation is reported below:

Japanese Forces Exhausted, Adopting a Defensive Posture

The Japanese troops entrenched in Dongguan City, Shilong, Taiping, and other places have been repeatedly suppressed by our various army corps. In an attempt to break through our army's defense line, they have repeatedly sent troops to assault our positions. However, our strength is solid and our defenses are strict, so they were repeatedly defeated and suffered setbacks. The Japanese army, realizing that it is not easy to achieve their objectives, has not dared to move for half a month, adopting a defensive posture instead. They are actively promoting puppet regimes and deploying defenses in the above-mentioned areas. Two days ago, over two hundred Japanese soldiers were sent to Dongguan City and Shilong to strengthen defenses. The Japanese troops in Longchuan were stationed at the train station. Three days ago, a unit of Japanese troops that reinforced Dongguan went out to patrol the Dongguan-Zhangmutou highway. It is speculated that their intention is to prevent our counter-offensive. Zhang Zuxun, the puppet county magistrate of Dongguan, recently received orders from the Japanese to form a pacification force, using threats and inducements to lure villagers to participate, claiming that it is for pacifying local security and suppressing bandits, with the same tasks as the self-defense corps. In reality, the Japanese are running out of soldiers and fear that they will be unable to defend their existing strongholds, so they are using Chinese to control Chinese. The intentions of the Japanese army are extremely vicious, and it is hateful that the traitors are willingly acting as their pawns.

Our Army Takes the Opportunity to Adjust and Replenish

Since our army corps on the south bank of the East River were ordered to attack on May 5th, they have achieved many victories. According to military reports, Commander Wang Ruozhou of the Fourth Guerrilla Column, Regiment Commander Wu Kangjian of the Security Regiment, and others believe that their units have been fighting for a long time, and that human and material resources need to be adjusted and replenished. They are taking the opportunity to eliminate the old and weak, and replenish the elite, in order to improve the basic quality. It is reported that the unit of Liu Fayu, the Third Brigade of the Fourth District Column, which has been operating in the Daotang area behind the Japanese army, was ordered yesterday to return to a certain place in the rear for rest and replenishment. Furthermore, on the 1st of this month, our army's intelligence team, which operates on the Bao'an-Taiping Road, infiltrated Pinghuan Township and killed the puppet township chief, Li Duanxia. A badge of the "Toramun District of the Yokohara Unit" was found on the traitor's body.

### The Provincial Government Strictly Punishes
### Corrupt County Magistrates

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] At the first meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Council, the provincial government, based on reports from various councilors, decided to take swift and effective measures against local officials who are incompetent. In addition to dealing with the county magistrate of Conghua, Li Linggen, according to the resolution of the Provincial Council, the former county magistrate of Sanshui, Chen Zhuolin, and the county magistrate of Zhongshan will also be prosecuted.

### The Department of Finance Organizes
### Business Tax on Kerosene and Gasoline
### The Zhongshan Tax Bureau is Ordered to Implement

[Zhongshan Express] The Zhongshan Tax Bureau received an order from the Department of Finance yesterday regarding the wartime tax regulations for kerosene and gasoline businesses, as follows: (1) The kerosene and gasoline tax will be changed from 6/1, from the original rate to 4 yuan per ten gallons. (2) For kerosene and gasoline imported before 6/1, if taxes are paid after 6/1, the tax will still be 4 yuan. (3) The advance taxes paid by the Mobil, Asiatic, and Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft (DAPG) will still be deducted according to the original plan. (4) All other matters will be handled according to the original regulations. After receiving the telegram, the Zhongshan Tax Bureau sent letters to various kerosene merchants to inform them, and sent personnel to conduct strict inspections.

### The Provincial Government Formulates
### Relief and Compensation Measures

[Qujiang Express] The Guangdong Provincial Government passed amendments to the relief and compensation measures for various counties, cities, and bureaus yesterday, with the main points as follows: (1) People in various counties, cities, and bureaus who are injured or killed as a result of Japanese aggression will be compensated in accordance with these measures. (2) The amount of compensation should be determined by the county, city, and bureau relief committees based on their financial situation and the condition of the victims, and the amount should not exceed the following limits (but this does not apply to local charitable organizations willing to provide additional compensation): A. 10 yuan for the injured; B. 20 yuan for the deceased. (3) In the case of injuries or deaths resulting from participation in the war of resistance, or if the hometown is attacked, the various city and bureau relief committees, in addition to providing compensation in accordance with the previous measures, should immediately report to the provincial relief committee for prompt consolation in order to encourage the people's determination to resist Japan. (4) To receive compensation, a two-part receipt should be filled out. The injured should sign and seal or affix a fingerprint. In the case of death, the family members should receive the compensation, such as: A. The spouse of the deceased; B. The children of the deceased; C. The father of the deceased; D. The brothers or sisters of the deceased.

### Japanese Troops Commit Atrocities in Lubao
### Burning and Looting Villages in Western Lubao
### Our Army Pursues to Yangmei, Where Fierce Fighting Resumes

[Xijiang Express] The war on the front lines of Sanshui, Xijiang, has been raging for days. After the Japanese troops committed atrocities by disturbing and attacking Lubao, our army took advantage of the situation to counterattack. On the 29th and 30th, the fighting was fierce. Our army adopted mobile tactics, killing many Japanese soldiers. The situation is reported below:

Japanese Troops Disturb Western Lubao, Burning Villages

On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese army sent over 600 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with three aircraft, to harass along the western Lubao Road. They advanced under the cover of artillery fire. Our army, Chen's forces, coordinated with the tax police corps and Ou Hanzhang's guerrillas, and fought back at Huangtang South Side Market, Qucun Niuzhiwang, and other places. After holding out until dusk, our army, seeing that the Japanese forces were exhausted, mustered their spirits and counterattacked. The Japanese forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated along the original route, abandoning a large amount of supplies and ammunition. Over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle. When the Japanese army retreated, they set fire to and looted along the way, resulting in the complete burning and looting of villages in the Lucun South Side Market, Niulan Gang Qucun area. People fled to Lubao.

Our Army Advances, Destroying the Remaining Japanese Forces

On the morning of the 30th, Chen's forces and the tax police corps swept and destroyed the remaining Japanese forces and conducted searches. They advanced along the western Lubao Road and encountered the Japanese at Yangmei and Baoyuetang around noon, leading to another fierce battle. Soldiers from a certain battalion of our army bravely charged into the Japanese formation and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese forces. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. After about two hours of fighting, our army retreated to the high ground northwest of Yangmei and monitored the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces, having suffered heavy losses, mostly retreated to the southwest, with only a small unit remaining on alert in the Yangmei Baoyuetang area of Western Lubao Road.

Japanese Boats Patrol, Damaged in Attack

Also, on the morning of the 29th, over 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry opened fire from the vicinity of Heimian and Maoergang near Mianhua on the 43rd Highway from Sanshui, using small cannons to shell the Zhuzhou, Wanglougang, Zaotang, and Old Sanshui along the coast. They also sent several motorboats with over 100 soldiers to patrol and reconnoiter around Old Sanshui. Our defending troops spotted them and, waiting for the boats to approach, formed a web of fire and opened a fierce barrage on the Japanese. The Japanese, realizing that our forces were prepared, hurriedly retreated. As a result, one boat was sunk by our forces, and over ten Japanese soldiers fell into the water and drowned.

### Zhang Huichang
### Concurrently Appointed Deputy Commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Zone

[Zhongshan Express] After Wu Fei took office as commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Zone, in order to adjust the units under his command, he summoned his subordinate officers yesterday morning (the 3rd) to discuss plans for resisting Japan and matters related to organization and staffing. As a result, it was decided that the organization would not be changed for the time being. Zhang Huichang and Shi Baoqi will continue to serve concurrently as deputy commanders of the Zhongshan Garrison. County Magistrate Zhang will also serve concurrently as deputy commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Zone. All self-defense teams, civilian corps, garrison teams, and guerrilla teams in eastern Zhongshan will be dispatched by the Guerrilla Zone.

### Guerrilla Cadre Team Members
### Depart for Work in War Zones

[Shaoguan Express] In order to enhance the effectiveness of guerrilla tactics, the Commander-in-Chief's Office of the X District established a guerrilla training class, gathering ambitious youths to implement training. The training has now been completed, and last month they departed separately for work in the eastern, western, and northern Jiang war zones. They are scheduled to first go to the guerrilla teams of various units to carry out administrative training, then gather the people after observing the situation in various counties, organize guerrilla teams, implement guerrilla warfare training, and cooperate with the regular army in combat.

### Relief Association Trains
### People in Relief Skills

[Shaoguan Express] The Guangdong Relief Committee believes that after the war of resistance, the Japanese are wantonly brutal, slaughtering the people, even in remote and backward areas. In addition to actively organizing relief teams to go to the front for relief, it also pays special attention to the training of people in relief skills, so that once they are injured or disabled by the Japanese, they can save themselves at any time. Currently, all the relief branches in the province have stepped up their efforts to promote this, contacting medical relief organizations in the county to first gather the county's civilian corps, draw a portion of them, and provide training in various relief skills, especially in areas that are heavily affected, so that they can cooperate with the military at any time to rescue injured soldiers and civilians. The committee has recently sent relief personnel to various areas to provide on-site guidance.

### Japanese Aircraft Rampage
### Tragically Bombing Towns North and South

[Liancheng Express] In recent days, Japanese aircraft have been sighted in the counties of Wuchuan, Yangjiang, Dianbai, and Xuwen in southern Guangdong. At around 8:00 a.m. on May 28th, twelve Japanese aircraft were sighted in Xuwen, flying through Jianghong Port in Suixi, appearing to be heading towards Qinzhou and Lianzhou. Later, the batch of Japanese aircraft turned around and flew through Jianghong Port, dividing into two groups. One group circled over Jianghong, while the other group of six aircraft rampaged over the county seat of Haikang, dropping five bombs, killing six compatriots and injuring thirteen, destroying over ten civilian houses. After the enemy aircraft wreaked havoc in Jianghong, they regrouped with the previous six aircraft and bombed Jianghong again, dropping six bombs, all of which landed in fields and on the sea. After the enemy aircraft bombed Jianghong, they dropped over ten bombs in the Thirteen Trades area at the end of Nanting Street in Leizhou. The bombing took place on a market day, and the villagers were unable to escape, and were bombed to death, more than ten people, seriously injured more than ten people. In addition, three enemy aircraft dropped over ten bombs on Haishan Township, destroying over ten houses, and injuring or killing several people, resulting in significant losses.

### Counties Must Establish
### Prisoner Reform Teams Within a Time Limit

[Qujiang Express] The Provincial Military Control District Headquarters has ordered all counties to follow the regulations for organizing and establishing prisoner reform teams in wartime. However, some counties have been delaying due to the small number of prisoners, which is insufficient to form a team, or due to limited local financial resources, which makes it difficult to allocate funds. The Governor sent a special order to the county magistrates yesterday, ordering them to organize teams within a specified time, and issued the regulations on prisoners not being eligible for military service for counties to follow. (Regulations on Prisoners Not Eligible for Military Service) A. Those whose cases are directly or indirectly related to collaboration with Japan, or who are traitors. B. Those who have committed the crime of smoking opium. C. Those who are over 50 years old. D. Those who have a confirmed illness and are unable to perform labor (those with potentially curable diseases are still allowed to enlist). E. Those sentenced to indefinite imprisonment or imprisonment of ten years or more, with a remaining prison term of five years or more (those with a remaining prison term of less than five years may still be enlisted).

### Recent Developments in Guangdong Province's Wartime
### Financial and Fiscal Organization
### Provincial Financial Stability, National Currency in Circulation
### Onerous Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies Actively Being Abolished

[Shaoguan Express] Gu Yiqun, Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance, in order to stabilize the province's wartime financial economy, has followed the wartime financial stability policy and drafted implementation measures for the province, which have been promulgated to all counties for diligent implementation. Since its implementation, the province's finances have been extremely stable. According to a senior official of the Department of Finance, the province's finances have been exceptionally stable from the outbreak of war to the present. The notable points are as follows: (1) Branch treasuries have been established in most counties, and preparations are actively underway in those where they have not yet been established. All county branch treasuries are able to remit various tax revenues to the county on schedule, but due to operational issues, some are affected by environmental factors, delaying collection, and efforts are being made to improve this. (2) Actively promoting the national currency. In addition to ordering all counties to strictly prohibit discrimination against the national currency, the Department and the Provincial Bank have also announced to all merchants that all trade must be based on the national currency. All merchants have complied and implemented this order, so the national currency is in widespread circulation in the inland counties. (3) The province buys back silver and prevents it from flowing out. After the locations for buying back silver in various counties were abolished, the branches of the Provincial Bank in each county were made responsible for the buyback, and personnel were sent to strictly investigate the smuggling of silver for export. Therefore, the quantity of silver bought back and remitted by the counties has been quite good recently. In addition, various counties have been ordered to strictly handle the prevention of Japanese sabotage of our financial policies. As a result, the province's finances are exceptionally stable. The organization of finances can be divided into the following: (1) Implementing unified financial management authority in the counties and ordering the organization of financial committees to assist in the organization. Financial committees have now been established uniformly in all counties. (2) Onerous taxes and miscellaneous levies in the counties have been actively abolished, and provincial taxes and national taxes have been separately defined. Those belonging to the national treasury are remitted by the counties to the financial affairs office for periodic remittance to the central government. Those belonging to the provincial treasury are remitted by the county tax collection agencies to the branch treasuries for periodic remittance to the general treasury. (3) The province's financial revenue and expenditure are now quite well-matched after the provincial government approved the wartime administrative expenses for the entire province and the expenses for the armed self-defense teams in the guerrilla areas. The provincial authorities are still striving to save government expenses and eliminate wasteful spending to strengthen wartime finances.

Movies and Drama

### Unprecedented Spectacle in Hollywood
### Three Color Films
### Being Produced Simultaneously

Starring Shirley Temple, Tyrone Power, Loretta Young (Betty)

According to information obtained by this newspaper from Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, the company's studios in Hollywood are currently producing three color films simultaneously, and the stars of each film are all top celebrities of today.

The first film being produced is Shirley Temple's "The Little Princess". Before "The Little Princess", Shirley will have a new film, "Little Miss Broadway." (The male lead is George Murphy. This is the first time for Shirley to star in a color film.

The second film being produced is Tyrone Power's "Jesse James." Since receiving critical acclaim for "Suez," Tyrone has risen rapidly, working together with Sonja Henie in "In Old Chicago" and "Second Honeymoon," and with Norma Shearer in "Marie Antoinette." He is also scheduled to star in a film with Loretta Young.

Many movie fans have an indelible impression of Tyrone. This is also the first time that he stars in a color film for Twentieth Century Fox.

The third film is Loretta Young's "Kentucky". Loretta has starred in dozens of excellent films. She also starred in a color film, "Ramona," with Don Ameche. Hollywood once praised Loretta as the most beautiful female star to star in a color film. This new film is directed by King Vidor, who directed "Second Honeymoon."

The three color films starring the above-mentioned stars are being produced simultaneously at a cost of five million dollars, which is an unprecedented spectacle in Hollywood. It is also rumored that Twentieth Century Fox has new productions in the works, including "The Girl From Brooklyn," starring Alice Faye and Warner Baxter, and "Thanks For Everything," starring Adolphe Menjou, Jack Oakie, and Jack Haley.

### Silver Mesh (Ph.D.)

Wu Cun's works are coming out more and more. After "Tears of a Singing Voice", he immediately started filming "New Hell" (renamed from "Rhapsody of Spring"), working hard at the studio all day long.

On the first day of filming "New Hell," Shu Shi, Xu Feng, and Bai Yun suddenly appeared nude as a group in front of Wu Cun. In an instant, all the female actors watching slipped away.

The total cost of all the scenery, costumes, and props for "Li San Niang" was calculated the day before yesterday and amounted to 30,000 yuan. Boss Liu said, "This film is ten times better than Meng Jiang Nu."

"New Hell" is co-starred by all the male and female stars of Guohua, depicting the dark side of a lonely island.

Wang Yuanlong, the director of "Swallow Thief," and the female lead Wang Ying, after completing their work, will go to Annam Saigon. As for Wang Yuanlong, he may also leave Shanghai for Hong Kong.

Sun Jing's "Fragrant River Singing Girl," which he wrote and directed, began filming the day before yesterday.

Since Fan Xuepeng both acted in a film and performed in a play, her health has been deteriorating day by day. A few days ago, she applied for leave from the Yihua authorities for further medical treatment.

Lu Ming introduced Cao Huizhen to Yihua. Yihua will give her important roles and changed her name to Cao E.

Wang Yin, Mei Xi, Gu Shijun, and Yuan Langen all rode in cars after the incident.

Chen Jianran is suspected of initiating a righteous movement in the film industry, and has been working very enthusiastically these days.

Shao Yifu has come to Shanghai this time, and it is said that he is aggressively poaching talent. Several people have been invited, but their names have not been announced.

Guan Hongda's younger brother, Zuo Yun, recently felt uneasy living in his "hometown" Harbin. Therefore, he came to Shanghai a month ago. Introduced by Lao Guan, he was also listed as one of Yihua's actors. Recently, he played a bandit in "The Three Transformations of a Girl."

Bu Wancang's new work, "Western Bandit," has already decided that the role of Xi Shi will be played by Wang Meiyun. The other roles have also been largely assigned. The film's scenery design will be handled by Fang Peilin.

The young master of Yihua Company, Yan Youxiang's son, Yan Kejun, will direct a type of ideologically rigid film like "Same Fate Mandarin Ducks." The script is already being written.

### Five Phoenixes Singing Together - A 20th Century Fox Production

A set of quintuplets is a good "human interest story." With the progress of science, none of these "five bundles" were damaged and survived. Medically speaking, this is also a victory. But what is it for film merchants to make it into a movie and make it public?

I remember that using five twin girls as the logo on commodity brands is even more common. For example, for biscuits, the portraits of the five girls are printed on the tin boxes. There has also been a snow scene called "Five Blessings Descend on the House."

This is a clever move. Isn't it for their "business opportunities"?

Now these five twin girls are gradually growing up, and they can already open their little mouths to sing inaudible songs, and they can pour tea and dance.

Film merchants are probably still smart. Of course, they won't miss this "business eye." So, they filmed this "Five Phoenixes Singing Together."

I don't object to filming the lives of the Dionne quintuplets as a newsreel, but it's really superfluous to add a beginning and end and weave it into a story, turning it into a "feature film."

Moreover, the "story" attached to this "Five Phoenixes Singing Together" tells of a male and a female reporter who have some unpleasantness with each other because of competition, so they try to tease each other. Later, the female reporter, entrusted by a New York orphanage, wanted to invite the Dionne quintuplets to perform in New York. They had already agreed. Coincidentally, she was teased by her lover and broadcast an inaccurate news report, "Rock heard about this and thought that Ge (the female reporter) had ulterior motives, so he forbade the five girls from going to New York to perform." Duke (the male reporter) heard about this and felt deeply remorseful and uneasy, so he decided to sponsor the completion of the matter to atone for his past mistakes. So, after his efforts, the truth came to light, and the five girls "broadcasted the situation of the five girls celebrating their fourth birthday" on a wireless television machine. "Ge deeply felt Ke's help, and thus released all previous grievances and became good friends."

From a thematic point of view, such a story cannot be considered bad, but in terms of the typicality of the play, it is really too bland. The motive for filming is to introduce the lives of the Dionne quintuplets. The story has become an appendage, so it's no wonder.

The story is an appendage to the Dionne sisters, and the other roles are even more appendages of the appendages. Therefore, there is no need to talk about their roles.

### Anti-Japanese War Film "The 400 Million Compatriots" Filmed on Location in China Completed. The Final Climax is the Battle of Taierzhuang. Lowell Thomas is the Narrator.

China's current war of resistance has attracted worldwide attention. Major Hollywood companies have already filmed newsreels of the war of resistance, but unfortunately, none of them can be shown in Shanghai. Last year, with the financial support of celebrities in the film and literary circles such as Lillian Hellman, Ernest Hemingway, Dashiell Hammett, and William O'Field, Joris Ivens and John Ferno also came to China to film on location a newsreel about the war of resistance, titled "The 400 Million" ("The 400,000,000"). (Note: these two are masters at making this kind of excellent film. Their "Spanish Earth" was the best newsreel of 1937.) The film explains that China's war of resistance will surely be victorious. The final climax of the entire film is the Battle of Taierzhuang. One scene in which Chinese farmers leave their fields for the battlefield is very powerful. What is worth noting is that the on-screen narrator of the film is the famous male star Lowell Thomas.

### Jiangcun × Mutiny. A Two-Hour Gunfight. Mutinous Soldiers Subdued. × warlord attempts to buy military hearts with appeasement.

(Northern Guangdong Quick News) Our army on the front line from (Huaxian) to Hua (County) is now continuing its efforts and advancing bravely. There have been gains in recent days. An investigation revealed that because the troops of × army were ineffective in their operations, the anti-war atmosphere is growing stronger. × army commanders are extremely anxious. On the morning of the 28th of last month, a train of × army arrived in Jiangcun from Guangzhou. Shortly after getting off the train, suddenly fifty or sixty people of × army launched a mutiny and refused to obey orders. At that time, more than twenty × army soldiers who were monitoring the × army, seeing the changes in the × army, immediately fired their guns to suppress the rebellion. The mutinous × army was furious and drew their guns in resistance, thus a gunfight broke out. For a time, gunshots rang out and the situation was serious. After more than an hour of confrontation, the mutinous × army, finally running out of ammunition, was subdued by the military police and the × army from their own unit and imprisoned in Jiangcun × headquarters. In this mutiny gunfight, a total of more than twenty people were killed or injured. The pervasive anti-war atmosphere in the × army is making the × warlords most anxious. Investigations reveal that the × headquarters in Jiangcun, Shijing, Gaotang, and Bengbu held "Mobilization Meetings" on the 26th and 27th, gathering the × soldiers in each location, promoting the policy of aggression against our country, and deceiving the soldiers. In recent days, they have also instigated the puppet maintenance societies in various villages and towns to organize so-called comfort groups. The puppet traitors, upon receiving orders, immediately plundered items from our people to comfort the × army. At the same time, they also held singing and recreational performances for the × army to watch and enjoy, attempting to suppress anti-war sentiment with appeasement. From this, we can see the embarrassment of the × warlords.

### Large Army Arrives in Hanoi. South China Team's Initial Victory. Six to Zero Clean Win Against Hanoi Champion Team.

(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) The South China Southern Tour Football Team, a group of nineteen people, departed on the Guangdong ship on the 31st of last month and arrived in Haiphong on the morning of the 3rd of this month. However, there was no match in Haiphong, so they took a train to Hanoi. (On the same day, Liang Rongzhao flew from Hong Kong to Hanoi to rejoin the team.) They played against the local champion team in Hanoi. This was the team's first battle of the expedition.

Yesterday, the rear received a telegram from the team stating that on the afternoon of the previous day (the 3rd), they competed against the local champion team in Hanoi. Many famous spectators went to watch. The team's morale was high, and they were good at both offense and defense. They defeated the champion team six to zero. Center forward Chen Dehui had a wonderful performance, scoring three goals himself. Li Zhaorong, Yang Shuiyi, and Liu Songsheng each scored one goal.

In the competition, the team often had the advantage and rarely had to worry about defense. Therefore, the five forwards often galloped in the opponent's penalty area. The opponent's defenders were very busy dealing with them and made mistakes in their movements. Therefore, two of the six goals they won were penalty kicks.

Although the team's current expedition still lacks several strong players, the military appearance is very grand. If the team members are not injured too much during the expedition and can move forward with all their efforts, the results will be excellent. Now that the initial victory has been reported, establishing the prestige of a first victory, we wish them a smooth journey and good news coming one after another. (Taishan of the Football Field)

### First Division Basketball Runner-Up. No Final Match.

The First Division Basketball League has ended, and the winner is the South China Athletic Association.

### Davis Cup European Zone Replay. Germany Wins Both Singles Against England

(Berlin Electric) The Davis Cup European Zone replay, the Germany-England match, began on the 3rd in Berlin. On the first day, Germany won both singles cleanly.

Based on the current situation, England is likely to be completely defeated. There is no doubt that Germany and France will be in the European Zone final.

### Chinese Baseball Team. Has Recovered Its Old Appearance. Yesterday Crushed South China 7-0. The Min Team Won Against the Westerners in the Last Inning.

Yesterday's public baseball league, the first game was between the Chinese team and the South China Athletic Association, and the second game was between the Mindanaos and the Western Association. Before the game, many expected a fierce battle in the first game. Unexpectedly, South China lost badly 0-7 because Ku Guojia Ping and Feng Jingxiang had gone south, and the replacements were not perfect.

South China's new catcher, He Xiancheng, had a steady performance and can be regarded as a promising new player. In the fifth inning, He was injured his finger catching the ball and switched to third base. Situ Bi took over as catcher. At this time, China had already scored seven points and was complacent. They were somewhat slack in the attack, so South China was no longer at a disadvantage.

South China's overall coordination was quite loose. Li Zhongzhen, who is known for his experience, was especially abnormal. It is probably because he is getting old and his physical strength is poor. In the fifth inning, Li was mentally distracted and let Xiang Yingyong pitch. Zheng's skills were mediocre and he made no contribution.

China Wins Cleanly Against South China

China's performance proves that they have recovered their old appearance. "Charlie" Lin Ye and Chen Fang stole bases a lot, and South China's morale was often disturbed by them. Therefore, guided by Lin and Chen in the third inning, they scored six points in a row, and their momentum was evident. Right fielder Qu Bingnan (Western name Cannery) has made great progress and is especially confident in catching fly balls. If China can continue to practice hard, they still have hope of retaining the championship. The scores of both sides are recorded below.

South China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 points

Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total Points

China 0 0 6 1 0 0 A 7 points

(Three balls) Chen Fang 4, Li Zhongzhen 7, Zheng Kangyong 1.

(Four balls) Chen Fang 2, Li Zhongzhen 7, Zheng Kangyong 2.

The entire game took one hour and forty minutes.

Min Team's Last Victory

The game between the Mindanaos and the Western Association was also worth watching. Although the Western Association lacked the help of Gaoshan, their offensive power was still strong. In the first two innings, they took the lead and threatened the Min team with a score of 5-0. By the sixth inning, they were still leading 7-4. Many viewers thought that the Western Association could win steadily. Who knew that the war was changeable and unpredictable. The Min team unexpectedly showed great power in the last inning and scored five points in one breath, reversing the defeat into a victory with a score of 9-7. The audience was excited, and the sailors all smiled. The scores of the two teams are listed below.

Mina Team 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 9 points

Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total Points

Western 3 2 0 1 0 1 0 7 points

(Three balls) Lu Ailu 7, Pala Ci 5,

(Four balls) Lu Ailu 5, Pala Ci 3,

The entire game took two hours and ten minutes.

### Shanghai Yen Depreciation Causes Uproar in Japan; Ministry of Finance and Banks Discuss Remedies; No Consensus on Fundamental or Temporary Solutions

The depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai has aroused concern throughout Japan. The Japanese financial community and newspapers are now demanding measures to support it. The Asahi Shimbun reports that officials from the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai are discussing the matter with various Japanese banks. According to general opinion, reducing spending by Japanese residents in Shanghai is a fundamental way to restore the yen's exchange rate. The financial community is now demanding that steps be taken to combat the undervaluation of the yen in Shanghai. This depreciation has various adverse effects on the country's exchange rate policy and is believed to be due to weakening factors supporting the yen. Exports from "Manchukuo," such as soybeans and soybean cakes, were previously sold to central China in yen, but are now calculated in sterling, resulting in less demand for yen. Furthermore, Japanese cotton fabrics in mainland China were previously calculated in yen, but are now calculated in military scrip. This change helps the circulation of military scrip, but reduces the need for ordinary yen. It is also noted that the number of Japanese people carrying cash to China for various purposes has increased, accelerating the inflow of yen into China. The Asahi Shimbun also believes that the Chongqing government is taking advantage of the controlled yen market to try to obstruct the circulation of Japanese currency in China, in retaliation for the establishment of the China Development Bank. Regardless of the cause, the yen's depreciation has led to illegal trading of foreign currencies to buy yen. Foreign currencies that normally flow into China are now circulating in Shanghai, where they are easily converted into yen. Although the authorities are making every effort to prevent this, such situations are now occurring. While the government may take some effective steps to restore normalcy to the exchange market, these are at best temporary remedies and cannot cure the underlying problem. There are now suggestions for remedial measures: (1) to absolutely prohibit the carrying of cash from Japan to Shanghai while completely separating the yen circulating in Shanghai from the yen in Japan; (2) to make Japanese military scrip the only legal currency in central China, but to delay its implementation in Shanghai and its vicinity. However, any attempt to isolate the Shanghai yen will lead to major national difficulties, as it will involve not only economic but also political aspects. Converting the entire central China into an area where military scrip can be used requires careful consideration, as it has widespread and serious implications. In summary, the newly established China Development Bank should not be used to aid the yen situation, as the China Development Bank is established as an exchange institution and should not be involved in currency adjustments.

Free Discussion

### Freedom?

— Wen Yu

"Freedom, freedom, how many crimes are committed in thy name!" This is a famous quote from Madame Roland. However, this is not a criticism of freedom itself, but rather to say that while the word "freedom" is something for which thousands of people shed blood and struggle, it is inevitable that some will use it to mask their wickedness. Just as the word "peace" is undoubtedly a good term, some fight for peace, while others kowtow for peace. Some say that there can be peace only with freedom, as foreign pacifists like Professor Luo Tianyi also believe. However, some seek peace at the cost of national freedom, a difference as great as heaven and earth. Now, even the treacherous Han traitors are shouting "freedom." Although they are merely "using the name of freedom" to engage in criminal activities, it shows how valuable freedom is. The freedom of the nation and its people should not be sacrificed by a few traitors, because the courage to fight for the freedom of the nation has surged into the hearts of the majority.

Speaking of "freedom of speech," it is indeed the spirit of a democratic country. If speech is truly not free, then naturally one must strive for it. However, the "freedom of speech" mentioned by XX is different. They publish a newspaper one day, a report the next, and send a telegram, freely answering letters from overseas Chinese or questions from guests, enjoying themselves immensely. While their speech is indeed illegal, they face no restrictions in expressing it. However, the righteous spirit of the people exists among the majority, so as soon as their arguments are presented, they are immediately seen through. The "demon-revealing mirror" shines on them from all sides, and even the XX's ever-changing newspapers dare not echo them loudly, but rather shrink back in embarrassment. Their so-called fight for freedom is merely an attempt to prevent people from interfering with their smokescreens, poison bombs, conspiracies, and secret plans, so that they can "freely" sell out the freedom of the nation without anyone tearing down their masks. They have tried many tricks before, but they have all been exposed and clearly identified as XX. The majority can distinguish who is who. With no plans left, how can they live up to their masters and earn their stipends? Perhaps they will even be punished. Now that XXXX is using the guise of "freedom of speech," it shows how their schemes are becoming increasingly inept. However, do we, the people, recognize their "freedom of speech"? Exposing them should be done even more actively!

Their "freedom of speech" is not to be won from the country, but from the masses. In that case, they can only achieve their goals if the masses' demands for resistance have already failed. Then, when they have freedom of speech, it will be when four hundred and fifty million people are enslaved, and they will be slaves serving their masters. At that time, there will be no need to mention freedom of speech. Therefore, we answer them: your "freedom of speech" is impossible to achieve. Although you may print your surrender arguments in newspapers, you cannot prevent people from exposing, tearing down, and cursing you. You will never be able to imprint it on people's hearts. Our freedom of speech is completely different from yours. As long as the fight continues and the people are still here, we will absolutely not allow you to freely betray the nation! And we, under the principles of supporting resistance and building the nation, can obtain complete "freedom of speech." However, whether Wang Jingwei mentioned "freedom of speech" when he met with the Japanese is something no one knows.

In fact, for any individual, freedom always has a limit. Beyond that limit, freedom will be sanctioned. We resist in order to seek the freedom of the nation, which is demonstrated by the facts of the past twenty-three months. The recent retreat of the XX from northern Hubei for two hundred miles further proves that the XX's defeat is an inevitable fact! Therefore, seeking freedom through resistance should be the belief of every Chinese person. If one's belief is not firm, it is a mistake that needs to be corrected. They are not allowed to be free, let alone those who fundamentally deny resistance, shout for peace, and run between old Tokyo and Hongkou. If they cannot be Chinese, what freedom are they talking about? There is no freedom for traitors here. If traitors want freedom, let them seek it from the XX! There will never be freedom for traitors within our anti-Japanese camp!

Freedom, freedom, but there is no freedom to sell out the country, no freedom to imitate traitors!

The "freedom of speech" of the traitors is not even worthy of the name.

### The Primordial Ancient Dream

— Yang Yanqi

I am ashamed, I am embarrassed, I stare blankly at the sky; I hope for a gust of wind to blow away this garment of civilization, to blow in the primordial ancient dream.

——Two lines from an old work.

Like the oil stains in the seams of a machine, the human spirit is being ground down. When it is worn out, more provisions are added, until the preciousness is eroded to the point of desolation, and then it quietly leaves the world.

Some describe life in the countryside as poetic and life in the city as prose. In fact, life in the city is not only prose but also an argumentative essay. It is full of concentrated juice, without a single space to stretch out the suffocating feeling of being blocked. Basically, among the gears of the machine, it is not allowed to stretch out the suffocating feeling of being blocked. Looking up, one sees telephone poles and, occasionally, rows of tall trees. They are nothing more than decorations to adjust one's vision.

It is as if people are bound by heavy shackles, like a heavy stone pressing down on them, forcing them to be unable to breathe, only to sweat profusely. With hunched backs and bent waists, they are squeezed in this vast and complex society. People say: This is a civilized society.

Therefore, we have all become civilized people.

In the eyes of barbarians and savages, we are gods, we are monsters—but we regard "them" as "it."

The traces of civilization are engraved on people's lifestyles, but they are not engraved on their hearts. In people's hearts, there is always a void, a void as deep as a valley. Around it are flowers and grass—a garment of civilization.

Perhaps the spring breeze will blow up the garment of civilization. We see that inside the garment is a withered skeleton. Inside the skeleton is a gold and silver ring. Inside the ring is a prison of meditation. Inside the prison are many crazy people who want to seek happiness in leisure. Outside the garment, a breeze is blowing.

Baudelaire said, "Life is a big hospital, and the people in this hospital are always thinking of changing their beds. Many people like to spend their lives suffering by the stove, while many others prefer to live comfortably outdoors." When people live a greasy life in the seams of the gears, they think of falling into the primordial ancient dream.

Truly, "history has given me this revelation, calling me to be restless. The era has given me this deception, calling me to be confused." Therefore, "watching white clouds floating overhead, watching the sun reflected in the civilized sky" is all a mockery of the people in this era. They consider themselves the favored children of civilization, having received the baptism of culture, but in fact, they are exactly the same as in countless years past, only dressed in a colorful silk robe, complacent and self-satisfied.

Alas, this is not glory, it is shame, it is disgrace. Having lost the freedom of the primordial era and the original form of man, they are more barbaric than before. There is no need to use the waste paper of treaties and the deceptive speeches to cover up and conceal the shame of mankind.

The spring sunset appears despondent.

I stretch and murmur the two lines from my old work:

"I am ashamed, I am embarrassed, I stare blankly at the sky; I hope for a gust of wind

to blow away this garment of civilization, to blow in the primordial ancient dream."

An afternoon without having to remember the date.

### Theory and Practice

— Dian Chang

"Mount the horse to kill the enemy, dismount the horse to draft proclamations," this is the true nature of a hero. But in the present, it is already the most ordinary thing. Precisely because it is ordinary, it is still the minimum requirement, if one wants to be a sound warrior.

"Drafting proclamations" is precisely linked with "mounting the horse." It cannot be separated. It must be above common sense, otherwise it cannot be below common sense. If one still comes up with, "Cannot bear to see the clothing and customs of the superior nation fall to the barbarians; Let us gather the heroes of the Central Plains and restore our rivers and mountains!" that is merely plagiarism, and cannot even be considered literary talent; it is just a joke. Naturally, drafting proclamations on horseback might "muddle one's mind," but to possess literary talent, one must "calmly" seize the "silk-clad beauty"—in the "three on" of "on the horse," one already feels hazy and uncertain when looking at the flowers, so to "move one's mind" genuinely somewhat... therefore—"dismount!"

In fact, the shortcoming of being on horseback lies in "personal experience," while "specializing" in "paperwork," although there are times when distortions require a "comrade's criticism" and "life-or-death" consequences, it is generally not a problem. Thus, drafting proclamations in an air-raid shelter becomes a matter "below common sense." In this way, killing the enemy and drafting proclamations become separate. Drafting proclamations becomes another link. However, although the clerk-like drafting of proclamations is accomplished with a flourish in the air-raid shelter, one still faintly smells the aroma of gunpowder, because while the ink is still wet, one must still proclaim it. If one stays permanently in the air-raid shelter, never looking up, or even moves to a safe area to draft proclamations by radio, over time, one will naturally lose a sense of reality. Such "specialization" turns the proclamation into a "pure theory"—it becomes so stifled that it cannot be discussed in terms of victory or defeat.

Be a scholar then. Of course, a soldier in battle is not qualified to be a scholar, but are not great scholars born from battles? Having smelled a bit of battle in the air-raid shelter, one can calm down and attack theory, and one is qualified for this. Joseph said, "Our theory must not only run parallel with practice but must also surpass practice!" But undoubtedly one must pass over the bridge of practice. The bridge is certainly a suspension bridge of sorts, not allowing one to saunter at one's own pace, shaking one's head and wagging one's tail, but very dangerous. Therefore, one can only go to the bamboo garden to "investigate things," and after investigating for three days and three nights, apart from the crisscrossing bamboo shadows and exquisite tranquility, one gets a headache. Perhaps one can suddenly understand this principle: for example, Dayu is two... But then one also loses the basis for one's own experimentation.

Therefore, scholars are even more frustrated in this situation. Yesterday Kant, Schiller, Bogdanov, Hegel, Midding; today Marx, Engels, Lunacharsky, Plekhanov, Sinclair, Sirokov, Eisenstein; tomorrow Friche, Darwin, Wells, Ilyich; the day after tomorrow Gorky, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky,... what kind of theoretical system can one study? "Why hasn't a great work yet been produced?" Then let the scholars get to work. The scholars worked for many years, finally thinking of moving, in accordance with "dialectical materialism," thinking, "The proclamation stuff is still good, it can 'enter the upper levels,' 'engage in theory' is somewhat boring." But... in this second phase of the war of resistance, no agencies are recruiting clerks in air-raid shelters anymore. What, what to do? Fine, just "practice" here and now, every place needs "talent."

Like this: attend · discuss · resolve: "The War of Resistance has reached the ×th phase, we must..." Clasping the briefcase and straightening the back, one walks off. This is an even greater proclamation-style practice—true, Mr. Hua Wei's muttering demeanor is sometimes quite handsome, and one must sacrifice precious time: even if one only walks two steps, puffs out a smoke, and says, "Excuse me, I'll take my leave!" it is still work. Besides, the space for attending, discussing, and resolving is not just one!

Therefore, there are fewer opportunities for research. The special collections of Guangde, Schiller, Sholokhov, Ostrovsky... will have to wait for the future. This is why "why has a great work not yet been produced?"

However, what is even more regrettable is that the scholar's rigorous private life has now become somewhat "elastic": "Miss ×" must also be taken outside:——her hair is permed into the most standard bombing style, her nails are dyed blood red, and she wears ivory sunglasses. All this has its rich meaning of resistance. Besides, the scholar's mouth must also puff out a beautiful cloud of May Blossom smoke, waving his hands and feet and pointing out: This is May's blood flower!

The conversation, of course, is multifaceted, but it is still below the level of common sense. "Why has a great work not yet been produced?"

The ancients said: Where does one start biting a bone? From where one bites. It is not about biting, it is about the danger of spitting out stomach acid. Coming out here to stroll around is naturally a way to harmonize one's blood and energy, but what is worrying is that one has not even swallowed an old cotton wadding; things are truly terrible!

### A New Weapon of War

— Sha Hong

The cities of what we call the civilized world are now constantly under the threat of aerial bombardment. Aircraft can at any time drop explosives, trinitrotoluene (TNT) poison gas, or incendiary bombs to destroy and massacre. Some cities close to enemy territory are also subject to heavy artillery shelling by the enemy. For example, during the last European war, Paris was bombarded by the enemy from a distance of seventy-five miles. Recently, a new threat has been added: rockets.

Lieutenant Randolph of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps, in the "Army Ordnance" magazine, said that the use of rockets in military affairs is now possible, and may soon become a reality. Rockets can be used for long-range bombing. Based on current technological conditions, it is not difficult to make them achieve the same great feats as the German long-range guns used to shell Paris during the European war. Long-range guns take a long time to fire medium-caliber shells, but rockets can be fired quickly at will, with the explosive power equivalent to a 24-inch shell. The realization of this is not far off, just like airplanes in 1913, which within a few years were able to carry out bombing raids in wartime.

During the European war, the shells of the German long-range guns used to bombard Paris were only about eight inches in caliber and weighed only about seven hundred pounds. However, a 24-inch shell would weigh about four tons.

The possible range of such bombardment rockets is beyond the reach of any ideal cannon. Ideally, rockets could be fired from Berlin, fly across the Atlantic, and bombard New York. However, the cost of manufacturing such rockets is too high, and the targets are difficult to hit, which are all practical difficulties.

Rockets can also carry pilots for long-range attacks. When the pilot guides the rocket directly towards the target for a crash landing, he can jump down with a parachute, or land in a small plane, and then do his best to exert his personal power, either fleeing to the countryside to set fire to forests, or cutting traffic and power lines, until captured.

Although unmanned rockets lack accuracy, they can become a factor of terror. From the attacker's point of view, they are good for bombing targets such as docks, armories, and factories. For civilians, knowing where to hide from rockets can provide some comfort. But rockets can also be filled with explosives and dropped at any time in unimportant places in the rear, which makes civilians very nervous.

Rockets used for bombing at a distance of about a hundred miles can be made by slightly modifying existing rockets. As for rockets used for attacking thousands of miles away, they may be realized in the future, but the structure will be very different. In terms of engineering principles, such long-distance flights are possible; however, materials that can withstand the temperature of space and the necessary pressure for the propulsion components have not yet been found.

There are also some problems with fuel that have not yet been solved. The rockets created by Dr. Goddard of Clark University have achieved excellent results in testing. The fuel used in them is not the gunpowder used in fireworks, but a kind of liquid fuel called, where liquid oxygen is used to replace ordinary air, which can make it ignite more fiercely.

War rockets are not limited to those that are huge in size and have long ranges. Rockets used on the front lines only need to be small. Their greatest advantage is that launching rockets only requires light tubes. Some tasks that ordinary heavy artillery cannot accomplish due to their weight can be easily accomplished with these rockets.

Rockets can not only attack land targets, but also simplify the problem of coastal defense, because they have the same use as the heaviest cannons, but are much easier to move around.

Rockets can also serve as anti-aircraft guns. Large-caliber anti-aircraft guns often have difficulties in aiming at rapidly moving targets due to the heavy gun body and slow rotation. However, the launching tube for a 300-pound rocket is much lighter than an anti-aircraft gun that fires shells twenty times heavier. As for effectiveness, the shells have more explosives and stronger explosive power. When hitting a flying target, in addition to hitting it, it can also blast it into even further places.

Rockets have two advantages over cannons. First, the speed of a rocket can remain constant until the propellant at the bottom of the rocket burns out. The speed of a cannon shell, on the other hand, is extremely fast only when it leaves the muzzle, and becomes extremely slow as it approaches the target. Second, if the propellant at the bottom of the rocket remains when it hits the target, it will explode at this time like the propellant at the head, increasing its power.

However, rockets cannot completely replace the position of cannons. In many military necessities, cannons are still the king of weapons; however, in warfare, many of the tasks of cannons have already been replaced by mortars, airplanes, bombs, hand grenades, etc. Therefore, in future wars, rockets will also participate in some new tragedies.

In the tyranny of the god of war, rockets are not a brand-new gadget. The British had already achieved significant results in their campaign against Napoleon using rockets. The rockets used at that time were invented by William Congreve.
