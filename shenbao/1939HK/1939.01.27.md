### Basic Arguments for Chairman Chiang's Belief in Inevitable Victory in the War of Resistance

In his opening address to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee, Chairman Chiang meticulously analyzed the situation of the enemy and ourselves, indicating the reasons for our country's inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, and the concrete measures to strive to ensure the conditions for inevitable victory. This is the supreme guideline for our 450 million compatriots in the War of Resistance and the struggle for survival, and a golden rule that all Chinese citizens should carefully read and follow. The full text is about ten thousand words long, and its content can be divided into two major parts. The first half can be said to be the basic arguments for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, while the second half is the concrete measures to strive for victory in the War of Resistance. Now, I will briefly elaborate on the points indicated, to fulfill the responsibility of conveying the leader's guidelines to the journalistic circles. Due to space limitations, I will briefly express my views in two parts. First, let's start with the basic arguments for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance:

(1) The determination to resist and the confidence in inevitable victory are the fundamental driving forces for us to win the final victory in the all-out War of Resistance. Without this determination and confidence, not only will our victory not be guaranteed, but even the War of Resistance will not be able to continue. Our ability, as a long-weak and aging country, to resist a country with relatively modern and mechanized military equipment for as long as eighteen months, and to become stronger as we fight, all stems from this confidence and determination. High self-confidence generates resolute action. In our "confidence," there is also "shared confidence" and "mutual trust." At this critical moment for our entire survival, our 450 million people have a common belief, which is that if we do not resist to the end to strive for final victory and national liberation, we will become slaves of foreign races and never have a chance to rise again. In addition to this shared confidence, the relationship of "mutual trust" is also very important. The ability of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all parties and factions, to eliminate past grudges and prejudices and genuinely cooperate to resist external oppression, stems from this mutual trust. Shared confidence generates mutual trust, and with these two types of confidence, there is the determination to jointly resist to the end. Therefore, how to find ways to increase the sincerity of "mutual trust" and enhance the conviction of "shared confidence" thereafter is the first major prerequisite for strengthening the basic driving force of the War of Resistance.

(2) Our confidence and determination to resist to the end do not come out of thin air, but are based on scientific evidence. This scientific evidence is the objective understanding and correct judgment of the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, as well as the international situation. Ancient military strategists said: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The reason why the enemy is now trapped in a dilemma, and fights in confusion, is precisely because they do not know themselves and know their enemy, that is, their understanding and judgment of the objective situation is incorrect. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, there were also some unscrupulous elements who did not have confidence and determination in the War of Resistance, and were always in a state of wavering, which had a negative impact on our all-out War of Resistance. The reason for this was that they did not recognize the reasons for the enemy's inevitable defeat, or overestimated the enemy's strength, or made a separate and individual assessment of the Sino-Japanese War, and deviated from the relationship with the world. The enemy will inevitably be defeated and perish because we resist to the end, but the many international problems caused by our resistance to the end are also major factors accelerating the enemy's demise; we will inevitably win because of our heroic resistance, but the sympathy and support we have gained from various countries for defending international conventions and world justice through our heroic resistance is also a huge force to enhance our victory. Therefore, correctly recognizing the enemy and the inevitable trend of the world is the scientific basis for maintaining and strengthening our confidence and determination in the War of Resistance. We should thereafter more actively promote the study of the enemy's situation in all aspects and the inevitable trend of international mutual constraints. With this active research and the correct understanding obtained from it, we can not only enhance our confidence and determination in the War of Resistance, but also obtain a basis for establishing the political and military strategies of the War of Resistance.

(3) Chairman Chiang put forward the argument that the enemy is bound to be defeated and listed many facts as supporting evidence, which is precise and accurate: First, the enemy's invasion war violates the steps of its continental policy; second, the enemy's understanding of our country and the world is incorrect; third, it violates three military principles and commits three military taboos; fourth, its political strategies adopted towards our country and various countries in the world are wrong; fifth, the enemy completely ignores the great strength of our nation and the fierce trend of the times. In short, the mad enemy not only failed to recognize its opponent clearly, but also failed to recognize the nature of the times. Evaluating the new China of the 20th century with the perspective of the Yuan and Qing dynasties is its biggest fatal wound. The enemy has committed the above-mentioned errors, which means that it has created deep weaknesses in the war. In the process of promoting the War of Resistance, we must closely grasp these weaknesses and expand and deepen them, so as to hasten the arrival of the enemy's defeat. For example, on our side, we should expand the propaganda of the War of Resistance and strengthen our strength in the War of Resistance; in the diplomatic field, we should closely and effectively connect with our allied countries to create a great force to resist the world's aggressive groups. This can not only increase our strength, but also isolate the enemy and its accomplices. In this era, there are few countries that are warmongering, aggressive, and reckless, and there are always many more countries that love true peace and uphold justice, that is to say, the strength of the latter is always much greater than that of the former. Therefore, if we effectively connect with truly peace-loving countries and urge them to fully express their great potential and closely link them together, the aggressors will be completely isolated and their power weakened. However, the initiation and connection of this kind of true peaceful force should have different priorities and distinctions in its methods, and must first start with the countries that love peace most deeply and uphold justice most actively, and then proceed in order. As for the standard for judging the degree of love of peace and upholding justice, it is not difficult, and can be determined by the degree of closeness of the relationship between each country and our country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions said: "Unite with all ethnic groups who treat us equally and struggle together," which indicates the best guideline for determining the order of priority and intimacy.

(4) However, among the basic arguments for Chairman Chiang's belief in the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance, the most important is how to ensure the basic conditions for the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance. What exactly is this basic condition? There is nothing else, that is, "do not give the enemy any opportunity to exploit," in other words, we must not waver in our will, we must not willingly surrender, and we must not seek compromise halfway. The ultimate goal of our all-out War of Resistance is not to seek temporary peace or a compromise solution, but to complete the national revolution and establish a new China with equality and freedom, so we must seek a fundamental solution and strive for final victory. Judging from the current situation, if Japanese imperialism exists, the disaster of the Chinese nation cannot be eliminated. It has reached the stage of either the enemy or us. The enemy is already full of sores and diseases that have penetrated deep into the bone marrow. It is urgently trying to find ways to get rid of its irremediable predicament and remedy its irreparable weaknesses. We must hold on to this critical moment and push it onto the road to defeat and demise. As Chairman Chiang indicated: "If we can persist in the War of Resistance, we will surely achieve victory. If we cannot resist resolutely and compromise with the enemy, and conclude any peace treaty, then the enemy can, based on the position it enjoys in the treaty of surrender, endlessly penetrate deeper. When it comes to this point... all of China, no matter where, no matter who, will be subject to the enemy's domination and trampling, and there will be no reason to expect to be spared... This is no different from sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants for generations to come, and instead delaying the enemy's demise." How we should grit our teeth on this difficult step, grasp this basic condition, and ensure the arrival of the inevitable victory in the War of Resistance is the most important issue at present.

### Opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee Full Text of President Chiang's Address (Continued from yesterday's Third Edition)

Since the Japanese government and its Prime Minister Konoe have successively issued statements, this conspiracy to swallow China in order to dominate the Pacific and invade the world is known to all, and need not be repeated. What I want to make clear to all comrades now is that Japan has already failed, and there are various reasons to prove that it will eventually suffer the greatest defeat. As long as we continue to fight, we have the certainty of victory. First, let's look at the Japanese side. Not to mention that in the past eighteen months, they have suffered more than 700,000 casualties in the north and south battlefields of China, and spent 900 million yuan in war expenses, leading to exhaustion of resources in their country, stagnation of agriculture and industry, social degradation, and political unrest. These are all tangible signs. Even judging from their launch of the invasion to the present, the application of all their military and political strategies, as well as their observations and estimates of China and their understanding of the times, they have actually violated principles and fallen into errors at every step. At this juncture of success or failure, gain or loss, survival or extinction, I want to list the examples of Japan's inevitable failure for the plenary session based on genuine facts, and present a detailed analysis report to all comrades.

First, everyone knows that Japan launched this invasion to implement its continental policy. According to their internally determined secret traditional policy and their publicly announced Tanaka Memorial, they must first occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, and then attempt to invade the entire China, and even dominate Asia and unify the globe. However, before they had stabilized their occupation of Northeast China, they wanted to invade North China. After their power reached North China, they changed from gradual erosion to rapid annexation, and then openly occupied our Beiping and Tianjin. This is already completely contrary to their established national policy and strategy of the so-called continental policy. Not only that, but they also want to advance to Central China and even invade Guangzhou. This is a further step for them to destroy their own traditional policy. After entering Central and Southern China, they not only fell into a strategically untenable position, but also, politically, forced them to face the world powers and put Japan in a desperate situation on all sides. This is the first reason for their inevitable defeat.

Second, their initial attempt to subdue us without a fight, but we finally fought without surrendering, which has already exceeded their expectations. After the war began, they wanted a quick victory, but from Shanghai, Songhu, Zhekou, Nanjing, all the way to the battle of southern Shandong, as well as the battles around Poyang Lake and the Dabie Mountains, they went deeper and deeper, and finally failed to achieve a quick victory. Then they turned around and longed for a quick peace. Before we withdrew from Wuhan, their magazines and newspapers tried their best to advocate the cessation of hostilities or to find ways to stop the war, while using various cunning schemes to try to lure us into the trap, deceive the world, and gain advantages. But soon, they revealed their true intentions and took out their so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which was eventually deceived and subdued by Japan, and was not the destruction of our entire nation. Now the Japanese are妄想妄想under the slogan of "establishing a new order in East Asia," to realize their dream of統制 of China in the short term. They never want to think that they have invaded our Northeast, spent more than forty years of time, (Turn to the third edition)

### Growing Up in the Storm

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Lin Heng

Special Feature on the Establishment of the Huiyang County Team Department of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers

"The expression of work," the spirit of struggle, naturally people will recognize it. The youth of Huizhou are highly hoping that you will continue the organization of the Huiyang Anti-Japanese Pioneers!

"...

"Finally, please forgive me for not signing my name here—let's talk again. With best regards! And respect to the comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers!"

After reading the letter, the meeting place was so quiet that only people's urgent breathing could be heard. It was clear that they were indignant and wanted to hate. "Comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, unite, carry forward the spirit of friendship of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and the style of hard struggle..." Everyone shouted with He Jun, and this slogan was very effective. Everyone's face showed an expression of energy, and some people began to smile.

(II)

In the lively, united, tense, and joyful today, they remember the small waves of yesterday.

After several days of regular symposiums, a total of forty-two young people participated in the symposium and all joined the Huiyang County Team Department of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. On the day before the opening of the establishment meeting, they were still discussing political philosophy issues. Suddenly, someone suggested that the youth of Huiyang should establish another organization instead of joining the Anti-Japanese Pioneers. Then many people echoed, and you came with a few sentences and I said a few words, and the order of the meeting was chaotic. After a while, someone suggested canceling the Huiyang County Team Department of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers and establishing the Huiyang Youth Anti-Japanese Federation. It was very obvious that anyone could see that someone was sabotaging the arrangement.

The meeting was chaotic and debated for half an hour. The搗搗份子充分demonstrated shamelessness. Yesterday they were still shouting "We want to fight for the Anti-Japanese Pioneers to the end" "Consolidate and expand the organization of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers" but today they are destroying it with a cold and sarcastic attitude.

Just when the trouble was at its most important, their district team leader Lin Deputy Team Leader appeared next to the long table in the hall. Mr. Lin stood, and immediately all the people's eyes were concentrated on his face.

"Comrades," Mr. Lin began to speak, "The occurrence of this matter today, it is very obvious that we can see that someone is arranging to destroy the organization of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers Huiyang County Team Department, which we expected in advance." He explained for a while and then went on to say: "Okay! Since someone has forgotten that they were still shouting "We want to fight for the expansion and consolidation of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers" yesterday, then let him deceive himself. Let's give him a chance and allow them to sign up to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers immediately..."

The atmosphere in the meeting became more tense. Those who wanted to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers stood up and signed up one after another. Some explained that their family environment did not allow them to temporarily join the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and at the same time, a woman requested to participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers team.

"...The Anti-Japanese Pioneers cadre training class will continue as usual. We welcome comrades who are not Anti-Japanese Pioneers to attend the lectures... For comrades who are forced to withdraw from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers due to environmental reasons, we hope that they will participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers only after overcoming their difficulties... Now the meeting is adjourned, but please stay, comrades of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers." Mr. Lin made such an announcement to them again. Twelve people left the meeting place, and as soon as they stepped out of the library, a mastermind was blaming the others, saying: "Why didn't you arrange for everyone to withdraw?"

The meeting place upstairs was焕然一新了. There was no more chaos. They started a new symposium. First, they analyzed the cause of today's microwave and its possible impact. According to a report from one of the young people, this morning the Huiyang Youth convened a symposium at No. 1 Middle School in the county. Someone in the meeting threatened them, saying that joining the Anti-Japanese Pioneers would be transferred and sent away from their hometowns at any time, saying that local people should not be led by provincial youth, and some people said bad things about the Anti-Japanese Pioneers, and some people even went to the homes of new comrades to spread rumors, explaining the 활泼활泼 spirit of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers as romance, and told their parents not to let their children participate in the Anti-Japanese Pioneers team... This fact proves even more proves that someone is sabotaging the Anti-Japanese Pioneers. "The first basic condition for a member of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team is to have political firmness. Those wavering elements and opportunists who withdrew from the Anti-Japanese Pioneers today cannot stay in the ranks of the Anti-Japanese Pioneers for long. It is beneficial to the Anti-Japanese Pioneers that they withdraw today instead of in the future, making the Anti-Japanese Pioneers more pure." The chairman's conclusion ended the analysis of the microwave. Finally, they discussed the future training and work issues. Ms. Gao suggested increasing the training time to "four hours a day." Mr. Li requested to increase the courses on mass movements, the Chinese revolution, and other courses. There is no doubt that the content of the training is more enriched, which means that "This newborn child has rich nourishment, and his future must be very bright." The reporter thought so.

(III)

There were still twenty minutes before class time, and the team members were all there. Some sang "Fight to the Enemy's Rear," which they had just learned yesterday, and some sang "Sending Out the Brave Warriors Song" in a low voice. Liao Jun was so excited that he was not shy and opened his "bean paste throat" to sing his latest masterpiece - the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Song. Some team members were chatting and laughing coldly. The Three Two "bookworms" secretly took their books and newspapers and went to the room to eat their去了, and the work was disturbed, he had to stop writing and leave the articles and scripts of the new comrades for modification next time.

"It's time for class," the duty officer announced to everyone. In a short while, the team members sat down in rows, and the whole atmosphere changed. Taking out their notebooks, they recorded seriously and nervously, guerrilla tactics, protracted war, dialectics, summary of the anti-Japanese war in seventeen months, report on Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the nation... These new knowledge enhanced the learning interest of the youth of Huizhou, making each of them feel happy, living a life that has never been so rich.

They approved the seven candidate team members who recently joined the organization to become official team members. They also decided to improve the status of team members in the family, and all the members visited the home of each team member to商正在籌備成立的 青抗聯會, they passed the proposal not to hate but to actively support the establishment and consolidation of its organization, and finally decided to visit the authorities, who convened the Huiyang Youth Anti-Wang Support Fifth Plenary Session.

I remember that it was the two days when they set off to work in other counties. The time of departure had arrived, but the rain was still following the north wind, hitting the hats, faces, and clothes of the戰士們, and the accumulated water on the hats and险ไหลไหลล down from above again. Some people were shivering, but no one complained, and no one was willing to fall behind as a "turtle". Standing up straight, holding their breath, and singing the Guerrilla Song, they advanced one step and two steps. Suddenly, a part of the team stopped and waved to the soldiers who were continuing to walk, singing aloud: "Farewell comrades, farewell comrades, to Boluo, work actively and work hard, comrades, comrades,"

On the nineteenth day of the first month in Huizhou City

Original Text of President Chiang's Speech Continued from Second Page

[The enemy] has used a large amount of troops and spent a lot of money, but still cannot control our Northeast, let alone govern it. He still does not realize this obvious lesson, but instead wants to intensify his efforts to annex all of China, recklessly following the same path to failure. This is because he fundamentally does not understand our Chinese nation, does not understand the power of our Three Principles of the People, does not recognize the characteristics of our National Government, and does not recognize today's era, as well as the revolutionary strategy and tactics of China today. Frankly speaking, during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the strategy and tactics of full-scale attack and protracted resistance had not yet been invented. Napoleon, with such great talent and such a large army, could not avoid defeat. How much more so today, when we are a republic, the national spirit is widespread, and the entire nation is united against the enemy. Under the command of the National Government, we are implementing modern revolutionary strategies and tactics. No military force can succeed by chance. Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" has the three major principles of "Knowing that the enemy cannot be attacked, knowing that our troops cannot be attacked, and knowing that the terrain cannot be fought." I would like to add a principle to Sun Tzu: "Knowing that the enemy can be attacked, knowing that our troops can be attacked, and knowing that the terrain can be attacked, but not knowing that the era cannot be attacked, then there is no way to win." The × people do not understand the situation of the other side, especially do not recognize the era, which is obvious without further explanation. Based on the five points mentioned above, it can be concluded that the × people are bound to fail. Now that × and I are in a stalemate, the situation of victory and defeat is different. The × people's inevitable defeat proves that I have a way to win. In terms of military affairs alone, during the first phase of the war, we fought in areas with convenient transportation. His army, navy, and air force, as well as mechanized units, could move in and out freely. Now, fighting in the war zone that we are violating, after eighteen months, he has not only failed to defeat us, but we have become more and more refined, stronger and stronger. In the second phase of the war, we entered battlefields with complex terrain, mountainous and boundless deserts, and extremely inconvenient transportation and supplies. His skills are, of course, even more difficult to use. Moreover, he has already used more than 85% of his national military force. Everyone knows that the × country's military equipment was originally prepared with 30% for use in China and the other 70% for use against Russia. Today, in our country, he has not only used more than twice the troops he had anticipated, but the number of casualties in China has reached more than 35% of his total military force. As for the detailed numbers of the × army, I will explain them in detail to all comrades when the military report is given. Everyone sees that the × army's use of troops and casualties have reached this level, which proves that his path to defeat has been determined. Moreover, if we compare the battlefields later, one of our bullets can be used as at least three bullets, and one of our soldiers can be used as at least three × soldiers. On the other hand, the × people are the opposite. From our experience in the past year and a half, the × people must use at least three people for one of our soldiers and three bullets for one of our bullets, and perhaps even more.

Therefore, today's problem is that as long as our country does not give × an opportunity to take advantage of, final victory is guaranteed. What is giving × an opportunity? If our spirit is threatened by him, our will is shaken, we willingly surrender, and we hastily seek compromise, that is what the × people desire most. Only in this way can the × people explain their irreparable predicament, make up for their irreparable weaknesses, and our country and nation will be forever mired in misery. In short, if we can persist in resistance, we will surely achieve victory. If we cannot resolutely resist and compromise with × and conclude some kind of peace treaty, then the × people can, based on their privileged position in the surrender treaty, continue to deepen their encroachment without limit. At this point, our China will stop breathing, block its ears and eyes, and endure all kinds of hardships and sacrifices under the smoke screen of the new terms created by the × country, such as the "New Order in East Asia," "Manchukuo-China cannot be separated," and "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." All of China, regardless of location or person, will be subjected to the slaughter and trampling of the × people, with no hope of survival. Once the spirit is coerced, the situation will immediately change, and once the humiliating treaty is signed, the status of master and slave will be established, which is tantamount to sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants for generations and delaying the demise of the × country.

After understanding the various examples I have listed above of the × people creating their own failures and committing their own sins, you comrades can know that if Japan can win this Sino-Japanese War, then all the world's strategies, tactics, and all military theories will have to be fundamentally overturned, and even the principles of all things can be proven useless. After understanding the meaning of the × people's various coercions and inducements to surrender today, you comrades can better understand what we should strive to uphold. To put it plainly, we must be determined and unyielding, that is to say, our spirit must never be coerced by the × people, and we must never be deceived by the × people. We must persist in the war of resistance to the end, not only preventing the × people's past goal of "quick war and quick victory" from being achieved, but also making their current cunning scheme of "quick settlement" fail completely. This is our only strategy today. This is the basis for the failure of the × people and the victory of our country. I solemnly tell you comrades that this is the conclusion I have reached after deeply considering the safety and security of the nation for eighteen months from the position of commander-in-chief entrusted with the heavy responsibility. I especially put it forward to contribute to all the comrades in our meeting.

You comrades should also make the compatriots throughout the country understand that we must take the history of the Song and Ming dynasties as a warning. We must know that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was not due to the superior power of the × people and foreign races, but entirely due to the wavering and timidity of the will and spirit of a small number of generals and officials in the government at that time, as well as the social gentry, and even the people of the whole country, who were affected by them, leading to the collapse of the overall situation beyond repair. Today, we have such a good national spirit, such a deep revolutionary foundation, and the Three Principles of the People of our party, which are suitable for the times. As long as we do not abandon ourselves, no force can destroy our country. The situation today is very clearly placed before us, that is, the × people will inevitably become more ferocious and use their weapons and troops to make a desperate struggle. Our policy is very simple and clear. From the second Ming Resistance War, we must use our revolutionary strategy and tactics to fundamentally attack the wavering will and exhausted strength of the × people with a more courageous and resolute war of resistance to quickly promote the total collapse and final failure of the × people to complete the task of our revolution. I also tell our comrades that if we currently fantasize about compromise and hope for a lucky peace, we will only throw ourselves into the trap and bring about our own demise. It must be known that the so-called talks on adjusting national relations published by the former × Prime Minister Konoe on the 22nd of last month are actually documents of inducement to surrender and not conditions for peace talks. If we talk about peace based on this, frankly speaking, it is surrender. Our Chinese nation has ambition, integrity, and a future. Although the sacrifices have been great in the year and a half of the war of resistance, the strength is getting stronger and stronger. All of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor of the Chinese nation must be worthy of our ancestors and parents, worthy of future generations, worthy of ourselves, and worthy of the countless martyrs who sacrificed for the war of resistance. There is absolutely no one who is willing to surrender. Today, we only have to fight with all our strength and resist with the determination to die until the goal is achieved. We must know that surrender is seeking death in life, with no hope of survival. Fighting seeks life in death, and there is a way to survive.

Now, let me make a review of our own war of resistance in China.

I can say that not only do the × people have a way to fail, but our country has a way to win. Sun Tzu said, "First make yourself invincible, then wait for the enemy to be vincible." To achieve invincibility, of course, we must work hard and struggle with blood and sweat. But from the perspectives of history, geography, culture, economy, and national spirit, and from the past facts, our innate conditions really have a foundation that makes × inevitably invincible, as long as we cooperate with our man-made efforts. We can definitely defeat the × people without any doubt.

(A) Historically speaking, I have said that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was the defeat of a dynasty of one family, not the demise of our Chinese nation. Our Chinese nation has never been subdued by anyone in the past five thousand years. Not only has it not been destroyed by anyone, but the collapse of the dynasties of the Song and Ming dynasties was only due to a very small number of generals and officials who had no courage or integrity, only knew how to live in ease and comfort for themselves, and were selfish and self-interested, regardless of the misfortunes of the nation, resulting in the collapse of the entire dynasty for hundreds of years. But at that time, it was an autocratic monarchy, and the court and the people were separated into two factions. The pain was not very concerned, and the people's resistance could not be exerted for a while. In fact, at that time, the firm national spirit was not controlled by foreign races and always resisted the foreign invaders to the end. After the nation was generally aware and strengthened, although two or three hundred years had passed, it was finally able to eliminate the barbarians and restore the country. What's more, now is the era of the Republic of China, where the people are the masters. The current National Government is a revolutionary government.

(To be continued)

A New Era in Relations Between Kang and Tibet (III) Liu Zunqi (V) After returning to their native place, the kind monks of Da Jin are still monks of the Xikang Temple and should strictly abide by the rules of the Yellow Sect and abide by the law. If there is any arbitrary instigation that leads to disharmony between Kang and Tibet or incidents involving human life, as well as conflicts caused by local people due to grievances with the temple, the Sichuan and Kang officials should investigate the truth and punish them according to the law. Those who are related to destroying the reconciliation between the two sides can also notify Tibet based on friendly relations. If any Yi people or others harm the monks of Da Jin Temple for no reason, the monks are allowed to submit a request to the local government for strict punishment. (VI) When the kind monks of Da Jin Temple return, they must submit a written guarantee that they will never cause trouble. The headmen of the five tribes of Bairi Rizhi Adou Huoer and various temples who had previous grudges with the monks of Da Jin Temple must also submit a written guarantee that they will never seek revenge in order to quell disputes and eliminate hidden dangers. (VII) Da Jin Temple should appoint a Khenpo, who must be a person of great virtue. However, Niangxian must first notify the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters of the name and obtain their consent before the Khenpo is appointed by Xibi. In addition, the monks of the temple should jointly recommend a person of public trust to assist, but the name must first be reported for approval before deciding on the above Khenpo assistant, but both are only in charge of the temple's religious affairs. (VIII) The losses suffered by Da Jin Temple in burning down the Dengke County Government, killing officers and soldiers, and innocent people should be compensated by the monks of Da Jin under the order of Tibet to pay 25 taels of gold to repair the county government and compensate the officers and soldiers because the two sides have reconciled. (Note) Four copies of this agreement and regulations are written, one for each representative of both parties, and the remaining two copies are submitted to the superiors for record. This agreement is mainly in Chinese and is approved by the superiors of both parties. The listed regulations are to be observed by officials and civilians alike. Seal of Qiu Lisheng, Representative of the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters Seal of Deko, Representative of the Tibetan Kashag January 9, 24th year of the Republic of China, Deko

4.  Final Conclusion and its Significance The above eight regulations have great effect in two points. First, it began to show the attitude of the Tibetan side turning to compromise. Second, it specifically stipulated the legal status of the Da Jin Temple Lama, but it omitted many practical key points, such as the most important thing, the guns possessed by the Da Jin Temple Lama (whose source is self-evident) were not limited in their ownership and number. Secondly, the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters compensated for the repair of the main hall of the Da Jin Temple, and the Da Jin Temple's compensation to the Gan merchants and the Dengke County Government were ambiguous, and there were no specific provisions, and so on. For this reason, although some monks of Da Jin Temple returned to the east bank of the Jinsha River in the past three or four years, the guns were not handed over, and many disputes still occurred from time to time. At the same time, the restoration of the main hall of the Da Jin Temple, because the current regulations only stipulate that the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters "make a wish" to raise donations, and no funds have been used for construction, the emotions are still as tense as before. After the start of the War of Resistance, the attitude of the front has further changed, and its understanding of the central government and the Sichuan and Kang authorities is also very different. It has adopted a completely supportive attitude, and the influence of British politics cannot be ignored. The Xikang authorities must also consider the overall situation and do their best to seek stability in the rear. Therefore, the two sides are getting closer and closer, and they have expressed sincerity and tolerance in thoroughly resolving the Da Jin City case. Therefore, since last year, the Sichuan and Kang Border Defense Headquarters has appointed Zhang Zhenzhong, deputy brigade commander of Liu Wenhui, and Fan Changyuan, magistrate of Dego, as representatives. The Tibetan side appointed Wang Qing Daiben and Secretary Wang Tingxuan as representatives, and in Dego, based on the eight articles of the previous regulations for the placement of kind monks of Da Jin Temple, they specifically and thoroughly negotiated a solution, which was officially signed on January 2 this year. Because the signed documents must be delivered by "Ula" (that is, the labor of applying cattle), they cannot be delivered to the Kang Provincial Government in one or two months, so the full text cannot be found for disclosure. However, the main points are stipulated as follows: (1) Da Jin Temple should compensate Gan and Shanxi merchants for the loss of goods and lives by 720 taels (each tael is equivalent to 160 silver dollars, which is equal to 80 legal currency). However, Da Jin Temple only needs to pay 320 taels. Liu Wenhui recognizes 190 taels, and Changdu Zhesa Lama and Zhesa Suocan each lose 190 taels. Then, 20 taels will be exempted by Gan Jia merchants. (2) The destroyed Dengke County Government should be repaired with 100 taels. Among them, Da Jin Temple compensated 25 taels to the public, and the public returned the house owner A Du Tusi of the county government. Da Jin Temple directly compensated 25 taels to the county government. Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Zhenzhong donated 15 taels, Tibetan representative Wang Qing Daiben donated 10 taels, Dego County Magistrate Fan Changyuan donated 1 tael, and Dego Tusi donated 15 taels, totaling 100 taels, all paid to Dengke A Du. (3) The regulations for compensation for casualties stipulate that Da Jin Temple should pay 25 yuan for medical expenses for each of the three wounded Han merchants and 15 taels for the four deaths. (4) For the construction and repair of the main hall of Da Jin Temple, the Garze County Government will appoint 150 migrant workers for one month. Within this month, Da Jin Temple will pay each worker 10 Tibetan silver dollars. After one month, Da Jin Temple will directly recruit and hire workers for construction and repair. (5) Regarding the issue of weapons, all the guns issued to Da Jin Temple by Lhasa will be recovered by Lhasa. However, 30 guns will be retained for the use of Da Jin Temple, as self-defense guns, and a passport will be obtained from the government. Usually, the gun body is stored in the temple, and the handle and ammunition are stored in the county government and issued when necessary. On the evening of the establishment of the above regulations, the representatives of Kang and Tibet and the officials and lamas in Dego gathered together to celebrate. When the telegram arrived in Kangding, the provincial government was about to be established. The whole city was overjoyed and regarded it as a new era in relations between Kang and Tibet. Today, when the War of Resistance is the most difficult, when the × people are using all their strength and means to divide the various components of our country and sow discord in the unity of our entire nation, Tibet, which has been regarded as "outside of civilization" by historians for decades or even two thousand years, has shown unprecedented enthusiasm and thoroughly resolved the most troublesome problem in Kang and Tibet, the Da Jin Temple case. It cannot be said that it is a great success in the middle of the War of Resistance. On the other hand, it is a blow to the conspiracy of the × people to sow discord. … What a joyful thing this is! We only hope that our brothers in Xikang can go further and further on the road and fully cooperate with the overall policy of the War of Resistance and national construction in politics and military affairs and strive for progress. At the same time, the Xikang authorities must also do well on this new foundation, be selfless, and seek the thorough unity and cooperation of the Han and Tibetan peoples and consolidate our southwestern half of the national defense like steel.

The European Situation is Tense: Rumors of Germany and Italy Preparing to Launch War; French Prime Minister Calls Defense Meeting 【Associated Press, Washington, 25th】According to an article by Scripps Howard News Service's international editor, Simms, confidential sources in London and Paris believe that Germany and Italy are prepared to launch war simultaneously in early March. Germany will move against Romania because King Carol is unwilling to compromise with Germany. At the same time, Italy will demand from France, at a minimum, autonomy for the 95,000 Italians in Tunisia, the transformation of Gibraltar into a free port, the demilitarization of Corsica, and a share in the management of the Suez Canal. It is also reported that Germany plans to seek an understanding with Britain: if war breaks out between France and Italy and Britain does not participate, Germany will remain neutral.

【Associated Press, London, 25th】According to some diplomatic figures, well-informed sources in London and Paris firmly believe that a second major crisis in Europe will occur within a month. Hitler is scheduled to speak to the Reichstag on the 30th, at which time he may reveal the timing, scope, and manner of the crisis. Both London and Paris feel that if the Spanish government forces fail, it will be difficult to get Italian troops to withdraw from Spain. Some say the Italian troops may withdraw a few thousand, but German troops will seize the opportunity to enter. Public opinion in France is becoming increasingly hardened, believing that Mussolini's actions should not be conceded.

【Reuters, Berlin, 25th】The German Reichstag will meet at 8:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on January 30.

【Associated Press, Berlin, 25th】Representatives from Austria and the Sudetenland will attend the January 30 meeting of the German Reichstag, the first time since the Nazi Party seized power. Hitler will give a speech at the meeting, widely believed to review the tense relations between the United States and Germany, and will also mention U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes and Senator Pittman. Otherwise, the content of his speech will focus on foreign policy, especially issues related to Southeastern Europe and strengthening the German-Italian axis.

【Reuters, Paris, 25th】French Prime Minister Daladier convened the National Defense Committee today. The country's Ministers of the Navy and Air Force and the Chiefs of Staff of the various military branches attended.

Reuters, London, 25th] When the British House of Commons reconvenes on the 31st, it will debate the situation in Spain and the international situation. Other scheduled discussions have been postponed.

Italian Prime Minister to Launch Another Four-Power Conference

Haitong News Agency, London, 26th] This morning, it was widely rumored here that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will launch a four-power conference as soon as Barcelona falls. However, this news has not been confirmed or denied by well-informed sources. According to some opinions, this rumor originated from the Italian Prime Minister expressing his intention to clean up various unresolved Mediterranean issues when the British Prime Minister returned a visit to Rome, and believing that the four-power conference is the best method. It is said that the issues to be discussed at the future conference will include Italy's demands on France, namely the Tunisian issue. According to political circles, the declarations made by England and Germany at the Munich Conference, the declaration by France and Germany in Paris, and the Anglo-American agreement are all aimed at resolving international issues, so convening a conference at this time can be considered the most opportune time. The Daily Mail also received a report from a Rome reporter stating that Mussolini is determined to launch a four-power conference and proposes to put three issues related to the future of Spain on the agenda, namely (1) methods to avoid another civil war in Spain, (2) strengthening Spain's freedom with the assistance of Germany and Italy, in accordance with the will of the Spanish people, (3) guaranteeing that the four powers prevent the establishment of a communist or Popular Front government in Madrid or Catalonia. Furthermore, political circles here are not paying much attention to France's calling up of the 1918 reserve team and the rescheduling of French Chief of Staff Gamelin's visit to Morocco, as it is expected that there will not be any serious problems between France and Italy.

Central News Agency, Rome, 25th] An official communiqué has been issued stating that the government has decided to call up a batch of reserve soldiers born in 1901, totaling 60,000, to enlist for training on the first day of next month.

Reuters, Paris, 25th] "Le Temps," which has close ties to the French government, published an article yesterday that is quite noteworthy. The article stated that if the rebels achieve a decisive victory in Spain and foreign troops remain stationed in the country, France's unavoidable obligation is to acquire a counterbalancing position for itself. Places such as Minorca and Spanish Morocco could be occupied in one fell swoop. France could use troops from French Morocco, in the name of the Sultan, to occupy Spanish Morocco. In addition, former French Prime Minister Léon Blum published an article in "Le Populaire," stating that he is paying close attention to the situation in Germany. According to Léon, activities will inevitably occur within Germany and Italy in the near future. Léon said that the two dictators, now encountering such domestic problems, are paying attention to foreign affairs and intensifying preparations to increase the danger of war. This is the biggest mistake.

Barcelona Falls: Rebel Troops Enter Yesterday Afternoon; Refugees Flee to France

Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 26th] Officials here announced that Spanish rebel troops entered Barcelona at noon on the 26th.

Associated Press, Lleida, 25th] Currently, two-thirds of the city of Barcelona has been surrounded by rebel troops. Although it is hoped that the rebels will not enter the city until it is completely surrounded, it can be attacked at any time.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] According to reliable sources, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government has been consulting with French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris since last week to organize refugee camps on the French border of the Pyrenees that can accommodate 150,000 people. It is said that the French government advocates only allowing women, children, and the elderly to cross the border as refugees. The Times also reported that those fleeing from Catalonia to France are being closely monitored because the fall of Barcelona will have a major impact on the Spanish civil war and the European situation.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 20th] Military reports from Barcelona have not been received here last night, for the first time since the war began. It is unclear whether the Spanish government has stopped issuing military reports or whether news from the city has been cut off. A report received at midnight stated that the city is in utter chaos, and the remaining residents are hiding in air-raid shelters to avoid enemy aircraft constantly circling overhead. Since this week, about 200,000 people have fled from the city to northern Catalonia, and the sound of artillery fire is clearly audible in the southwest.

Reuters, Cerbère, 25th] According to reports from Spanish rebels, government troops in the Pyrenees near Urgell have been isolated due to the rebel occupation of Solsona. It is also said that this will guarantee the final collapse of the government army's Pyrenees Catalonia position. At the moment, General Yagüe's Moroccan troops are waiting on the Zumonzhi heights outside Barcelona, while the Navarre troops are advancing along the Llobregat River through Manresa and Terrassa. Franco's strategy is the same as the one he adopted in Bilbao, that is, to carry out a large-scale encirclement first and then attack the city in order to avoid street fighting.

Reuters, Perpignan, 25th] A train that left Barcelona today has arrived at the French border with more than 200 women and children, who have not eaten for two days. Another train wanted to leave the city, but the tracks had been bombed and had to return to the city. When the refugees were waiting for the train at the station, four Savoia-type rebel bombers soared in the sky. The refugees, who had been hungry for many days, were exhausted and fled to the dark streets when they heard the sound of the planes. Rebel planes were very active, circling over various highways and railways, bombing vehicles and strafing them with machine guns. It is said that many soldiers escaped into the various French coasts by fishing boats and were disarmed by the French gendarmes.

Reuters, London, 25th] The British Minister to Barcelona and the remaining staff of the embassy boarded the cruiser HMS Devonshire today. The ship will not leave for the time being to await developments. The destroyer HMS Greyhound, which carried the families of the British Embassy to Marseille yesterday, has returned here. The British Consul General in Barcelona will also not leave for the time being.

Reuters, Paris, 26th] According to dispatches from Burgos, thousands of trucks loaded with food are now waiting near Barcelona, ready to enter the city with Franco's troops. It is said that entry into the city will be restricted to prevent refugees from other provinces from entering the city, and only those with special passes will be allowed to enter. Only those with relatives in the area will be allowed to stay. The refugees will be sent back to their original provinces as soon as possible. The civilian guards will patrol the city, and the people will resume work as soon as possible after the rebels enter the city. The banks will open immediately, the hospitals will be expanded, and the members of the city council have been appointed and announced in the newspapers and will hold a meeting as soon as possible.

Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Regarding the matter of abolishing the U.S. arms embargo on the Spanish Republic, after former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, 35 state ministers of Christianity jointly wrote to President Roosevelt to support it, stating that the embargo should be stopped immediately. If hesitation continues, not only will the Spanish Republic and other democratic countries be harmed, but the interests related to our lives and the peace of the world will also be affected.

"You Cannot Live if You Commit Evil"

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] Yesterday morning, a Spanish national bomber suddenly encountered a violent hurricane near Arles, France, on the French border of the Pyrenees and crashed. Two military officers and three staff members on board were killed. When the accident occurred, three people tried to parachute, but could not open due to the strong winds. The plane was a German-made Kurl III-style aircraft equipped with two machine guns.

Representatives of Charity Organizations in Shanghai, Yu Bin, Ordered to Go to the United States; Speech in Paris: China Determined to Fight to the End

Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] Yu Bin, Bishop of the Nanjing District of China, as a commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, a representative of various charity organizations in Shanghai, and Chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, was ordered to go to the Americas. He passed through Rome and paid respects to Pope Pius XI. Upon arriving in Paris, he immediately issued a statement to the press, stating that the time for the Catholic Church to develop in China has come. China is determined to fight to the end for independence and territorial integrity. When I paid respects to the Pope in Rome, I presented a public letter from our government regarding the innocent Chinese women and children who have been subjected to the poison of new weapons. The Catholic clergy sincerely and earnestly provide relief and express their gratitude. The Pope was very moved after reading it and immediately offered special blessings to me and the people in the Americas who have contributed to the relief efforts and bestowed commemorative medals with great kindness, which is truly inspiring. Bishop Yu Bin also described the suffering that China has experienced and the bombing of various undefended cities by aircraft, saying that millions of Chinese have died and no less than 300,000 are homeless. When Yu Bin was asked about the hope for peace, he replied that the word "peace" was proposed by the aggressors in order to control China under the pretext of peace. China will not accept peace unless it is fair and lasting. Finally, he said that the Catholic Church has a major mission in China. The Chinese government and the church trust each other, because the Catholic Church in China is the Chinese church, and in France, it is the French church. In short, it serves the country where it is located and has no foreign influence. The benefits that the Chinese people have received from the Catholic Church are incomparable. If he, at the age of 62, is determined to lead the Red Cross and serve at the front, he is a Belgian priest who has naturalized in China (that is, Father Leiminghuan). The Benedictine priest from Belgium is the army priest of the Red Cross relief team. The French Jesuit priest Jiajiju, who organized the refugee area, is admirable. The Catholic Church is suitable everywhere, and the future is very optimistic.

German Staff Officer Praises the Soviet Army: Estimates About 9,000 Soviet Aircraft; German Team to Visit Russia for Trade

Reuters, Berlin, 26th] The Nazi Party newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" published an article by Colonel Zeiss, a member of the German General Staff, praising the Soviet Army. In his article, he stated that although the Red Army has lost its special strength due to the transfer of senior officers, it is a big mistake to not take into account the Red Army's continuous expansion, which increases its combat power. Judging from the precedents of the last war and the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Soviet soldiers' bravery, hard work, and perseverance are beyond doubt. Every soldier knows how to exert his combat effectiveness under good command. Zeiss estimated that the Soviet air force has about 9,000 aircraft and reserve aircraft. However, not all of these aircraft are the latest models. According to reliable business sources, Germany is forming a business inspection team that will soon go to Russia. The task of this team is to negotiate the acquisition of raw materials from Russia in exchange for German manufactured goods. The number of permanent commercial representatives from the Soviet Union in Berlin has decreased from 230 to 30 in the past few years and may increase again.

Grass Court Tennis Championships: Decision to Hold Starting March 6
The number of participants is limited
[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Hong Kong has four open tennis championships every year, organized by various tennis clubs in turn. There is the men's open singles and doubles hard court tournament, which is organized by the Navy Civilian Joint Entertainment Association; the mixed doubles tournament, which is organized by the Chinese Recreation Club; the women's singles and doubles tournament, which is organized by the Women's Sports Association; and the most important men's open grass court singles and doubles championship, which is organized by the Hong Kong Cricket Club next to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is also the origin of the Hong Kong Tennis Bronze Medal Tournament.

It is estimated that the Open Grass Court Tennis Championship has been determined to open in early March every year. It is reported that this year's organizers have recently decided to hold it starting March 6, but because of the recent gathering of talents in Hong Kong, there are concerns that too many participants will affect and prolong the time. Therefore, it was decided to add some restrictions this year. Although it still specifies that anyone who resides in Hong Kong and is a registered member of the Hong Kong Tennis Association is eligible to register, it has been decided that only 64 people will be accepted for the singles competition, and only 30 pairs will be allowed to participate in the doubles competition. The registration deadline is 6 pm on February 18. If the number of people exceeds the quota at that time, the organizers have the right to select the best.

It is estimated that this open tournament is scheduled before the Central Tournament, and all matches will be played in a best-of-three-sets format, while the semi-finals and finals will be played in a best-of-five-sets format. Anyone who wishes to participate should register with the Hong Kong Cricket Club as soon as possible. (Flying Alive)

Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (3)
Translated by: Court Old Partner
The next day, I watched the performance of the two in detail as she said. As a result, Wales won two sets, but there was only one dead ball victory. I reported this to Miss Brown. She listened and said, "Do you understand now? The method you used yesterday is a technique that even the army is difficult for her to develop. From now on, when you return to your hometown, practice the forehand and backhand strokes. When you have learned it, you will naturally be an excellent tennis player."

After returning to my hometown, I worshiped Miss Qilianna Danneng as a teacher. I made great progress in the second year and jumped to become the seventh person in the United States. However, the pommeling technique is not easy to learn. It took me an unknown amount of time, patience, and hard work to learn it. I have sacrificed temporary victories many times to learn the pommeling technique. Therefore, I think that if you want to learn a new technique, you should always use it. Even if you are about to lose in a competition due to not being proficient, you should not use the old method again. You must practice the new method hard until it is successful, because the new method can only be practiced in fierce competitions.

I now firmly believe that the bottom-line smashing technique is outdated. Now is the time to discuss the competition method, the aerial interception method, and the high-pressure method on a good court, and to become a full-court smashing technique. The progress of women's tennis and the ability to obtain independent power are as powerful as women's participation in commerce, politics, medicine, art, science, and even aviation and radio knowledge. The Polish champion, Chedefa Zusga, who is also the women's runner-up at Wimbledon and Linsan, once said to me, "After I return to Poland next time, I will focus on practicing your American women's railing and high-pressure techniques."

I believe that there is no definite right way to play tennis, and I have also realized that there is no definite way to hold the racket. I believe that I have found a shortcut to success, and my teacher has also used this shortcut to teach a Bobby Riggs to make him jump to the position of star.

The method is like this: when I make a forehand hit, I use the Eastern grip method, because in this way, we can not only get the same quick power as the Western grip method, but also get the stability of the Ormond grip method. At the time, I also felt that the posture of Van Ness, Boch, Pan Lai, Jiede Zusga, and Miss Langde, who circled the racket in a semi-circle after hitting the ball, was a good propulsive force. If you add some outward rotation force when hitting the ball, you can completely control the ball under your control.

I hope that there is no one who does not want to have the forehand smashing power of Zidezhi Zusga, but few people have such strong power. If you retreat and ask for the next best thing, then I think that Van Ness's stop-hand hitting method is fast and appropriate, and it is the best hitting method I have ever seen. After my detailed investigation, I feel that when he hits the ball, his shoulders and feet form a 45-degree angle with the net, which is completely different from the side-body method of many experts. The ball is hit just in front of the left foot. As for the residual force of the racket, it is first pushed out to the net, and then slightly curved to the left. The degree of curvature never crosses the body, which is what we should all emulate, because the weakness of ordinary residual force after hitting the ball is that it crosses the body. (To be continued)

One of Hong Kong's Sports Undertakings:
Curnie's Gymnasium - Wang Xuezheng -
(8) The required equipment is very simple and easy to prepare. Moreover, most of the equipment can be replaced by furniture, etc.

(9) The degree of exercise can be adjusted at will, depending on the individual, so as not to suffer from the harm of over-exercise.

(10) Correct the wrong posture of the body and improve health and beauty.

(11) For ball games and other sports, special freehand exercises and equipment exercises can be performed according to the different needs of each person. For example, football players, basketball players, sprinters, long-distance runners, high jumpers, etc., each have specially designed physical training methods.

(12) Mass-oriented, suitable for both groups and individuals.

However, many people believe that this type of exercise can not only cause muscle stiffness (Muscle bound), making movements clumsy, and can also cause various heart diseases, making blood vessels hard, and even leading to death. Although this is a common fact, this is not a drawback of freehand exercises and equipment exercises themselves. The reasons for causing this drawback are nothing more than the following three: (1) Errors in methods, such as too many or too few exercises, too heavy equipment, incorrect posture, incomplete movements, incorrect breathing, etc.; (2) The exercise does not have a certain system, the exercise is too intense, and the muscles and internal organs cannot be developed evenly; (3) The exercise is intermittent, there is no fixed time.

If there are no above-mentioned errors, this type of exercise will never cause muscle stiffness and other drawbacks.

The effect of equipment exercise is really better than freehand exercise. If we engage in equipment exercise and want to achieve the greatest effect, we must do progressive and vigorous exercise. The most important thing is to follow a certain system from light to heavy.

In today's extraordinary times, the need for exercise is even more urgent, but the opportunity for exercise has been reduced due to the war. Although advocating freehand exercises and equipment exercises can solve this problem, there are many problems and difficulties in engaging in this type of exercise, especially vigorous equipment exercise, that are often not easy for us to solve individually, such as the perseverance, spirit, interest, time, equipment, location, clothing, bathing, appropriate guidance, number of exercises, correct posture, thorough movements, breathing methods, and systematic exercise procedures. In short, there are too many such problems to list.

Regarding this type of problem, opinions vary, and each says different things. In addition, everyone's physical fitness is different, and if you want to solve this problem, you must also "prescribe the right medicine." Just in terms of exercise methods, what is not suitable for A is not only suitable for B, but sometimes even harmful. Moreover, it is better to believe in a book than to have no book, and it is better to see with your own eyes than to hear with your ears. Therefore, without long-term and rich experience, it is not easy to solve this problem.

Professor Curnie has been engaged in physical education in our country for more than 20 years and has a deep understanding of the physical characteristics of the Chinese people. He has trained many strong young men and women, and he is also very willing to solve the above-mentioned problems and difficulties for us.

Curnie's Gymnasium was first established in Shanghai in 1930. The author's stomach disease was very serious at the time, and medical treatment was ineffective. Later, I joined the gymnasium. Under the guidance of Professor Curnie, it took only half a year, and not only my stomach disease, which had not been cured for many years, greatly improved, but also my physical strength and spirit improved rapidly. Also, the author's heart was very weak in the past. If I ran a little, I would feel dizzy and my heart would jump. Since joining Curnie's Gymnasium, my weight has increased greatly, my heart has become stronger and stronger, and my illnesses have also decreased. The author's physical foundation was established at this time, and the author's interest in this type of exercise can also be said to have been inspired by Professor Curnie.

This is all the author's personal experience, but from the above, it can be seen that Mr. Ke serves the crowd well.

Professor Curnie is not only experienced, but also has a deep research on this knowledge, combining medicine and sports into one. Also, Mr. Ke has extraordinary physical strength. No matter what his physical appearance, his arms are 17 inches thick and his chest is 47 inches wide. From this, it can be seen that his theory is completely derived from the results of experiments and is by no means an empty theory.

About four years ago, Mr. Ke came to Hong Kong from Shanghai and established the Hydro Therapetfe Instftue, making various efforts to benefit the crowd.

Mr. Ke has a relationship with the relationship between our country's war of resistance and the physical fitness of the people. He is very happy for the young men and women of our country to join the hospital and engage in various freehand and equipment exercises.

Although freehand etiquette exercises and equipment exercises are the most effective and simplest physical training methods, everyone can do it themselves, but before having a deep understanding of this type of exercise, we should first refer to various books and newspapers, and at the same time, ask for guidance from experienced and knowledgeable people.

Movies and Drama
Entertainment... First Love
Love Finds Andy Hardy

Every movie that portrays the Hardy family can give the audience a fresh interest. This type of movie is full of reality and can reasonably express a large number of interesting life experiences. The depiction is so realistic that the audience almost personally experiences everything in the movie and is moved by the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy in this family. Now this "First Love," the fourth Hardy movie, has a very deep and realistic depiction of the love psychology of young men and women. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is busy with love and shuttles between three women. One is the one he sincerely loves, one is the one his friend entrusted him to take care of, and the other is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who has given him a lot of help. At the same time, the family has encountered an unfortunate event. Andy's grandmother is seriously ill and her life is uncertain. His mother has to leave home to take care of her personally. In this situation, they are preparing to have a sad Christmas, but suddenly his mother comes back with good news and gives them a "happy" gift, and the family spends a carnival Christmas.

Mickey Rooney has worked particularly hard in this movie and has achieved better results than in previous movies. Louis Stone plays a serious and sincere elder and is the most outstanding character in this movie. In addition to the original cast, there is also a singing child star, Judy Garland, whose sincere and moving expressions and clear and melodious singing also occupy an important position in this movie.

Queen of Peace
Models' Paris Conference
Artists and Models Abroad

It is the first comedy in 1939 with excellent sound and color. Starring Jack Benny and Joan Feina, it has a lively and interesting theme, excellent and beautiful reports, and crazy and funny performances, giving the audience unlimited light and happiness. Undoubtedly, this movie is an entertaining work.

Jack Benny leads a large group of American models who are trapped in Paris but have no money. Later, he meets the daughter of an American oil tycoon in a cafe. She happens to be short of money, so he mistakenly thinks that she is also a girl wandering in a foreign country like him, so he invites her to join their group. This rich girl, who is used to living a noble life, agrees in order to find excitement and fun. So they live a life of wandering, eating without a fixed place, and making trouble everywhere. As a result, the lucky Jack Benny actually gets the love of this golden girl.

The cast in this movie is also quite complete, including the Yacht Four Brothers and a large group of excellent female actors. The costume performance in one scene is even more magnificent and gorgeous, and it is the most worthwhile performance in this movie.

Eastern - Blocking Spain
Blockade

It is a movie that depicts the activities of traitors during the war. However, on the one hand, it wants to expose the sins and cruelty of war. This is probably a point that the author pays special attention to.

Although there are no great war scenes inside, a few scenes are lively enough. The director uses very lively shots to reflect the remnants of war. In the blockade area, the people are dying.

Henry Fonda and Delin Carroll also perform well.

Dahua... Car Front Probe
Tip-off Girls

Although it is said to be a detective movie, the performance is not tight enough, and the director does not have skillful techniques to make it lively and vivid, so the results cannot be very good.

This movie is about a detective who joins the ranks of thieves to spy on secrets, thus capturing the bandits in one fell swoop and lovers finally getting married. This kind of clichéd story is not easy to please the audience if there are no exciting scenes. The main actors, such as Lao Ai Lun and Ellie Kara Sel, also have mediocre acting skills.

New World... True and False Wu Zetian
Cantonese Film

A commodity that wants to use fragrant and sensual flesh as a gimmick, it uses a stage celebrity with a naturally lewd personality as the central figure of the movie, and her private life of playing Wu Zetian on stage as the descriptive material. The strange and unbelievable content may cater to low-level tastes, but the so-called fragrant and sensual scenes are not dared to be thorough, only to disappoint the audience. Ordinary audiences are numb.

Free Talk: The Task of Writers in the Period of Active Anti-Japanese Price Quotation
Du Ai
1. Characteristics of the Current Situation
The War of Resistance has developed to a new stage. In this new stage, the task of the cultural movement is even more arduous and great. The Anti-Japanese War literature and art movement is an important organizational part of the entire cultural front. There is no doubt that it needs to stand at the new stage of the War of Resistance, strengthen its work practice, and expand its scope of work.

However, a cultural worker, especially a combatant in the literary and art movement, must first understand the general situation and characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance before engaging in the more intense and serious work of the new stage. Only by deeply understanding the complex content of the reality of the new stage of the War of Resistance and the basic trend of its development can the pen of the literary and art worker play a more critical, instructive, and promoting role.

2. Progress in the War of Resistance
However, what are the characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance? This is mainly reflected in two aspects. On the progressive side, we have summarized the past eighteen months of the War of Resistance, which has made us believe even more that the War of Resistance has not made "truth" rusty. On the contrary, the War of Resistance has made the light of truth shine more powerfully. Today, the increasing persistence of the War of Resistance and the increasing political progress have further silenced the "always trembling" lips of pessimists; at the same time, it has uncovered the blind eyes of gentlemen who "observe reality from a mechanical point of view." The convening of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China, the increase in international assistance, the purge of the traitor Wang Jingwei, and the holding of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang have given the War of Resistance a new start. It makes the "backward" parts of the country more likely to become "progressive" things. And this new situation more powerfully promotes the united front of the entire nation to gradually develop to a higher stage, making the "patriots" who doubt the protracted War of Resistance and the united front have to come to a new understanding. This is one side of the great reality (the main, basic, and decisive side).

3. Traitors' Conspiracy
The characteristic reflected in the other aspect is that the current new progressive situation can also make the backward parts more conservative; especially the Japanese imperialists and the corrupt elements of peace compromise within us are afraid of this progress. Therefore, they want to instigate traitors, Trotskyites, etc. to do their best to sow discord, hinder our progress, and undermine our war of resistance. This estimate is no longer a question of "possible or impossible," but has become a steel-like fact. The newspaper of × people's organization here and the newspapers of traitors here are singing in chorus every day to carry out their shameless tricks of sowing discord and spreading rumors. Therefore, although the entire War of Resistance is heading towards progress, it must also require us to be more vigilant. Due to the complex content of this realistic and drastic change, we have come to the following conclusion: the traitors' separatist movement should not be regarded as the end of the movement. On the contrary, this is the beginning of the separatist movement. The reason why the separatist movement has not ended and the conspiracy of surrender and compromise has not ended is because the traitors' ambitions have not stopped. Moreover, now is the time for × people to launch a large-scale military offensive against the Northwest and Southwest, so the "fearless" actions of the traitors dare to continue under the nationwide beating are not without reason.

4. Two Key Points of the Realistic Program
The above points are the general situation and characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance. However, under these situations and characteristics, we can come to the following conclusion: that the current reality itself contains two opposing factors in development. The new political situation, the new development of the national revolutionary war, and the new development of the national united front are strengthening its breadth and increasing its degree, but it is still facing many difficulties (the new offensive of × people, the activities of pro-Japanese traitors). But in the same way, we must clearly point out in the characteristics of this reality that today's progress in all aspects is the harvest of one and a half years of war of resistance and the solemn result of the development of national history. Although it continues to discover new difficulties in the process of movement, it also continues to increase its new strength. This new strength will surely break through everything, overcome everything, and move forward uninterruptedly. Therefore, in the new situation, it is bound to continue to develop to a higher stage. However, this favorable development cannot do without the following solid guarantee: that is, to strengthen the work practice of each individual.

In today's new stage, the fighters in the literary and art circles should pay special attention to the two key points in the so-called "realistic program," that is, literary and art workers should be more closely integrated with the anti-Japanese war practice of the new stage. Under this premise, from this point of view, to "describe the real state of reality development." The so-called "state" should be clearly regarded as the overall "trend" of the vivid and advancing reality development. Secondly, writers should stand firmly on the scientific worldview, and intensify their study of materialist dialectics, not regard materialist dialectics as a ready-made code, a dead dogma, or a rigid formula; but regard materialist dialectics as a living thing, and its principles are flexibly applied to concrete and vivid facts to improve the writer's ability to deal with problems and a clearer perspective on reality.

Random Jottings on a March
Li Huiying
"If it doesn't work, go to court. Are you afraid of him? A short guy, with triangular eyes and a fleshy lump bulging under his nose, was waving his fist and shouting loudly, as if he was a hero who feared nothing in the world.

"That's right, Huanggang County is not afraid of anyone inside and out. If you go to court, he won't get any benefit. Damn it!" This man was a burly fellow, with thick arms and great strength. He could knock over three or four characters with one hand.

In the middle of this, there was a more refined one, tapping his dry tobacco pipe, calmly suppressing the others:

"Don't panic, don't panic, speak slowly. There is nothing that can't be done. If you can settle it yourself, it's best to settle it yourself."

However, the other side was not convinced, and indignant words shot out from the slingshot like bullets:

"Go to court? Go ahead! Who's afraid of who? Don't scare people with big talk!"

The group of people was in high spirits, and it seemed that there would be no end in sight for a while.

At this time, the doubts of Gao and I were dispelled, and we guessed their history, and then we suppressed our own nervousness. In the village, that evil force still exists. Local bullies are rampant everywhere. They are making a living and building a family on this. They can provoke disputes and stand up for injustice. The final result, if it is more civilized, is to profit from it. If it is more barbaric, they will extort. The group in front of them is a mixture of everything, the bad guys who are rampant in the countryside. (To be continued)

A Few Military Police of Jian Ku
When Nanjing was retreating, it was really difficult to get on the train to Shanghai in Xuzhou. The top of the car, the windows, the handrails, and even Zhan's J Hook were full of refugees. The platform was still full of people waiting for the train. Some were probably already. I had bought a ticket and waited for many days.

It was impossible to squeeze onto the express train, and it was even more impossible to squeeze onto the refugee train. In despair, I saw a carriage outside the station that had not yet been hung up. I took the idea of ​​trying to take a look, so I walked along the railway tracks. When I walked closer, I could see the chalk writing on the carriage, and I regretted taking this trip again. No wonder no one squeezed here, it turned out to be a military police special car.

I took the child and prepared to walk back. At this time, there was a snap on the car window, and a head wearing a copper helmet poked out.

"What are you doing?"

"No, I came to see if there was an empty carriage. I have been waiting for the train for many days, and I can't squeeze up," I said and wanted to walk away:

"Where are you going?" Another iron copper helmeted head popped out and asked.

"I'm from Nanjing and want to go to Hankou." I suddenly thought that they wouldn't suspect that I was some kind of Han traitor to explore their whereabouts. This thought forced me to leave the carriage quickly.

"Is it just the four of you?"

"Yes, and two pieces of luggage."

"Okay, wait for me to ask the officer."

I couldn't walk away, but it was really not easy for me to stand there and wait for a few minutes. "Ask the officer" what does it mean? I was extremely uneasy. Not long after, the military police who went to ask poked their heads out again and asked:

"What do you do?"

"I used to work in a newspaper, and in recent years I have been teaching at ××. This time I escaped from my hometown."

"Okay, go and carry your luggage. We are also going to Hankou." Many people opened the door to greet me. Two military police jumped down and immediately carried my child into the car.

When I carried the luggage and sent it to the military police special car, my two children had become the center of the military police's joy. They scrambled to hug and kiss the children's rosy cheeks and used many candies to make the children laugh.

After taking off their steel helmets, I saw that they were all young people in their twenties. Some of them I saw were not even eighteen years old. They were lively, innocent, and sometimes childish, completely different from the shrewd and strong aura of being fully armed.

My doubts and uneasiness about them disappeared - slowly. I got along well with them, and slowly, I listened to their experiences, experiences, and ideas, and I couldn't help but admire them from the bottom of my heart.

Yes, according to dead knowledge and age, I may be able to be their big brother, but on the other hand, in terms of living knowledge and experience, they can be my teachers everywhere.

Several months of battlefield experience have tempered them like pure steel. Suffering only makes them stronger. The constant threat of death only makes them more pure and more diligent.

"Every second, every place, there is a threat of death. If you are lucky, you can just avoid the place where the bullet passes through in that second. If you encounter it, there is nothing to say, that's life. In order not to die in that second, I can't wait to do a year's work in one hour. The treasure of time and the uselessness of fame and wealth, I am afraid that only people on the battlefield know the
