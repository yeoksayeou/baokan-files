### Historical Lessons

"Past events, if not forgotten, are a guide for the future." The greatest significance of human history lies in using the experiences and lessons of our ancestors or predecessors to guide our struggle forward, to achieve the most ideal path to happiness in life. What the Chinese people and the Chinese nation are pursuing today is mainly to drive out the Japanese aggressors who are coercing us towards extinction, and to strive for the liberation of all the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from the oppression, robbery, rape, [censored], massacre, [censored] of the Japanese, and to achieve independence, freedom, equality, and happiness.

In our history, there have been many such struggles for liberation, leaving behind very precious precedents for victory and very precious experiences and lessons. Especially after Dr. Sun Yat-sen met the upsurge of the May Fourth Movement and realized the radical reorganization of the Kuomintang, and after Dr. Sun accepted all the experiences and lessons of all liberation movements in human history and created the Three People's Principles and determined the Outline of National Reconstruction in response to the international and domestic situation and needs, the Chinese national liberation movement today in 1925 made a new impression on the world, looking at the revival of the East and the rebirth of China with admiring eyes, and we ourselves, even when we recall it today, cannot help but feel our hearts leap and our blood boil, increasing our infinite courage and confidence in the liberation movement currently underway.

The national liberation movement of today in 1925, the movement that laid the victorious foundation for China's revolution and nation-building, its most important and great significance was the first concrete manifestation of the Chinese national united front in the mass movement; and on the eve of the Northern Expedition, when the upsurge of seeking liberation was boiling throughout the country, the national liberation movement in every city was enthusiastically participated in not only by students, workers, and farmers, but also by national capitalists, and the formal establishment and development of the Federation of Industry, Commerce, and Education became the organizational form of the first mass united front in China. Due to the great power of this national united front, it not only demonstrated the great power of Chinese young students, especially workers and farmers, in the national liberation movement, but also demonstrated that national capitalists were also an important force in resisting [censored] and saving the country. At the same time, because of the persistence and correct leadership of the revolutionary party at that time for this movement, the movement was able to achieve extensive and in-depth development. This is the first historical lesson we need to deeply reflect on today.

The current War of Resistance and nation-building endeavor of the Chinese national liberation movement to strive for independence, freedom, equality, and happiness is entering a new and critical stage. We should now more solemnly recognize the experience of victory and the lessons of failure that millions of people's blood and heads exchanged for fourteen years ago: we must learn from the experience of victory, the first is to further consolidate the unity of all nationalities, all classes, and all parties in China, and expand the united front of the entire Chinese nation in the War of Resistance and nation-building. However, our common [censored] Japanese aggressors are following their "path to victory" fourteen years ago, and are changing to political offensives as the main focus, combined with military offensives, and are devoting their efforts to maintaining their collusion with all feudal remnants, corrupt forces, and stubborn elements in China, and are devoting their efforts to luring Chinese traitors, rebels, wavering and conservative elements, and using smoke screens and poison gas such as "anti-communism," "peace," "Japan-Manchuria-China cooperation," and "East Asia New Order" to divide our national united front for the War of Resistance and nation-building, to strengthen their rule, robbery, and exploitation in the occupied areas of China, and to use these new strategies to solve the internal and external difficulties and crises caused by their war of aggression against China, and to prepare for new steps to conquer all of China and dominate East Asia! Therefore, we must also accept the lessons of failure fourteen years ago, and wage a persistent struggle against all the conspiracies and poisons of the Japanese [censored] to sow discord, divide, and disintegrate the unity of our entire nation, all parties, and groups; and wage a persistent struggle against all the speeches and actions of Chinese [censored] traitors, rebels, wavering and conservative elements that violate the central government's policies for the War of Resistance and nation-building.

On the eve of the invaders encountering an irreparable blow, on the eve of the traitors and rebels encountering an unavoidable sanction, they will use all unimaginable cruel and vicious conspiracies! Perhaps this is the moment! Let us use greater determination and persistence to deal them a fatal blow! Final victory will come to us after the completion of this blow!

### War of Resistance and Nation-Building and the Cultivation of National Morality

â€” Liu Haiou

1. The Causes of the Sino-Japanese War

Taking the First World War from 1914 to 1918 as a wedge, the histories of China and Japan developed in opposite directions. Japan took advantage of the opportunity of the European War to accelerate itself to the "final stage," and from then on, its internal contradictions increased day by day, and its fate was only groping in the dark, with no bright future.

China, on the contrary, took advantage of the opportunity of the European War to lay a weak foundation for national industry. Driven by revolutionary beliefs, the Chinese people closely followed the development of national capital, and successively launched the anti-feudal May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926. At that time, China had obtained the opportunity to become self-reliant, and the original driving force for the upward development of Chinese history was generated.

After the European War, the internal crisis of Japanese imperialism gradually increased. In order to solve this crisis, it suddenly occupied China's Liaoning Province, and even all of the four northeastern provinces on September 18, 1931. Due to the success of the adventurous attempt, it was reflected in Japanese politics: first, the decline of party politics and the rise of the military; second, the chaebols, whose main component was the military industry, rose up to become the backing of the military. From then on, the Japanese military became the darling of the times, regarding China as no man's land and the Chinese nation as [censored].

However, the more Japanese imperialism intensified its aggression against China, the more solid the internal unity of China became. After the September 18th Incident, the slogan "Sincere unity, going to the national crisis together" became popular throughout the country, and the strength of the War of Resistance was concentrated. However, the Japanese aggression was endless. After the Tanggu Truce, China still maintained its burden of humiliation and humiliation, and negotiated with Japan, stopped military action, and used peaceful methods to first seek the preservation of the northern provinces, and then seek a reasonable solution to the problem of the four northeastern provinces, politically maintaining the integrity of sovereignty and administration; and economically taking mutual benefit and equality as the principle of cooperation. However, Japanese imperialism, oblivious to the trend of the world, in this era of the surging tide of "national self-determination" and "nationalism," vainly attempted to swallow up China, which has a population of 450 million, with a country with a population of 70 million. Finally, in July 1937, it suddenly attacked Lugou Bridge with force and occupied my Tianjin. The lifeline of China's life was at stake, and it had reached the critical point of survival. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to rise up and resist the war and seek survival from death. Therefore, the unprecedented national war of resistance in Chinese history broke out like a raging fire.

2. The Significance of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building

The purpose of China's war of resistance this time is to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism in order to save the dying of the country and the people; at the same time, to intensify work in the war of resistance to complete the task of nation-building. Why do we want to advance the war of resistance and nation-building at the same time? In the declaration of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang on April 1, 1938, there was such an indication:

"Our war of resistance this time is not only to save the country, but also to prevent the great cause of nation-building from being interrupted. Moreover, the great cause of nation-building must not wait until the victory of the war of resistance to start again, but is a constant process in the war of resistance. We must gather the manpower and material resources of the whole country in the war of resistance to go to the same goal and deeply plant the foundation of nation-building. Then the day of victory in the war of resistance will be the day when the great cause of nation-building is completed, and the day when China is free and equal.... For without war of resistance, the survival and independence of the nation cannot be guaranteed, and there will be no way to carry out the great cause of nation-building: and without nation-building, self-reliance cannot be fulfilled, how can we resist foreign aggression and seek final victory?"

As long as we can study the highest guiding principle of the Three People's Principles, then the mutual assistance and mutual assistance of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building to the bottom is a necessary principle. This war of resistance is a total mobilization of the nation's mind and material resources, and it is also the total final of the nation's mind and material resources, so we must make the following efforts:

(1) Concentrating People's Power - During this war of resistance, we must recognize that only by basing ourselves on the principle of nationalism, developing the inherent morality of the nation, restoring the nation's self-confidence, and uniting the minds of the 450 million people into one mind, as solid as gold and stone, can people's power be concentrated and the strength of the war of resistance be fulfilled.

(2) Developing People's Power - The victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on people's power. Therefore, we must organize the people and train the people. The purpose of organization and training is to cultivate the people's self-defense ability and self-government ability. These two have the same importance. Without self-defense ability, then self-government will have no room for development and growth: without self-government ability, then self-defense will inevitably lose its reliance. During this war of resistance, we must organize and train the people in the spirit of the principle of people's rights, and then the people's self-defense and self-government power can be developed, which is also the development of people's power.

(3) Fulfilling People's Power - The War of Resistance is a total mobilization and final of mental and material resources, as mentioned earlier. To develop material resources and fulfill material resources, we must adjust and develop agriculture, industry, and commerce to lay the economic foundation for the War of Resistance and Nation-Building. Specifically: First, the people of the whole country should be extremely frugal and hardworking, accumulate production capital, and revitalize industry. Second, all our agricultural revitalization plans must be based on the premise of the War of Resistance. Third, in economic construction, the government implements planned economy according to the credo of the principle of people's livelihood. If the government and the people can cooperate in implementing the above three points, the strength of the war of resistance will be fulfilled.

We take the Three People's Principles as the highest guiding principle of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building, and we must also practice it by ourselves, overcome difficulties, and move forward, then the War of Resistance will be victorious, and Nation-Building will be successful, which is an inevitable trend.

3. War of Resistance and Nation-Building and the Cultivation of National Morality

The last and most important determining factor of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building is the issue of national morality. What national morality shows is national spirit, and how important is it? Chairman Chiang said: "Our revolutionary army must have a special revolutionary spirit to resist the tyrannical force and superior material resources of foreign enemies when fighting against the counter-revolutionary army and the army of the invaded country against the invading country." "The spirit is the mother of all successes and the driving force of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building." "And the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance lies entirely in the spirit."

The so-called revolutionary spirit is the spirit of "becoming extinct" and "becoming things." "Becoming extinct" contains the spirit of "being fond of learning," "self-improvement," "humility," "creation," and "progress." "Becoming things" contains the spirit of "creation," "service," "progress," "sacrifice," and "struggle." The above eight spirits are born from the three "wisdom," "benevolence," and "courage." "Wisdom," "benevolence," and "courage" are the virtues of the world. Therefore, the so-called national morality problem we have put forward is obviously also the problem of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage." Now, let's explore them separately:

(1) The meaning of "wisdom" is to use the functions of innate intelligence (sharpness of ears), brightness (sharpness of eyes), tolerance (sharpness of intention), and knowledge (sharpness of heart) to obtain it through three ways: The first is to know from birth, which is due to "innate." The second is "to know from learning," which is from "knowledge." The third is "to know from difficulties," which is from experience. However, those who "know from birth" are ultimately a very small number of people, which are the so-called people who have unique learning. Most people need to know after learning. Speaking of learning, it is not easy. You must be fond of learning and learn in difficulties before you can succeed. The so-called "being fond of learning is close to wisdom" means that seeking knowledge must be fond of learning. Secondly, seeking knowledge must be humble, which is the so-called "Lu Huai Ruo Gu," because "the most Lu in the world is the most sincere in the world." Only with sincerity can one be humble, and only with humility can one seek progress!

What is the purpose of "wisdom"? The first is to judge right and wrong based on objective conditions and subjective understanding, so it is said: "The heart of right and wrong is the beginning of wisdom." The second is to know "benevolence," that is, to understand the truth of being a human being. This truth of being a human being is to seek the success of a career with the view of life of creation and service, that is, becoming a thing, so it is said: "Becoming a thing is wisdom."

If we can improve and deepen our cultivation of "wisdom," then our understanding of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building will be clear, and our beliefs will be more resolute. There is no doubt that we will win and succeed.

(2) "Benevolence" includes "creative spirit" and "service spirit." From "creative spirit" to "love things," from "service spirit" to "benevolence to the people," this is the so-called "benevolence to the people and love things." "The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence." Also, "benevolence" is a kind of active action, so it is said: "Practice is close to benevolence." The purpose of this active action lies in "Wei Wu," that is, seeking the success of a career. Otherwise, even if you sacrifice everything, you will not hesitate, so [censored] said: "If you don't succeed, you will become benevolent." Wen Tianxiang said: "Confucius said becoming benevolent, Mencius said taking righteousness. Only when righteousness is exhausted can benevolence be reached." Because to become things, one has to sacrifice small things for the sake of the big group, so "killing oneself to become benevolent." Now that [censored] is in front of us, the tragedy of the massacre of compatriots, the occupation of land, the deprivation of sovereignty, and the destruction of the nation and the country are like the eternal depths of fire and heat. We can no longer endure it for a moment. At this turning point of fortune and misfortune, in order to seek the success of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building (becoming things), we must strive to create, strive to serve, and finally even kill ourselves to become benevolent (becoming oneself). Do not seek to live to harm [censored]. "If the people have no such heart of benevolence and love, they will inevitably fall into cruelty, sell themselves to selfishness, and then indulge in violence and laziness, and return to steal life and live in fear. They will not be moved by the survival of the family and the nation, their personal personality will no longer exist, and the vitality of the country will be lost. How can we resist the war? How can we build the country?" (Official words of the Provisional National Congress) If the people can cultivate the "benevolence" with great intention and put it into practice, then the people's hearts will be rejuvenated, and the atmosphere will be formed. The War of Resistance and Nation-Building will be sure to succeed.

(3) "Courage" includes the spirit of progress, the spirit of sacrifice, and the spirit of struggle. Doing righteous (becoming oneself and becoming things) things based on these three spirits is courage, so it is said: "Seeing righteousness and acting bravely." The Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is our great shame and humiliation. We know this shame, so we started the War of Resistance. This is "courage," so it is said: "Knowing shame is close to courage." It is also said: "Making shame clear and teaching war." Compatriots! Rise up with the spirit of progress, sacrifice, and struggle, and strive to wipe out shame and resist the war and build the country.

"Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the virtues of the world, and the one who practices them is one, and one is sincerity.... Sincerity is to choose goodness and hold on to it. Compatriots! Liu Ci's deep intention, then the nation's mind and material resources can be fulfilled, and the War of Resistance and Nation-Building can be surely won and surely achieved."

### The Current Youth's Way Out (Part 2)

â€” Feng Wenbin's Speech

(2) Special Airmail News from Xi'an

Mr. Sun Yat-sen answered this point in advance before he passed away. He said: "Before the Han people regained their country, the general party members thought that once the Han people regained their country, they could achieve the goal of benefiting the country and the people. Today, we know that this is not the case. The reason for this is that the comrades at that time only knew about the principle of nationalism and ignored the mistakes of the principles of democracy and people's livelihood, and this mistake is also where the party's responsibility has not ended. We must know that if the principle of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood cannot be implemented, even if the principle of nationalism achieves its goal, it will not be stable in the end; not to mention that the principle of nationalism has not fully achieved its goal today!" So he affirmed: "To solve the national problem, we must also solve the problem of democracy; to solve the problem of democracy, we must also solve the problem of people's livelihood."

Chairman Chiang also said, "The Three People's Principles are a whole, and cannot be split; the Chinese National Revolution is not a revolution of one principle, but a revolution of the Three People's Principles promoted at the same time."

The reason why the Outline of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building stipulates the protection of people's rights is the conclusion that should be reached from the premise of the Three People's Principles. However, some people misinterpret it, saying that what it stipulates is only the right of the law, not the right of the people, because it protects people's rights only within the scope of the law, and the law can be stretched freely. This view is also wrong. If governments at all levels protect the people's thoughts and beliefs regardless of whether they violate the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, and if they do not want to protect them, they will ban them. This is just playing with the integrity and dignity of the law. All laws must abide by the principles of the Three People's Principles to be correct laws. If governments at all levels can formulate laws at any time and place at will, and arbitrarily judge whether the people are legal or illegal, then what is the significance of our Outline of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building?

The third condition is that we have rich historical lessons. Our sages and elders have long told us: "Brothers read in the [censored], and resist their insults from the outside." The clams fight, and the beans are fried in the kettle, which has always been regarded as the greatest stupidity. We have not only been influenced by this excellent national tradition since childhood, but also proved its correctness in our own experience.

Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth have had twenty years of struggle history. The precious experience of the past twenty years has proved that unity is happiness, and division is disaster. The memory of victory and the painful wounds are still very fresh to us. We have understood the necessity of seeking unity and avoiding division, and we have also learned many practical ways to seek unity and avoid division.

The fourth condition is that we have received help from many domestic elders and foreign friends. The central and local military and political elders, the leaders of various anti-Japanese parties, and the advanced people of high reputation in all walks of life, their support, love, guidance, and guidance for our youth are what we will always be grateful for. The International Youth United Front has given us Chinese youth a very good example in many aspects. Young people in Britain, France, the United States, and other countries are moving towards unity under the common goal of anti-war and anti-fascism. Young people in all countries are very concerned about the unified front of Chinese youth. The two World Youth Conferences and the visit of the World Affairs Federation delegation to China have all had a significant role in promoting our unity and unity.

Sixth, we have young cadres who are loyal to the youth united front. These cadres in our youth organizations have political sensitivity and foresight, and have all kinds of necessary talents and perseverance. Almost everywhere, our cadres can walk in front of ordinary young people and can be good friends of ordinary young people. When ordinary young people are tired and depressed, our cadres will give them strong encouragement. When ordinary young people lose their way, our cadres will give them firm and clear instructions. All their energy is dedicated to the youth united front. In our [censored] special in Fujian, we can name such people by the thousands. They are the people who worry about the world before the world worries, and who are happy after the world is happy. As long as they are helpful to the cause of youth unity and resistance to the war, they are not afraid of any [censored] and [censored]. This is the unparalleled glory of our youth team. (Applause)

Finally, one advantage of our youth united front is that our youth are very frank, pure, and clean, without any worldly prejudices. We say what we think should be said, and we do what we think should be done. We take personal interests very lightly. We are all very enthusiastic about the work of teaching the country and saving the [censored], which makes us naturally unite.

With these superior conditions, who can stop the development of our united front? Even if someone dreams of stopping it, isn't it a waste of effort?

### New Internal Affairs Facilities in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building

[Chongqing Airmail News] For more than a year, although the government has been actively resisting the war, it has also been actively developing various internal affairs facilities in the rear, hoping to cooperate with the military. There are four aspects that are particularly emphasized: (1) Regarding hygiene, there is a special office to handle everything, and the progress is the fastest. The health [censored] of each province have been established one after another, as well as the health experimental offices. Recently, in view of the relatively backwardness of the border provinces, the Northwest Health Commissioner's Office has been established in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and 800,000 yuan of regular expenses have been approved for the use of eight months this year to facilitate implementation. A health institute has also been established in Xikang. Along the highways in the rear, health stations have also been set up, and medical teams have been set up to spread all over the road to relieve the lack of internal medical and epidemic prevention facilities. (2) Regarding opium suppression, planting has long been strictly prohibited, and it was stipulated that planting should be completely banned by the end of last year. Recently, it is still feared that there will be secret planting in various places, so special teams have been organized to investigate and survey planting in various places. Sichuan organized an investigation team by the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs provided guidance. Other provinces were inspected separately by personnel sent by the Opium Suppression Committee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Sichuan investigation team will be able to depart soon. This year, smoking must also be strictly prohibited. Selling and smoking places will be banned. Except for the elderly over 60 years old, smoking is now listed as a ban. (3) Regarding police administration, the work of unified command and uniform training is being carried out. All police training institutes in various provinces and cities are subsidized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs with funds ranging from 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per school per year. The directors of teaching affairs are also generally selected by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In this way, the training standards can be made more uniform. (4) Regarding civil affairs, the reform of the provincial and county administrative organs is now being carried out to make them sound. The reform measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and are still being submitted to the Central Political Committee for review. The reform principles are: First, to change the provincial government into a supervisory unit in administration. Second, to strengthen the power of the administrative supervisors, so that they are directly responsible to the central government for commanding local administration, and at the same time directly responsible to the provincial government's supervisory system for supervising the county governments. Third, to increase the power of the county magistrates and give them considerable protection. Those with a population of more than 500,000 are listed as special counties. Fourth, to change the district and township Baojia system to adapt to the new institutions. These new measures will be implemented around June of this year. As for the war zone administration, in addition to the provincial governments still leading and supervising each province, the central government has specially set up a Party and Government Committee. In case of war zone administrative matters, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will handle them together. The administrative districts in the occupied areas, such as Weihaiwei and Jiujiang, are still properly and directly handled. The original police in each war zone have been registered, relieved, trained, and reorganized to take on the local guerrilla work.

### The Hunan-Hubei Enemy Offensive Has Exhausted; Our Troops in Northern Jiangxi Launch a Successful Counterattack; The Occupied Areas of North China Are in a Frenzy of Mobilization

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Zhuangqing, 20th] Because of their failed offensives in Hubei and Hunan, the enemy is now almost entirely on the defensive on various battlefields. Therefore, the overall situation has been relatively quiet recently. However, the enemy is quite busy with mobilization in the occupied areas of North China. The majority of the enemy in central Hubei is concentrated in the Dabie Mountains, Zhongxiang, Xihe, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Yingshan areas. We have completely controlled them, and there have been constant small-scale engagements. The Xiang River bank is extremely quiet. In this offensive in northern Hunan, the enemy suffered 1,300 casualties, and their offensive has been exhausted. There has been no major engagement in Jiangxi. East of Gao'an and Wuning, near Nanchang, we have constantly attacked the enemy, achieving considerable success.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 29th] Currently, there are four enemy gunboats, four transport ships, four submarines, and more than forty motorboats anchored on the Yueyang River. At 9:00 AM on the 29th, two enemy boats sailed from Yueyang to the border of Huarong for reconnaissance and then immediately retreated.

Frequent Reports of Victory from Hebei and Shandong

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] The enemy has recently claimed to "pacify" Jiaodong, but our guerrilla forces are strong and there is no cause for concern. Yesterday, our units attacked Muping and entered the city, burning down the puppet county government. The enemy fled in disarray to the east gate. They also used four aircraft to assist in the battle. Because our objective had been achieved, we safely withdrew. Furthermore, our security team completely annihilated the puppet army regiment of Zhao Yanhan in Shenzhuang and Zhuying Road, Dong'a County. Zhao was also killed in action. More than 700 enemy troops from Jining and Wenshang attacked Macun, Wenshang, but were repelled. Our troops in various parts of Hebei also have occasional engagements with the enemy. We control most counties. The enemy in Hebei and Shandong is forcibly collecting land taxes from the people and forcing villages to use puppet currency, causing extreme public resentment. Many Japanese and puppet soldiers have been killed.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 28th] Yesterday, the enemy in southern Shanxi launched an offensive towards Xiaganquan and Wuziguanzhuang. After a fierce counterattack by our troops, the enemy was unable to withstand the assault and fled towards Shicun. Our troops attacked Zhoujialuo and the enemy immediately collapsed upon contact, fleeing westward and abandoning much heavy weaponry and military supplies. We have taken advantage of the victory to pursue them. At the same time, our troops advanced towards Yicheng Avenue, cutting off the enemy's retreat. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate the remaining enemy forces.

Guangdong Guerrilla Forces Active

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 29th] Our guerrilla forces have been active in the vicinity of Sanshui recently, achieving considerable success. On the morning of the 28th, the enemy attacked Yangmeilu northeast of Sanshui. After five hours of fierce fighting, they were defeated and fled. Also, the enemy in the southwest attacked Lucun without success. On the afternoon of the 28th, they reinforced with more than 300 troops and attacked again, using machine guns and artillery to assist in the battle. We bravely annihilated more than 100 enemy troops, then shifted positions and continued to resist. In this battle, we suffered 20 casualties.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 28th] On the 22nd, a unit of more than 100 enemy soldiers from Shilong, Dongguan, harassed Hengli. They were ambushed by our guerrillas.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Guilin, 29th] According to reports from here, there are approximately 50,000 enemy troops entrenched in Guangdong Province, most of whom were transferred from Taiwan, with the remainder being Korean and Manchukuo puppet troops. The enemy stationed in the Pearl River Estuary are mostly naval landing forces, as are those on Hainan Island. However, only the eastern, southern, and northern coastal areas of the island are under their control.

[Central News Agency, Xuwen, 18th] More than 200 enemy troops from Tuanshi City (under Qiongdong) attacked Cenkou in Ding'an County, and approximately 300 enemy troops from Ding'an City attacked Hanlin. Under the cover of twelve enemy aircraft, they fought with us for several days. The enemy suffered more than 100 casualties. Due to the enemy's intense artillery fire, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, we shifted our positions to villages near Hanlin Longtang and continued to resist the enemy. Also, on the 16th, the enemy attacked Xinyu, Tunchang, engaging us in three days and nights of bloody combat. They are currently still in a stalemate with us in the Xinyu Tunchang area. Yesterday at 8:00 AM, the enemy from Penglai and Dingan split into two routes, using aircraft and more than ten tanks to cover their attack on Huangzhu (under Qiongdong). Our defending forces, in conjunction with local units, actively resisted and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

[Special dispatch from Wengyuan] Belated news: On the morning of the 27th, a detachment from the Peng Division of our 12th Group Army attacked the enemy at Shengang again, encountering more than 400 enemy infantry and cavalry and several small cannons at Dagangling. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the assault.

### The Tibetan People's Comfort Mission Sends a Telegram to Salute the Soldiers Across the Country, Donating Medical Supplies and Comfort Funds of 9,000 Yuan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] A mission from Tibet, consisting of monks and laypeople, traveled to Chongqing to express their condolences to the soldiers fighting the war of resistance. They presented a flag to the supreme leader and the soldiers of the country, and also donated comfort funds of 9,000 yuan. On the 28th, they telegraphed their respects to the soldiers of the country. The telegram read: "To the commanders of all war zones, the director of the Aviation Commission, and all the officers and men, We send you our deepest respects. For nearly two years, our generals and soldiers have been fighting bravely and shedding blood in the war of resistance, trapping the enemy in the quagmire and exalting our national prestige in the world. Final victory is within our grasp. We are about to witness the rebirth of the five-thousand-year-old land of culture into a free and independent nation. One hundred million descendants of the Yellow Emperor will live in peace and happiness, benefiting our country and leaving behind lasting contributions. We look forward to your achievements with the utmost respect and admiration. Although the three Tibetan regions are far away, our sense of gratitude is no different from those living on the mainland. This delegation, representing the Panchen Lama, all personnel, and the monks, laypeople, and masses of Tibet, have traveled day and night to pay our respects to the supreme leader and all of you, and to present you with flags and our condolences. We also donate medical supplies and comfort funds of 9,000 yuan, as a small expression of our Tibetan compatriots' thoughts. We have already made preparations to depart, in accordance with the wishes of the authorities, to return to Tibet and devote ourselves to spreading propaganda.

Shanghai Traitor Newspaper Attacks Britain

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 29th] Today's editorial in the "New Shen Bao," under Japanese control, claimed that Britain is now using its "traditional policy of killing two birds with one stone. At the same time as the Anglo-Soviet alliance has been completed, Britain has been urging the Soviet Union to go to war with Japan. The recent Outer Mongolian border incident is likely the result of British instigation. The Japanese authorities will certainly teach Britain a lesson." The newspaper concluded by saying, "If Britain's anti-Japanese plan succeeds, then several more countries will be sacrificed."

### Japanese Newspaper Advertises the Opening of the Yangtze River

[Tokyo, 29th] According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, today's "Miyako Shimbun" stated that the Japanese government has decided to reopen the Yangtze River to allow shipping by third countries. Since the Japanese naval authorities closed the Yangtze River, various countries have been negotiating with Japan almost daily. The Japanese government has indeed decided to open the river, but the Japanese military officers in the "local area" still oppose implementing it at present. Therefore, the date of opening may be postponed until the autumn of this year. There are five important tasks for Japan before opening the river: (1) implementing a backing currency policy; (2) improving shipping and port facilities; (3) adjusting economic relations with the people in the Chinese hinterland (?); (4) maintaining public order; (5) restricting foreign shipping. The "Miyako Shimbun" also stated that the issue of opening the Yangtze River is closely related to the issue of concessions in China.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: British Ambassador Kerr, accompanied by Admiral Jubal, arrived in Shanghai on the British cruiser Birmingham at 9:00 AM on the 29th, sailing from Xiamen.

Now the ambassadors and army and navy commanders of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, have gathered in Shanghai. Amidst the tense atmosphere surrounding the concession issue, the meeting of these important military and diplomatic personnel from the three countries should bring warm comfort to the Chinese and foreign people. It is rumored that the officials have already held an important meeting to discuss general issues related to Japan and to strengthen cooperation between the three countries. It is also heard that the heads of the three countries' consulates in Shanghai also participated in the talks.

### German Mail Ship Also Intercepted and Searched by the Japanese; German Consul in Shanghai Protests; Both Sides Attempt to Conceal the Matter; Truth Revealed After the Ship Arrives in Shanghai

[Local news] Recently, Japanese warships have been rampant along our country's coast, wantonly inspecting foreign merchant ships. In the past week alone, three ships have been searched by the Japanese. In addition to the news about the British mail ship "Rampurra" and the French mail ship "Aline Mesurier," which has already been reported, the incident involving the German mail ship "Sulten," which was also searched by a Japanese warship on the 24th of this month, has not yet been published. Relevant parties in this port have also not disclosed this information. According to a Western report from this port yesterday, the German mail ship that was searched by the Japanese warship was the "Sulten," weighing 7,087 tons, owned by the German Hamburg Shipping Company. On the 24th of this month, it was sailing about one mile outside this port when it encountered a Japanese destroyer coming head-on and signaled it to stop. The ship's captain immediately obeyed and stopped. Soon, a group of Japanese sailors, about ten in number, led by an officer, approached the ship in a motorboat, then climbed aboard to inspect the ship's cargo of paper goods and important documents, etc. They also asked where the ship was coming from, where it was going, and whether it was a German merchant ship. After about 20 minutes, the Japanese soldiers left the ship and returned to their warship, and the "Sulten" continued sailing to Shanghai. Regarding the ship's search incident, the Japanese and German authorities in this port and Shanghai have not reported it, but it is rumored that the German Consul General has protested to the Japanese side. However, this news has yet to be confirmed. Furthermore, it is found that the location of this German ship's search is the same as that of the French ship's search.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Shanghai dispatch: According to the English-language Continental Daily News, after the French mail ship Aline Mesurier was inspected by the Japanese on the 24th of this month, the German ship Sulten, which was sailing from Germany to Shanghai, was also intercepted by Japanese warships, and the Japanese boarded the ship to inspect documents. After 20 minutes, they left. The German Consul General in Shanghai has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. Relevant parties attempted to conceal this matter, but it was eventually revealed. After the Sulten arrived in Shanghai, the full truth of the incident was revealed.

### Japanese Informally Express Cessation of Intercepting Foreign Ships

[Reuters, Shanghai, 29th] A Japanese naval spokesman, meeting with journalists tonight, guaranteed that there will be no more incidents like "Rampurra," "Aline Mesurier," and "Sulten." However, he said, "The Japanese naval authorities will still board and inspect the documents of any ship deemed suspicious." Furthermore, when answering questions, the spokesman pointed out that there is currently no blockade of the Chinese coast, saying that the Japanese navy only wants to stop Chinese ships from sailing, but third-country flags are often misused, so it is sometimes necessary to search them for verification. From June 1st, the Shanghai Customs will refuse to issue export sailing permits for ships sailing to Haimen, Qidong, Xingang, Zhangzhou, and Funing, etc. It is heard that the purpose is to cut off supplies to the Chinese guerrilla forces in these ports.

### Coastal Zhejiang Implements Blockade; Wenzhou-Taizhou Authorities Notify Shipping Merchants

### Shaoguan Air Raid Destroys Dozens of Homes

### Soviet-Japanese Air Battle South of Manzhouli; The Enemy Repeatedly Loses in the Invasion of China and Falsely Reports Battle Results to Deceive the People

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 29th] A Japanese army spokesman claimed that this conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in Manchuria was far more intense than the Changkufeng Incident.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 29th] The Japanese officially announced that yesterday the Japanese Air Force and 100 Soviet Air Force military aircraft engaged in an air battle south of Manzhouli.

### Scenic Spots of Lanzhou (Part 1)

â€” Jun Sui

Travels in Xinjiang, Episode 5

Visiting the Peach Blossom Forest in Shijiawan

As arranged by Mr. Zheng Xiangchen of the Bank of China, we took a car early in the morning of the 18th to visit Shijiawan, about 30 li from the city, where the famous peach blossom forest of Lanzhou is located. Tens of thousands of peach trees are planted in the middle of nearly a thousand mu of farmland. Looking at it from a distance, it looks like a pink sea, which is truly beautiful.

The Yellow River Iron Bridge

After the car left the city, it passed a Guandi Temple. With gates to the north and south and a paifang in front, the temple looks extremely majestic and is currently occupied by a government agency. After passing the ancient temple is the famous Yellow River Iron Bridge, built three years before the founding of the Republic of China. It was ordered from an American bridge company by Sheng Yun, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu during the Guangxu era of the late Qing Dynasty. This bridge has long exceeded its warranty period, but the authorities do not have the resources to rebuild it, so they still allow cars weighing less than seven tons to pass, which is really too dangerous. Looking north from the bridge, Baitashan (White Pagoda Mountain) stands tall, with the white pagoda towering independently on the top of the mountain. From the mountain's base to its peak, it is covered with temples, including the Ten Kings of Hell, worshiped in small temples. This shows the past superstition of the people of Lanzhou.

The Lanzhou Mint

The road on the north bank was originally the highway from Lanzhou to Qinghai and Xinjiang. Recently, with the government's barter trade with the Soviet Union, it has become an important route for transportation between the two countries. However, the road surface has not been repaired. The loose yellow soil is so deep that it can submerge the axle. Mountain stones sink into the gray soil, making driving very difficult. The road runs parallel to the Yellow River. Not far from the Yellow River Iron Bridge, two water mills stand side by side, with large stoves towering high. Mr. Zheng said that this is the Lanzhou Mint, also built during the late Qing Dynasty. Further ahead, every half li or so, there is a fort, and the forts are connected by mud walls. According to Mr. Zheng, these are the remnants of defensive walls built by Zuo Zongtang during the suppression of the Hui Rebellion. The farmland along the Yellow River is mostly stony, but because it is irrigated with waterwheels, the land is extremely fertile. White poplars and green willows on both banks add to the beauty of the scene. On the vast expanse of yellow soil, the addition of verdant colors makes one forget the desolate scenery, showing that human determination can overcome nature and that developing the Northwest is not impossible.

The Peach Blossom Forest in Shijiawan

When the car arrived at Shijiawan, we got out and walked, taking a large circle around the peach blossom forest. In the densest part of the peach forest, it looks like a pink cloud. Each peach tree has densely layered blossoms, with deep red stamens and pink petals, truly a vibrant sight. It looks similar to the blooming plum blossoms of Meiyuan in Wuxi, but the planting method is similar to the plum orchards of Licun in Qingdao, because only a few trees are planted on each mu of land. However, because the number of mu planted is too large, it appears endless. The roadsides are interspersed with plum trees, which have also blossomed, creating a red and white intermingling effect that adds to the elegance. There are also jujube trees, which have not yet bloomed, their branches twisted and turning, adding to the charm. Most of the peach trees in the peach forest have short trunks and lack grace, but there are also several trees with old trunks and winding branches, comparable to the old plum trees of Chaoshan.

The Hardships of the Farmers

On the road in the middle of the peach forest, we saw a large cart pulled by a mule and a donkey. The road was steep, and the mule was exhausted and refused to move forward. The cart driver whipped it repeatedly, but to no avail, and he was so anxious that he shed tears. Mr. Zheng chatted with him and learned that the cart was carrying crushed stone, which could be exchanged for three yuan in national currency in Lanzhou City. If he could not reach the city today, not only would he have nothing to eat, but also nowhere to get grass for the animals. That is why he was so anxious that he was crying. The hardships of the laborers in the Northwest are beyond the imagination of the people in the Southeast. People often talk emptily about developing the Northwest, but they have not delved into the lives of the people in the Northwest. How can they know the poverty of the people in the Northwest? Ahead, we saw a small village, and we went over to talk to the villagers, learning that they were the farmers of the peach forest. Each family has dozens of peach trees, each worth only about one yuan, indicating that even when the fruit ripens, it is not worth much. Their daughters still have their feet bound from a young age. We advised the mothers to stop binding their daughters' feet, and some of them agreed.

The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway

There we met the foreman of the Tongcheng Company, which is building the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, and learned that the section of the highway near Lanzhou has started to be paved with stones and will be completed in about one or two months. In the future, when we return to Shijiawan, we will no longer have to endure the hardship of traveling on a rugged and uneven road from the primitive era. We often say that the Northwest Highway is our international route for communication with the Soviet Union, but unexpectedly, the road 20 or 30 li from Lanzhou is still a mule cart road from the primitive era. This shows that those who talk about construction have always focused on developing the Southeast. If we now want to step up the construction of the Northwest, we will face a situation of stretching ourselves too thin. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If we can catch up quickly and start by focusing on transportation, the other construction projects will naturally be solved easily. Sun Yat-sen's construction plan originally designated Lanzhou as the center of China's railway network. We should now make Lanzhou the intersection of Northwest transportation, as well as the liaison station for transportation in the Southwest and Northeast, and the starting and ending station for Sino-Soviet international transportation. The first step is to improve the highways, the second step is to adjust the air routes, and the third step is to build the railways. At the same time, we should rush to extend the Longhai Railway to Lanzhou before there is a possibility of implementing Sun Yat-sen's plan.

[Special Correspondent Report from the People's Revolutionary Society, Hanoi] Hanoi, the capital of Annam, is perhaps not well-known in ordinary times to many people, except for those with special interests there. But since the Wang Jingwei incident, where he fled to Hanoi, many people's attention has shifted to it.

The streets of Hanoi have a French flavor. Except for Guangdong Street and a few streets inhabited by the Annamese, the roads are wide, with trees densely planted on both sides, providing shade like a large umbrella over those moving on the streets. Cicadas and various summer insects chime in the shade, resembling a clear symphony. The Western-style houses are not very large, and are often widely spaced, leaving open spaces for gardens. This is due to the hot weather. There are streetcars, not like the double-decker ones in Hong Kong, but like those in Shanghai, with two carriages. The total population is 150,000, mostly Annamese, followed by the French. There are only about 4,000 overseas Chinese, less than in Saigon and Haiphong (Saigon has tens of thousands, and Haiphong has over 8,000). After the Wang incident, the reporter became quite interested in Hanoi, and thus made this trip there. After arriving in Hanoi, the reporter visited the Chinese Consul-General in Hanoi and various overseas Chinese figures, inquiring in detail about the current living conditions of the overseas Chinese, the dynamics of the anti-Japanese national salvation work, the activities of the Wang faction, and the attitudes of the overseas Chinese towards Wang, among other issues. To summarize what was learned from the visits, the current living conditions of the overseas Chinese are generally not bad. They are very enthusiastic about donating funds to save the country. They have national salvation organizations and frugal meal societies, donating their savings each month to the consulate for remittance to Hong Kong, to be forwarded to the central government. Intellectuals often hold fundraising performances to aid refugees. However, firstly, the overseas Chinese population is too small, with small merchants and workers making up the majority; and secondly, the educational level of the overseas Chinese is relatively low. Generally speaking, it is undeniable that the overseas Chinese here are quite scattered. Indeed, it is probably not accidental that Wang chose to come to this place of all places. Perhaps he calculated that the minds of the overseas Chinese here are as simple and pure as blank paper, easy to grasp, and then decided to flee to Hanoi. However, this was his miscalculation. For the sake of livelihood, the overseas Chinese in Hanoi and even throughout Vietnam, who are in a colonial situation, have a love for their motherland that is no less than that of the overseas Chinese in other regions. Their enthusiastic donations for national salvation and the vigorous development of national salvation work are ironclad proof of this. They are unanimously indignant and opposed to Wang. They unconditionally support the central government, the supreme leader, and the basic national policy of protracted resistance. Their confidence in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction is as solid as iron. However, this is not to say that there are no scoundrels among the overseas Chinese here, which no one wants to deny. Perhaps due to the above reasons, the Wang faction is very active here, and their scope of activities is not limited to this one corner, but has spread to various parts of Vietnam and Siam. The reporter happened to read a communication from Wangluo in the "Vietnam News" column of the May 16th Vietnam Daily, titled "Traitors Who Sell Out the Country Randomly Distribute Propaganda," the article detailed the seditious activities of the Wang faction to incite the overseas Chinese, the reporter has transcribed it in full, word for word, for the readers:

### Anti-Aggression Negotiations Proceeding Tortuously, Rumor of Soviet Union Presenting Counter-Proposals Again, Alliance Could Greatly Increase Strength

[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] According to political circles here, Stalin personally studied the Anglo-French proposals. This news is enough to indicate that the negotiations have reached their final stage. Whether the tripartite alliance can be established depends on the Soviet Union's decision. However, according to another source, Stalin does not want to accept the current Anglo-French proposals, and wants to present counter-proposals again. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to London at the end of this week, and Foreign Secretary Halifax will return to London on Wednesday or Thursday, which is enough to indicate that the British government knows that the Soviet Union must study the Anglo-French documents for a long time before it can reply.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] As of last night, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, had not yet reported to the British government the results of the meetings on Saturday and Sunday with the French ChargÃ© d'affaires to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Political circles here also do not know when Ambassador Seeds will report to the British government, only saying that Stalin personally studied the Anglo-French documents in detail on Saturday night.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] Yesterday's Paris noon newspapers reported that if Japan joins the military alliance, the clauses in the current Anglo-Soviet-French agreement that stipulate automatic military mutual assistance in Europe will also be extended to the Far East. All the evening newspapers in Paris said that the talks currently underway in Moscow are extremely satisfactory, that the British and French ambassadors and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are in agreement, and that Stalin also wishes to cooperate fully and closely with Britain and France.

[Associated Press, London, 29th] The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union delivered the British proposals to the Soviet government last Saturday and Sunday. Britain is now awaiting the Soviet response. Once the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is completed, the three countries will be stronger than they were in 1914. Although general experts believe that the danger of war still exists, they feel that after two months of diplomatic activity, the balance of power in the international arena has now shifted in favor of the anti-aggression group. No one dares to say that the Axis powers have abandoned their aggressive ambitions. Hitler's future actions will first expand the German-Italian military alliance, and then extend to Spain and Japan.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday for one hour. British diplomatic circles believe that the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression defense group can be completed within a few days. How the strength of the Soviet Union is has always been kept secret, but according to sources claiming to be well-informed, the establishment of the Anglo-French-Soviet defense alliance is equivalent to an increase in the military strength of the peace front, with 16 million people who can be mobilized, of which 10 million have been trained and are able to use the latest weapons and follow new combat methods. The Soviet Union currently has 5 million trained troops, serving in the regular army or in the reserve army. This reserve army was established in August 1923, and has now become a powerful force. In addition, the Soviet Union has a second reserve army, whose members are all those who have served in the regular army or reserve army. They are also subject to the military authorities until they are 40 years old. The Soviet Union also conscripts 75,000 people into the navy and air force each year. Conscripts must undergo military training for ten weeks each year during the period from 16 to 18 years old. After retiring from the regular army, they are incorporated into the reserve army until the age of 40, and then automatically returned to the supplementary service. The Soviet Union also intends to develop plans for wartime mobilization and transportation.

[London, 29th] According to reports arriving here from Paris, if the negotiations for the conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet three-nation alliance encounter further difficulties, the totalitarian countries may soon have new acts of aggression. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, influenced by some powerful quarters, is unwilling to conclude a formal alliance with the Soviet Union, which has delayed the Anglo-Soviet negotiations for two months without complete success. Pro-German Britons fear that once the Anglo-Soviet alliance is completed, Hitler's diplomatic failure may lead to the collapse of his regime and give rise to Bolshevism in Germany. The French side, led by Premier Daladier, has been warned by the French General Staff regarding the negotiations for the conclusion of the three-nation alliance. If an anti-aggression front is not established quickly, the General Staff will not be responsible for national defense, so they must do their utmost to win over Britain and the Soviet Union. Chamberlain had still believed that Italy could be won over, but after Germany and Italy signed a military alliance last month, he realized that it was hopeless. This was also a major blow to pro-German leaders in Britain, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Home Secretary Hoare, and Chamberlain's advisor Wilson. A well-known weekly in London wrote last week, declaring that if the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations are successfully concluded and a three-nation mutual assistance alliance is signed, Germany's dream of dominating Europe will be shattered, the Axis powers will definitely be disappointed, and the peace front will be greatly strengthened.

[Associated Press, on the British Royal Train, 8th] The British Royal Train stopped in Revelstoke for 20 minutes today. 8,000 people gathered there to give the King and Queen a grand welcome.

[Reuters, Banff, Canada, 28th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie hosted a dinner for the British King and Queen and over a hundred journalists and photographers at the Banff Springs Hotel last night. Everyone participated in singing. After the dinner, the King and Queen left the dining room and talked casually with the journalists. As they left in the electric car, the reporters applauded. The King and Queen will attend prayers this morning and leave the Banff Hotel at 10:30 am (local time) to drive to Lake Louise (40 miles west of Banff). There, they will transfer to the royal train and drive to Vancouver. The authorities have dispatched a locomotive to help the royal train pass through the sloping mountain roads.

### Roman Women Parade in Military Uniforms

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 29th] Yesterday, the largest women's parade ever held in Italy took place here, with over 7,000 participants, all members of Fascist women's organizations, uniformly dressed in gorgeous uniforms. They lined up in the early morning and marched towards the Royal Avenue. The weather was clear at the time. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the Italian royal family, the secretary of the Fascist Congress, cabinet members, members of parliament, and diplomatic officials from various countries all inspected the parade. Representatives of the German Hitler Youth also participated. The streets of the entire city were crowded with people eager to see the women who had been trained to serve in the colonies. Each wore a "khaki" military uniform, a helmet, and carried a long gun on their backs. When the women's column passed the Venice Palace, they shouted loudly. Mussolini was forced to walk out several times to thank the crowd and make a simple speech, praising the women's military exercises as perfect and will be a valuable and reliable army for the motherland and Fascism.

### Soviet Nationalities Council Approves Defense Budget, Izvestia Praises the Power of the Red Army, Sufficient to Crush Fascist Aggression

Representative Vesnin reported on the defense budget, saying: "May the Fascist aggressors remember that the Soviet Red Army has this mechanical equipment, coupled with the Red Army's full courage and precision, and has become an irresistible force. Anyone who dares to provoke our motherland will end up with a bloody head." After the speech, the representatives applauded enthusiastically.

### 60,000 Catholics Pray for Peace

[Reuters, Melbourne, Australia, 28th] 60,000 Catholics participated in the gathering today, the highest number since the Pope launched the prayer. When the participants heard the speaker say that the scourge of war could be avoided by the power of peace-loving people around the world, they cheered enthusiastically. Australian Prime Minister Menzies undertook to forward a resolution to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, as well as the Vatican, declaring that war is not inevitable, and continuing to ask all countries to engage in friendly discussions on all international issues and to end the competition for arms expansion.

### British Ambassador to Italy Visits Mussolini

[Associated Press, Rome, 29th] The British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Noel Charles, visited Mussolini at the Venice Palace last night for their first meeting. It is said that this visit was purely a matter of etiquette, and the two had a harmonious conversation.

### "Iron Lung Man" Goes to the Holy Pool for Immersion Again

[Reuters, Rotterdam, 28th] The "Iron Lung Man" Snyder went to the Holy Pool again today to be immersed in the holy water. Mr. Snyder changed into a lighter lung and lay on a rising bed to be immersed in the holy water, which flows directly from a miraculous stream. During the immersion, Snyder also participated in singing hymns. Then he was still placed in the original iron lung and did not feel uncomfortable. He stared at the god in the mirror for ten minutes. After that, he was raised back to the city. Along the way, the people wished him a speedy recovery.

### Romanian King Travels Around, Foreign Minister Gafencu to Visit Turkey

[Hai Luo News Agency, Bucharest, 29th] According to well-informed sources, Romanian King Carol, who was reported to have gone to Ankara, has arrived in the province of Transylvania. After inspecting the arms factory in Mika yesterday morning, he is now hunting on the southern Romanian border.

[Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu felt slightly unwell last Friday, but according to yesterday's reports, he recovered the day before yesterday and returned to work as usual. The Turkish Minister to Romania returned to his country yesterday to discuss preparations with the government for the visit of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu.

### Fascist Party Members Incite Overseas Italians in France to Take the Opportunity to Disrupt the Situation

[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Former Secretary of the Italian Fascist Party, Farinacci, recently published an article in his organ newspaper "The Fascist Era," advising Italians living in France to take the opportunity to join French political parties, and then "wait for the right opportunity to create chaos and disrupt order in the heart of the enemy country. If a hundred people attack the enemy from behind, its effectiveness is far greater than a thousand soldiers fighting the enemy on the front line."

### British War Veterans Decide to Protect National Freedom, Will Rise Up and Fight If Attacked, Morris Speaks at Annual Meeting

[Reuters, London, 28th] British veterans of the European War held their annual meeting today. Chairman Morris attended and addressed the meeting, saying that British veterans would be very willing to shake hands and make peace with German and Italian veterans if the German and Italian governments could allow them to do so. However, British veterans are still determined to rise up and fight to protect British freedom when their country is attacked. Morris continued that if the German and Italian press do not end their attacks on Britain, it will be difficult for British veterans to rebuild their friendly relations with them. He finally said, "Although we are willing to rebuild friendly relations with Germany and Italy, if our country is attacked, we will resist to the last man. If our freedom is threatened, we will fight for freedom, and if our allies are in trouble, we will also fight for them." After the speech, the thousand representatives gave him enthusiastic applause.

### Italy Currently Has No Intention of Provocation

[Associated Press, Rome, 29th] According to Fascist sources close to Mussolini, Mussolini will not take excessive actions in order to endanger European peace. Although there are many clouds of war in Europe at present, Italy still hopes for lasting peace in Europe. This statement is enough to prove that Italy currently has no intention of provocation and hopes that Germany's actions towards Poland and Italy's actions towards France will not cause trouble. In addition, it also proves that Italy has no intention of abolishing the Anglo-Italian Agreement or signing another agreement to resist the Anglo-Turkish Agreement, and the rumor that Germany and Italy will soon put forward new demands on European issues is untrue.

### Many Shortcomings in Germany's Western Defense Line, Underground Forts Have Been Infiltrated by Water

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] German newspapers are currently boasting that the German-Italian Axis powers are strong and indestructible. The Berlin BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung also claims that Germany's western Siegfried Line is impregnable, but according to news received by French newspapers, this defense line has many construction shortcomings. For example, the right-wing Paris Echo reported that a correspondent from The Hague called to say that according to reliable news, German leader Hitler recently inspected the Siegfried Line and discovered many shortcomings. For example, the underground forts have been infiltrated by water from the Rhine River, and the increased moisture and softness have caused the gun emplacements to sink. The cement used in the forts is of poor quality and cannot resist water, so the guards have had to withdraw. The experts led by Leader Hitler all believe that another defense line should be built three to five kilometers behind the first defense line. The Leader has dismissed the leaders of the National Defense Army engineering teams for this reason and ordered Air Minister GÃ¶ring to conduct an investigation to determine where the responsibility lies. According to experts, if the Siegfried Line is to be rebuilt, it will take at least two or three years to complete.

### Discussion of British Commercial Interests in the Far East, Detailed Record of House of Commons Debate

[London Air Express] Recently, British Members of Parliament Drummond-Hay and others raised questions about the issue of British commercial interests in the Far East, and Vice-Minister Butler answered on behalf of the government. The details are recorded as follows: (Drummond-Hay asked) If British merchants in China wish to travel freely between Shanghai and Hankou, I wonder if they can enjoy transportation conveniences. (Vice-Minister replied) On April 17 this year, about 20 passengers traveled from Shanghai to Hankou on a British ship, and on April 29, about 50 passengers traveled from Hankou to Shanghai. At that time, all British people going to Hankou traveled together, but it is currently difficult to restore a regular route. Negotiations on this matter are still ongoing with the Japanese authorities. (Drummond-Hay) Can I ask the government to raise this issue again with the Tokyo government and sternly urge them, saying that the closure of the Yangtze River has not only made British merchants feel very distressed, but their families have also suffered a lot. I also asked the government to contact the commander of the British fleet in China on March 13 regarding this matter. I wonder if discussions are still ongoing. (Vice-Minister replied) This type of contact has not stopped, and the government also understands the serious situation you mentioned. (Ealing Graham asked) The Japanese are launching organized anti-British propaganda in the occupied areas of China. I wonder if the government has paid attention to it. Is the information obtained by the government sufficient to prove that the aforementioned anti-British propaganda is incited by local Japanese officials? If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will harm the friendship between Japan and Britain. Has the government alerted the Japanese government to this?

(Vice-Minister replied) According to the recent report from the British Consul-General in Shanghai, he lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong at the beginning of last month, and the so-called anti-British propaganda has been somewhat relaxed. However, the government will continue to monitor this matter and will raise protests when necessary.

### British General Election Nears, Rumor That Chamberlain Will Resign, Ministers Will Also Be Replaced

[Tonghai News Agency, London, 29th] The recent activities of the Conservative Party Executive Committee have caused great concern among political figures here. They believe that all the activities of the Committee are related to election affairs, indicating that the election period is not far away. It is generally believed that if Chamberlain believes that the political situation is advantageous to the Conservative Party in October, the election may be held in October. The "People's Newspaper" here declared that after the election, if the Conservative Party can still win a majority, Chamberlain will continue in office for about a month, but Chamberlain must submit his resignation to the King before Christmas, and the successor will be Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon. In addition to this rumor, there have been recent rumors of a possible cabinet reshuffle. According to Sunday's rumors, Chamberlain has planned to reshuffle the cabinet within four weeks, because the recent criticisms of some cabinet members in the newspapers have reduced the credibility of the cabinet, so Chamberlain wants to reshuffle the cabinet, although it is not out of his own will, but because of the pressure of public opinion, he has to do so. It is believed that Secretary of Commerce Stanley, Minister of Health Elliot, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Eastham are all on the list for replacement, and even Sir John Simon may also leave office. As for whether Churchill will join the cabinet, it is still difficult to say for sure. Well-informed sources declare that Churchill may join the cabinet in the near future, as First Lord of the Admiralty. British people believe that his appointment to this important position is most appropriate, and the personnel in the Admiralty are now actively welcoming Churchill to head the department.

### French Prime Minister's Speech, Defending Peace, Living in Friendship with All Mankind, US Ambassador Says Cannot Submit

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Prime Minister Daladier, speaking today at the dedication ceremony of the monument to the European American Legion at the Neuville Cemetery, expressed France's desire to live in friendship with all mankind. He said that the French people never make false exaggerations, and do not regard themselves as a superior nation that is superior to everything and capable of enslaving other human beings. On the contrary, the greatest happiness for the French is to live equally with all the noblest and most peace-loving nations. Daladier continued, "France never 'sits on the fence.' When it advocates peace, it makes every effort to work for peace with sincerity. Although the current environment is fluctuating and unstable with the discovery of new threats, France has never given up hope of maintaining peace." US Ambassador to France Bullitt followed up by saying, "Whether the American people or the major nations of the West, accepting the horrors of war is lighter than accepting slavery."

### Rumor That US Ambassador to Japan Will Be Replaced, Grew Has Left Office and Returned Home

[This newspaper's Shanghai special dispatch, 29th] According to news transmitted here from Washington, US Ambassador to Japan Grew recently returned to his country on the Japanese Empress liner, and may not return to his post. Japanese newspapers such as "Japan Times" and the military organ newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" have expressed great fear that Grew will not return to his post and unanimously demanded that the US ambassador be able to return to his post as scheduled. Some quarters in Washington believe that Grew is too weak, especially in the "Panay" incident, he failed to take a firm stand, so they hope to replace him with someone stronger and tougher.

### British National Defense Party Members Accept Government White Paper, Discuss Palestine Issue

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] National Defense Party members held a meeting at the home of their leader Nashashibi today and passed a resolution accepting the British government's "White Paper" as the basis for negotiating the Palestine issue with Britain. Another resolution condemned the terrorists, saying that this kind of terrorist action was "assisted by some foreign countries." Nashashibi was a former Arab representative who attended the London Palestine Conference.

Small Commentary

### Ã—Forcibly Conscripting Our Villagers

We have repeatedly pointed out that since the War of Resistance entered its second phase, or the transitional period into a stalemate, the Ã— people have encountered significant difficulties and have adopted a strategy of "politics as the primary focus, with military as support." They attempt to exploit our land, population, and production, that is, to use our country's manpower and material resources to alleviate their current difficulties and increase our difficulties, in preparation for further conquering all of China and dominating the Far East.

According to foreign news from Hong Kong, the Japanese Ã— in Yulin Port have forcibly conscripted 4,000 Chinese laborers, working day and night to expedite the construction of a submarine base, which is largely nearing completion, with the entire project scheduled to be finished within two months. This news further proves a part of the Japanese Ã— new strategy of aggression against China today. This new strategy is being implemented in all occupied areas of China.

Upon seeing such news, one cannot help but feel extremely pained! Especially those of us who have been forced to leave our homeland and native villages by the gunfire of the Ã— people! However, merely feeling heartbroken upon hearing the news is useless! If we still cherish our motherland, our hometowns, and our ancestral graves, fields, homes, and elders, brothers, and sisters, then, though our bodies are in foreign lands, our hearts are with our homeland. Those who still have assets should do their best to help the government develop the work behind the Ã— people's lines and the production and construction in the safe zones. Those who have knowledge and physical strength should intensify efforts to encourage overseas Chinese to invest in and donate to the motherland, and to mobilize overseas Chinese to return to the country and serve their hometowns in an organized and planned manner. In short, we must exert all our strength to go to the occupied areas and behind the Ã— lines to compete with the Japanese Ã— for the people and for political power, to sabotage all Japanese Ã— and traitorous political, economic, and military activities, to launch our establishment of Ã— revolutionary government behind the lines, to launch our Ã— guerrilla warfare behind the lines, and to arrange for the future general counter-offensive to recover lost territories.

### Hull Delivers Speech Severely Condemning Isolationist Policies Advocating International Cooperation and Resolutely Refusing to Submit to Provocative Nations

[Central News Agency, Chicago, 28th] Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech at the "Starry Night" Club here, criticizing isolationist policies and defending international cooperation. He stated, "We are in turbulent times. Those who revere only violence either invade, or kidnap, seize by force, or take by trickery, all have become commonplace. To reject violence and prevent international relations from being dominated by it is indeed the normal and great path. However, those with power are doing the opposite. Politicians of certain countries have openly declared that they will not hesitate to use force to achieve their goals, without shirking responsibility. The tone of their remarks is so overbearing that threatened nations must either submit unwillingly or arm themselves for self-defense. Such a situation is truly tragic. However, if war does break out, the devastation would be unimaginable. Even as it stands now, countries around the world are suffering immense losses in spirit, energy, and material resources due to their competition to strengthen military preparedness. It is extremely painful to speak of. And in this environment, diplomatic policy must be adapted to the nation's economic development. For problems, whether internal or external, are all interconnected. Now, the United States urgently needs to address these interconnected domestic and foreign policy issues. To claim that someone fails to recognize this connection is a fundamental error. Isolationism arises from this. Those who believe that implementing isolationist policies can make it easier to resolve major domestic issues are not only indulging in fantasy but also potentially inviting great danger. It is essential to know that the consequences of pursuing isolationist policies will be contrary to what these people expect and will not guarantee that our country will not be drawn into the vortex of war. Truly, those who plan to provoke other nations and do not hesitate to wage war to obtain what they covet cannot maintain peace simply by professing peaceful wishes. The only way to maintain empty peace is to endure humiliation and declare submission to provocative nations. Is this what we are willing to do? Stepping back, if our country were to implement isolationist policies, we would inevitably have to change our economic structure. This would not be in our country's interest, and moreover, it would be unhelpful to our country's security for other nations to harbor resentment as a result. From this, it can be seen that the result of implementing isolationist policies would not only fail to reduce our need for defense but would also increase the necessity for it. It is also clear that our country should not live in isolation. On the contrary, only by cooperating with other countries can we find ways to solve our domestic economic problems. As for maintaining peace, there are two concepts: (1) To maintain world order based on international law. So-called order means that the relationships between countries should be based on certain principles of justice and fairness. For our part, if we can respect the independence and sovereignty of other countries, abide by international obligations, and resolve international disputes peacefully, we will undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of world order. (2) Countries should establish sound economic relations. In this regard, the reciprocal trade agreements advocated by the United States serve as a model. The current policy of the U.S. government aims at these two concepts. These two are mutually supportive and inseparable. If one is favored at the expense of the other, the result will not be as desired. Both must be pursued simultaneously to achieve complete success. Since we have this capability, we will certainly devote all our efforts to it."

Isolationist Policies in Flux

[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 30th] According to news from Tianjin, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, is currently traveling with his family to Beiping and various parts of North China. He reportedly told reporters that the United States' isolationist policy is indeed in flux. McNutt is quite familiar with the situation in the Far East and plans to return to the U.S. soon to participate in next year's U.S. presidential election campaign. If he were to be elected, U.S. policy toward China would become more proactive.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The U.S. Senate and the Foreign Relations Committee both indicated today that Secretary of State Hull's proposal regarding the revision of the Neutrality Act

has a major impact. Several members of Congress stated that the result of this proposal would be to reintroduce the issue of revising the Neutrality Act in this session of Congress. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate at that time. Senator Byrns stated that Secretary of State's proposal contains many advantages, several of which should be approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Kepper agreed with this statement, saying that he knows for sure that the American Midwest strongly opposes the transportation of scrap iron and war materials to Japan. Senators Nye, Poindexter, Clark, and Borah also

unanimously agree in principle that the United States should not supply war materials to belligerent countries.

Letter Sent to Both Houses of the Foreign Relations Committee

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Hull yesterday sent the same official letter to the chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the Neutrality Act amendment. Political figures have commented that the government's policy has now undergone a significant shift. Secretary of State Hull is scheduled to deliver a speech tonight criticizing isolationist policies to support the official letter. This offensive is largely based on two reasons: (1) In

diplomatic terms, the international situation appears to be quite peaceful on the surface, but the United States should maintain peace in the wisest way, that is, by continuing to closely monitor developments while mobilizing all forces in spirit and material to prevent Germany and Italy from engaging in further acts of aggression or taking unexpected actions. The United States taking this attitude seems to have a positive psychological impact and is actually extremely important. It is generally believed here that the reason why the anti-aggression spirit of European countries has become firmer and why the actions planned by Hitler in early April were delayed or even avoided is that President Roosevelt's telegram of April 15 (addressed separately to Hitler and Mussolini) was not without merit. (2) In

domestic terms, a segment of people is opposing the government regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act. This mentality, although difficult to discern, has strong indications. The Senate and House of Representatives seem to be weary of this case, and time has been wasted without amending it according to the government's wishes. Therefore, the isolationist faction and the anti-government faction seized the opportunity to claim that when the general election is held in 1940, President Roosevelt intends to participate in the election for a third term, but because he has no support on domestic issues, he wants to restore his tarnished reputation in foreign affairs, even at the cost of dragging the United States into the vortex of war. The issue of amending the Neutrality Act has been influenced by this domestic debate and has almost become a case of the tail wagging the dog. To this day, it has become a

force to defeat. Therefore, Secretary of State Hull first issued an official letter, followed by a speech, strongly criticizing the fallacy of isolationist policies. As for the Republican Party, it failed to establish a political program to confront the government during the current session of Congress, and it is also indecisive about future policies. There was once talk of combining with moderate Democratic senators, but this has not materialized. Therefore, although this opposition faction spares no effort in criticizing the government, President Roosevelt's position is now stronger than it was at the beginning of the year. This has been confirmed by Postmaster General Farley after probing opinions within the Democratic Party and among public opinion. Farley said that if President Roosevelt is willing to participate in the election for a third term, the Democratic Party will definitely nominate him as a candidate. This is because people in the State Department firmly believe that President Roosevelt's

foreign policy is still supported by the majority of public opinion, but because the isolationist faction and the opposition faction have colluded and engaged in extensive propaganda, it is difficult to cope with. Secretary of State Hull has taken it as his responsibility to clarify the situation, ensuring that the issue of amending the Neutrality Act is no longer confused by domestic concepts. Some people in the political arena believe that although the government's offensive is somewhat late, it can still encourage public opinion to support it. Others say that the opposition faction in Congress firmly believes that foreign policy is the government's weakness and may continue to obstruct it, so that the issue of amending the Neutrality Act will not be submitted for discussion in the current session of Congress.

### Stalls in the New Central Market Jointly Petition for Rent Reduction Due to Sluggish Business and Unbearable Costs, or They Will Be Forced to Close

Newspapers have also reported in recent days that meat and vegetable stalls in the New Central Market are facing high rents and limited business, leading some vendors to withdraw. The New Central Market opened on the first of this month and officially began operating on the third. In less than a month, such bad news has emerged, concerning many members of the public. A reporter specifically inquired about the reasons from a butcher in the Central Market, who stated that limited business and high rents were indeed unbearable for the vendors. Secondly, vendors in the Sheung Wan Market, fearing competition after the construction of the Central Market, have largely reduced prices to sell off goods, hoping to avoid being affected. Thirdly, the vegetable stalls are located on the third floor. Although the third floor is not very high, not all customers who come to buy vegetables are young and strong. Those who find it troublesome to climb the stairs will inevitably buy small quantities from the vegetable stalls around Gage Street. Furthermore, since the Central Market was rebuilt, during the construction period of more than ten months, those who purchased meat, fish, and vegetables have been going to the Sheung Wan Market. They are accustomed to the route and familiar with the transactions. Moreover, the prices are relatively cheaper, so many are unwilling to change and prefer to stick to the old ways. Although the vendors in the Central Market want to compete by lowering prices and seeking small profits, the rents are too high (some as high as $180 per month), and meat prices are also high (currently, the purchase price of beef is about $30 per picul, while the retail price is about 32 cents per catty, with limited profit). Additionally, the costs of hiring partners are not small. It is impossible to adhere to the principle of selling more for small profits. All of these are reasons for the poor business performance of vendors in the New Central Market. Therefore, some are now unable to bear the losses and want to stop immediately. Others have abandoned the rented stalls after having paid the deposits, letting their partners take over. Still others are secretly seeking someone to take over the stall, not wanting to be burdened further. More than a dozen have jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting sympathy for their business difficulties and a reduction in rents. However, the Municipal Health Bureau has not yet responded. Currently, there are more vendors who are following suit. In short, if the authorities do not grant their request, it is expected that there will be repeated closures due to poor business.

According to the electric cable from the military commander who has not yet participated in the battle, the following measures have been formulated in compliance with the order to temporarily suspend the demolition ofç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtowers) in the five districts: (1) Eachç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) should be guarded by no less than two armed strong men hired by the owner of the ç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower). The names and weapons of the strong men who are scheduled to guard the ç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) should be registered by the owner of theç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) and submitted to the district government for verification at any time. (2) If the ç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) under contract is attacked by Ã—, and the strong men in the ç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) do not resist, the owner of the ç¢‰æ¥¼ (fortified watchtower) shall hand over the guarding strong men within a specified period.

In addition, the Sze Yup Relief Association has been conducting door-to-door donations to expand relief fundraising. More than $5,000 has already been donated, and another $2,000 was donated on the 28th and 29th, achieving excellent results. Today, there may be more fundraising to obtain more donations. Chairman Lau Yuk-saap will continue to lead the team. Furthermore, since the start of our country's War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been enthusiastically donating funds to return to the country. Some have sent letters requesting the association to handle the relief efforts on their behalf and directly remit the funds to the China Relief Association. To this end, the association specifically drafted a memorandum to Committee Member Xu Dai of the China Relief Association, requesting that funds remitted from foreign ports, specifying that the association handle the relief efforts, be approved for allocation. The memorandum can be issued shortly.

### The Bao Hing Steamer Still Dominates Guangdong

Arrival in Hong Kong Next Week

Fire

At 8:10 PM last night, thick smoke suddenly filled the building at No. 23 Austin Road, Yau Ma Tei, with flames shooting out. The people in the building, seeing this, feared that the fire would spread, so they tried to fetch water to extinguish it while sounding the alarm and calling the fire department to send vehicles to assist in the rescue.

### The Typhoon is Blowing Southeast Hong Kong is not Affected The Observatory Issues a Report and Lowers the Gale Signal Maritime Traffic Resumes and Conditions are Good

The weather in Hong Kong has been unpredictable in recent days, with alternating sunshine and rain, brewing a typhoon. The Observatory issued Gale Signal No. 1 as a warning at 10:15 AM on the 28th. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, as the typhoon approached Hong Kong, the Observatory changed the signal to Gale Signal No. 7. The entire Hong Kong Island was under the control of the typhoon, and the situation became even more tense. Fortunately, as the typhoon approached the sea near Hong Kong, it gradually dissipated, causing no damage. The Observatory lowered Gale Signal No. 7 at 10:50 AM yesterday morning. The tense situation on land and sea was lifted, and normalcy was restored.

Typhoon Movement

According to the Observatory's report, the movement of the typhoon was as follows: At 9:45 AM on the 28th, the typhoon was detected within 60 miles of 19 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude. The progress was quite slow. At 10:15 AM, Gale Signal No. 1 was raised. An anti-cyclone blew eastward in the Pacific, southeast of Japan. The typhoon was 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong, blowing northward slowly. At 3:15 PM, the typhoon had blown to between 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, blowing northeastward. At 5:00 PM, it blew to 21 degrees North latitude and 115 degrees East longitude. At 5:45 PM, a mild anti-cyclone blew from the three northeastern provinces towards the Pacific, extending to the east of the Sea of Japan. Also, at 2:00 PM, the typhoon was 120 miles southeast of Hong Kong and threatened to hit Hong Kong. At 11:00 PM, the air pressure continued to gradually decrease.

Gale Signal Lowered

The Observatory issued another report yesterday morning, stating that from 1:00 PM yesterday to 6:00 AM today (29th), the typhoon remained between Shek Kok and Waglan Island, blowing northeastward. Its direction of movement was still towards Hong Kong, but the force of the wind had gradually weakened and was no longer a threat. Until 10:15 AM yesterday morning, the Gale Signal No. 7 raised by the Meteorological Office had been lowered. After the Gale Signal was lowered, the Observatory issued another report, stating that the typhoon was blowing southeastward, 100 miles from Hong Kong, but had turned mild and the wind force was stable. The weather in Hong Kong was blowing northeasterly, the temperature was 79 degrees, the humidity was 85 degrees, and the rainfall on the 28th was 3.5%. The total rainfall this year is 38.61 inches.

Restoration of Normalcy

Regarding the situation on land and sea in Hong Kong, since the Observatory changed the signal to Gale Signal No. 7, the situation on the sea suddenly became tense, and the waves gradually became turbulent. Ships and boats in the port rushed to the typhoon shelter to take refuge. The naval patrol boats were also ordered to patrol. After 6:00 PM, the sea was empty of small boats and ships, and the larger ships had also prepared to set fire to open the typhoon shelter. Each side of the sea presented a desolate scene. The situation on land was also quite tense. Shops in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon were preparing for the typhoon to strike, and the doors and signs of many shops were tightly secured. Shops and residents in coastal and low-lying areas set up floodgates in front of their doors to prepare for any eventuality. The tense situation was reminiscent of the tragic scene of the "92" typhoon. However, after the gale signal was lowered yesterday morning, the situation on land and sea completely eased, and maritime traffic returned to normal.

Postal Ship Encountered Typhoon

Fortunately, the typhoon did not cause a disaster in Hong Kong, and there were no major losses on land and sea. Among the ships at sea that encountered the typhoon were the Lanput Tanner of the Iron Line Mail Ship Company, and the President Coolidge and Maosheng Victoria of the American Mail Ship Company. What about the details of the last two ships Hong Kong has not received a report, according to Lanput Tanner's telegram to Hong Kong, when the typhoon occurred, the ship's route coincided with the wind's time when the typhoon had blown to 9 degrees, 5 East longitude 114 degrees, the ship was east of the wind direction, 60 miles from the center of the typhoon, the typhoon blew southwest to the west, and the wind force was 40 miles per hour, as for Coolidge, when the typhoon blew to 20 degrees 5 North latitude and 114 degrees 5 east, the ship was 50 miles from the center of the typhoon, encountering the wind force, Lanput Tanner was more violent, the ship telegram Hong Kong said, the wind blew southeast to the east, and the wind force was 60 miles per hour.

House Collapsed and Injured People

On land, no serious accidents have occurred after the wind and rain. Only a terrace in Wan Chai was blown down by the wind, injuring one person. The incident occurred on the roof of No. 375 Lockhart Road. At 11:20 AM yesterday, it suddenly collapsed due to days of wind and rain erosion. Hearing a loud noise, nearby residents knew that an accident had occurred and immediately called the police station to report it. After receiving the report, the fire department immediately dispatched vehicles to the scene to provide assistance. As a result, a porter was injured and sent to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. The collapsed terrace was an old-fashioned building made of wooden frames and tiles, which was a warehouse for a certain company. When it collapsed, several porters were carrying timber here. Fortunately, they escaped quickly and were not injured. Only one porter was slightly injured on the head by bricks and tiles.

### The Tourist Guide Agency Guides But Does Not Tour: Police Station Conducts Thorough Investigation; 500 Agencies Operate Throughout Hong Kong, Employing Thousands: The Practice of "Selling Dog Meat Under a Sheep's Head" Must Be Stopped Immediately

In the past two months, tourist guide agencies have sprung up in Hong Kong like bamboo shoots after rain. As of now, statistics show that there are over 500 tourist guide agencies in Hong Kong, employing up to a thousand tourist guides. Among them, the quality is mixed, and many engage in activities that disrupt public morals under the guise of tourist guiding, going beyond normal boundaries. The government authorities have long been aware of this situation and have been taking measures to crack down on it. However, due to the laws of Hong Kong and China, there are no explicit provisions prohibiting tourist guide agencies, so a complete ban cannot be immediately imposed. Nevertheless, the authorities consider public morals to be of utmost importance and will strictly crack down on those who overstep the line. According to reliable sources, the authorities have authorized the police to investigate all Hong Kong and Chinese tourist guide agencies at any time. If any tourist guide agency or tourist guide engages in activities that deviate from the proper path and violate the laws maintaining public morals, they can exercise their authority to arrest them and charge them with offenses against public decency, thereby preventing cunning individuals from engaging in illicit activities under the guise of tourist guiding. It is rumored that several tourist guide agencies in certain areas of Central are employing a "selling dog meat under a sheep's head" policy, where the facilities are specialized and have absolutely nothing to do with the tourist guide business. For example, a building is divided into several rooms, each with a bed. When customers visit the agency, they each occupy a room and freely choose a prostitute to engage in lewd behavior inside the room. This is what is called "indoor tourism," which is actually no different from a private brothel. The police have been closely monitoring these types of tourist guide agencies. Yesterday (the 28th), police detectives were dispatched to search a certain tourist guide agency in Central, but the results are unknown.

### City Tigers Collide

Two Children Narrowly Sacrificed

Various car accidents causing injuries occurred in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories yesterday morning. Taxi number 777 departed from Tai Po for Kowloon at 4 a.m. When it reached Sha Tin Tai Tu Village, a private car of an unknown number suddenly chased after it, overtook the taxi, and sped ahead, knocking down two children by the roadside. After the accident, both vehicles stopped. The children were carried into the cars, intending to be taken to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, when the private car reversed, it crashed into the front of the taxi, damaging the vehicle and the fender, and then stopped again. At this time, the two children got out of the car and fled. Afterward, the taxi driver, Kwok Fung-keung, went to the police station to report the incident.

### The Lu-Wu Marriage

Miss Wu Liyu, the third daughter of Mr. Wu Chaoshu, and Mr. Lu Ronggan held their wedding ceremony at St. John's Cathedral at 3 p.m. yesterday, officiated by Bishop Mow Shou-tseng and Reverend Li Qiu-en. A tea party was held at the Gloucester Hotel at 4:30 p.m., with hundreds of dignitaries from all walks of life attending to offer congratulations, including Soong Ching-ling, Soong Tzu-wen, Wu Tiecheng, Chow Shou-chen, Hu Mulan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and He Xiangning. The event was grand and unprecedented.

### YMCA Launches "Friends of Soldiers" Campaign: Expand Organization, Increase Service Personnel: Hope Everyone Does Their Duty as a Friend to Soldiers

Since the start of the War of Resistance, the national youth have been providing services to soldiers with remarkable results. Various services, such as consolation and reception, wound treatment and rescue, training and education, and recreation and entertainment, have been commended by military officers and welcomed by soldiers and civilians alike. In 1938 alone, no fewer than four million soldiers were served, and the service areas were spread across various war zones throughout the country. This work is a manifestation of military-civilian cooperation and represents the love and enthusiasm of the people in the rear for the soldiers at the front. Now that the war zone is expanding and the service work is becoming more urgent, the Soldiers Service Committee of the National YMCA has decided to expand its organization and increase service personnel to meet the current needs. It will also jointly organize the Soldiers Service Committee of the National YMCA, Guangdong and Hong Kong Branch with the Guangdong and Hong Kong YMCA Military Service Committee to strengthen its forces. The Hong Kong YMCA is responding to this matter by launching a major "Friends of Soldiers" campaign. A meeting of leaders of various small groups of the YMCA will be convened at 7:30 p.m. on June 6 at the YMCA Library on Bridges Street to discuss the implementation plan. This initiative is of great significance because soldiers sacrifice themselves for the country and their hard work is commendable. Being a friend to them is a great honor. If everyone joins as a friend of the soldiers and does their duty as a friend, deeply expressing the enthusiasm of the people in the rear, the soldiers at the front will be greatly consoled and will greatly enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. This initiative of the YMCA not only enhances the relationship between the people and the soldiers but also contributes to the future of the War of Resistance.

### The YWCA of Guangzhou will hold a reunion conference for members staying in Hong Kong tomorrow at the YMCA hall in Kowloon; all members and friends are welcome

The Guangzhou YWCA has now moved to Hong Kong and Macao to carry out fundraising work. The Hong Kong office is located in the YMCA on Waterloo Road in Kowloon, and the Macao office is located on the second floor of No. 1, Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro in Macao. A members' reunion conference will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 31, in the YMCA Hall on Waterloo Road, Kowloon. All those who have joined the Guangzhou YWCA and their relatives and friends are welcome to attend.

### The Kuala Lumpur Return-to-China Service Corps Arrives in Hong Kong: The 73-member group, led by Zhong Chun-sheng, will make preparations in Hong Kong before departing for Dongjiang

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been concerned about their motherland, contributing money and organizing return-to-China service corps. Many patriotic overseas Chinese are willing to abandon their businesses and overcome difficulties to return to China to serve. Their spirit of loving their motherland is admirable. Recently, another compatriots' service corps organized by overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur has returned to China. The 73-member group arrived in Hong Kong on the "Fengqing" ship at around 10 a.m. yesterday and stayed in a hotel in Kowloon. They will transfer to the mainland to serve soon. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed a member of the corps and inquired about the destination of this return to China to serve and the situation of the overseas Chinese in the local national salvation movement. According to the reply, this time, the 73-member corps is led by Zhong Chun-sheng, and the staff includes Chief Executive Huang Yifang, Office Director Ye Jusheng, Finance Director Luo Yifan, Propaganda Director Ye Fusheng, Liaison Director Wen Dansheng, and 67 members, all of whom are male. The members all have specialized skills in first aid, mechanics, medicine, etc. Because most of the members are from Guangdong, the destination of the service will be Boluo, Huiyang, and Bao'an in Dongjiang, so as to achieve greater efficiency. The overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur are very enthusiastic about the national salvation work. The establishment of national salvation groups is like a storm. Under the leadership of the China Relief Association for Overseas Chinese, the local overseas Chinese are all patriotic, so the work is progressing smoothly. The amount of donations is the highest in Southeast Asia. After arriving in Hong Kong, our group will stay for a while to make preparations and then depart. The departure date has not yet been determined.

### What Ways Should Be Used to Win Over the Hong Kong Reading Public? A Record of the "Literary Association" Symposium

â€” Qi Zhuo

Mr. Xu Dishan suggests: Training storytellers

"Hong Kong literary workers, organize!"

"Give play to the great role of raising the bar!"

"Strengthen the cultural counterattack!"

"..."

The demands of the objective environment were so pressing, and the appeals from all sides were so enthusiastic; therefore, on the anniversary of the National Literary Associationâ€”March 27â€”the cultural figures of Hong Kong finally organized themselves. The name is the Correspondence Office of the Hong Kong Members of the National Literary and Art Circles Resistance Association. The abbreviation is "Literary Association." Since its establishment, in addition to publishing weekly supplements in rotation in the "Ta Kung Pao," "Zhujiang," "Shen Bao," and "Sing Tao Daily" newspapers, the "Literary Association" has also been divided into four groups: "Magazine Literature," "Western Culture," "Art Literature," and "Film and Drama Literature." Symposiums are held in order each week. Spiritual unity and work performance are much improved compared to the previous state of "fighting on their own."

For the sake of concentrated research, the symposiums of the four groups have recently been unified. The first joint symposium of the groups was successfully held the other day.

The address was at the Youth Journalists Association. Although many were unable to attend due to being busy with work, there were still many who attended enthusiastically. Those who expressed their opinions included: Xu Dishan, Lu Danlin, Wu Jingsong, Fang Yu, Pan Lang, Wang Jianming, Peng Chenghui, Guo Butao, Mai Sui, Cai Lei, Du Wenhui, Chen Latt, and Zhu Qizhuo. The central topic of the symposium was: "What ways should be used to win over the Hong Kong reading public." The motivation was, needless to say, aimed at the serious problem that many Hong Kong readers spend their time and energy on "poisonous publications" and "low-level tastes."

The discussion was very enthusiastic, and the materials contributed were also very rich. For detailed information, please see the next issue of "Literary Association." Due to space limitations, only the highlights of the important conclusions can be introduced here:

The ways to win over the Hong Kong reading public should be:

1. Strive to make the writing popular so that everyone can understand it;

2. Select topics that are closely related to the readers or topics that readers like, and handle them correctly;

3. Make full use of old forms and promote new ideas, but do not be slaves to old forms;

4. Start by mobilizing teachers and middle school students to love new literary works;

5. Arouse readers' interest from entertainment and sports, and change their wrong concepts;

6. Do not passively cater to low-level tastes, but actively guide and improve cultural standards;

7. The news writing style of newspapers should be improved, and attention should be paid to punctuation;

8. Stand on the position of small newspapers, create works with new content in old forms, win over small newspaper readers, and carry out a long-term struggle with decadent and poisonous works;

9. Expand the promotion of the Latinized New Writing Movement, because the literate reading public is only a small part of the vast masses. To accelerate the popularization of education, improve the level, and instill new consciousness, one should start with new writing;

10. Improve comic strips.

11. ...

Among these, the most interesting, concrete, and meaningful was the opinion provided by Mr. Xu Dishan. Mr. Xu said that he often carefully observed in the storytelling stalls in the Sai Ying Pun area. Many people who listen to storytellers also like to listen to materials such as the passing of the Volunteer Army's resistance against Japan and interesting current affairs news. Many storytellers are now not talking about the chivalrous set, but rather randomly talking about new books such as "Japanese Spies" and "Journey to the West," and he has the ability to tell them very pleasantly. Because of this new trend, Mr. Xu suggested organizing and training storytellers, the blind, those who sell olives, and those who sell medicines, giving them new content, and hiring them to distribute and preach in various central areas. The effect must be very grand. Everyone expressed agreement with Mr. Xu's opinion and added opinions one after another. As a result, it was decided to hand it over to the council to handle in conjunction with the Youth Journalists Association. We hope that the responsible authorities of the "Literary Association" and the "Youth Journalists Association" will launch it as soon as possible and take on this great task.

Finally, it was decided that the central issue of the next symposium would be "What should be written specifically in Hong Kong?" The time has been changed to 6 p.m. on Friday, and the location is still at the Youth Journalists Association. It is hoped that the members of the Literary Association will attend and participate on time in the future.

### Japan's Impertinent Behavior

â€” South China Morning Post Commentary

Yesterday, the Hong Kong South China Morning Post published a commentary entitled "Japan's Impertinent Behavior," denouncing the illegality of Japanese warships intercepting foreign ships, exposing the insidious nature of Japan's actions, and stating that Japan's domestic economic situation is deteriorating further and that victory is hopeless, and that Japan is at a loss as to what to do. The original text is translated as follows: The Japanese explanation for intercepting foreign ships is chilling if the malice contained in their interception is concealed. According to a Japanese spokesman, the interception of the Tieling shipping vessel "Lanpura" was purely a routine matter to verify its nationality. However, the "Lanpura" is a well-known ship, and any warship captain would have no doubt about its nationality. It has always been a British ship, and the British flag is clearly visible. The argument held by the French mail ship "Aramis" is the same. Regarding the "Lanpura" incident, the Japanese action was obviously an unreasonable and arbitrary act. However, it is not yet known whether this action was taken by the Japanese authorities, the commander-in-chief of the navy, or the captain of the Japanese warship. But in fact, the "Lanpura" was about one mile away from Hong Kong's territorial waters and was about to enter Hong Kong, so what reason did it have to encounter such a well-planned and provocative incident? Its intention is still mysterious. The "Lanpura" and "Aramis" incidents coincide with the development of other incidents that caused riots, such as Japan's declaration of a blockade of the entire Chinese coastline, two hundred miles offshore. But Japan still conceals the key points. Japan's attempt to seize the concessions of various countries in China is also one of them. And Europe's situation regarding Japan, and the deterioration of its domestic economic situation, are also among them. The last item above may explain everything. Japan's hope of winning has been dashed, and it is at a loss as to what to do. All these facts are interconnected. Now Germany and Italy need to be cautious in their actions, or it is now Japan's turn to cause trouble, and what happens to the public concessions and concessions, in order to make it have the opportunity to achieve its goals, and try to use it to oppress the powers to stop aiding China. Regarding the Gulangyu incident, although it insisted on its conditions, before the landing of British, American, and French troops, Japan withdrew most of the troops that had landed. Japan undoubtedly believes that this damages its dignity. It is not surprising that the Japanese navy is trying to regain face. As for the political situation in which Japan is now, it must make a final choice, a democratic country or a totalitarian country, but its position in China and its counter-behavior with the Soviet Union make its choice difficult. At this stage, Japan is clearly destroying the British-Soviet alliance and promoting its position against Britain. The interception of foreign ships is also a natural result of the weak attitude of the powers at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Japan announced the implementation of the blockade, and at the same time claimed that Japan's actions "are in accordance with the announcements of August and September 1937, which were accepted by the powers." From this point of view, it is urgent to deny that Japan has the right to blockade, and that the powers have recognized the facts. Moreover, the recent announcements issued by Japan were not issued by the Japanese government, but by the "Deputy Commissioner of Customs" of the Japanese Shanghai, followed by the spokesman of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai. He has no formal official qualifications. As the Japanese authorities said, without war, there is no right of belligerent countries, even if China's coast is blockaded, it must notify all parties with legal procedures, and implement it effectively, not allowing any ships to pass through, but Hong Kong cannot be included in it. What the powers have recognized is only that the Japanese are allowed to check the nationality of ships only when they have reason to suspect the nationality of the ship. This recognition is limited. The powers' tolerance of their arbitrariness is to avoid friction with Japan. The powers cannot give up their rights to Japan's illegal acts again. Except for the United States, the powers are not prepared to arm and escort their own ships, and the fact that American ships have not been harassed is noteworthy. In any case, if the powers retaliate against Japan, they should first detain a Japanese ship to await the release of the "Shajilishi" ship.

### With Each Victory, the War Becomes More Optimistic: Our Strike Force Fiercely Attacks Shengang, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy: Loyal and Brave Air Force Launches Attacks, Bombarding Enemy Military Supplies

(Urgent Report from Wengyuan) In the Zengcheng-Conghua battle, we have consistently maintained the initiative, making steady progress, and the battle results have become increasingly clear. The enemy is still trying to struggle, constantly harassing Luofu Mountain, Fuhe, and other places in Boluo to contain our army's offensive. However, each time they are dealt a severe blow and cannot succeed. Recently, our army has made rapid progress, and our brave air force has also launched attacks. The details are described below:

Attack on Conghua: Fierce Battles

On the Conghua front, the enemy in Shengang and Taipingchang have repeatedly crossed the river to conduct reconnaissance in force against our positions in Mayazhuang. They have also dispatched troops from Guizui to create a false impression. However, our army is well aware of the enemy's plan and firmly defends its positions, never wavering. On the morning of the 27th, a unit of the strike force of the Peng Division of our 12th Army Corps attacked the enemy in Shengang along the Guangcong Highway. A fierce encounter battle occurred with over 400 enemy infantry and cavalry at the North Dagang Ridge in Shengang. After three hours of fighting, over 50 enemy infantrymen, over 20 cavalrymen, and over 10 warhorses were annihilated. The enemy's morale was greatly weakened. The enemy army in Shengang urgently mobilized over 200 infantrymen and several tanks to reinforce them. However, the enemy was already routed, and their reinforcements quickly covered and collected the remnants of Dagang Ridge and retreated towards Shengang, holding firm and not going out. About 200 enemy infantry and cavalry crossed the river from Luogang Market and carried out a large-scale harassment in the area near Kapok. A unit of our Peng Division, upon receiving a report from a sentry, immediately dispatched a team to encircle and annihilate them, killing dozens of enemies. The remaining enemy soldiers retreated in panic towards Shengang. Now, we have established close contact with the strike force from Jiekou and the local guerrillas and have surrounded the enemy in Shengang and Taipingchang in an arc.

Our Army Once Rushed into Zhucun

On the Zengcheng front, because the enemy's flanks and rear were attacked and the transportation line on the Guangzeng Highway was in imminent danger of being cut off by us at any time, they sent troops to defend it tightly and strengthened fortifications in the suburbs. Our army attacked the enemy unexpectedly in Fule and He at night on the 26th and partly attacked Danqiu from the flank, causing the enemy to be unable to take care of both ends. According to the enemy in the two places, they were suddenly attacked and lost contact. They urgently telegraphed Zengcheng for reinforcements. Unexpectedly, our brave soldiers took advantage of the enemy's weakness and fiercely charged into the enemy's position, destroying a part of the enemy's fortifications. Our Luo unit's guerrilla team also mobilized to help in the battle and once rushed into Zhucun, killing 60-70 enemies and capturing two machine guns and over 30 rifles. By the time the enemy reinforcements arrived, our team had completed its mission and safely returned to its original defense.

Our Air Force Achieved Success on the Front Line

According to military news from the front line in Dongjiang, our aircraft have been extremely active in the past ten days, repeatedly launching reconnaissance attacks on enemy positions. On the afternoon of the 24th, at about 1:00 p.m., a team of our brave air force took off from a certain place and launched an air raid on the enemy army in Zengcheng. They soared and observed over the Guangzeng Highway. Over a dozen enemy military vehicles loaded with military supplies were seen driving from Guangzhou to the east, and when they reached the vicinity of Beikeng in Zhongxin, our aircraft immediately descended from high altitude with agile maneuvers and continuously dropped multiple heavy bombs, all hitting the target. Over 20 enemy military vehicles were destroyed, killing over a dozen enemies. The enemy lost a large number of military supplies. After dropping the bombs, our aircraft flew to Shilong in Zengcheng for reconnaissance and returned safely to the defense after completing the mission.

Zengcheng Exortion of Grain and Fuel

In addition, the enemy army in Dongjiang has recently been suffering from the "blockade policy" of the Dongguan-Huizhou area, and there is an extreme shortage of grain and fuel. According to intelligence from the Third District Guerrilla Column, the enemy in Zengcheng has been searching the villages for days and has ordered the puppet county magistrate Liu to force each village to supply grain and fuel daily, and stipulates that larger villages should be levied five dan of rice and two cans of kerosene per day, and smaller villages should pay three dan of rice and one can of kerosene. A deadline of five days was given to pay the money to the puppet association for counting. Those who violated it would be punished as bandits and burned and killed. The villagers in the area along the front line of Boluo-Zengcheng at the foot of Luofu Mountain are living in dire straits under the enemy's harsh levies and have fled to Longmen and Boluo. Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the Third District Column, has ordered the front-line troops to take strict precautions and devise methods to cut off the enemy army's supply.

The Enemy Army in Shilong Harasses the Villages for Days

In addition, the enemy army in Dongguan-Longchuan on the south bank of the Dongjiang has also repeatedly dispatched small groups to harass the villages in recent days. On the 26th, the enemy in Shilong sent dozens of soldiers to harass Nanshe, Xihu, and Jingshan villages and looted grain. On the 27th, they sent 300-400 infantry and cavalrymen to Shiwancailan and forced Dongbo and Tiechang in Boluo to pay 300 yuan in military pay and over ten bags of rice. Under the enemy's coercion, the villagers were forced to supply the required amount. In addition, the villages along the Dongjiang River, such as Shangxianhe, Laoliao, Fulong, Yanwo, and Shipai, have recently received threats from the enemy puppet and were forced to take over the order from the Shilong puppet maintenance association. The villagers are now gathering to discuss how to deal with it.

### Stability in the Jianghui Battle; Our Mechanized Units Launch a Two-Pronged Counteroffensive; Sanbu Stabilized, Market Gradually Recovering Prosperity; People from Five Counties Commemorate the Fallen Soldiers

[Express News from Zhongshan] According to military dispatches, the Jianghui Ã— army has suffered repeated setbacks and its strength has been depleted. At present, it can only hold its defensive positions and has no strength to launch further offensives. Our army continues to advance along the Xin'kai and Xin'he routes. Our mechanized units launched from the Jianghe Road on the 27th to assist frontline troops in attacking Jiangmen. On the morning of the 28th, large numbers of our tanks were spotted operating on the Jianghe Road. Our engineering corps also rushed to repair the damaged roads to facilitate the advance of our mechanized units. As a result, morale was greatly boosted, and there is confidence in the counteroffensive against Jianghui.

Recent Situation in Jianghui

According to intelligence received yesterday from the Jianghui area by the local military authorities: [1] In Jiangmen, Ã— forces are forcibly conscripting civilians, killing those who resist, and issuing large amounts of military scrip, forcing them to circulate in the market to collect our national currency and silver. Currently, all the silver and paper money of the residents of temples and households in the city have been looted. [2] Our guerrillas raided the city of Hui overnight, causing great panic among the Ã— forces stationed there. Barbed wire has now been installed at each street entrance to prevent our forces from entering. [3] About ten or more Ã— speedboats near the Basha Dyke Bridge suddenly sailed away on the morning of the 28th, their destination unknown. [4] Jiang Zhongyun, the village head of Wenxiang, Kaiping, was detained by Yang's regiment for failing to sabotage the highway effectively. [5] Our newly formed mechanized unit arrived at a certain location on the Jianghe Road on the morning of the 28th to assist our Dalang unit in attacking.

Recovery of Prosperity in Sanbu It has been observed that since our troops launched a counteroffensive recently, the Jianghui battle has become more stable in Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha and Sanbu. The public has gradually returned to their shops and businesses, and prosperity is gradually returning. In terms of transportation, all ferries are operating smoothly, and goods are flowing in steadily. The prices of grains in Sanbu are as follows: high-quality Simiao rice, 14.8 yuan per bag; medium rice, 13.6 yuan per bag; coarse rice, 11.1 yuan per bag; raw oil, 19 yuan per "shou"; kerosene, 12 yuan; live pigs, about 50 yuan per "zu"; pickled mustard greens, 10 yuan per "dan"; and loose pine firewood, 1.9 yuan per "zu."

### The Ã— Army on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Line; Frequent Transportation, Showing Signs of Unrest; Tight Security in Luba; Unable to Cross Stealthily; Ã— Speedboats Reconnoitering Constantly; One Sunk

[Express News from Xijiang] The Ã— army on the Sanshui front line of Xijiang has recently increased in number. Transportation along the Guangzhou-Sanshui line is frequent, mostly for the transport of food supplies. There is no change in the frontline Ã— army, but the Ã— army still harbors ambitions to invade the west and is actively preparing for unrest.

The Ã— Army in Sanshui Is Massively Assembling Fir Rafts

Recently, the Ã— forces on the Sanshui front line have repeatedly collected fir wood from various villages and stored it in warehouses in Hekou, totaling several thousand logs. On the 20th, several military vehicles of the Ã— army from Foshan, fully loaded with ropes, bamboo mats, and iron bars, were transported to various places such as Hekou, Southwest Ganggen, and Makou. The next day (21st), they began to conscript laborers from nearby villages to build fir rafts and wooden rafts for them. At present, there are many Ã— army wooden rafts gathered on the river surface of Xinlu, Jiaokou, and Laoyazhou, indicating a malicious intention. According to military intelligence, the Ã— forces in Sanshui are eager to annex Luba, an important town that controls the throat of the North River, in order to remove the threat from their flank. For the past month, Ã— aircraft have frequently arrived in the town for reconnaissance and bombing. In addition to strengthening the defense strength of the line, the Xijiang military authorities have also ordered the tax police corps and a certain division's commando team along the Luba West Road to guard it closely, preventing the Ã— forces from entering stealthily.

Ã— Speedboats Patrolling, One Sunk by Our Forces

In addition, about thirty or forty Ã— speedboats and electric boats have been sailing to the sea area around Hekou and Xinxu in recent days, and have been actively patrolling around Zhuokou, Ganggen, Xinxu, and Fuchuangang, and have sent boats from time to time to patrol and spy along the coast of Qingqi, Jiusan, and Mujiaowei. On the morning of the 26th, several Ã— electric boats sailed along the North River to the Wanjinsha River and patrolled, frequently using binoculars to observe our Chendi. Our artillery at Mafang observed the situation, knowing it was Ã— reconnaissance in nature, and calmly defended. When the Ã— forces reached a favorable terrain, they took advantage of the Ã— forces' unpreparedness and bombarded the Ã— forces fiercely, firing seven or eight rounds. One of the leading Ã— electric boats was the first to be hit and sunk, and two others were damaged in the tail. The Ã— forces fled in panic and scurried downwards. More than twenty Ã— soldiers fell into the water and drowned. After this setback, although the Ã— speedboats still patrolled everywhere on the 27th, they did not dare to approach our positions to spy on them.

### Ã— Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombed; Shantou British Community Planning Coping Measures; Our Authorities Working Hard to Prevent Ã— Massacre Policy; Actively Evacuating Population and Instilling Air Defense Knowledge

[Special Dispatch from Shantou] Due to the indiscriminate bombing by Ã— aircraft, residential and commercial areas and other prosperous areas in Shantou are filled with ruins and devastation. Currently, boat and car companies have generally switched to night shifts, and markets have switched to night markets. Starting from the 26th, the forced emigration of the elderly, weak, women, and children has further silenced the city. Last night, the British community in the city held a meeting at the British Consulate to discuss how to ensure their own safety and maintain and develop their businesses in the face of the urgent Ã— threat to Chaoshan and the insane bombing by Ã— aircraft. Several principles were determined and the meeting adjourned after 11:00 p.m. It was heard that the decision was made to emphasize to the Ã— that British interests in Chaoshan could not be abandoned or destroyed, and to ask the British government to express its determination to protect those interests and make appropriate preparations to cope with the situation. The military authorities have taken practical measures to prevent the Ã— people from carrying out a massacre policy. (1) Evacuation: Starting from the 26th, military police will go to each car and boat dock to check the entry of passengers each time the cars and boats arrive. Men and women who meet the evacuation standards will be registered and allowed to stay in the city for no more than five days. Violators will be arrested by the police and deported, and will never be allowed to return to the city. If men and women who should be evacuated are found in the city, they will be escorted by police to the branch bureau for disposal. At the same time, a census will be conducted to severely punish those who neglect their duties. Those who are poor and have no means to escape can apply for an evacuation certificate and receive a free boat and car certificate and expenses from the Women and Children Care Association (3 cents for adults and 2 cents for children). More than 1,000 people received certificates on the 25th night. It is estimated that the city's population will be reduced to 50,000 by the end of this month. (2) Propaganda: In order to provide the public with knowledge of air defense to reduce losses, the authorities published the proportion of air raid disasters in Qujiang and Shantou in the past, proving that the public should not be afraid of the Ã—'s crazy bombing, but of the public's lack of air defense knowledge. A. Qujiang was air-raided 60 times from August 31, 1937 to the end of April 1939, with 569 aircraft and 1,021 bombs, resulting in 283 deaths, 676 injuries, 770 stores destroyed, and 74 boats bombed. However, in the early stages, people did not seek shelter when they heard the alarm, and 27 bombs caused 751 casualties in five bombings. Later, with richer air defense knowledge, 994 bombs caused 208 casualties in 54 air raids. In the former case, each bomb caused 28 casualties, while in the latter case, each five bombs caused only one casualty. B. In Shantou, more than 60 bombs fell on the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th of this month, causing more than 150 casualties. After the authorities evacuated the population and provided air defense knowledge, more than 40 bombs on the 14th, 15th, 17th and 23rd caused only about 50 casualties.

Movies and Theater

### The Dark Side of Hollywood; Especially Many Beggars; Actresses Selling Their Bodies

Hollywood, the capital of the film industry, has cast an unparalleled fantasy in the minds of every moviegoer, making people who have never been to the film capital believe that it is always a city of gold, that there is only glory and no sorrow, only wealth and no poverty, so they are fascinated and admire it endlessly. In fact, Hollywood is just like other cities in the world. How can it be as perfect as you imagine?

In Hollywood, except for a few stars, the lives of actors are very plain and hard. A salary of thirty to forty yuan a week is considered very lucky. These actors usually have contracts with film companies for ten to fifteen weeks. If there are no amazing achievements, after the contract expires, they can rarely continue to get a contract in the original company. The remuneration for extras is higher. Usually it is eight to ten yuan per day. Although this number seems small, it is very fortunate to be hired for three days a week. In addition to registering with the central introduction office, extras have to wander around the various companies every day waiting for the opportunity, because the need for extras in the shooting site is sometimes decided temporarily, so everyone is exploring and searching, for fear of missing the opportunity.

There is almost no difference between ordinary actors and extras. Ordinary actors become extras after the contract expires. As long as an extra gets a contract, they immediately become an ordinary actor. Their living conditions are also roughly similar. Of course, they do not have the power to build houses on Beverly Hills. Those apartments about ten miles outside Hollywood are the dormitories of these "future stars." Their economic strength usually only allows them to live in a small room of about one hundred square feet with only one window, with a daily rent of one yuan to one and a half yuan. They take the streetcar or even walk to Hollywood every day, and patronize the small cafes near various parks and shooting sites for three meals a day. Some bring their own cheap sandwiches and sit on the park benches to enjoy themselves. But if they cannot find a job for three or five days, even this hard life will become difficult.

According to statistics at the end of June this year, there were more than 124,000 ordinary actors and extras in Hollywood. The average number of actors needed by each company every day is 20,000 to 25,000, which means that each person can find a job for one day every four or five days on average. Among these actors, men account for 40% and women account for 60%. Although many actors feel unstable in their lives and have changed careers one after another, those who arrive later still come in droves, maintaining the above numbers for a long time.

Another thing that is enough to surprise people is the number of beggars in Hollywood. There are beggars constantly wandering in front of the gates of various shooting sites, waiting for the alms of big stars and wealthy visitors. It is not uncommon to give one yuan at a time, so the income of several beggars is even more abundant than that of the actors. They enter and exit small restaurants and sit at the same table with future stars. The only thing they use to show their identity is that they have to wear clothes that are a little more ragged.

Some of the extra actresses have to engage in side jobs because they cannot maintain their lives. There are many kinds of side jobs, and the most miserable one is of course the sale of their bodies. Their customers are shooting site staff and foreign tourists. The price is similar to filming. As long as you can pay more than ten yuan, you can enjoy a whole night. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "One day job, one night job, a week's food and accommodation." It is really cruel to the extreme.

### Strange Things Needed for Filming; Hollywood's Strangest Occupations; Collecting Stamps; Collecting Ancient Coins; Collecting Buttons

Because Hollywood directors often need strange things for filming, many experts have been created, and there are strange occupations in Hollywood.

Some people who collect stamps provide rare stamps to film companies to display them on the screen. There is also a person who collects coins and relies on collecting ancient coins to supply the needs of filmmakers to maintain a living.

Lower 50,000 Buttons

The strangest thing is a button collecting expert. He earns a lot of money every year for buttons. He was originally a tailor for a film company. When it was discovered that strange buttons were needed for filming, he began to do this collecting business. Now he has more than 150,000 buttons in his collection, including the ancient buttons used by Napoleon's guards in the beginning.

All Kinds of Bottles

Collecting bottles can also get a lot of profit, but it takes up more space. Not long ago, a film needed ancient bottles from the Scandinavian Peninsula, and another one needed rare Chinese soy sauce bottles. People who collect bottles collect perfume bottles, laboratory bottles, medicine bottles, and various foreign bottles.

Studying Beards Is Worth Money

In movies, beard collectors are not needed, but there is a beard expert in Hollywood. He can tell you anything about the beard of a Russian duchess, the Teutonic beard, the Italian beard, and the Slavic beard. If there is any doubt, he can tell you if you pay a considerable fee.

Another strange occupation is an expert who collects epaulettes. There is a woman who can recite any dish, from ancient times to the present. The strangest occupation is that a person weaves spider webs by hand to shoot scenes of hell. His spider webs have a market. The price limit is high.

Movie Novel

### Drama School; Produced by MGM; Starring Louise Rainer, Allan Marshall, Pauline Goddard

"Well, are you coming to the dinner of the whole class this time?" Dodo asked her sarcastically while collecting the monthly banquet expenses one evening. "Or are you still going to pay but not attend? What's the excuse tonight?"

Nana interrupted and said, "Don't you know, Dodo? She's going to the Siamese court, and her aunt is getting married to an Indian prince, so she has to attend two grand wedding banquets, and-"

Lovely Nana is always like this-used to sarcasm, she hates others, she wants to hurt others-the whole world, because she herself has been hurt. She wants to recklessly get what she can get, because the one thing she needs-the love of young Flower-already belongs to another woman.

Now she faced Louise, like a cat seeing a mouse, waiting for the opportunity to pounce on it and devour it. In the school hall, they were surrounded by many classmates, chatting and laughing in joy and leisure. They were ready to use others' consumption to make themselves happy. Interesting thing!

But Louise said, "If you want me to pay for the dinner, take it." Who cares if her finances are very difficult! "But you guessed right-I can't come, it's not that I don't want to-"

Nana laughed, "I guess you're dating some handsome young man. What are you doing every night?"

### South China Expeditionary Football Team; The Main Force Decides to Depart Today; The List of Players Was Decided Yesterday, About Seventeen People Will Depart Today; Li Huitang Will Depart After the Team Arrives in Surabaya

The South China Expeditionary Football Team has decided to depart on the 30th of this month for the expedition. Team Leader Mai conducted a meticulous selection process, and the list of team members was finally decided yesterday. The trip will consist of a group of twenty people, led by Mo Qing, with Zhou Runnian as the accompanying staff member. Yang Loubao has also been selected to accompany the team. Shan Shijin of the Guanghua Association has also been granted leave to join the team. However, Li Huitang is temporarily unable to accompany the team due to busy official duties. However, the Surabaya side has sent a letter stating that they must have Li participate before they are welcome to go. Li agreed to the mother association's plan, so he will depart after the expedition team arrives in Surabaya. Li Shuoyou had previously been requested by South China to reduce the penalty period from the Football Association, but the association did not approve it, only allowing him to play in the British territory during this southern tour. Therefore, Li will also be able to go. The expedition team is scheduled to depart today at 2:00 PM (Guangdong) and will first arrive in Haiphong, Hanoi, and Saigon, then take the route through Singapore, and then to the Dutch East Indies (Java), the Philippines, and Yangon. It will take about three months before returning to Hong Kong. The list of team members is recorded below:

Bao Jiaping Rongcai

Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan Hou Rongsheng

Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai Liu Sheng Yang Genbao Guo Yingqi

Li Shuoyou Luo Douwen Zhuo Shijin Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Chen Dehui Feng Xiang Deng Guangsen Yang Shuiyi

Team Leader Mo Qing Staff Zhou Runnian

Another report states that the Southern Expedition Team will gather at the Queen's Pier today at 2:00 PM, take a barge to the French postal ship Guangdong, and set sail south at 4:00 PM, traveling to Haiphong, Hanoi, and Saigon in Annam; Georgetown, Butterworth, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang in the Federated Malay States; Yangon in Burma; Medan in Sumatra; Batavia, Semarang, and Surabaya in Java; and Manila on the way back. They are expected to return to Hong Kong around early September.

The South China players officially met yesterday. Center Li Huitang was temporarily unable to accompany the team due to leave issues, and will take a plane to join the team when the Southern Expedition Team reaches Java. Football associations in various places in Java have contracts with the association, requiring Huitang to participate in the competition. Mai Shaohan's foot injury has not fully recovered, and he may not be able to enlist tomorrow. Left winger Li Shuoyou, although the "wave ban" has not expired, playing in French and Dutch territories does not conflict with British football regulations, and the team leader has decided that he should participate in the war. Because of the urgent time and incomplete procedures, he was unable to travel with the team. It is rumored that if the Southern Expedition Team needs to replenish its troops in the future, they will be called to go by telegram. As of 6:30 PM yesterday, there were about seventeen people who could depart for the Southern Expedition tomorrow, but the number may increase or decrease at that time, which will still be decided by Team Leader Mo.

### Jian Quan Cup Charity Tournament: Championship Finals Approaching, Seven Male and Female Long-Term Winners Each

The All-Hong Kong Open Men's and Women's Jian Quan Cup Table Tennis Team Competition, with a total of 36 teams participating in the preliminary and semi-final rounds, has recently concluded with great success, setting a new record in the history of table tennis competitions in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau. The issue of the venue for the men's and women's team championship, runner-up, and third-place finals has been resolved by Mr. Zhu. The association's staff have been actively working to arrange it, and the date should be announced soon.

There are 14 players in total, male and female, who have exceeded eight-tenths of the possible points without losing or forfeiting. Ms. Yang Wei-bin, a versatile athlete from Hong Kong, has stated that she is willing to relinquish her right to the individual long-term championship final, thereby allowing other female players the opportunity to advance, which is a true example of sportsmanship.

### Yesterday's Rain and Wind Did Not Cease; Baseball Game Again Unable to be Held; South China Team Adds Three New Players to Ranks; Yesterday's Joint Practice at South China Field

Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, a makeup baseball game was scheduled between the South China Athletic Association and the American warship Mindanao. However, due to the brewing hurricane in Hong Kong, the American warship personnel could not leave their posts. Therefore, the regular game was repeatedly postponed. All South China Athletic Association players arrived on time. Finally, due to the Mindanao team's absence, the game could not be held. Yesterday, the South China Athletic Association had three new players join the ranks. After the announcement that there would be no game, they jointly practiced at the South China Athletic Association field. The new players He Xian-cheng and Huang Yao practiced batting, and Zheng Kang-yong practiced pitching frequently. They may play this Sunday against the strong team.

### Sampan Driving Method
â€” Pan Congshao

1.  Not understanding the influence of the oar's path in the water on the boat's left and right movementsâ€”if this most basic principle of boating is not understood, one cannot steer a sampan alone. When two beginners steer a boat, they push left and pull right, but the boat always circles. Learners who have experienced this know that the force generated by the oar resisting the water changes the boat's direction depending on the oar's position in the water, with different positions causing smaller or greater changes. They realize that their previous hard work of blindly practicing was a waste of energy, and that there is a more convenient path.

2.  Not understanding the relationship between pushing the boat forward and controlling its directionâ€”the action of pushing the boat is the easiest to do. Simply hold the oars with both hands, one high and one low, grasp the oar handles, sit on the side of the boat, insert the oar into the water in front of you, and drag it backward. Then, pull it out of the water behind you and repeat the motion to move the boat forward. However, it is important to know the path that the oar takes in the water during this simple action, as this is what controls the boat's direction and must be studied.

Based on the two reasons above, with dedicated practice, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

First, the main force for steering comes from the stern of the boat. Those practicing driving a sampan alone sit in the stern. If the oar's movement in the water is entirely at the end of the boat, the force to change the boat's direction is greater. Although beginners sitting in this position will initially find it difficult due to the strong changes in the boat's direction, they will be better able to observe how the oar's path in the water affects the boat's direction. Therefore, when learning, sitting at the very end of the boat is actually a way to facilitate driving the boat, and it is important to maintain this position.

Second, whether the body sits on the left or right side of the stern is irrelevant to learning and application. Take the method of turning the boat as an example: to turn the bow to the left, how is this done? The reason why the boat can change its direction of travel is that a force is exerted on one side of the boat to push it. Imagine that this force is generated by a single oar in the water at the stern. The water behind the boat must be subjected to the opposing force of the oar pushing from front to back and from right to left, and the bow will turn to the left. This is the application of force; one example can be applied to others. Although the actions may be different, as long as the principle of applying force is the same, the change in the boat's direction will be the same.

Third, if the seated position is still on the right side, there are two ways to turn the bow to the right. First, attach the oar to the side of the boat, that is, at the stern on the right side, holding it firmly with one hand, and frequently push the oar blade that is still in the water outward with the other hand. The direction will turn to the right. However, wanting to maintain the boat's speed while changing its direction of travel is an undesirable action. So, the second method is: this action is more difficult to learn, but must be mastered, otherwise the technique of driving a sampan alone cannot be further improved. The oar is still moved from front to back, but do not align the oar blade with the boat's direction. In other words, the oar blade that is pushing from front to back should be slanted toward the side of the boat, diagonally into the water, pushing from left to right. The bow will turn to the right.

Fourth, when driving the boat forward, combine the action of changing the boat's direction with the action of pushing the boat forward. Based on the explanations in the third and fourth points, in addition to needing to turn left or towards a turn, the actions of the previous two points must be performed. The boat's direction of travel must always be maintained straight ahead. This way, the route of travel can avoid curved movements, needlessly increasing the distance to be traveled, and can also avoid reducing the forward force due to the boat's swaying from side to side. How to maintain a constant direction of travel requires paying attention to maintaining the normal relationship between the direction and the oar's actions each time the oar is used to push the water.

Practice driving a sampan according to the four methods described above. With practice, you will become skilled, and there is no need to worry about being clumsy in application. (2)

### Analysis of the Recent Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai
â€” Shi Yiwu

Since the opening of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" on the 16th of this month, those unfamiliar with the situation have been anxious, believing that the value of the legal tender would suffer significant pressure and that the Shanghai financial market would inevitably be affected. However, as of now, the facts show that the value of the legal tender has not changed in the slightest, and the Shanghai financial market has not experienced any instability, proving that the worries caused by the establishment of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" were unfounded.

In fact, looking at the actual situation in the current Shanghai financial market, what has been affected by the establishment of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" is not China's legal tender, but the Japanese yen itself. Several days before the opening of the "Hwa Hsing Bank" (May 13), the black market exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender was 102 yuan of legal tender for 100 Japanese yen. However, since the 16th (the opening day of the Hwa Hsing Bank), the Japanese yen has fallen to be equivalent to the legal tender. To this day (May 20), it has fallen to only 95 yuan of legal tender for 100 Japanese yen (see yesterday's newspaper). Within this week, the Japanese yen has depreciated by more than eight yuan against the legal tender, and this downward trend may continue to develop in the future.

The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today. I recall that in June and July of last year, the market price of the Japanese yen in the open market was about 30% higher than that of the legal tender (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for about 130 yuan of legal tender). By September, it had dropped to 20% (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for 120 yuan of legal tender). By January and February of this year, it had fallen to 10% (i.e., 100 Japanese yen could be exchanged for 110 yuan of legal tender). Recently, it has even fallen below parity with the legal tender. If British currency is used for conversion, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen had already fallen from its benchmark exchange rate (one shilling and two pence) to ten pence in September of last year. By January and February of this year, it had fallen to nine pence, and recently it has fallen to about seven pence. This continuous downward trend of the Japanese yen is certainly not an accidental phenomenon, but has its objective reasons. It is worthy of our study.

In September of last year, when the Japanese yen's depreciation was at its most dramatic, I wrote an article for the Wenhui News (see the Economic Supplement of that newspaper on September 20), pointing out the reasons for its depreciation. Here is an excerpt from it for reference:

"Since the outbreak of the war in 1937, the amount of Japanese currency flowing into China has been no less than 200 million yuan, of which about 150 million yuan flowed into North China (mostly Bank of Chosen currency) and 50 million yuan flowed into the Jiangnan war zone (mostly Bank of Japan currency). The sources of these currencies were partly funds used by the Japanese army in the war zone for military supplies, and mostly the salaries of Japanese soldiers fighting in China. In February and March (last year), 50 million yuan of Japanese yen had already flowed into Shanghai. In May and June, some speculators used Shanghai's legal tender to buy up Japanese yen in North China, so Japanese yen in North China poured southward, and Shanghai became a place where Japanese yen were rampant. Since the number of Japanese yen in Shanghai had increased, if foreign exchange could be freely purchased, then its value would not be a problem. However, under the strict management of the Japanese government, applying for permission was required to purchase more than 100 yuan of foreign exchange, and the conditions were very harsh. Not only that, but Japanese banks in Shanghai also refused to accept transactions (such as export bills) that used Japanese yen to pay for goods exported from Japan (the purpose was to limit the export of goods without foreign exchange). Given the environment in which Japanese yen were located in Shanghai, and the Shanghai market's limited actual need for them, they became a currency that was half-paralyzed, and its drop in value was naturally inevitable."

The above is the general reason for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in September of last year. But what is the situation of the current depreciation of the Japanese yen? First, let's introduce the Japanese side's own explanation.

The Japanese believe that the biggest reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai are the following three points: First, it is the result of the restriction of the import of soybeans and soybean oil from the Northeast and North China into Central China. In the past, the value of soybeans and soybean oil imported into Shanghai from the Northeast and North China was about 2 to 3 million yuan per month. Now that Shanghai has no imports of these goods, Shanghai will have an excess of 2 to 3 million yuan of Japanese yen every month. The excess of Japanese yen in Shanghai naturally reduces the value of the Japanese yen.

Second, it is due to the surge in the number of Japanese people coming to China, and Japanese yen are also brought in large quantities. According to the statistics for April, a total of 8,350 Japanese people came to Shanghai from Japan. If each person carries an average of 500 Japanese yen, then 4 million Japanese yen will flow into Shanghai in one month, and 50 million yen in one year. In the Shanghai financial market, where the Japanese yen has no established position, it is naturally difficult to accommodate such a huge amount of money. This will inevitably affect the exchange rate.

Third, it is due to Japan's restrictions on the export of goods to China, reducing the need for Japanese yen. As the supply of Japanese goods in the occupied areas decreases, the people in the occupied areas will naturally use the military currency issued by Japan, transport it to Shanghai, exchange it for Japanese yen, and then exchange the Japanese yen for legal tender, and use the legal tender to purchase the necessary materials from foreign or Chinese merchants. Therefore, as a result of the large demand for legal tender by the people in the occupied areas, the Japanese yen will naturally be under pressure and depreciate (see the Shanghai Daily News on May 19).

We also admit that the above three situations are indeed the reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen, but they are only superficial reasons, derived reasons. The fundamental reason lies in the national strength of Japan, in other words, in the purchasing power of the Japanese yen. We know that since Japan launched the war against China, the military expenses it has consumed have totaled hundreds of millions of yuan. The consumption of military expenses is in fact the consumption of material resources, which is also the consumption of national strength. If Japan's productivity is sufficient to adapt to the huge military consumption, then it would not be a problem for the Japanese government to mobilize the materials needed for the war through the financial system. However, everyone knows that Japan's productivity is very fragile. Not only has it failed to supplement the materials needed for the war due to the large consumption of the war, but it has also become increasingly evident that its productivity is strained and heading towards exhaustion due to the large consumption of material resources and manpower by the war. Now the Japanese government is only relying on the method of draining the pond to catch all the fish, issuing more banknotes and creating new purchasing power to conscript the savings of the people and maintain its foreign war. Just look at the amount of Japanese yen banknotes issued, which has increased from 150 million yuan in June 1937 to about 250 million yuan at present (it once increased to 290 million yuan at the end of last year). In the 20 months after the war, the amount of new purchasing power (banknotes) has increased by nearly one time compared to before, while its domestic materials (including savings and productivity) have not increased in proportion to the amount of counterfeit purchasing power (in fact, it is decreasing). Therefore, the relative balance between purchasing power and materials is lost. What is expressed domestically is the soaring prices, and what is expressed abroad is the drop in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen.

The current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is also evidence of its reduced purchasing power. However, the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is not only a depreciation against legal tender (because the value of legal tender has not changed), but also a depreciation against all foreign currencies. However, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons for the reduction in purchasing power, there are two other reasons for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai that cannot be ignored:

First, the recent depreciation of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes in North China has caused the Japanese yen to depreciate as well. The depreciation of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes is due to the financial needs of the puppet government in North China and the Japanese army, which have led to indiscriminate issuance on the one hand, and due to the people's fear of the value of the puppet Federal Reserve Notes, who have exchanged the puppet Federal Reserve Notes for goods (or legal tender) on the other hand. Due to the equivalent relationship between the puppet Federal Reserve Notes and the Japanese yen, the value of the Japanese yen has also been lowered. Therefore, some speculators (including Japanese) bought Japanese yen in North China with legal tender, and then transported the Japanese yen to Shanghai to buy legal tender, which made the need for Japanese yen in Shanghai even greater and put pressure on its value to depreciate.

Second, the issuance plan of "Hwa Hsing Bank" banknotes will inevitably reduce the actual need for Japanese yen invisibly. At the same time, because the "Hwa Hsing Bank" banknotes are not issued indiscriminately (like the situation of the puppet banknotes in North China), Japan has long known this consequence, so it announced that the "Hwa Hsing Notes" are not linked to the Japanese yen, which is tantamount to reflecting the emptiness of the Japanese yen's foundation. Therefore, most people (including Japanese) dare not collect Japanese yen, and would rather exchange it for legal tender with a more certain value (or purchase goods), thus relatively increasing the value of legal tender and causing the value of the Japanese yen to decline step by step.

The above two reasons can powerfully promote the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai, precisely because the fundamental purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been reduced, which can also be said to be the result of currency inflation. What this shows is not only the shaking of the external credit of the Japanese yen, but also the serious losses suffered by Japan in the war against China. If the war cannot be ended, then the consumption of Japan's national strength will definitely increase with each passing day, and the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will inevitably deteriorate day by day. The deterioration of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will not only make it difficult for it to maintain the war, but also promote the total collapse of its entire national economy. The continuous depreciation of the Japanese yen at present shows that Japan is already on the road to total collapse. On the contrary, the current stability of the value of legal tender and the relative appreciation of the value of the Japanese yen are proof of the correctness of China's long-term war of attrition strategy, indicating that China is on the road to a military advantage. Final victory is no problem.

### Hua Hing Bank and the Shanghai Market

â€” Xin Hai

The so-called "Hua Hing Commercial Bank" has a very small impact on the Shanghai market. There are various rumors circulating, but as long as ordinary people don't disturb themselves, "Hua Hing" can't do anything.

However, when the news of the establishment of "Hua Hing" came out, the black market exchange rate for legal tender (fabi), especially for forward contracts, tightened for a while. This was probably because the market was not calm at first and lacked understanding of it. Once its nature and tricks were understood, things immediately became stable as usual. But when it opened on the sixteenth, all kinds of unfounded rumors were spread again, causing the sensitive market to be ridiculously tossed around again. The black market price of public bonds suddenly dropped. The rumors I heard were roughly of four types:

1.  It was said that the National Government, in order to resist "Hua Hing's" attempt to seize fabi, planned to replace fabi over five yuan with "drawing rights" (huatou) in circulation, leaving only small denominations of less than one yuan in circulation. In the future, only drawing rights could be used to purchase foreign exchange.

2.  It was said that the National Government would henceforth pay all principal and interest on public bonds in Chongqing, no longer using the method of "paying once in Chongqing and paying in six installments in Shanghai," in order to reduce the inflow of fabi into Shanghai.

3.  It was said that the legal tender issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be gradually withdrawn, allowing the banknotes and miscellaneous notes issued by the remaining eight legal commercial banks to circulate, and that these non-Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications banknotes would not be eligible to purchase foreign exchange.

4.  It was said that the existing fabi foreign exchange stabilization fund would be divided among China, Britain, and the United States, and would only be supplied to China, Britain, and the United States. Ordinary needs would not be supplied for the time being.

These rumors actually caused some people in the market to become impulsive, which is really a lack of judgment. First, regarding the first point, the wise authorities would never take such a measure to reduce the prestige of fabi. Because if only drawing rights are allowed to purchase foreign exchange, then fabi converted to drawing rights will inevitably be at a discount. A discount on fabi is the same as a depreciation of fabi. Moreover, fabi can still purchase foreign exchange after paying the discount and converting to drawing rights. How can the attempt to prevent the fake "Hua Hing" from seizing foreign exchange by sucking up fabi be prevented by simply adding a procedure for converting to drawing rights? It is likely that this rumor originated from the fact that foreign banks' drawing rights are quoted at a premium against fabi. It is true that foreign banks prefer to receive drawing rights to avoid the complexity of fabi calculations, but this does not mean that drawing rights will replace fabi in circulation. This is very clear.

The second point is equally ridiculous. Even if the National Government wants to contract the fabi in the war zone, it does not need to harp on this old tune. Moreover, the government is determined to maintain its credit and will not rescind its previous promises. Furthermore, the government can restrict the flow of fabi to Shanghai in other ways. Why must it plan on the payment of principal and interest on public bonds?

The third point is also impossible. If the National Government withdraws the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications and allows miscellaneous notes to circulate, wouldn't that be like the government slapping itself in the face? The banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are fabi, and those issued by other commercial banks are also fabi. The former can purchase foreign exchange, while the latter cannot. Wouldn't this be destroying the already unified currency system itself? Even in the Tianjin Concession, there will never be a withdrawal of fabi. On the contrary, when funds from North China fled south, the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Tianjin restricted outward remittances and maintained the original circulation of fabi in North China. Because if fabi were withdrawn, there would be no currency available for circulation in the concession. Then, counterfeit currency could take the opportunity to seize the area where fabi circulates. Would the government authorities be so foolish?

Finally, everyone knows that the establishment of the fabi stabilization fund is to stabilize the external value of fabi. Therefore, anyone who holds fabi, whether they are Chinese or British merchants, can purchase foreign exchange if necessary. Fabi holders have different nationalities, but the value of fabi does not differ depending on the nationality of the holder. Therefore, the idea of dividing up the fabi stabilization fund is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. There are many ways to prevent the inflow of funds to the fake "Hua Hing," such as not allowing domestic products to fall into the hands of the Japanese puppets and not buying Japanese goods.

In fact, even without the above analysis, the stabilization of the market today and the recovery of various bonds can prove the unreliability of these rumors.

### Reminiscences of May Thirtieth

â€” Ji Zi

As the 30th of May approaches, one cannot help but think of Shanghai and the arrogance of the Japanese. The year before the August 13th Incident, I first arrived in Shanghai and stayed in a hotel on North Sichuan Road, intending to take the entrance exam. Every evening, after studying, I always liked to invite a few friends to walk along Avenue Edward VII. Wandering through the Westernized streets, I would occasionally see a small squad of Japanese soldiers patrolling everywhere. They walked naturally, as if they were walking on their own territory, which made one angry. When passing the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in Hongkou, most passersby would hurry past, seemingly afraid to look at it, lest the Japanese soldiers cause trouble for no reason and suffer a loss. The same was true for the Japanese barracks near the shooting range. People dared not look directly at it, as if they had seen a living Yama. Newcomers always felt extremely surprised, and I was one of them. At that time, not only were the Japanese soldiers awe-inspiring, but even some idle vagrants with knives were very fierce and savage. When extremely bored, they loved to pretend to be drunk and beat Chinese people everywhere, intending to start trouble. Those who were unfortunately slapped dared not speak out, enduring the humiliation and avoiding the situation. No one wanted to cause trouble because of this. I saw the same thing several times, and each time I was so angry that I couldn't speak. Later, I went to Great China University. Near the school was the Toyota Cotton Mill, a large-scale Japanese cotton mill. Troops were stationed in the factory to protect it. These troops not only protected the cotton mill, but also sent teams day and night to guard the Jinghu Railway passing nearby, checking whether there were troop movements. The cotton mill also built a high platform for observation, looking very imposing, as if they were the masters of Shanghai. In winter, a strike broke out at the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. When it spread from the factories in Yangshupu to the Toyota Cotton Mill in Fanduatu, the Japanese also sent many marines and tanks to suppress the Chinese male and female workers. The end of Zhongshan Bridge near the cotton mill was full of marines and police, while the other end was full of Chinese police. In the middle were the striking workers. The situation was extremely tense. A single spark could cause a major conflict. Unexpectedly, the Japanese troops threw tear gas to disperse the workers. The order was suddenly disrupted, and the Zhongshan Road area suddenly became riotous. We, the unarmed workers, finally retreated in a very sorry state. I lived in Shanghai for less than a year, and all I saw were the violent acts of the Japanese rushing around, and the Chinese, due to the circumstances, had no better way to deal with it except to endure with tears. At that time, the arrogance of the Japanese was at its peak.

But there is a limit to endurance. Shortly after the July 7th Incident, the August 13th Resistance began. On the Bund, I saw Chinese planes bombing the Izumo warship day and night for the first time. The Japanese barracks, which the Chinese had always bowed their heads and dared not look at, were also completely destroyed. The Toyota Cotton Mill on the south bank of Suzhou Creek, a den of demons where thousands of Chinese workers had been beaten and abused in the past, was also marked with our artillery shell scars. At this time, the "Imperial Army" that used to stand guard with angry eyes and the arrogant vagrants were all gone. All we could see was the national flag on the Four Banks Warehouse and the heroic posture of the Eight Hundred Warriors, and all we could hear was the roar of our artillery fire in Pudong. Where had the Japanese, the "proud sons of Shanghai," gone?

As the 30th of May approaches, the police in the Shanghai Concessions will inevitably be busy again. But this year's May Thirtieth is not the May Thirtieth of fourteen years ago. At that time, our lives were in the hands of others. Other people's bayonets were pressing against our chests. But what about now? The spirit of resistance sparked by May Thirtieth has permeated over ten million square kilometers and been implanted in the hearts of four hundred and fifty million people. The death of a worker in a cotton mill in those days has now been repaid with the casualties of seven million soldiers and the expenditure of seven million yuan. Yan Qi.

### The Newness of New Poetry

â€” Yan Qi

So-called "new poetry," from a certain point of view, certainly has "new" forms, "new" styles, "new" emotions, and "new" meanings; but what remains in the minds of ordinary people as "new poetry" is nothing more than "vernacular written in separate lines." In fact, the "newness" of "new poetry" is definitely not just about separating lines or using vernacular sentences; because "new poetry" is not only "new," but also "poetry."

I remember Mr. Ke Ke wrote an article on poetry, in which there is a sentence that is still worth mentioning now, taking it as a new saying.

He said: "All poems that describe scenery, generate feelings, lament the times, mourn events, praise objects, express sentiments, respond to poems, and give gifts, even if they are created, cannot be considered new poetry."

His meaning is that you cannot find "newness" in the old circle, and something new will never hide in the old circle. "New poetry" jumps out of the old circle of "old poetry"; having jumped out, of course, there is no need to turn back and reach a hand back, resulting in only new formats and no new qualities. For example, ancient people liked to write poems about the secluded life of mountains and forests, all because their lives could have the secluded life of mountains and forests. They sat by the spring in thatched pavilions, dipping their brushes and composing poems, and of course, what they wrote was that kind of leisurely thing. This thing is in the old cabinet and is naturally "old poetry." But if today's poets also write reclusive, secluded poems, one can tell at a glance that they have fallen for the ancients' tricks and old clichÃ©s. Where can we find reclusive mountains and forests now? Even if we find them, can we live in seclusion peacefully? Can we write poems leisurely? Unfortunately, today's world does not allow for such things.

However, too realistic commodities are all vulgar things in the eyes of poets. Western-style houses, cars, and airplanes are all considered "scientific" and not worthy of being included in poetryâ€”therefore, "new poets" are in a dilemma. Learning from the ancients is not suitable, and taking out their own things is too vulgar, so they can only revolve around women's legs. And what about the so-called "new poetry"? The format is "new," the subject matter is "new," but after being "new," it falls into another "old" realm.

"New" and "old" are representatives of "before" and "after." When I see the line written in separate lines, "Alasâ€”where is my home!" all I see is a piece of "old" and a pile of "backwardness." If "this" is also considered a new poemâ€”then I really have to wonder.

Conversely, if you write a march, even if there is less "poetic" meaning, perhaps more "new" flavor can be retained; then at least give me a little "new" feeling.

It seems that some people think that writing poetry in a foreign format makes it new even if it is not new. This really makes me laugh! It was not easy for "new poetry" to get out of the shackles of the "old poetry" style. If it then voluntarily drills into foreign shackles, it is predictable that it cannot completely become "new." I personally feel that it is better to use the style of lyrics than to put a foreign shackle on "new poetry." Because since you are afraid of something going wrong without shackles, then why not be more content and not jump out of the inherent formal track, just look for "newness" in terms of quality and nature. At the same time, on the old forms and old styles, not only should we not ignore them, but we should even pay more attention to them. We must be able to find "oldness" in the "old" before we can create a new soul. But blindly describing scenery, generating feelings, lamenting the times, praising objects, expressing sentiments, and responding to poems, always playing around with the same old set, even if the person is "new," the poem is "old." Now, let me quote a few words from T.S. Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent" to make it clear: "No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not one-sided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new."

### The Eve of the Retreat from Nanjing

â€” Le Huan

"You have a new mission. You must cross the river today. The army commander is somewhere moored in Shangxinhe. Go and find him quickly." A certain department director said calmly and sternly. From his usual bureaucratic expression, it was difficult to gauge the fate of the front line.

"Then let's go!" The four of us accepted from the director's plantain-like palm a sum of money sufficient to support us for half a year.

Blanket, food bag, thermos. Fully armed, like a traveling camel. There was no joy or sorrow on the faces of the comrades. Their expressions were still so tranquil. We said goodbye to the director and the staff of another department and left the mouth of this great monster. The weak sun was hanging overhead. It was noon, but we hadn't thought about eating.

We left Yijiang Gate and stepped onto the embankment full of potholes; every five or six steps there was a deep pit. We found shell fragments, but we didn't dodge.

It was evening when we reached Shangxinhe. It was a small town by the river. Here, there were no shops open, but the people were still scattered on the streets.

"I don't know when we'll be able to come back here after leaving today?" Across from where we were standing, an old woman in a tofu shop was laboriously moving a large vat; but there was no sadness on her face.

"One day this place will be ours again. Just wait!" A young man, probably her son, was actively helping to move things, his spirit extremely excited.

They looked at us with sincere smiles; but there was no conversation. They were too busy.

After two hours of searching through the nearby small ports, we didn't find a single ship. The sun had been completely swallowed by the earth. The surroundings were eerily quiet; punctuated only by the approaching dense machine gun fire and intermittent small cannon fire.

"Report, officer!" A brother covered in mud and ash ran over hurriedly. The sweat on his forehead dripped down, a large patch was wet on his chest, and he was panting hard.

"What's the matter?"

"May I ask where our machine gun company is? Battalion Commander so-and-so ordered me to inform them to prepare for battle. The enemy is about two miles away from here..." he said quickly.

"We don't know. We are from such-and-such unit. Please ask on the front hill," we expressed our deep regret that we couldn't give him an answer.

But how stimulating was this sudden news? Should we wait? Or return to the city? These two questions swirled in the minds of each comrade. Finally, we decided: if we made contact, we would actively display our power.

Suddenly, an officer in a black military uniform ran over from the distance:

"Are you from the Ã—Ã— Division? Is the division commander Ã—Ã—Ã—?" he said, looking at our unit number. He was quite young, the local police chief, still searching and patrolling in the darkness for duty reasons.

"Yes!" we answered in unison. Although the words were so simple, everyone was full of enthusiasm, with a common thought in their hearts:

"If we make contact, then we will have this military officer with military knowledge to contact each other with us."

We started chatting with him, and he was very familiar with the situation of our division.

"â€”You'd better go back to the city," he said slowly. Perhaps he was afraid that we didn't know the situation here.

"I'm afraid it's impossible to return to the city!" A comrade with glasses, whom we called Little Kai, said.

"That's not necessarily true. There's a shortcut from here to Shuixi Gate. It's only six or seven miles!" He looked at his watch. "Ahâ€”7:30. Judging from the time, the city gate may not have been blown up before you reach the gate."

He carefully told us the ordinary and special passwords and drew a simple map.

For the sake of our mission, we parted ways with him.

On the broken, uneven brick road flowed crowds of refugees and armed comrades.

Dense machine gun fire, mixed with small mortars; children's cries, accompanied by dog barks; the whistling of bullets and the playing of whistles, the sky was even darker. But the surrounding of the city was burning with wildfire, and the red light shone in the sky.

We passed through it with hurried breathing and quick steps.

The outline of the city could only be distinguished in the firelight, and we breathed a sigh of relief.

The city bridge was full of explosives and wires. It would complete its mission in a very short time and destroy itself.

Led by an officer from a friendly army, we crossed the fully armed city bridge.

We threw ourselves back into the arms of the ancient city, and our pace slowed down a lot. Chen Xingmou

### The Final Victory

â€” Chen Xingmou

The Zhao brothers had just returned from playing billiards at Mr. Li's mansion and were lying tired on the soft sofas.

"Second brother," the elder Zhao said, flicking the ash of his Three Fives cigarette and teasing his brother, "Why is your school so annoying, with classes every day? Miss Zhu and Miss He are looking for us to go for a drive tomorrow. Are you still going to school?"

"No, I'll go for a drive with you," said the second brother, who hadn't returned to C University for several days and had originally planned to go back to attend Professor Li's constitutional law class tomorrow. However, in order to avoid being a "weakling," he immediately dismissed the idea.

"I heard that Wang Aimei has arrived here. Let's go to Zhonghua with Lao Li tonight."

"But..."

"But what, second brother?" said the elder Zhao impatiently.

"How much do you have left? I only have twenty yuan left." The second brother, who was usually very optimistic, was a little worried at this moment.

"Ha! Ha! I thought you were worried about something!" He immediately pressed the call bell. As soon as he put his hand down, a servant came in.

"Ah He, get me a seal and withdraw two hundred yuan from Manager Xu at the company. Also, get the new white 'sand-proof' suit ready for tonight."

"Yes, young master," Ah He retreated respectfully and quickly. The elder Zhao smiled at the second brother, as if mocking him for not being as smart as he was.

Darkness gradually enveloped the ground, but in this "city that never sleeps," they did not feel how dark it was, because the city was decorated with red and green neon tubes and firework-like lights. A 1939 Lincoln, carrying three young men in white, quickly passed through the crowded crowd. Although it gradually became smaller, smaller and disappeared; however, in the middle of the crowd, they could still smell a burst of perfume.

Hou Ou, dressed in a smart and tidy uniform, bent over and bowed a ninety-degree bow to welcome their three patrons to their seats, opening champagne, buying tickets, they were all busy.

"Chen, ce; Chen, ce..." The latest entertainment theme song began to play, and pairs of dancers followed the dance. The elder Zhao hurried up to find his intended dance partner, but when he went to her, she had already been taken away by another man. He, who had come in high spirits, was now disappointed and angry, replacing the joy that existed in his mind.

"What's the matter, Zhaoâ€”are you getting a return ticket?" "Bobo" Sun saw his flushed face and seemed to already know the general situation.

"Isn't it?" He added a lot of courage after seeing Bobo, and when the second piece of music started, he opened to her front at the highest speed, this time, he no longer failed, the beauty was in his arms, however, the anger still not disappeared.

In the center of the smooth dance floor, a dancer hugging a dance girl who was not fat or thin wanted to swim elsewhere, but forward, backward, left, or right, he was fail, he was surrounded, eager, trying to break through, but still being besieged.

"Damn it! Do you know Mr. Zhao now? Huhâ€”you dare to compete with me?" Having endured for a long time, the elder Zhao erupted.

"Boy! Do whatever you want. Say it, if you have the guts!" Bobo was in the form of a bulletin of beauty like a book. The words and attitudes of the seven or eight besiegers made the man feel greatly threatened.

A burst of applause drowned out the tail of this jazz music. The elder Zhao glared at him fiercely, then used his right hand to tightly hug her slender waist, and walked back to their table with a triumphant mood. He conquered his enemy; conquered the beautiful sheep, and conquered everything!
