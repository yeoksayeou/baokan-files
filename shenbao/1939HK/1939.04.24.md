### Can the Anti-Aggression Front Exclude the Far East?

For days, newspaper commentaries have focused on discussing the anti-aggression front and the Far East, uniformly arguing that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East. This is a subjective demand: China hopes so, the Soviet Union hopes so, and even the United States has the same hope. However, more important than this subjective demand is objective development. Many people still doubt that the anti-aggression front can necessarily include the Far East. Their argument is: if the aggressor nation in the Far East does not join the European disputes, but remains neutral outside the camps of the European aggression bloc and the anti-aggression bloc, as Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma said on the 30th of last month, "Japan does not belong to the democratic group, nor is it a member of totalitarian countries," then it seems that Britain, France, the United States, and other countries do not need to oppose Japan. More specifically, Japan can take advantage of the period of the European war to concentrate on its aggression in China, forcing China to submit, while temporarily not infringing on Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, nor participating in the actions of Germany and Italy. Then, for the convenience of fighting in Europe, could Britain and France temporarily indulge Japan? If Britain and France's actions in the Far East are not active, the United States and the Soviet Union will naturally maintain neutrality. Some even take the opposition of Japanese elders and important ministers to Japan's participation in the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan as an argument that Japan will inevitably remain neutral.

However, the actual development of the problem cannot be so simple and mechanical. We dare to assert that the development of the European anti-aggression front cannot but include the Far East, otherwise, an effective anti-aggression front cannot be formed. Our arguments are:

1.  When the European war breaks out, the Far Eastern war will inevitably converge with it, forming an inseparable whole. Almost all countries participating in the European war have intertwined interests in the Far East. On the one hand, they must protect their own security in Europe, and on the other hand, they must preserve the integrity of their rights and interests in the Far East, so that the execution of the European war has a purpose. Britain and France will not abandon their colonies in the East, nor will they easily sacrifice their rights and interests in China. However, when a European war occurs, it is precisely when their Eastern colonies, especially their Far Eastern rights and interests, are most at risk. To avoid this danger, they will inevitably make appropriate preparations and actions in the Far East, and also need the help and convenience of countries in the Far East that are implementing anti-aggression, for example, Britain needs the cooperation of the Chinese army to defend Hong Kong. Thus, the anti-aggression front actually includes China.

(2) The European anti-aggression front cannot be without the participation of the Soviet Union. Britain and France, who are currently leading the anti-aggression front, must first be able to deliver on their guarantees of security to the small countries of Eastern Europe. To guarantee the security of the small countries of Eastern Europe, they must rely on the support of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's relationship spans both Europe and Asia. It is not only threatened by European aggressors but also by Eastern aggressors. In fact, Eastern aggressors have repeatedly tested their aggressive gestures towards the Soviet Union. In this situation, the Soviet Union, which participates in the European anti-aggression front, will inevitably take the expansion of the scope to the Far East as a condition. Thus, the European and Far Eastern battlefields are linked together.

(3) Japanese aggressors will never let go of the opportunity to swallow Asia as a whole and "expel European forces from Asia" to fulfill their dream of dominating Asia. When war breaks out in Europe, Japan cannot maintain a compromise situation of non-aggression with Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as some people have speculated. It will also take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to advance north to annex the Far Eastern territory of the Soviet Union and advance south to "sweep away" the forces of Britain, the United States, and France in the Pacific, or even further occupy their colonies. When the "September 18th Incident" broke out, Japan did not take the opportunity to occupy Siberia. Later, it became a matter of regret and debate in Japanese military and political circles. They believed that the Soviet Union's Far Eastern construction had not yet been successful at that time, and it would be easy to occupy. When the second opportunity comes, I believe Japan will never let it go again, because by that time, they believe that the Soviet Union is busy with the West and has no time to take care of the East. In this way, even from the perspective of aggression, it is inevitable to push the Far East into the scope of the anti-aggression front.

(4) Furthermore, judging from the struggle for merit between the army and navy factions of the Japanese military, the Japanese navy will inevitably invade the Pacific when the European war breaks out. Needless to say, British Hong Kong and French Annam, even Singapore, the Philippines, and even Australia and India, will become their targets of aggression. The Japanese navy is now gradually in a situation where heroes have no use for their talents because the Chinese battlefield has moved inland. The navy faction is unwilling to fall behind and will inevitably strive to implement the southward policy. In today's situation, where the storms in the Pacific are becoming increasingly diffused as the European issue intensifies, not only can Japan not turn a blind eye, but Britain, the United States, and France cannot believe that Japan will not reach out its claws. The situation of non-aggression between Japan and Britain, France, and the United States cannot naturally be formed, and the struggle between Britain, the United States, and France and the Japanese aggressors in the Pacific is inevitable. How can the European anti-aggression front not extend to the Far East?

According to Shanghai telecommunications, various countries are already considering inviting China to participate in the anti-aggression front. It can be seen that the Far Eastern anti-aggression front is developing.

### The Japanese Yen and the Sharp Blade

— Translated by Wute Gong

This article was written by Guenther Stein in Hong Kong at the end of last year. The original title was "The Yen and the Sword," published in the March issue of "Pacific Affairs." Reading this article, it can be seen that Japan's war against China, even if it does not fail due to major military setbacks, will inevitably fail due to economic helplessness. As long as China can persist in the war of resistance, it will surely achieve the final victory. The full text is translated as follows.

The Monetary Foreplay of the Sino-Japanese War

Currency has proven to be one of the decisive weapons in this Sino-Japanese War. Although many close observers of the war overestimate the importance of currency, both China and Japan have long understood this fact. Two years before the actual military action, the Sino-Japanese currency war had already been actively underway. At the beginning of 1935, the Japanese took the offensive, attempting to link the currency of North China with the "Yen Bloc." They fully expected to separate the five northern provinces from the central government in this way, and finally conquer them completely without Japan shedding a drop of blood or spending a single bullet. They imposed this move on the unwilling country, not only relying on diplomatic and military pressure but also using various chaotic political activities in the north. Originally, China's old silver coins were in a dangerous state. The Japanese deeply felt that there was an opportunity to take direct aggressive action in the financial market. The method they took was to plunder China's silver, especially the silver in several northern provinces, which was China's legal currency.

Therefore, Japan sent personnel to North China to buy silver coins and silver bars at an abnormally low exchange rate for foreign exchange at that time. Under the review and guidance of the local Japanese authorities, the operation went smoothly, and a large amount was obtained. Although the Chinese government had issued a ban on the export of silver, it could not stop the smuggling of silver to Japan. The total amount transported to Japan is not recorded in the officially published import reports. However, once connected to Japan, it can be clearly transported to England. According to Japan's published foreign trade statistics, the total value of silver transported to England from 1934 to 1936 was more than 275 million Japanese yen. Needless to say, this silver all came from China, because Japan is not a silver-producing country. After the silver was transported to London, it was sold at the world's high market price maintained by the US government's purchase policy, making a great profit. However, this level of profit was due to a chance encounter. The real motive for this movement in Japan was not to seek profit but to plunder North China's deep-rooted currency reserve, so that it could not maintain its financial position and would have to be put into the hands of the "Yen Bloc." In the future, the same method could be used to gradually dispose of the entire China.

Although this attack caused China great losses, it failed to achieve the main purpose of the Japanese. Because the central government responded to the situation and suddenly implemented currency reform on November 3, 1935. This move was indeed too late, but it was still a way to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. As a result, silver was completely nationalized, no longer used as legal currency, and no longer allowed to circulate in the market. Instead, banknotes issued by government banks were used as substitutes. In other words, China has switched to a "managed" currency to avoid Japan's attacks, as most other countries have done before. China immediately set about collecting all the silver still left in the country. The government was able to collect at least 100 million yuan (Chinese currency). China therefore preempted Japan. Because this silver can not only serve as a hard currency reserve for new banknotes in peacetime but also serve as a powerful emergency fund in wartime, which can be freely disposed of by the government for the purpose of purchasing military supplies overseas.

The two ends of China's logical countermeasures in the undeclared currency war, especially the latter, made the Japanese very uneasy. As a result, Japan's political attitude towards China and Britain turned tough. The reason why she hated Britain was because it was rumored that China's countermeasures were instigated by Britain. Japan initially firmly believed that China's currency reform, purely from an economic point of view, would fail in a short period of time. She believed that China was a backward, only half-unified, and unmanageable country, and the government's power and credibility were not enough to make the current national managed currency a success; in addition, the Chinese people had been accustomed to using silver for thousands of years, and now they were suddenly asked to change to banknotes, which could buy foreign exchange but could not be exchanged for cash, and would never gain the trust of the people: the Chinese government's reform, although it had recovered from the currency difficulties, would soon face new difficulties, even more severe than the previous one. At that time, the "Yen Bloc" would have all kinds of unexpected expansion opportunities. Who knew that China's currency reform would be smooth sailing and achieve remarkable results, resulting in general economic progress, which was faster than the Chinese government expected. When this reform was obviously becoming a tool, and the central government used it to rapidly increase the country's political unity and overseas credit, the panic in some aspects of Japan became increasingly expanded.

The Astonishing Power of Legal Currency in the War of Resistance

If we say that Japan's armed invasion of China was entirely caused by the effects of China's currency reform, it would be an exaggeration. However, history will probably prove that this was a major reason for Japan's war. It is precisely because the ambition to incorporate the vast area of China into the "Yen Bloc" is indeed not the only purpose of Japan's operation, but this ambition is often revealed in her future plans and is more ambitious than people think. The great military institutions of Japan have finally launched large-scale movements in China. The currency weapon currently appears to be secondary, but it has not been shelved for a long time. Japan has never forgotten its original purpose. Therefore, after the establishment of the new puppet regime in Beiping, the four plans that were first urged to be implemented were intended to lay the foundation for the "Yen Bloc" to expand in the occupied areas. (1) Establish the "China United Reserve Bank" to make the banknotes it issues rely on the Japanese yen; (2) Promulgate new tax regulations to reduce import taxes to facilitate the expansion of Japanese trade within the new sphere of influence of the Japanese yen.

China also greatly relied on the fighting value of the newly formed currency weapon, initially for purely financial and self-defense reasons, nationalizing silver, and the resulting war fund, the amount of which was at least equal to half of the Japanese bank's gold reserves, was fully controlled by the government and fully utilized. This is a major factor why China has been able to exert the astonishing ability of long-term resistance. However, China also knew how to use the currency weapon itself to defend itself, and defended it very carefully. Whenever the Chinese regular army had to withdraw when encountering the superior Japanese army in terms of equipment, in addition to leaving many guerrillas to harass the rear of the victors, it also left one thing that even made the Japanese army feel painful: that is, banknotes. The Japanese were hoping to bring the occupied areas into the "Yen Bloc," forcing the Chinese people to cooperate with the Japanese, developing economic resources to the extreme, and obtaining new industrial and financial strength from military occupation. All these plans were in vain because China's legal currency was just a piece of paper.

China's monetary resistance to Japan's deep-rooted attempts in the occupied areas has been so effective, which is not a fluke. After two years of perfect control in peacetime, the new legal currency has gained the trust of the people. Therefore, the government can carry out active policies based on this trust, even in the areas under Japanese control. The main purpose of this policy is to maintain the inherent price of Chinese legal currency higher than the Japanese yen or any new currency that the Japanese force the occupied areas to use that relies on the Japanese yen. This means that legal currency can still be freely exchanged for foreign exchange, while holders of Japanese yen or affiliated Japanese yen currency cannot enjoy this important convenience. In order to maintain this solid principle, China had to sacrifice a large part of the foreign exchange reserve obtained from selling state-owned silver abroad first. Even at this time, legal currency could still be exchanged for foreign exchange. The continuous outflow of these reserves (mostly due to short selling speculation) gradually reduced the value of legal currency to half of its original value during the year and a half of extremely costly war; however, it was difficult for legal currency to depreciate, and it dragged the currency of the "Yen Bloc" in China down to the same degree. However, people still prefer to use Chinese legal currency, and its strong credit, widespread circulation, and fundamental consolidation are completely the same as before the devaluation.

At the end of 1938, the Sino-Japanese currency war was in a stalemate. China, relying on smart and firm policies, has been able to reduce the outflow of greatly reduced foreign exchange reserves, and the number of outflows in several months is almost zero. Although Guangzhou and Wuhan have fallen, and China has not received foreign financial assistance, China can still balance its income and foreign exchange obligations. Therefore, China can continue to maintain a stable legal currency almost indefinitely, and at the same time promote the ambitious plan of the "Yen Bloc." At least until Japan develops an effective new offensive, this situation will not change. Japan, on the other hand, has only been able to move step by step and is in a defensive position. This is obviously not because of any lack of enthusiasm for her old ambitions, but because she has encountered major difficulties that she has not yet overcome.

The Yen's Blood Blade and Background

At the same time, the "Yen Bloc," which originally included Japan, Korea, Taiwan, "Manchukuo," and the Kwantung Leased Territory, has been expanded to North China in a nominally effective way, and to the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China in an even more nominally effective state. As for the group expanding to South China, it is too weak. The Japanese have never announced any actions or conditions in this procedure, but an analysis of this matter shows that his two major purposes and his current development status are: First, to facilitate Japan's ability to import goods from these areas without the task of foreign exchange expenditure; this move can also enable Japan to sell the surplus products in these areas overseas, and all the foreign exchange obtained will be used exclusively for her, regardless of the damage suffered locally. The reason why the Japanese want to fully control the currency in these areas is not only to achieve these two purposes but also to use this as a powerful lever to promote Japan's general economic development. The method of promotion, of course, meets the wishes of the Japanese military and Japan's own economic needs.

Japan must continuously expand its exports because Japan is implementing two conflicting policies at home. One is to limit rather than increase the purchasing power of its own people; the other is to increase the output of domestic manufacturing industries to the extreme of its technological capabilities. The quantity of some of Japan's trade has indeed increased recently. From 1931, when the "Manchurian Incident" occurred, to 1936, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it increased by a full 100% in these nine years. The development of foreign trade is entirely due to the reduction of selling prices and the great sacrifices made by the country. If war preparations had not absorbed the increased output of Japanese industry, then the gap between Japan's domestic purchasing power and the quantity of goods manufactured by Japanese industry would still not be filled by the increase in exports. Military and industrial war preparations also aim to continue to increase exports. If the current war against China cannot achieve the expected result of finding a solution within the ever-expanding "Yen Bloc," the problem will be more serious in the future. Judging from the following situation, Japan's chances of seizing the Chinese market to win the export of the yen are indeed very slim, and it is even impossible to greatly alleviate the difficulties of the problem. However, this unfavorable situation has added a reason for Japan to try to subordinate the Chinese economy to the "Yen Bloc" so that it can develop to the fullest possible extent whatever trade opportunities it encounters in China.

Before this war, Japan was very dissatisfied with the quantity of its exports to China. In 1936, the last year of peace, China, which had 400 million buyers in Japan's total exports to foreign countries and colonies, accounted for only 4.4% of them; this number was equal to 16.3% of the total amount China purchased from foreign countries. Now, look at how different the situation is in various places where Japanese exporters are under the consolidated rule of the Japanese, where there is no foreign currency intervention, and where the Japanese yen has an advantage! Every Japanese colony, although far smaller in area and population than China, purchased more Japanese goods in 1936 than the country that Japan has always declared to be eager to "cooperate" with and has the largest population in the world.

Taiwan is Japan's oldest colony, with a population of no more than 5 million, accounting for 6.8% of Japan's total exports. This means that Taiwan purchases 83.3% of the foreign goods it needs from the "motherland," 9.1% from other Japanese colonies, and only 7.6% from non-Japanese regions. Korea is Japan's second largest colony, with 23 million people. The Japanese goods it purchases account for 18.5% of Japan's total exports, which is equal to 85.1% of Korea's total imports. The remaining 8.7% of imports come from other Japanese colonies, so Korea purchases only 6.2% of its imports from foreign countries. "Manchukuo" has only been under Japanese rule for a short period of time and has not yet reached the ideal level of relying on its elder brother for "cooperation," but it has made great progress in this regard. In 1930, the year before the September 18th Incident occurred, the Japanese goods purchased by the 30 million residents accounted for less than 6.4% of Japan's total exports. But by 1936, it had increased to 14.8%. In 1930, Japanese Empire goods accounted for 39.3% of the total amount of goods purchased from foreign countries by Manchuria, and in 1936, it had increased to 75.1%. The remaining 22.8% were supplied by foreign merchants, most of which were goods directly or indirectly used by the Kwantung Army for military preparations in "Manchukuo." In 1936, the Japanese goods purchased by Japan's three major colonies accounted for 40.1% of Japan's total exports. In that year, China accounted for 4.4%, while countries completely outside Japan's sphere of political influence accounted for 55.5%.

Judging by analogy with Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," after the "Yen Bloc" controls the occupied areas and the oppressed parts of China for several years, China will at least ideally allow the Japanese Empire to supply about 70% to 80% of its import needs. But even then, the total amount of Japanese goods purchased by China, based on the pre-war estimates in 1936, may still be difficult to reach 20% of Japan's total exports. In other words, Japan is still making great efforts to oppress the 400 million Chinese people to give Japanese exporters benefits that will not exceed the total amount contributed by the 27 million Taiwanese and Koreans in 1936. By that time, Japan's total exports will be 40%, and it will still need to sell in foreign markets outside the "Yen Bloc." That is to say, the main factor for the continued active expansion of Japanese goods exports will still be the desire of foreign countries to purchase more. But there is one thing: if Japan can completely incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc," it can get a good opportunity to gradually reduce China's current relatively high economic strength. As a result, Japan can make China's currency more dependent on Japanese supplies, just as Japan is currently manipulating Taiwan and Korea to a certain extent. However, this matter is far off.

Now, most of the places occupied by Japan in China have begun to be incorporated into the "Yen Bloc" in a nominally effective way. The trade between the Japanese and the occupied areas is now officially called "Yen Bloc Trade," the same as the trade between Japan and Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo." According to the regulations promulgated by the Japanese military authorities in North China, the newly established "Joint Reserve Bank" banknotes have been used as legal currency in a vast area and can be fully exchanged for Japanese yen; however, the financial policy of the bank is entirely controlled by the Japanese. In addition to the "Joint Reserve" banknotes, the original Japanese yen and "Manchukuo" banknotes have also been strongly set at the same value and are circulating in North China. However, the total amount of these three currencies combined is far less than the total amount of Chinese legal currency in North China. Chinese legal currency is still widely used among the people, not only in the inland counties that the Japanese army has not reached. It still occupies a dominant position among the people, although there is a ban on reuse, and if anyone is found using "old banknotes" without exchanging them for "Joint Reserve" banknotes at an 80% discount, they will be severely punished, but it has no effect. The new situation in North China has allowed Japanese exports to take the opportunity to flood the market. According to Japan's officially announced trade reports, in the first eight months of 1938, the average monthly exports to North China were more than three times higher than before the war in 1936. If we include the exports indirectly transported to North China through the Kwantung Leased Territory (before the war, a large number of Japanese goods were smuggled through this route, which has only recently stopped), its total amount, although the total amount of goods purchased from foreign countries by North China has been greatly reduced due to the war, seems to be more than twice as high as two years ago today. The emergence of the "Yen Bloc" in Central China has so far not been due to the circulation of military tickets issued by the Japanese army to meet military and commercial needs, but it is gradually expanding. However, Japanese exporters are also eager to take advantage of their opportunities there. During the same period, the average monthly increase in exports from Japan to these areas was certainly small, because the purchasing power and economic organization within the territory have been completely destroyed. However, the share of Japanese exports in the total imports of Central China has increased by about four times. In the newly occupied areas of South China, Japanese "military tickets" have begun to be used, and similar developments are expected. These advances are obtained by depriving third countries and Chinese national debt manufacturing of their interests. Although Japan is increasing the Japanese export market by forming the "Yen Bloc" in the conquered Chinese war zone and excluding other countries, it seems that it is currently on the way to achieving the first goal, but it is currently necessary to meet the second goal, otherwise, the "Yen Bloc" will eventually encounter a tragic failure.

### On the Way to Wengyuan—A Casual Chat Among Comrades—Friends of China in China (10)

— Ye Juesun

At five o'clock, Deputy Officer Mo from headquarters arrived, assigned to accompany us to Wengyuan. This young friend also brought a chicken, intended as lunch for the journey. At six o'clock, we jumped into the car and set off on the highway to Wengyuan from Shaoguan. When the car entered Dakengkou, the steel plate malfunctioned, causing the rear to bounce incessantly, shaking violently. The driver stopped to inspect, and we also got out to take a look. Mrs. Li Meng seemed quite familiar with cars and quickly lay down to peer under the car. After getting up, she said, "The bolt is loose, causing the steel plate to loosen. Now the tire is already hot. If we continue driving, I'm afraid we'll burn out the wheel." Continuing, she said very seriously, "When I traveled in North Africa before, the car had the same problem, and many good repairmen there couldn't fix it. I think this driver probably won't be able to repair it either." With her conclusion, the hope of reaching Wengyuan inevitably dimmed. However, the honest driver, who didn't say much, unhesitatingly changed into work clothes, picked up the repair tools, and adopted the same posture as Mrs. Li Meng, lying on the ground. Almost his entire upper body disappeared under the car. With a few forceful movements, he removed the damaged stack of steel plates, then disassembled them one by one, organizing them in a very orderly manner. This expression told us he had a strong confidence that he could definitely fix it. At this point, Mrs. Li Meng changed her previous fatalistic view. She also felt that he was quite a capable friend, so she said, "Let's find a place to sit and chat, and wait for him to fix it before we go!" We climbed onto the earthen slope beside us and sat at the base of a large tree. There were no villages around, and few pedestrians, so it was quiet and still. Somehow, we began discussing many foreign journalists. First, we talked about Snow. I think after "Westward Journey Notes" was published, Snow left a deep impression in China. These friends have a good understanding of the situation in China. He was the first foreign journalist to go to northern Shaanxi and be able to understand it well. The translator's note in "Westward Journey Notes" already has a very detailed introduction about him. He was born in 1905 in Missouri, USA. In his youth, he worked as a tenant farmer, an oiler on the railway, and a printing apprentice, but later he actually graduated from the University of Missouri and Columbia University. The first newspaper he worked for was the Kansas City Star. In 1928, Snow served as an assistant editor at the Shanghai Millard's Review. At that time, Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways of the National Government, even hired him to inspect the railways in the Northeast and at headquarters. As a result, he also wrote several travel guides. His footprints almost covered all parts of the Far East: the three northeastern provinces, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, India, Borneo, etc. In India, he became acquainted with Gandhi and many other revolutionaries. He also taught at Yenching University in Peiping for two years, diligently studying Chinese. He was the first to introduce Lu Xun's works to the West. Last year, when he left China to recuperate in the Philippines, the locals asked him to give a public speech. He agreed. When the day of the speech arrived, there were no less than two thousand people in the audience, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. However, the Japanese protested to the local government, believing that Snow was a communist and should not be allowed to speak publicly. The result that day was an unhappy ending. The speech did not take place, and those who attended were very angry and made demands to the government, specifically stating the reasons: first, Snow is not a communist; second, even if he is a communist, he still has the freedom to speak. Later, the Philippine authorities also used this reason to reject the Japanese imperialists' unreasonable demands. Snow finally stepped onto the podium amidst warm applause from an audience of four to five thousand people, more than twice as many as before. In such a scene, he firmly and definitively said: Final victory will belong to China! Indeed, Snow and his loving friend, Mrs. Wales, are both sincere friends of China. Continuing, we talked about Miss Smedley. She was the correspondent in China for the Manchester Guardian of England. During the War of Resistance, she had walked through the front lines of various battlefields and had given several speeches in Changsha, Guangzhou, and other places, all of which were welcomed by the Chinese people. Naturally, she was also a very enthusiastic friend who sympathized with China. Speaking of W.G. Shipp, he was a correspondent for the Pacific Affairs magazine and several newspapers in Paris. Everyone's impression of him was naturally still quite faint. When the Jinpu Railway battle was very tense last April or May, he went from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Through Mr. Hu Ziying's introduction, the reporter met him. Later, we went to Guangzhou together, and he even lived with our friends from the Customs Long March Group, living a collective life. In this common life, we discovered that this friend's work ethic was truly admirable. He went to bed late at night, often after midnight, and got up at four or five in the morning. The sound of his typewriter almost replaced the function of the alarm clock in our group... While we were talking enthusiastically, the driver called us: "We can go now!" The original intention of the conversation was to pass the time, but everyone's inner desire was still related to the car problem at all times, so when they heard: "We can go now!" everyone couldn't help but cheer with excitement! Running and laughing, they jumped down the hillside, and no one had time to end or pursue the conversation that had just taken place! Mrs. Li Meng saw that the car had been repaired better than she expected, and she couldn't help but praise him and asked the driver if he had ever attended a mechanical vocational school. This mental process of Mrs. Li Meng went from distrust to "Let him try it" to surprise and admiration. This is the general attitude of foreigners towards Chinese problems. The situation of the War of Resistance is naturally no exception. We should step up our efforts to let their mental state change from "Let him try it" to surprise and admiration! The saying "Heaven helps those who help themselves" contains profound truth!

### Tongshan and Gao'an Recaptured One After Another; Our Army Advances Towards Nanchang; Along the Coast of Fuzhou and Shantou, the Japanese Enemy Plots and Prepares to Make Mischief; The Central Government Commends the Generals and Soldiers of Li Hanhun's Troops

[Central News Agency, Yuanling, 23rd] Our troops attacking Nanchang have recaptured places such as the Wanshou Palace in the Western Hills. The enemy artillery has retreated towards Xiangtang (near the intersection of the Xiang-Gan roads). Our army continues to advance towards Nanchang. Our army recently launched a fierce attack, and on the morning of the 23rd, recaptured Tongshan and Gao'an one after the other. Our troops besieging Fengxin have already approached the city walls.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 23rd] Since the all-out counter-offensive by our army in northern Jiangxi, victories have been achieved one after another. On the 23rd alone, Gao'an, Xiangfuguan, Wanshou Palace, Shitoubian, Shimijie, and other places were captured in succession. Also, Tongshan in southern Hubei was recaptured today.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 23rd] Late at night on the 22nd, a certain unit of our army launched a surprise attack on the enemy in Tongshan with lightning speed. After fierce fighting until dawn, over a hundred enemies were killed. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated towards Nanqiao. We then formally recaptured Tongshan, and while pursuing the remnants of the enemy, we also investigated the spoils of war and comforted our compatriots who had seen the light of day again.

[Central News Agency, Puluo, 22nd] At 8:00 p.m. on the 19th, the enemy launched a fierce attack near Chapi. Our army calmly responded to the battle, and the enemy did not succeed. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy suddenly used a large amount of poison gas, combined with infantry and artillery, and launched another attack. Our army bravely rose up, charged out amidst the poisonous gas, and engaged the enemy in close combat. At that time, the sounds of killing shook the sky. After fierce fighting until 1:00 p.m., the enemy's entire front wavered and retreated north. In this battle, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Enemy corpses were scattered all over the vicinity of Chapi. We are currently clearing the battlefield. Also, the enemy near Daqiaohe advanced towards Longgang the day before yesterday, but was intercepted by a certain unit of our army midway, killing over a hundred enemies.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 23rd] A few days ago, five civilian boats on the Gan River, carrying over three hundred enemy soldiers, sailed to the vicinity of Shengmi, and were ambushed by our guerrillas on both sides of the river. All five boats were sunk one after another, and all the enemy soldiers were buried in the belly of the fish.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 22nd] Our troops attacking Gao'an are extremely successful. The right-wing commando team has occupied Zuocun, only three li away from Gao'an. The main force is still in the vicinity of Wulipai.

### Zhejiang Unveils Its Political Offensive; The Process and Gains of the Western Zhejiang Administrative Conference [2]

"Revisiting Tianmu, the longing for the capital is endless, the meandering Zhejiang River; it vaguely resembles, the willows by the Six Bridges, the rippling West Lake. The lonely Three Pools reflect the moon at midnight, the Yue Tomb remotely sprinkles tears of loyalty, counting the years of defending the territory and failing the original intention, life is as good as death.

Recovering lost land, starting from today. Yue Jian, should be emulated. Never forget gathering for training, the taste of firewood and gall. Ease and comfort harm the fate of the family and the country. Diligently manage the military with hard work. Pillow the long spear, the rooster crows at midnight, pointing to Fusang." As soon as the recitation ended, the host showed an excited smile, followed by thunderous applause from the entire audience.

The 16th was the fourth day after the opening of the conference, and many people, including the secretaries-general of the county party committees and the standing committee members of the Anti-Japanese Guard Association, participated, because the originally planned party-government-military symposium had been merged with the administrative conference of that day. In the meeting, Chairman Huang personally presided over and presented the cases that had been examined for discussion one by one, divided into eight categories: civil affairs, finance, property adjustment, team organization, military transportation, communication, public organization, and education and culture. The important decisions included: A, strengthening the administrative institutions below the county level, with the principle being: 1. Adjust the district, township, town, bao, and jia organizations, especially focusing on the township level. 2. Determine township and town expenses. 3. Improve the quality of autonomous personnel. 4. Implement integrated management, education, welfare, and defense, laying the foundation for autonomous self-defense. Regarding the candidates for township and town chiefs, it was decided to request those with prestige in the village to take office and to find enthusiastic anti-Japanese youth to assist. The candidates for bao and jia chiefs will be elected by the Bao Min Congress and given strict training through various training classes. The case also specifically stipulates that convening the Bao Min Congress is one of the central tasks of county administration and should be held once a month. The central task of the Bao Min Congress is to promote the spirit of democracy and promote the four major policies of integrated management, education, welfare, and defense, but the most urgent task at present is to universally hold the national public oath. B, improving the Western Zhejiang Tax Office, the principle is: 1. Improve the collection system and strengthen the collection force. 2. Eradicate illegal exploitation in the war zone and reduce the burden on the people. 3. Adjust the monthly tax rate to achieve active economic offensives and passively prevent the invasion of Japanese goods. The main method is to improve the tax collection system. Taxed goods should not be taxed again during transportation, and the tax rate on daily necessities should be appropriately reduced. Goods transported to the occupied areas will be allowed to pass with a reasonable management fee, provided that they do not benefit the enemy. The important decisions on adjusting the economic plan are: important characteristics of the war zone and guerrilla zone should be controlled and purchased by the government, and other usable properties should be transported to the rear as much as possible, and the organization of farmers' production and sales chain (such as cooperatives) and the organization of merchants' transportation and sales (such as trading companies) should be completed as soon as possible, and the input of enemy goods should be absolutely prohibited, and economic blockade should be implemented on the enemy-occupied areas. Regarding the issue of production and processing loans, the meeting believed that: 1. Encourage tea picking, refined boxed tea making, silkworm rearing and tung and persimmon breeding. 2. Organize loans for tea picking, tea making, tea collection, silkworm seeds, cocoon drying, cocoon collection, and silk reeling. 3. Increase the price of export specialties. In addition, there were very concrete decisions on public training, education and culture, and transportation and military departments. After the discussion of the proposals was completed, it was already 7:00 p.m. The chairman also provided answers to the many temporary proposals of the county party committees based on the decisions of the meeting.

The closing ceremony of the conference was held at 8:00 a.m. on the 17th. In addition to the personnel attending the administrative conference and the party-government-military symposium, there were more than 1,000 people, including all teachers and students of Western Zhejiang Middle School, the Second Political Work Brigade, the Wartime Staff Training Class, and all officials. Chairman Huang delivered the closing speech and expressed his feelings about the conference, saying roughly: (1) Regardless of whether the conference was successful, it was a great success in itself, because our ability to hold the conference here proves that we have the will to advance and the spirit of attack. (2) From the reports of the counties, we know that each county has made some progress. (3) This conference broke the previous conference format, and the purpose of the conference was to solve problems, and the result did answer many difficult problems.

The most significant harvest of this conference was the accuracy of all the resolutions and the spirit of harmony, cooperation, and unity shown in the conference process, which enabled everyone who participated in the conference to maintain a consistently high level of morale.

The political offensive under Zhejiang's "offensive politics" has determined a complete implementation plan in this Western Zhejiang Administrative Conference. [End]

### Continuous Victories in Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Shanxi; The Japanese Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Shanxi; Over Two Thousand Corpses on Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Commander Taniguchi Killed in Action

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Shanghai News: Over 500 wounded Japanese soldiers, loaded on the No. 109 transport ship flying the Red Cross flag, left Shanghai for Japan on the morning of the 23rd.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 23rd] Six hundred enemy corpses were transported north from Wenxi daily. There are still two hundred corpses in the city. There are also seventy or eighty corpses in Xiangshanzhuang. In Daxiaze, Xiguocun, and Shangguocun, a total of over three hundred corpses are placed. A total of over one thousand four hundred corpses were found to be the corpses of Japanese soldiers who died on Zhongtiao Mountain this time and were not burned. In addition, over four hundred enemy corpses were transported north from Anyi on the afternoon of the 15th, reaching nearly two thousand corpses. This is only a partial statistic, but it can already be seen that the Japanese invaders suffered heavy losses.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 22nd] Japanese Commander Taniguchi went to the Fushan area from Linfen on the 19th to supervise the battle and was surrounded by our troops midway. Several cars were destroyed. It is reported that Taniguchi was killed in action.

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 21st] After we adopted an offensive posture on the Ping-Sui Line, the guerrillas cooperated with the regular army and achieved success one after another. The railway between Baotou and Wangdatong has now been damaged by our troops and it is difficult to move trains.

[Chongqing News Agency, Yulin, 22nd] Our troops attacked the Magaitu Station on the Ping-Sui Railway at 11:00 p.m. on the 15th and almost completely annihilated over a hundred enemy soldiers. The Japanese stationmaster disguised himself and fled to Zhangjiakou. We seized a large number of military supplies.

### Optimistic Prospects for China's War of Resistance; Soviet Pravda Publishes Special Commentary

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Moscow, 22nd, TASS: Soviet Leningrad Pravda recently published an article entitled "The Liberation War of the Chinese People," stating that the war in the Pacific region is the first national liberation war of such a large scale. The Chinese people have shown unprecedented resistance to imperialists in the midst of oppression for the first time. The Japanese aggressors in China are now being resisted by millions of armed people organized into regular armies and guerrillas. The barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese bandits have not only failed to break the resistance of the Chinese people, but have strengthened their combat preparations. The actions of the Chinese guerrillas have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the Japanese army. The entire Chinese people are permeated with the idea of striving for final victory in the protracted war of resistance. Patriotic Chinese men and women have responded to all capitulationist arguments with a strong rejection. The Chinese people are uniting all forces, preparing to make a major blow that will completely defeat the enemy. The amazing unlimited energy of the great Chinese people is hidden, and the source is vast. The reason why all powerful classes of the people can unite and fight against Japanese bandits cannot be separated from the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front. The Chinese people, relying on their own strength and the assistance of progressive mankind, are confident that they will achieve final victory. The revolutionization of the Japanese rear is of great help to this. The living conditions of the Japanese people are deteriorating, prices are rising, and many companies are closing down due to lack of raw materials, leading to a continuous increase in unemployed workers. The harvest is decreasing day by day, and the number of conflicts between farmers and landlords is increasing. The dissatisfaction of the vast masses of the Japanese people affects the maintenance of military morale. Incidents of troop mutinies and damage to military discipline are becoming increasingly common. The protracted nature of the war, the huge military expenses, and the Japanese government's reliance on domestic debt to make up for its consumption, as well as the National Mobilization Act, have all sharpened the contradictions among the Japanese ruling class. The newspaper concluded by saying that the powerful anti-Japanese national united front, the increasing unity of the Chinese people, and the disintegration of Japanese imperialist spies and agents in the Jingwei faction and Trotskyite bandits all guarantee that the Chinese people will achieve glorious victory and complete liberation.

### The 5th Annual Conference of the Geopolitics Society: Discussion of Wartime Land Policy, Concluding Today in Chongqing, with President Chiang's Address

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The China Geopolitics Society held its 5th annual conference opening ceremony at 8:00 AM on the 23rd at the Eastern Sichuan Normal School. Chairman Nian Zheng presided, and President Chiang delivered an address offering encouragement. The Central Executive Committee dispatched Minister of Social Affairs Mr. Chen Lifu to attend and deliver an address. Representatives from the Ministries of Education and Interior also participated. Land administration agencies from various provinces sent representatives carrying detailed reports and proposals. As of last night, over seventy units, including those of Ji Yu and Zhu Zongliang, had registered their members. Members who made special trips to Chongqing to participate included Zeng Jikuan, Dean of Academic Affairs of the National Northwest Agricultural College; Gao Xin, Director of the Guangdong Land Administration Bureau; Tang Qizi, Director of the Jiangxi Reclamation Office; Zhu Ping, Director of the Sichuan Land Reporting Office; Hua Xi Reclamation Company; Tang Huisu, Director of the Yunnan Reclamation Area; and Zhang Daochun, representative from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. The society received over fifty theses and solicited articles, which have been compiled into a conference proceedings and various monographs and special publications, providing valuable references for post-conference research on land administration.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The 5th annual conference of the China Geopolitics Society opened in Chongqing at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, presided over by Chairman Xiao Zheng. Minister Chen Lifu delivered a speech, stating that the implementation of land administration work is the foundation for completing local self-governance. Everything, from surveying households, training soldiers, organizing land, reclaiming wasteland, opening transportation, and increasing production, relies on the detailed discussions of the conference attendees to inform government decisions. The first general meeting was held at 2:00 PM to discuss China's post-war land policies. The second general meeting will be held on the morning of the 24th to discuss economic development in the Southwest and land issues. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.

Original Text of President Chiang's Address

President Chiang's address was as follows: "Fellow members of the 5th annual conference of the China Geopolitics Society, 'Do not hoard wealth that should be abandoned on the ground; do not begrudge effort that should not be devoted to oneself.' Exerting human effort to develop the benefits of the land embodies the principles of improving livelihoods and utilizing resources to their fullest extent. The Principle of People's Livelihood, advocated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, takes equalization of land rights as its guiding principle. Articles 10 and 11 of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction further specify its concrete methods. As local self-governance begins to be implemented, it is particularly important to set land prices and cultivate wasteland. The people rely on the land for their livelihood, and the full development of land productivity depends on the effective use and distribution of land. Neglecting the benefits of the land will inevitably lead to local desolation. This not only breeds social inequality but also impedes the progress of economic life. All of you embrace the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and are diligently studying land reform. You should know that strengthening the power of resistance against Japan greatly depends on the development of land resources, and the day of victory in the War of Resistance will be an excellent opportunity to thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If you can adapt to the times, examine sound regulations, and carefully explore policies, so that farmers are no longer burdened by their plows and the masses benefit from increased food production, then the land policies advocated by our party for decades can be expected to be realized quickly. This will not only contribute to adequate food and strong soldiers but also benefit the current situation of the War of Resistance. Zhongzheng believes that resolving the land problem is the most urgent task in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. What I expect from you is not only to pool your wisdom during the conference but also to conduct separate, in-depth, and practical discussions after the conference. It is not only to formulate general plans but also to address the specific details of land policy, rectify past shortcomings, and offer practical and feasible solutions. I hope you will all strive to achieve this."

### The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army: Recent Situation of Bitter Fighting in the Northeast; The Japanese Army is Unable to Massively Enter Shanhaiguan Pass, Completing the Task of Strategic Containment

[Special Telegram from Harbin, 23rd] The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, which persists in heroic fighting in the Northeast, has been intensifying its active operations since the start of the War of Resistance, employing skillful guerrilla tactics to continuously strike at the Japanese and puppet troops. This has prevented the Japanese and puppet troops from massively entering Shanhaiguan Pass to fight. In the entire Chinese national anti-Japanese war, the Northeast Volunteer Army, scattered among the mountains and rivers, has indeed coordinated with the Supreme Military Authority to accomplish the glorious task of effective strategic containment.

The following is an excerpt from a telegram sent by the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, outlining the general situation of the anti-Japanese war waged by the soldiers and civilians in the Northeast: (1) The Li Regiment of Yang Jingyu's First Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army engaged in a fierce three-hour battle with the Zhou and Yu regiments of the puppet army in the Shibanhe area of Mengjiang County on March 11th. The puppet army abandoned over fifty corpses and fled in disarray with a large amount of ammunition. (2) The Cao Regiment of Yang Jingyu's army engaged in combat with the Zeng Yuan unit of the Japanese army in Shiqing Donggou area of Ji'an on the morning of March 15th, killing over fifty Japanese soldiers. We also suffered some casualties. (3) The Liang Detachment of Yang Jingyu's army surrounded the command of the Japanese and puppet mountain forest suppression team in the southeastern ridge area of Xiangdian County on the morning of March 20th. In addition to killing sixteen people and capturing twenty-four alive, they occupied the command. Another guerrilla detachment engaged in a fierce battle with the Nakagawa and Tomimori units of the Japanese and puppet troops and the Myanmar puppet police in the Mujihe area of Myanmar County on March 6th, inflicting countless casualties before withdrawing. (4) The more than five hundred men of Li Yanlu's Fourth Army, who were conducting guerrilla warfare in Yiguan, Bohe, and other counties, engaged in fierce battles with the Song Kui unit's Hirota suppression team on March 5th and 6th. The Japanese army was taken by surprise and suffered heavy casualties, fleeing in disarray. We also suffered over fifty casualties and handed over five captured Japanese soldiers to the "Political Security Company" for education. (5) The Li Xuefu Regiment of the Seventh Army encountered the Taniyū unit of the Qianfu unit of the Japanese army in Laoying Manxing of Raohe on the evening of March 11th. The Japanese were caught off guard and the entire army collapsed, and we captured a cannon and several machine guns. (6) The Miao Detachment of Xie Wendong's Eighth Army engaged in combat outside Baoqing City in early March, fighting extremely fiercely. After achieving a major victory, our army entered the deep forest for rest and reorganization. (7) Several hundred men under Li Huatang of the Ninth Army ambushed the Sawada suppression team of the Japanese army on the eastern mountain area of Jiamusi on March 17th. As the Japanese army passed by, shouts of killing arose, and over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops were killed, and three armored vehicles were captured.

### The Various War Zones of North China in Heroic Resistance: Administrative Institutions Gradually Recovered, Material Assistance Awaits Debate

[Hong Kong News] County Magistrate xxx of a county in the occupied area of Hebei went to Tianjin from Ningjin on the 2nd of this month, then transferred to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong via sea defense to Kunming to go to Chongqing for official business. The reporter took advantage of his stay in Hong Kong to interview him. He described in detail the situation of the military and civilians resisting Japan in the occupied area. The following is a record:

Strong morale among the people in the occupied area: Mr. x said first that the Japanese army in the occupied area intends to "sweep up" our guerrillas at all times. Currently, the Japanese army has 300 troops stationed in each county, with strict defenses against our guerrillas, but they are often embarrassed by the guerrillas. The morale of the people in the occupied areas of North China is extremely high because we still maintain administrative sovereignty in each occupied county. All government orders are presided over by responsible officials, no different from non-occupied counties. Among them, there are even female county magistrates, who are all able to work hard and lead the anti-Japanese work. There is no distinction between front and rear in the guerrilla areas, so the most difficult problem is the placement of wounded soldiers. As for the supply of medicines, it can still be barely managed.

The Japanese army's attempt to undermine our finance is unsuccessful: Regarding the Japanese army's attempt to undermine our finance in North China with counterfeit currency, Mr. x said that this move has clearly failed because counterfeit currency cannot flow into the guerrilla areas. In order to force the absorption of our national currency, the Japanese army has set strict rules that those who possess five or ten yuan or more of the national currency will have it confiscated, and those who exceed one hundred yuan will be executed. The conspiracy to undermine our finance and the viciousness of the methods are evident from this. However, after the Japanese army searches for banknotes, they often seize them for themselves.

The Eighth Route Army has □□0,000 troops: Mr. x continued to describe the situation of the Eighth Route Army in the occupied areas of North China, saying that the Eighth Route Army has a regular army of x divisions stationed in various parts of the area. However, although the number is only x divisions, in reality, including the guerrillas, there are a total of xx0,000 troops, so the expenses are quite strained and have to be greatly reduced. The supply of ammunition is particularly difficult. Currently, the most used in the guerrilla area is hand grenades, because the large bells of the temples and the homemade gunpowder of the villagers can be used to make hand grenades. As for the current location of the guerrillas, the main distribution is as follows:

Troops: Areas of Stationing

Dike: As far as northeast of Beiping

Deng x: Eastern Hebei area

Xu Gou: Eastern Suiyuan and Chahar area

Xiao x: East of the Jinpu Railway

He Long: Central Hebei area

Nie Rongzhen: Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region

Liu Bocheng: Southern Hebei area

Charging ahead, retreating behind: Mr. x also said that since Chairman Lu Zhonglin of Hebei took office, the political power has been concentrated, and the Communist Party members of the Eighth Route Army have set an example in order to achieve the solid unified front and avoid unnecessary disputes between parties. At the same time, they also lead the people to achieve the following goals:

Charging ahead,

Retreating behind,

Lightly wounded do not leave the front line,

Seriously wounded do not cry in pain,

Give up life but not the gun,

Shed blood but not tears,

Therefore, the impression of the people of North China on the Eighth Route Army is extremely good, and the spirit of military-civilian cooperation is demonstrated everywhere.

### US Fleet Commander Leaves Hankou

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A dispatch from Hankou on the 23rd states that Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, visited here a few days ago and returned east by ship on the 23rd. In addition to Rear Admiral Yarnell, the ship also carried the entire staff of the Soviet Consulate in Hankou, ten Soviet citizens, a TASS reporter, and some American citizens.

### Freedom to Hang National Flags: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests Against French Concession's Interference with Flag Display in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Regarding the matter of the Shanghai French Concession authorities interfering with the freedom of Chinese residents to hang national flags within the concession, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had lodged protests with the French Embassy on two occasions last month. Recently, the authorities forcibly removed and confiscated our national flags on April 19th and arrested residents. Upon learning of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately demanded that the French Embassy correct the attitude adopted by the authorities and guarantee that they would no longer interfere with the residents' freedom to display their national flags in the future. The Shanghai French Concession authorities have now returned the confiscated national flags and released the arrested residents. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still not satisfied and has made verbal and written protests to the French Embassy, demanding that they no longer interfere with the freedom to display national flags in the future.

### Competition Between European and Asian Blocs to Enlist Smaller Countries; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Near Conclusion; Chamberlain to Issue Statement

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, today reported to the Soviet government on the British government's views on the European situation and plans to travel to London tomorrow. This move indicates that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations are nearing completion.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] There is much speculation here about whether the future agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will include the Far East issue, while news from Paris is clearly different from what was reported in London yesterday. Political commentators believe that after the Soviet ambassador returns to London, Chamberlain will issue a statement early this week outlining the progress of the negotiations.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] "The Times" diplomatic correspondent pointed out today that Britain's policy towards the Balkans is to establish a group of neutral countries adopting a mutual aid system. At the same time, "The Observer" diplomatic correspondent stated that the talks between Britain, France, and Turkey are for the Eastern Mediterranean issue. "The Times" diplomatic correspondent discussed the relationship between Poland and Romania in the anti-aggression front, saying that the two countries have the same views on Soviet aid, and the relationship should be rebuilt. Therefore, the Polish-Romanian treaty should also be amended. The Romanian Foreign Minister's visit to London should be able to explain everything.

[Haitong Agency, London, 22nd] "The Times" diplomatic correspondent here stated that Britain is convinced that the Soviet Union will express deep sympathy for Britain in the event of war and will provide practical assistance to its Western European neighbors. However, it is not yet possible to say what kind of agreement will be signed between Britain and the Soviet Union. The correspondent also stated that the Soviet Union's joining the anti-aggression front will be a positive step in establishing collective security. The correspondent mentioned the negotiations with the Balkans, saying that Britain is very aware of Bulgaria's position and difficulties. However, the Balkan countries forming a solid front is the only effective way to prevent aggressive countries from dividing or controlling Southeast Europe, and it is pointed out to Bulgaria and its neighbors that their interests are consistent and that an agreement must be reached immediately.

European Situation to Undergo New Changes

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Political activities in various countries continue unabated. The European situation seems poised for new changes. Today, newspapers here unanimously emphasized these activities. Democratic countries and the Axis powers are now competing with each other to enlist smaller countries, hoping to complete this before Friday, as Hitler will respond to President Roosevelt's suggestions on that day. "The Times" wrote today, "Although the diplomatic situation is ever-changing and constantly uncertain, one thing is certain: Britain should develop its combat power to the highest level in the shortest possible time." At the same time, several newspapers, led by "The Observer," discussed the conscription issue again. They unanimously believed that the issue would be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. At the same time, it is widely rumored that France has suggested this issue to the British government as an emergency measure in peacetime.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] European diplomatic activities continue unabated. The Axis powers are putting pressure on the Balkan countries, especially Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, which has attracted close attention. Axis countries are reportedly attempting to mediate the disputes between Hungary and Yugoslavia and are willing to allow Greece to reclaim Thessaloniki and hand it over to Yugoslavia in exchange for restoring the 1913 border. However, the current goal of the Axis countries is to isolate France and then attack French colonies.

Italian-Yugoslav Talks to be Broadly Discussed

[Central News Agency, Venice, 23rd] The Italian and Yugoslav foreign ministers held their first talks here yesterday. The general atmosphere was good.

[Reuters, Venice, 22nd] Reportedly, the first meeting between the Yugoslav and Italian foreign ministers went well. Before arriving in Venice by train, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister solemnly stated during a meeting with guests that the recent declarations by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano regarding Italy's intention to maintain friendship have greatly pleased the Yugoslav people. Italian political figures believe that the agreement signed between Hungary and Yugoslavia will be one of the main topics of discussion at this meeting between the two foreign ministers.

[Reuters, Venice, 23rd] After the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister, a communiqué was immediately issued, declaring that various issues related to the international situation of the two countries and the Albanian event had been discussed. The communiqué attested to the extreme friendship between the two countries.

[Central News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Political circles say that Germany and Italy are inviting Yugoslavia to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact, or at least demand that Yugoslavia state that it has no intention of joining the defensive alliance led by Britain and France. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit Germany on the 26th, and the German side will naturally exert pressure on him again at that time. However, according to responsible sources, Yugoslavia will not be involved in such machinations.

[Central News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Ten thousand young people representing various universities and political parties in Yugoslavia held a mass rally yesterday, resolving to support the democratic countries and urging the government not to use the guise of neutrality to conspire to aid the aggressor countries.

### British Conscription System: Implementation Seems Inevitable; Cabinet to Make a Firm Decision

[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] It is widely believed that Britain is about to implement a disguised conscription system. In recent weeks, Britain has made careful preparations for this step. The British government will actively discuss it this week. According to "The Daily Telegraph," the cabinet meeting on Monday will decide on this issue, and it is expected that the cabinet will agree to a partial conscription system. If the cabinet decides to take this step, then all men aged 18 to 21, except for certain professions, will be conscripted and will receive military training within a few weeks. It is said that the change in the British government's attitude is due to the recent note from the French government, which stated that nothing would convince the smaller countries of Europe of Britain's determination to resist aggression more than implementing some kind of conscription method. Chamberlain was deeply impressed by this. According to estimates, a limited conscription system will initially enlist 500,000 men, which is faster in terms of mobilization than the Territorial Army's suggestion. French Ambassador to Britain Corbin visited Chamberlain on Friday and said that France welcomes Britain's adoption of some kind of conscription system, and that this move would best demonstrate to the world that Britain's preparations for contingencies are extremely thorough.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Informed sources in political circles here recently declared that the implementation of a conscription system in Britain is inevitable and that the cabinet will make a firm decision within the next week. Sir Vansittart, the government's diplomatic advisor, recently returned here after holding negotiations with the French authorities in Paris and reported to Foreign Secretary Halifax that French public opinion was very surprised that Britain had delayed the implementation of a conscription system under the current situation. In addition, General Gort, Chief of the General Staff, also stated to Prime Minister Chamberlain that unless Britain strengthens its army, it will be impossible to fulfill the military obligations it has recently accepted. In addition, the Army Department recently began recruiting volunteers, hoping to double the number of reservists, but the results have been unsatisfactory, which shows that the implementation of a conscription system is inevitable and cannot be delayed.

[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] It was announced yesterday that only 65,390 men have been recruited by the voluntary army of both sides from March 19 to April 18, but the original quota was 340,000, so the current number is only one-third of the quota.

### British Gold Shipped to the US in Large Quantities

[London, 22nd] Foreign reports indicate that a large amount of gold has been shipped to the United States. Yesterday, gold worth £20 million departed from a British port for New York. One mail ship carried £9 million. Continued shipments will take place today and early next week. This is related to the recent unrest in Europe. Within five weeks of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Britain shipped £112 million worth of gold to the United States.

### Germany Orders Newspapers to Engage in Written Warfare Against Democratic Newspapers

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels ordered German newspapers to conduct as much propaganda as possible against the "lying democratic newspapers." Goebbels accused the democratic newspapers of "driving the world towards war." This major propaganda campaign will be particularly directed at Britain. German newspapers have expressed a desire for democratic countries to inspect their newspapers. The purpose of this official propaganda is clearly to support Hitler's response to US President Roosevelt's statement that all countries in the world feel threatened by Germany.

### Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit London and Meet with Stanley Today; Britain Decides to Extend Credit Loan to Romania

[Haitong Agency, London, 23rd] "The Sunday Times" foreign affairs correspondent here commented on Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's visit to London and predicted the outcome of the Anglo-Romanian negotiations, saying that he believes that the British government does not want to turn the guarantee to Romania into a mutual aid agreement, as with Poland. However, it can be asserted that the two countries will take the opportunity to discuss economic promotion matters. In addition, the Romanian Foreign Minister will have his first meeting with Trade Minister Stanley on Monday. It is also said that the British government is determined to assist Romania by granting it a credit loan of £2.5 million.

Germany Urges Implementation of the German-Romanian Agreement

[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 23rd] The British trade delegation is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow, while the German side is now trying to implement the recently signed German-Romanian economic agreement as soon as possible.

A Romanian trade delegation left here yesterday for Germany to study ways to promote trade between Romania and the former Czechoslovakia.

### Poland's Strong Attitude; Mobilization Measures Not Relaxed; Rumors that Germany Will Exert Pressure on Poland

[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] Poland's partial mobilization costs an average of £40,000 per day and has not been relaxed in the slightest. However, people generally hope to change their legal status as soon as possible. However, Polish people are not prepared for any concessions. At the same time, Polish Germans continue to be arrested for insulting the country. Estonian Army Commander Laidoner arrived here on Tuesday and held staff meetings with Polish military experts. He was originally scheduled to return to the group today, but has now been extended to next Monday.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] People here have now begun to speculate on Hitler's speech on Friday, but there is no concrete establishment. However, it is generally believed that German-Polish relations are about to unfold. "The Times" Warsaw correspondent said that Hitler will put pressure on Poland, urging it not to join forces with the Western powers.

### Franco's Victory Parade to be Held in Mid-May; Miaja Goes to Mexico

[Reuters, Burgos, 22nd] Today, the authorities here announced that the victory parade will be held in Madrid on May 14th and 15th. General Franco will go to Madrid to participate on May 15th.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that it is rumored that the general staffs of Germany, Italy, and other friendly countries intend to hold talks, and that the generals of Germany, Italy, and Spain plan to hold a military meeting in Berlin. The competent authorities here have not been able to confirm this.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 23rd] The authorities recently issued a statement saying that various rumors that foreign troops have landed in Spanish territory are all malicious rumors. Spain is determined to devote all its efforts to construction.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Former Spanish Republican Army Commander General Miaja left here today on a British mail ship for Mexico City. French police escorted him to the border to prevent incidents from occurring during the journey.

### British and Soviet Cooperation: Today Provokes Resentment; Seeking Further Damage to British Interests in China

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The "Asahi Shimbun" here reports that Japanese government and public circles, hearing that Britain is not only cooperating with the Soviet Union but also intends to extend the democratic front to the Far East, are "greatly angered." Therefore, Japan's attitude towards British interests in China must be reconsidered. The newspaper also stated that this indicates "British aid to communism in the Far East," and the Japanese government should seriously consider what countermeasures to take.

### Borah Comments: U.S. Neutrality; Roosevelt Agrees to Cotton Export Proposal

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Republican Senator Borah, yesterday, expressed his views on the Neutrality Act in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that American public opinion on the European situation is becoming increasingly strong, and that true neutrality is no longer possible today. Judging from past events, countries can no longer regard the United States as a neutral nation. However, Borah did not specify what he meant by "past events." Borah also stated that the American people do not necessarily need to care about the victory or defeat of the aggressor nation in the Sino-Japanese conflict, but in fact, the American people are extremely concerned about it.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Senator Bankhead announced today that Roosevelt has agreed to the cotton export proposal, stipulating a subsidy of two cents per pound for 700 bales of this year's cotton production. This subsidy will be paid by the Department of Agriculture for a period of one year, starting from August 1, 1939. Exporters can receive cash subsidies or government cotton loan-pledged cotton. However, it is stipulated that the latter can only be sold after January 1, 1940. This new plan has gained the support of most of the southern cotton-producing group in the Senate and will be attached to the upcoming agricultural budget bill. Southern congressmen largely oppose President Roosevelt's original plan, fearing that cotton prices may be lowered as a result, forcing a large amount of new cotton to be stockpiled by the government.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Today, the French government re-issued a decree approving credit loans of nearly 20 million pounds sterling for defense expenditures.

### No War in Europe

— Xiao Ping

The situation is developing faster and becoming clearer.

In September, ××××× gave the Sudetenland to Hitler. In November, Mussolini seized the opportunity to rise up, demanding Tunisia and Corsica from France. However, his old man's fate was far worse than his younger brother's, and his demands were naturally unsuccessful.

This year, in March 1939, while Mussolini was still chattering incessantly, Hitler reached out and took Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain just woke Hitler from his pipe dream—actually, only half-awake—issued a declaration of aid to Poland, and prepared to start organizing an anti-aggression front. Mussolini, however, had a stroke of luck and quickly grabbed Albania.

The history of aggression this year clearly shows that Germany and Italy are forever using a strategy of you attacking while I defend, mutually supporting each other. They have never openly proposed a joint front or made joint demands. Therefore, we say that the aggression of Germany and Italy is only 80% or 90%, not 100%. If they use 100% aggression, it would involve simultaneous attacks on all fronts, leaving no room for people to maneuver. The result would be war.

The famous political commentator Herten, in his "The Fate of the Danube Countries," says that the Axis powers always use one policy: "To do everything in their power to avoid war, but to make the greatest effort to create an atmosphere of war, to intimidate, and to deceive countries prone to war."

We agree with Herten. This time, Germany and Italy are still only creating an atmosphere of war and have no intention of a real war. Moreover, they fear a real war.

Three

The attitude of the Axis powers toward war is already clear. Now, let's see how the democratic countries are doing.

To put it nicely, Britain, France, and the United States are countries that love peace and firmly believe in the collective security system. Naturally, they hate war and have no intention of stirring up trouble.

To put it bluntly, these countries, since 1918, in the Palace of Versailles, took and divided arbitrarily as victors, gorged themselves, walked to extreme capitalism, and enjoyed themselves to the fullest. In these years, they are barely maintaining the status quo, afraid of falling behind, how dare they think of another cruel and destructive war.

We have said that the Axis powers fear war; now, we can unreservedly say that the democratic countries fear war even more. The toxic elements of war terror have penetrated every person in the democratic countries—whether they are people, officials, even soldiers, or journalists.

Because of this, Germany and Italy have been able to take advantage of their aggression. The most obvious thing we can see is: every time Hitler and Mussolini take action or make demands, why don't Britain and France take counter-actions or make some counter-demands?

When Italy's invasion of Albania began, British Prime Minister Baldwin seemed to speak out with righteousness—but this was just a superficial statement. In fact, it was still for Britain's own interests in the Mediterranean—France hurriedly presented the Laval-Hoare Pact to curry favor. In the end, Baldwin also turned a blind eye, and, in the midst of the chorus of "shameless" in the House of Commons, automatically discarded the notion of sanctions. Why? This was scared away by Mussolini's "war."

Following this, Hitler marched into the Rhineland. Obviously, France was the one taking the blow. At that time, the French government and public were indeed filled with righteous indignation, ready for a fight. But soon, the atmosphere changed completely, and the extreme right-wing Flandin was brought in to take charge, singing his pro-German tune to ease the tension between the two countries. What is this? This was also scared by Hitler's "war."

The Spanish affair is even clearer. Germany and Italy openly transferred troops and equipment, and have already "intervened" to a terrible extent. Britain and France insisted on organizing a "Non-Intervention Committee." As a result, the government forces finally collapsed under the exhaustion of ammunition and aid. Therefore, many people say that Franco's victory was not due to the power of Germany and Italy, but to the "non-intervention" of Britain and France. Why "not intervene"? Fear of trouble.

After this, it was even more Chamberlain's so-called world of realism. Germany's annexation of Austria. Of course, there was no need to speak out, just quickly change the Austrian embassy to the German embassy to show friendly intentions.

Then came the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia…. Daladier always followed Britain's lead, and Chamberlain was always "forbearance to avoid disrupting the overall plan," forbearance, forbearance, forbearance, as long as the mortal wound to the British Empire was not touched.

We are not saying that people like Chamberlain and Daladier do not understand the facts of Germany and Italy's long-term war. They understand very well, but they also understand that they themselves are more afraid of war than Germany and Italy. Although it is not the difference between ten steps and a hundred steps, it is still a step behind. I am just afraid that if they provoke those two devils, they will also stir things up willfully.

The above is a review of the past, all to prove that the democratic countries also fear war. Perhaps some people will say that although the past was like this, it is different now. Britain has made assurances to Poland, Greece, and other countries, and is preparing to resort to force.

However, we have different views on this. We do not deny that Britain and France have indeed changed to a more assertive attitude this time, and this is a good phenomenon. However, it is not accurate to say that Britain and France are determined to guarantee small countries and are prepared to resort to force.

For example, if two people are fighting, one side rolls up their sleeves and speaks harshly, it will not lead to a fight. When the other side also rolls up their sleeves and retaliates with harsh words, then the fight has to happen. Therefore, people who are afraid of a real fight, the one with the bigger guts will always prevail, because he will definitely roll up his sleeves first, making a fake fighting posture. The one with the smaller guts, seeing that a fight is imminent and things cannot be done, will have no choice but to lower his flag and admit defeat.

The relationship between democratic countries and the Axis powers is like this. Every time, it is Hitler or Mussolini, who has the bigger guts, who rolls up his sleeves first. Although Chamberlain knows that it is all just a fake show, he still dares not roll up his sleeves to confront them, because maybe it will lead to a situation where he has to ride a tiger, where he has no choice but to really fight.

Learn from your mistakes. Chamberlain has suffered too many losses, and finally, he has learned the lesson: "strike first is best." This anti-aggression declaration is his first sleeve rolling against Germany and Italy, ×××××××. The day before Chamberlain issued the declaration of aid to Poland, March 30th, Thursday, a British Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Polish Foreign Minister will arrive here next Monday, but the Prime Minister will not wait to meet with the Polish Foreign Minister, and plans to issue a declaration tomorrow to prevent aggressors from launching an attack at the end of the week."

Doesn't this make it very clear that Chamberlain knows that Germany and Italy dare not fight back, ××××××××× hand, ××××××, and is definitely not "determined to resort to force."

We do not hide the fact that Chamberlain is indeed on the upper hand this time. Hitler has rolled up his sleeves to take Danzig, but he didn't have time. To avoid a real war, he had to swallow this frustration.

The re-declaration of Britain and France did indeed scare the Axis powers a bit. But, did Chamberlain really win? Did he stop the aggression of the Axis powers? Far from it! We say that Chamberlain's declaration still will not deter the aggressors, because he has no determination to "resort to force" at all—the Axis powers are just being deceived by it.

Brief Comment

### Expanding the Spiritual Mobilization of Overseas Chinese

The National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is a movement to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence to ensure the success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is a movement to expand the entire nation's support for the war of resistance and national reconstruction and to strive for national liberation. This movement will not be perfectly successful without the enthusiastic participation of tens of millions of overseas Chinese!

Overseas Chinese, since the Central Government promulgated the implementation outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant, have been enthusiastically promoting them, which will not only have a significant effect on the motherland, but the overseas Chinese themselves can also gain greater sympathy and respect from international people. If our overseas Chinese can enthusiastically promote the spiritual mobilization movement, it can not only directly mobilize the power of overseas Chinese to aid the war of resistance and national reconstruction, but also smash the plots of ×good in the overseas Chinese, overcome pessimism and disappointment, eliminate the poisonous atmosphere of peace and compromise, and promote the great spirit of overseas Chinese in assisting the motherland's revolution and national salvation movement over the years. It is worthy of special attention to the motherland and the world.

Students in Hong Kong held an oath not long ago. The Eastern District Teachers' Association and the Chinese workers of the Peninsula Hotel have also held oaths to the National Covenant. In addition to expressing our admiration, we feel that the circle of opinion, which bears the responsibility of leading the people, should especially catch up quickly and hold a large-scale oath-taking ceremony including all news practitioners, so as to actively develop the ideological mobilization movement that supports the ×××××××× speech and action. Of course, we also hope that all agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and even men and women from all walks of life will catch up quickly!

Expanding the spiritual mobilization movement of overseas Chinese, of course, cannot be satisfied only by holding the National Covenant oath: but every overseas Chinese who considers himself to still have enthusiasm, still have backbone, still value personality, and still love the motherland must take participating in the National Covenant oath as the beginning of a glorious struggle, abide by the oath at any time and place, and then do his best to assist all ×× reconstruction specific work.

Overseas Chinese who are fortunate to be outside the artillery fire and are broadly in foreign territory, the leaders and people of the motherland are calling us! International people are watching us!

### Congratulating the 5th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society

The Chinese Land Administration Society held its 5th annual meeting on the 22nd of this month at the Eastern Sichuan Normal School.

I remember that during the period when the Jinmian War of Resistance was launched, the association made great efforts to amend the Land Law with the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People's land revolution. Unfortunately, the relevant authorities in various places failed to implement this consistently and effectively, which cannot but be considered a regret for the cause of national resistance and national reconstruction.

At present, the War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In this stage, we must enhance the combat effectiveness of the front line, expand the guerrilla warfare in the future, and intensify the cultivation of new forces in the rear. All these depend on the mobilization, organization, and utilization of the broad masses of farmers. To effectively achieve total mobilization of farmers, we must first solve the central crux of the current farmer problem, namely, the land problem. The Land Administration Society's annual meeting is held this week. We hope that the land problem can be reasonably resolved in accordance with the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People's land revolution, so that in the rear we can obtain the active efforts to expand the purpose of the farmers' eyes and actively help the front line to intensify production work, and in the war zone and the occupied areas of the ×people, the reasonable solution of the land problem can help the faithful execution of the National Covenant and the perseverance and expansion of the anti- × anti-traitor and anti-puppet movement. The above is only in terms of wartime. Further, if we can obtain a suitable and fair solution to the land problem at present, we can lay a solid foundation for the construction of the ideal new China of the Three Principles of the People.

The Land Administration Society is holding a meeting at this time. We respectfully send our deep hope that it can follow the principle of "equalization of land rights" in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the principle of "implementing the land policy of the People's Livelihood" shown in President Chiang's training speech on the 22nd, and seek a suitable and fair solution to the current land problem, so that the vast farmers of China can automatically and actively participate in all undertakings of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We also hope that the circles of opinion and mass organizations in various places will share the hope and wish it to obtain the due success.

### Bandits Run Rampant, Robberies Occur Frequently; Police Strengthen Guarding Forces in the New Territories; Cooperate with Various Villages to Establish Voluntary Security Teams; Three Robberies Occurred in Wan Chai and Ping Shan Yesterday

Since the outbreak of the war in South China, the order in the border area between China and Britain has been affected several times in the past few months due to the war. The opportunity for unlawful people to act has increased, resulting in frequent robbery cases in villages in the New Territories, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sheung Shui, Fanling, Lok Ma Chau, San Tin, and other places. There are many gangs of thieves, carrying inspection tools and sharp weapons. Since the New Territories are secluded and residents are scattered, it is inevitable that the police force will not be able to take care of everything. Therefore, the bandit forces are rampant, which has never been seen before in the New Territories. The ghosts and monsters are difficult to arrest, and very few cases can be solved after they occur. The police and sacrificial authorities, in order to prevent the growth of banditry in the New Territories, in addition to strictly investigating the traces of thieves, recently summoned the gentry of various villages in the New Territories, requesting the people of each village to organize voluntary security teams to assist the police in preventing theft. The organization of the volunteer police team is to be responsible by the gentry of each village to convene strong men in the village to take turns patrolling and guarding. This method has been agreed to by the gentry of each village, and it will be established one after another in the short term, which will be of great help to the security of the New Territories.

Police personnel express their opinions on this matter. Superintendent of Police Criminal Investigation Department Shiuhutun expressed his opinion yesterday. According to Shiuhutun, before Guangzhou was captured, the security of the New Territories was cooperated with the Shenzhen police, so even if there were robbery cases, they could be solved quickly. However, since the outbreak of the war in South China, the Chinese police have been unable to cooperate as before. Therefore, the bandits who rob in the New Territories often escape into the Chinese border after the incident, making it difficult to arrest them. Shiuhutun also said that since the beginning of the year, a total of 38 armed robbery cases have occurred in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and 70% of them have been solved by the police. More than 50 cases have occurred in the New Territories (including pirate robbery cases), and only 5% have been solved by the police. The reason why it is difficult to solve robbery cases in the New Territories is that the victims often fail to tell the police the details of the robbery afterwards, so even if small suspected robbers are caught, they are often allowed to escape the law due to insufficient evidence. Secondly, the stray bullets and various military equipment left behind during the war on the border are often picked up by bandits. The number of robbery cases in the New Territories is also inevitable for one reason. Moreover, there are no street lights in the New Territories, and after nightfall, it is impossible to tell people apart. The bandits then took the opportunity to escape into the Chinese border with ease. If each village establishes a guard regiment and patrols the entrances and exits, the bandits will definitely not be able to escape in the dark.

Three robberies occurred again yesterday. Yesterday, three robberies occurred again in Hong Kong and the New Territories. The cases are as follows: 1. At about 3:00 a.m. yesterday, the owner of the Cai Chang Old Image Private Shop on Lockhart Road, Wan Chai, Jian Cai (59 years old), was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awakened by a strange noise. He caught a glimpse of four big men entering, holding sharp swords, frightening him. Jian was afraid of being harmed and had to pretend to obey and crouch in a corner. The thieves were about to point things out to search when, while they were rummaging through the boxes, Jian took advantage of the thieves' inattention and suddenly ran out into the street and shouted for a police whistle. When the thieves saw this, they were afraid that the police would arrive, so they hurriedly fled out the door. At this time, the police officers nearby rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and cooperated in the pursuit. Finally, one person was captured and sent back to the No. 2 Police Station for record and to investigate the three thieves who were still at large. Fortunately, the store suffered no losses. 2. A robbery occurred in Haowei Village, Ping Shan, at 3:00 a.m. yesterday. Two houses without numbered addresses were robbed one after another. One house was occupied by Chen Ying, 51 years old, and the other was occupied by Deng Chao, an old woman in her 70s, both of whom were engaged in farming. Although the thieves did not carry weapons when they robbed, the residents were old and weak and unable to resist. Clothes worth more than ten yuan were robbed from the two houses, and they left howling after they succeeded. 3. At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the second floor of 12 King Kwong Street, Happy Valley, Wan Chai, was suddenly robbed by three thieves armed with weapons. As a result, gold and silver jewelry worth about more than 300 yuan was robbed. The victim of the robbery was a young woman named Zheng Xiuying (27 years old). At about 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, she suddenly heard someone knocking on the door. Zheng immediately ordered the maid to open the door, but after the door was opened, she saw three people rush in one after another, pulled out guns and sharp weapons from their sides, and pointed them at the maid and Zheng, and tied them up. Then, one of the thieves monitored everyone, and then two people searched for about 20 minutes before leaving with the stolen goods. Checking the items, it was estimated that gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and cash worth about more than 340 yuan were lost.

### Eastern District Teachers Association Held a National Oath Yesterday; Central Committee Member Luo Yiqun Attended the Oath Ceremony and Delivered Encouragement; Peninsula Hotel Employees Also Took the Oath on the Same Day

After the War of Resistance entered the second stage, our country's military and diplomatic affairs have gained an advantage. The central authorities, in order to make the national spirit more unified, have strictly implemented spiritual mobilization. Compatriots at home and abroad have responded enthusiastically and have held national oaths one after another. Various groups in Hong Kong have also risen in response and have held oaths one after another. Yesterday, the Eastern District Teachers Association and all the employees of the Peninsula Hotel followed suit. The details of the oaths in the two places are recorded below:

Eastern District Teachers The official oath ceremony of the Eastern District Teachers Association was held at 11:00 a.m. yesterday at the Wan Chai Tung Chi Middle School. It was chaired by Cen Zhuoyun, President of Zhenhua Engineering College. Hundreds of teachers from various schools attended. Luo Yiqun, a member of the Central Committee, presided over the oath ceremony. After the ceremony was performed, the chairman gave an opening speech, followed by a speech by Luo Yiqun, the oath-taker. First, he elaborated on the situation of our country's war of resistance and the prospects of the nation, and then promoted the significance of spiritual mobilization. Finally, he expressed his deep hope for the education circles in Hong Kong, hoping that they would abide by the purpose of spiritual mobilization, discipline themselves and others. The atmosphere was very solemn throughout the session.

### The Amateur Social Club Donates and Burns Relief Bonds: A Collective Ceremony Yesterday

The Hong Kong Amateur Social Club, being the most vibrant amateur organization in Hong Kong, its social department, yesterday launched a special trip to the old battery. Over eighty people participated. After a picnic, the club's Amateur Drama Troupe gave a temporary street performance of the play "Put Down Your Whip." They also publicly burned the national relief bonds donated this period, with a face value of one hundred and forty-five dollars. It is said that the serial numbers and coupons of the burned bonds have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.

### Crackdown on Obscenity: Hong Kong and Kowloon Police Mobilize, Mass Arrest of Street Vendors of Western Paintings, Dozens of Painting Stalls in Wan Chai and Yau Ma Tei Arrested

It is reported that in Hong Kong and various districts of the peninsula, there are often countless Western painting vendors setting up painting stalls on the streets, enticing men, women, the old, and the young to drop a penny into a box. Then, they can peep into the box through the small holes provided in the equipment to view various pictures. The painting vendors would then move the mechanism, and the pictures in the box would move in sequence, just like movies on a screen. The figures and landscapes are lifelike, so ordinary men, women, children, and lower-class people often flock to them. However, for the sake of competition, some vendors secretly insert nude paintings into the collections within the boxes, attracting viewers. Some of these nude paintings are extremely obscene, and their impact on public morals is enormous. Recently, the police authorities have become aware of this secret and first sent undercover investigators, who confirmed it was true. So, yesterday, more than a dozen plainclothes Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched in armored vans to arrest these Western painting vendors and escort them back to the police station for investigation. These Western painting vendors are most numerous in Wan Chai in Hong Kong and Yau Ma Tei across the harbor, totaling no less than forty or fifty stalls. Yesterday, all of them were arrested by the detectives. If obscene pictures are indeed found hidden in their boxes, they will be prosecuted and punished according to the law; otherwise, they will be warned and released.

### Vital Transportation Routes Inland and Overseas: Increasing Numbers Travel from Hong Kong to Vietnam and Then to the Mainland, Hong Kong Visa Office Has Issued Over Five Thousand Passports Recently, Ships Have Increased Sailings, but Passengers are Still Crowded

After the outbreak of war in South China, transportation between Hong Kong and our country fundamentally shifted. After the occupation of Hainan by the ×, Beihai was threatened, and the route through Guangzhou Bay became impassable. Therefore, merchants and travelers wishing to go to Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan must take the route through Haiphong. At the same time, to facilitate the people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered its Hong Kong Visa Office to also handle passport issuance. However, the government is deeply concerned that × spies or traitors may take the route through Vietnam to infiltrate the mainland and ordered the Visa Office to secretly inquire about passport applicants and issue them cautiously. In addition, inspection stations were set up at the border between Vietnam and our country to strictly inspect travelers. While the government intends to prevent problems before they arise, travelers find it quite troublesome. However, according to recent investigations by reporters, the government has recently implemented improvements to the transit process, and the inspection stations have been ordered to be abolished. In the past month, the Visa Office has issued more than five thousand passports for travel to Vietnam. The number of ships sailing to Haiphong has increased from three to six or seven, and the number of sailings has increased, but passengers traveling to Haiphong are still extremely crowded. In addition to the public cabin berths, first and second-class berths must be booked one week in advance. The situation can be imagined.

### Fishermen in Blood and Tears

— Qi Zhuo

Reflections on the Launching Ceremony of the Four Relief Fishing Boats Held Yesterday

We cannot imagine the comfort of "heaven"; nor can we imagine the pain of "hell." If you glimpse this fisherman's picture written in blood and tears, you will surely feel sorrow and sigh that there are such tragic things in the world!

There are a total of 70,000 fishermen in Hong Kong, scattered in fourteen areas within Hong Kong Island. The three famous fishing areas are Aberdeen, Shau Kei Wan, and Cheung Chau. These places on the water are the fishermen's homes, the fishermen's society, and the place where fishermen struggle with life.

Ignorance, stupidity, prostitution, gambling, opium, red pills, early marriage, and the auction of body and soul are the elements that constitute the lives of fishermen. Their cultural level is so low that at most three out of a hundred can write their own names. Society also looks down on them too much. When fishermen land, they are sure to be subjected to people's trampling and bullying. Because they lack knowledge and organization, they become objects of exploitation, which also makes them fall into a bottomless abyss.

The year before last (the twenty-sixth year) on July 6, after the "September 2nd" typhoon disaster – the fishermen lost hundreds of thousands of dollars – the × people began bombing Chiwan, so the fishermen suffered even greater pain. From September 13th, they began burning our fishing boats and killing our fishermen in the Wanshan Islands. Up to now, a total of 10,920 fishermen have died at the hands of the × people. A total of 628 fishing boats were burned. Countless were injured and lost property. In addition, there are more than sixty fishing boats. A total of more than 1,600 fishermen have been taken away by the × people and become the lambs of the × people. They can increase production for the × people. They are familiar with the geography and can help the × people kill our own compatriots. It is said that they are now managed by the × people near the tiger's mouth. How heartbreaking this is!

If we do not quickly take precautions step by step, the future troubles will become more and more serious. The × people use the ignorance of the fishermen, and their appeasement policy is even more unrestrained. For example, they use ten dan of Taiwanese sugar to exchange for one dan of our rice, deceive us into buying our chicken eggs, and even rob while washing the fishing boats… there are endless examples.

Now, the unemployed and helpless fishermen urgently awaiting relief are everywhere.

Although the tragic situations of being burned, killed, and robbed emerge endlessly, in order to survive, they have no choice but to risk going out to sea to fish. Rather than complaining that fishermen lack understanding, it is better to complain that our organization is too lacking, and the relief work is still far from enough!

This serious problem that has been forgotten and neglected by people was not until last year, when Mr. He Xiangning, who had the masses in mind, appealed to overseas Chinese. The enthusiastic overseas Chinese in the Philippines generously donated 2,000 national currency dollars, and the enthusiastic overseas Chinese in Annam generously donated 496 Hong Kong dollars, totaling 1,576 Hong Kong dollars. Mr. He Xiangning sent it to Mr. Cai Chusheng, who transferred it to Mr. Xie Fensheng, the person in charge of the Fishermen's Association, to plan and carry out relief work for the fishermen.

After receiving the money, Mr. Xie built four new Chinese-style small fishing boats as a means of livelihood for unemployed fishermen. However, each boat can only accommodate four people, and at present, it can only slightly relieve sixteen people. After two months, other unemployed fishermen will use them again. This is naturally not a thorough and perfect solution, but it is better than nothing.

At noon yesterday, the ceremony of launching the four fishing boats was held at the Xiangdao Theater in Aberdeen. Old and decrepit old fisherwomen, bare-chested and dark-skinned fishermen, and students from the fishermen's charity school in naval uniforms, a large group of fishermen with no experience in gatherings, crowded the entire theater.

After the ceremony, Chairman Xie reported, followed by a speech by Liu Haiping, a representative of the China Relief Association. Ms. Wang Ying, deputy head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, was also invited to speak because she was attending the welcome meeting of women's organizations in Ap Lei Chau. A female soldier from the front line moved the innocent and simple fishermen.

After that, the procession went to Tin Wan to hold the launching ceremony of the fishing boats. Originally, Mr. He Xiangning, who was loved by the fishermen, was to preside over the launching ceremony. However, Mr. He was unable to attend due to mental discomfort, and requested an old fisherwoman, Ms. Lu Huang, to preside over the launching ceremony, which was also somewhat meaningful. In the "September 2nd" typhoon disaster in the past, she righteously and bravely rescued more than 300 fishermen, and was a typical fisherwoman who was "respected and esteemed" in the fishing village.

The small fishing boats were named "Sincerity," "Unity," "Self-Reliance," and "Renewal." Each boat had four oars, one mast, and one rudder, was eight zhang long and five chi wide, had a draft of three chi, was built by the Hehe Shipyard, and the raw materials used miscellaneous wood. Sails, cooking stoves, fishing gear, and fishing boats were added. The total cost of the four boats was 1,200 yuan. When the songs and trumpets were played together, the ribbons were cut, and the four boats sailed smoothly into the sea.

However, these four small fishing boats are only a temporary solution for sixteen fishermen. More thorough, more extensive, and more active relief and education work is still waiting for us to work hard to complete.

### Mainland Fish and Vegetables: The Supply Continues Uninterrupted, Macao Ships Brought Large Quantities Yesterday, Residents Do Not Have to Worry About Having No Fish to Eat

According to news from Hong Kong's fish and vegetable businesses, the supply of some fish and vegetables decreased when Jiangmen fell, but now it has resumed. Hong Kong-Macao ships have been bringing large quantities of fish and vegetables for days. Yesterday, the Hong Kong-Macao ship Lujiang carried more than eighty dan, and other ships each carried dozens of dan. As a result, the market price of freshwater fish has also recovered. However, firewood sold at retail is only forty to fifty jin per dollar, which is still considered expensive, and the poor find it even more difficult. According to insiders, under the current supply and demand situation, the price of firewood should not be so high.

### China News College Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday, Chairman Xu Shiying Attended and Delivered Instructions, Formal Classes Start Tonight

The China News College, organized by the Hong Kong Youth Journalists Association, held its opening ceremony at the Chinese Middle School yesterday (23rd) afternoon at 2 p.m. Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the College, guests Du Qizhang, Fang Yuyan, Huang Zufen, representatives of various schools, reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, faculty, students, etc., totaling more than a hundred people, gathered together, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Butao delivered a speech, mainly saying that he was extremely happy that everyone had come so enthusiastically today. Speaking of this News College, it reminded him of the early years of the Republic of China, when the Beijing Press Association planned to establish a News University to train news technology talents, but it did not materialize due to some reasons. Later, Mr. Cai Yuanpei felt the urgent need for news technology talents, so he established a journalism department at Peking University. This was the beginning of training news academic talents. Later, Mr. Cheng Shewo founded the Journalism Training School in Beijing, and the results were remarkable. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the school was unfortunately destroyed by the × people. Now, the Youth Journalists Association has inherited the great responsibility of training news talents and established this college. He hoped that the students would all study hard and be able to stand on the news positions in the future and shoulder the sacred task of resisting the war and building the country. Then, Tan Siwen, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the College, reported on the preparation process of the College, the curriculum arrangement, group learning, etc., and also talked about the employment prospects of students after graduation. Then, Xu Shiying, the Chairman of the College, gave an instruction speech, saying that when he went to London in 1910, a friend once told him that there were only three kinds of people in the world who were most precious: first, judges; second, lawyers; and third, journalists. All of you students have today begun to step onto the ladder of the journalist's life, which is most respected by the world. He had two hopes for this: first, in terms of self-cultivation, he hoped to be able to practice the three words "Purity," "Prudence," and "Diligence" and move towards the following six goals: 1. Striving for the survival of the country; 2. Working for the liberation of the people; 3. Working for the improvement of "People's Livelihood"; 4. Protecting the inherent culture; 5. Promoting international justice; 6. Working for the happiness of mankind. Second, he hoped to hone one's own skills. The world's news technology is advancing rapidly. He hoped that everyone would study hard, make the most of their talents, and create miracles for the news industry. Finally, Jin Zhonghua, the President and Vice President of the College, teachers Wang Jiyuan, Lin Rizhen, the representative of the Journalists Association, guests Du Qizhang, Fang Yuyan, and Huang Xiangfen, etc., successively delivered speeches, all of which were earnest and moving. After the speeches, they took a group photo and dispersed happily. It is said that the college is scheduled to start classes tonight.

### Eastern Goods: Surprisingly Selling Well in Hong Kong, Dumping at Low Prices Outperforming European and American Goods, The Import of Piece Goods Alone Has Increased Significantly Compared to Last Year

Hong Kong is a major transshipment port in the Far East. Businesses from various countries are competing and vying for the market, all trying their best to win. However, European and American goods, on the one hand, have long distances and high transportation costs, and on the other hand, have better materials and higher costs. Eastern products are completely the opposite. Therefore, although European and American goods can occupy a place in the Hong Kong market, they ultimately cannot compete with them. In addition, Eastern goods have always adopted a large-scale dumping policy, and Hong Kong is a tax-free port, which has created a great opportunity for cheap goods to seek low prices. According to the investigation of Hong Kong's import goods, the quantity of goods in March last year was small, but the value was high. In March this year, the quantity of goods was large, but the value decreased sharply. The biggest reason is probably that Eastern goods have suddenly become active in the Hong Kong market. According to the investigation, the total import of piece goods in March this year was 6,864,348 yuan, while in the same month last year it was 8,872,490 yuan. Comparing the two, the import volume is more than last year, but the value is less than last year. The table is as follows:

(March last year) (March this year)

Cotton cloth 5.629.290 yards 8.668.130 yards

Suit material 30.594 yards 41.227 yards

Cotton silk cloth 2.017 yards 11.412 yards

Silk hair 252 dan 547 dan

Rayon 68.628 yards 787.08 yards

Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has specially moved to 75 Wing Lok East Street in Hong Kong to continue its business as usual.

Island Scenery

### Aberdeen Scenery Line

— Cai Huisheng

Aberdeen - a small market located behind the peak of Gough Hill, in the Aberdeen harbor, a tributary of the East Lamma Channel. It is surrounded by many lush and continuous mountains; and across a narrow strip of water, the remotely facing Ap Lei Chau is also a small market. However, due to the steepness of the peaks and the narrowness of the plains, the market has no way to expand, and the transportation to and from Hong Kong is more inconvenient, so it is naturally not as "prosperous" as Aberdeen. This is one of the three major fishing areas in Hong Kong. There are dozens of kinds of fishing boats of various sizes that come to dock frequently in the harbor. Whenever it is the end of the old lunar year or the beginning of the year, or festivals and some "god's birthdays," all the fishing boats will come back from the sea by appointment, lined up neatly in rows. The prows and sterns face each other, stretching endlessly, making the mountains and seas an infinite spectacle. Overlooking the small boats shuttling back and forth in the "sea market" from the peaks, and then seeing the sails floating on the sea, the flying sand birds from the mountain gorges, if this is not a world of "brigands," then it should be enough for poets to "intoxicate" themselves.

Since the outbreak of the "July 7th" national freedom and liberation war, the bloody hands of the × people have reached into the South China Sea, and the fishing boats in Hong Kong and along the coast of South China have been constantly bombarded and burned by the × ships × kill, ×××× – this phenomenon has continued to this day and is still intensifying. As a result, many fishing boats do not dare to go to sea, and most of them lie dormant in the harbor for a long time, spending their bleak and miserable years; however, they cannot but live like everyone else, and the money they owe in high-interest loans does not allow you not to repay. They cannot catch fish near the coast, so they have to risk their lives and go to the boundless sea and sky without any guarantee. The outcome is naturally unnecessary to say!

The "shore people" of Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau - those "shore people" who are said to look down on the "water people," their business relies 99% on the support of the "water people" - fishermen who are looked down upon. Since the "water people" who are looked down upon have been subjected to massacre and arson, the business of the "shore people" who look down on them has also been greatly affected. However, there is a distorted status quo here, that is, since the War of Resistance, the houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been completely rented out, so some refugees who cannot find a place to live have turned to this place that is not much noticed by people. As a result, the population has increased sharply. However, there are not many houses here, and even fewer empty houses, but people's needs are very urgent, so the owners took advantage of this opportunity to make a "windfall" by taking advantage of the fire - greatly raising the rent. Until now, every house here is filled with people like canned sardines; those that can be used for business generally share a shop with two or three different businesses. Also, those simple and narrow houses that were never noticed before the war have also been re-registered and decorated, and businesses have started on the grassland, leaning over and bending down. This crowded situation is really no less than that of the main part of Hong Kong.

The means of maintaining ferry transportation between here and Ap Lei Chau is a kind of exquisite ferry boat, with a dome-shaped blue or green awning on the top of the boat, and a flower mat laid in the middle of the boat for passengers to rest. In the small cabin, there are wooden shelves set up on the walls where things can be displayed, and the shelves are covered with pleasing embroidered cloth cushions and some rather exquisite tea sets, clocks, mirrors, and other utensils. When the boat moves, it sways left and right and moves forward, which makes passengers feel like they are sitting in a cradle. These "sampans" are the tools for "sampan girls" or "sampan women" to make a living. In addition to using them to carry passengers and earn a little profit, they are sometimes hired by people who are not very wealthy to "cruise the river."

Another kind of larger boat is more luxuriously decorated. A large "safety lamp" hangs in the cabin, and many beads are suspended. The walls of the cabin are full of painted mirrors or "sampan girls" "glam shots". The shelves are full of cups, plates, flower arrangements, and other things. This kind of boat is specially for people to "play." Whenever the night is clear and the wind is gentle, some lechers or "drug buddies" go to this boat to "cruise the river" - in fact, they sit without cruising, or lie down without cruising. These sampan girls are the wives and daughters of fishermen struggling on the line of death. Because they cannot survive, they have fallen to doing this inhuman act. For the sake of the whipping of survival, they have to put on powder and rouge to conceal their original "ugly" appearance and become a "braided" person like the "shore people". They are good at singing a kind of song unique to fishermen - a tactful, lingering, and pleasant flirtatious "saltwater song." Although the content of the song is not commendable, the sad and melancholic tone is enough to represent their hard work, and should make those who have the heart hear it and feel sad and tearful!

The specialty here - "fresh seafood" has always been praised by people. The business of several restaurants that specialize in "fresh seafood" is very bad; on Sundays and other holidays, they are even more crowded and there is no empty seat. The fish sold are all kept alive in the sea, and they are only caught and boiled alive when customers want them - this is what is called "fresh". The price of "fresh seafood" is very expensive. On average, fish that costs two or three dollars has to cost you ten or eight dollars. However, no matter how hard the restaurants try to make a profit, the "wealthy people" who eat fish naturally do not care about this point. Maybe they think that this is the only way to show "wealth"!

Someone once said this: "Going to Hong Kong without going to Aberdeen to eat seafood is not considered fashionable." It is probably the meaning that people with too much money are too unreasonable if they do not become "suckers" a few times.

With the turmoil in the European situation, Aberdeen has made many defense works, and according to reports in the newspapers, the Hong Kong government intends to turn this place into a military port because of its high mountains and deep water, which is a natural typhoon shelter - driving all the fishing boats to Wong Chuk Hang. If it is implemented, what the situation in Aberdeen will be tomorrow is not something we can imagine.

### Utter Helplessness – Offensives on Both Northeast Lines Exhausted – Our Cross-River Raids and Attacks Repeatedly Successful – Our Army's Counterattack at Zhongxin Market Quite Successful

[Correspondent from Wengyuan] On the front lines of Northeastern Guangdong, utter helplessness reigns. Most battle lines have shifted from offensive to defensive. Regarding recent combat situations, a reporter obtained information from local military authorities yesterday, listed as follows:

Zengcheng Troops Cross the River to Attack – Since relocating to new positions, our Zengcheng forces have engaged the enemy in a stalemate along the Zengcong Gongfu-Cong Highway and other areas, continuing to advance fiercely towards Guangzhou. Our forces holding the Lizhi'ao area north of Zengcheng, in coordination with the Third Guerrilla Force, crossed the Zeng River along the Zengbo Highway on the morning of the 21st to launch an attack, making contact with the enemy's outposts, followed by intense fighting. Another unit of our forces attacked both the Zengbo and Dajiang areas, disrupting the enemy's communication. Our army launched a major campaign to annihilate the enemy, achieving numerous kills. Currently, the enemy in Zengcheng is under great threat and shows signs of retreat.

The Enemy Attempts to Invade Eastward – Futian Position – On the 21st, according to the Zengcheng military intelligence, the enemy forces, attempting to contain the rear of our Eastern Route Army, dispatched over two hundred cavalry and artillerymen and four hundred infantrymen to invade the Futian and Luofushan positions in Boluo. The enemy used small-caliber cannons and tanks for cover, advancing fiercely. Our defending troops at the foot of Luofushan calmly responded, using flat-trajectory guns to suppress the enemy's tank forces. Subsequently, fierce battles broke out in areas such as Bogong'ao and Jigongkeng in Futian. Our brave teams annihilated the enemy, one against a hundred, fighting intensely for three hours. The enemy's momentum slightly waned, and we took the opportunity to counterattack. The enemy fled in disarray towards Zengcheng. In this battle, both sides suffered casualties. Our army is now pursuing and pushing towards Zengcheng along multiple routes.

Huang Tao's Division Attacks Zhongxin – The advance units of the XXX division, led by Huang Tao, have repeatedly frustrated the enemy forces attempting to invade north from Taipingchang in recent days, inflicting heavy losses. Therefore, the enemy has been cautious and inactive lately. Huang Tao's troops from the Fuhexu headquarters, in order to cut off the enemy's connection from Zengcheng, launched fierce attacks on Zhongxin Market on the 20th and 21st. The enemy, caught by surprise, fought back hastily, but was on the verge of collapse. They urgently received reinforcements from Zhucun, resisting our army stubbornly, but to no avail. Our teams stormed the enemy's positions, charging and maneuvering, killing many enemy soldiers. Currently, our troops are still fiercely fighting the enemy on the Fucong Highway near Zhongxin, and are preparing to join forces with our troops in Liangtian to launch a counterattack downwards towards Danqiu Market and Zhucun, and other places.

### Victory News from the North – Our Army's Southern Advance Smooth – The Enemy at Longkou Being Encircled and Annihilated – Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Suburbs of Fengyong

[Express News from Northern Guangdong] In the past ten days, the center of gravity of the war in Northern Guangdong has been on the left, actually in Zengcheng and Conghua. Recently, the enemy has devoted all its efforts to recapture Paitan and Zengcheng. In the fierce battles near Paitan in recent days, no less than two thousand enemy soldiers have been annihilated, inflicting heavy losses. Unexpectedly, the enemy has again moved troops along the Guangdong Road and the Guanghua Highway, attempting to invade the Xinjie position in Huaxian again. Our frontline troops of the Twelfth Army Group have received orders from the military authorities to stand firm. Currently, our Northern Route Army is counterattacking the enemy and making good progress. The most recent military intelligence is as follows:

Counterattack on Longkou – Annihilate Many Enemy Soldiers – After our Northern Guangdong forces recaptured Huaxian, they immediately began setting up strong defensive positions to prevent the enemy from invading again. On one hand, they dispatched troops to pursue the fleeing enemy. In recent days, our army has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line, through Lianglong Pingshan, towards the enemy positions in the Longkou Village and Zhucun area. On the evening of the 20th, our Kong Division, in coordination with a mechanized unit of the Central Government, launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Longkou Village. The enemy resisted stubbornly, relying on fortifications. Our army was exceptionally brave, charging and killing the enemy. Subsequently, our army from the Xinjie area also sent troops to assist, attacking the enemy from the side and engaging in fierce fighting. The battle lasted until dawn. The enemy's momentum was exhausted, and we took the opportunity to launch an assault, killing many enemy soldiers. Currently, the enemy is still stubbornly holding on to dangerous positions. Our army is in the process of encircling and annihilating them.

Invading Xinjie Again – The Enemy Suffers Defeat – Since we recaptured Xinjie, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to invade. On the 16th, they gathered over a thousand infantrymen to attack, but were repelled by our forces. In recent days, reinforcements have been transferred from Guangzhou and stationed in the Jiangcun and Gaotang areas. Since the 18th, the enemy's transportation along the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite busy. On the morning of the 21st, the enemy from Jiangcun dispatched several hundred infantrymen and cavalrymen, along with two artillery units, northward along the railway, with the intention of invading Xinjie again. Our defending troops received the report and stood ready. Soon after, the enemy's advance units arrived at the XX position several miles south of Xinjie. Our army rose to meet them in battle. The enemy launched a fierce artillery barrage, using it to cover the infantry and cavalry charge. We calmly responded, and our position remained unshaken. At noon, we waited for the enemy's momentum to weaken slightly, and then launched a sudden and fierce attack, killing over ten enemy soldiers. The enemy could not withstand the assault and retreated south in defeat, abandoning many military supplies along the way. We have already conducted a search and advanced forward.

Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Suburbs of Fengyong – Furthermore, it has been investigated that on the 17th, 18th, and 19th, our army's counterattack on Fengyong was extremely successful. On the 18th, we successively recaptured important surrounding points such as Xianggang and Hulugang near Fengyong, encircling the enemy in Fengyong on all sides. In the past two days, our army has continued to launch surprise attacks on the enemy. In order to contain our army's advance, the enemy has occasionally shelled our positions in Hulugang and Xianggang. Our artillery also did not show weakness, returning fire. On the morning of the 20th, our artillery battles were very intense, and our Li Division's assault team also took the opportunity to launch an assault on the enemy, engaging in an encounter battle with the enemy in the suburbs of Fengyong. The fighting continued into the late afternoon.

### The West River Guerrilla Force is Active – The Guangxi Army Annihilates Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers in a Night Attack – Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Baini and Dengkeng to Vent Frustration – Deng Yanhua's Hometown Almost Completely Reduced to Rubble

[Express News from the West River] After our Western Route Army began its counteroffensive, our guerrilla teams in the Baini area in the lower reaches of the West River have been very active, repeatedly annihilating stubborn enemy forces, greatly assisting the progress of the regular army.

Annihilating Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers at Yelong Ganggen – It has been investigated that Ganggen is the left flank of the Erfangshui enemy forces. Since our army began its counteroffensive on the 5th of this month, in order to prevent our army from crossing the river at Jinli and cutting off their retreat, the enemy increased their troop strength to over six hundred men, distributed in the villages around Ganggen. However, they were apprehensive, only daring to come out at night. A certain unit of our Guangxi Army on the south bank of the West River secretly crossed the West River on the tenth, disguised as civilians, and infiltrated Baini, coordinating with the local guerrilla force. At about one o'clock in the morning of the 16th, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy in Ganggen. When they arrived, the moonlight was dim and everything was silent. Our army, guided by the guerrilla force, stealthily passed through the enemy's sentry posts via small paths. With a secret signal, they charged into the enemy's camp, using hand grenades to bombard the enemy fiercely. The enemy soldiers were caught by surprise, panicked and disoriented in the darkness, unable to resist. Our army charged and maneuvered wildly for about forty or fifty minutes before safely withdrawing. This night attack was very effective, killing or wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers, seizing over ten firearms, and achieving a great victory.

Baini Dengkeng Suffers Indiscriminate Bombing – Furthermore, it has been investigated that after the enemy forces suffered a surprise attack by our army, they became enraged. On the 17th, they dispatched six aircraft from Hekou to indiscriminately bomb the villages near Baini, dropping a total of forty bombs. At that time, the villagers fled in panic. Unexpectedly, the enemy aircraft flew low and strafed with machine guns. Subsequent investigation revealed that the most bombed areas were the Baini Market and Dengkeng Village, with no less than twenty bombs dropped in each location. Dengkeng Village was almost completely reduced to rubble, while the Baini Market had dozens of shops destroyed and part of the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall destroyed, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, both men and women, and causing an unprecedented tragedy. It has been investigated that Dengkeng Village is the hometown of Deng Yanhua, the former First Deputy Administrative Inspector, so the enemy's hatred is particularly deep. They had previously sent troops to harass the area several times.

### Another Bloody Account – Details of the Enemy Aircraft's Indiscriminate Bombing of Boluo – Dozens of Bombs Dropped – Over a Hundred Casualties

[Express News from Huiyang] The enemy army in the East River, in order to disrupt our army's rear as our counterattacking forces press forward step by step, has been wantonly dispatching aircraft to wreak havoc in Dongbao, Huizhou, Boluo, and other places in recent days. On the 18th, enemy aircraft again bombed Boluo madly. The details are recorded below. It has been investigated that at 4:10 PM on the 18th, four enemy aircraft flew in batches over Boluo County from Zengcheng and Longmen, circling several times before flying low and taking turns dropping a huge number of bombs, over forty in total, and then flying south. Subsequent investigation revealed that six bombs were dropped in Lower Street in the city, over ten bombs were dropped at the Nanmen ferry terminal, three bombs were dropped at the County Government, and over ten bombs were dropped inside Nanmen, resulting in over a hundred civilian casualties, both men and women, and destroying over forty buildings, causing an extremely tragic disaster. After the enemy aircraft wreaked havoc in Boluo City, they dropped two bombs at the Qingtang Market in Boluo County during their retreat and strafed the civilians with machine guns from low altitude, also destroying several civilian houses and resulting in ninety-six casualties. County Magistrate Huang Zhongyu immediately dispatched personnel to take in and treat the injured civilians, and to collect and bury the deceased, but the disaster was so extensive that it had not been fully cleaned up by the 20th.

Organize Relief Teams and Reception Stations – The association believes that the relief work in various counties has rarely dispatched more personnel to work in the war zones due to funding constraints, which is not a close approach to the refugees. Therefore, it has decided to organize ten relief teams, equipped with all necessary items, to be dispatched to various war zones at any time to provide practical relief. The organization is currently being accelerated and will be established soon. Furthermore, in order to enable the universal reception of refugees in various counties, in addition to ordering Gu County to set up refugee reception centers as originally planned and to appoint local district and township chiefs as administrators, it is specifically stipulated that each county in the war zone and neighboring war zones should establish reception stations along the refugees' routes, generally setting up one station every ten to thirty li, and assigning the local Baojia chiefs to be responsible for receiving and transferring refugees to the county's relief association for resettlement.

Handling Measures for Refugees in War Zones – Furthermore, it is easy for both good and bad people to mingle in refugee areas in war zones. Therefore, the management of refugees in war zones must be strict. Specific measures for handling refugees in war zones have been drafted, on the one hand, to prevent bad elements from mixing in, and on the other hand, to quickly transport refugees away from the front lines to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. These measures have been drafted by the Relief Association and will be implemented after being submitted to the Provincial Government for review. The content stipulates that each county's relief association must send personnel to inspect the refugee situation in various districts at any time. If they can be transported to the rear reception center immediately, they must be transported immediately. Otherwise, they must investigate and register the refugee's name, hometown, age, etc., and fill it in the inspectors' manuals for constant attention. Female and child refugees, regardless of whether the front line is approaching or not, must be forcibly evacuated. The relief team responsible for the area will assess the situation and divide the team members into several groups, requisitioning cattle carts and wheelbarrows and other means of transportation to transport the elderly, weak, women, and children. Extreme attention is also paid to the protection of refugees. The association has already consulted with the Provincial Government and the military authorities, ordering the defense forces in the war zone and neighboring war zones to station troops along the route at any time, and ordering the county magistrates to instruct the district and township chiefs to dispatch teams to assist along the refugees' routes to provide practical protection and not to make things difficult for them on any pretext.

### Guangdong Relief Association Intensifies Refugee Relief Work Actively Promotes All Relief Efforts Relief Teams Enter War Zones

[Express News from Shaoguan] Provincial Government Chairman and Relief Association Director Li Hanhun believes that refugee relief work is a major political priority at present. Although there was an organization for refugee relief in this province before, the organization of branch associations in various counties was not perfect. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Central Government to reorganize the association into the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association. It has now been reorganized and established, actively promoting all relief efforts and carrying out the reorganization of refugee branch associations in various counties. The reorganization situation and various measures are recorded below.

Reorganize Refugee Branch Associations in Various Counties – After the Refugee Relief Committee of this province reorganized the Relief Associations, Director Li Hanhun, who also served as the Director of the Association, believed that the refugee relief branch associations in various counties should also be reorganized at the same time to facilitate command. Regarding the reorganization process, the Provincial Relief Association has drafted organizational regulations for each county and city, ordering each county and city to reorganize and report on the establishment within a specified period, and in order to save expenses, the staff of each county association must still hold concurrent positions without additional pay. However, in areas in or adjacent to war zones where relief work is busy, full-time personnel may be appointed to facilitate the work. It has been investigated that more than twenty counties have complied with the order to reorganize and establish refugee branch associations, while the remaining counties have not been reorganized or are in the process of doing so. The Provincial Relief Association uniformly set a deadline of May 1 for all counties to reorganize and establish refugee branch associations and continue to promote relief work.

### In Shaoguan

— Microwave

In the darkness, sitting in the car, like death, we swept past Nanhua Temple, crossed the beautiful Qujiang Bridge, and drove to the North Gate Station. Only then did the two-day journey come to an end.

Originally planned to visit Nanhua, but was delayed en route, delaying the time. When the car passed, it was already as dark as ink, and I could not get a glimpse of the scenic spot, which is a real regret. "Love and hate are impermanent, separation and reunion are scheduled." Traveling and sightseeing also have their predestined relationships. This is really hard to understand. Generally speaking, life must have curves and undulations to be considered meaningful.

Shaoguan—the new "Guangzhou City"—is the seat of the provincial government and the political center of Guangdong. In this place where government orders are issued, the rapid increase in population is inevitable. With the population increasing greatly, housing has become a problem, and the inns are overcrowded. Many people live on boats and live a floating life. I also tasted it for one night, but it felt a bit unpleasant, so I moved immediately. Naturally, the streets are much more prosperous than before, with tea houses and restaurants making a hundred times more profit, and there seems to be an inability to supply the demand.

Perhaps because of geographical and environmental factors, air raid alarms are very frequent. The crazy Japanese planes also came to spread their poison several times. The citizens have been alerted so often that they have strengthened their determination and confidence in winning the war of resistance. Since air raid alarms have become commonplace, everyone is very experienced. At the sound of the alarm, they settle their belongings and run to a safe place, without feeling flustered at all.

Shaoguan's air defense intelligence network is well done. For the convenience of the citizens, many report signs are hung in the city streets. The number and whereabouts of the Japanese planes are written clearly. I also experienced a "walking alarm" once and saw that all aspects were able to take responsibility and the order was very good. Chinese people rarely have the opportunity to exercise in the suburbs. This time, thanks to the invaders, everyone can take a walk every day, which is of great benefit to their health!

Like the families of nouveau riches, the poverty of the past cannot be concealed. Although Shaoguan has unexpectedly received good fortune, many places show that its strength is not enough to cope, especially the lack of goods, which will affect the progress of the cause and slow it down invisibly. Mr. Wu Jufang launched the organization of a cooperative, which is indeed a matter of urgent importance, and everyone hopes for its success.

When I arrived in Shaoguan, many friends complained to me, not about the lack of material food, but about the lack of spiritual food. Books and magazines are very, very few. Many things that need to be read daily cannot be bought. Newspapers are shipped from Hong Kong, and it takes at least a week to arrive at the fastest. People engaged in writing feel even more the lack of reference materials and sigh that it is difficult to write.

Mr. Wu established a book cooperative near the provincial government to supply the urgent needs of the environment, which has received good criticism from the outside world. Now, he has successively sent people to various places to collect books to enrich the content, aiming to cultivate it into a rich cultural warehouse.

Shaoguan was originally a very convenient place for transportation, with railways and highways extending in all directions, but because there are not enough means of transportation to be allocated, many have not received reasonable supply. There are also very few rickshaws in the urban area, and the fares are surprisingly expensive, at least two yuan. It is said that because the urban area is too small, there were not many rides in the past, so the fares were more expensive than elsewhere. Now there are few cars and many passengers, and there is no reason to reduce prices. Wartime traffic management is very important, and the adjustment of vehicles, the supervision of projects, and the allocation of personnel all require strict scientific management. Based on the actual situation I have seen along the way, I hope that the local authorities can pay special attention to it.

Movies and Dramas Film Reviews

### Sisters

— Hua

"Sisters" has a mournful and beautiful story, which is more skillful than the so-called funny films that are noisy and amusing, and the so-called erotic films that are flirting and pretty.

The author is somewhat sighing at the scenery as before, but the faces are no longer the same. He uses the Nide family to go to the presidential election dance party and also ends with the presidential election dance party. The前後correspondence is handled very purely and skillfully, but it also makes people feel the feeling of the earth as a reverse journey and life as morning dew. The style of "white-haired palace maids are still there, sitting idly and talking about Emperor Xuanzong" certainly has its so-called haunting poetic meaning, but what it transmits to the audience is always a passive gray.

In fact, a story like "Sisters" can also be done if the director wants to emphasize its social significance, and it is very easy to do. For example, for Frank's encounters, write it from the front and emphasize it, but this is not the case now. The focus of the whole play is on Louise, and Frank only becomes a foil, and the joys and sorrows of her two sisters, Helen and Grace, only become a foil.

Putting the selling point on Louise is naturally determined by the director's worldview and outlook on life: he pays too much attention to human feelings and ignores society, not knowing that the starting point of human feelings is based on society.

Therefore, the interest that "Sisters" gives people is only leisurely and melancholy, and its social value is only limited to this.

If the wish to see a play is only to get a little helpless feeling of melancholy, then "Sisters" can be classified as a good one, especially the director can control this mood everywhere, for example,

(1) Louise and Frank's night escape, Helen and Grace's seeing them off at the ladder and window, on the desolate road, a carriage carrying a pair of lovers far away;

(2) After Frank lost his job, he hid it from Louise and went to be a sailor on the ship, at the moment of farewell before leaving Louise.

Others, the Nide family's preparation before going to the meeting, and the introduction of Louise and Frank's appearance, also have very good techniques, and the different ones before the two meetings, the guests and Louise's quick descent when she first heard Frank come to take the escalator, and the stumbling back from the boxing ring after the marriage, are all good contrast techniques. These techniques are concise and meaningful, but lack a little strength, and if the director is willing to spend some effort and add a little social value, it is not impossible to do. For example, Frank's loss of job to various newspapers to seek employment is very compact and powerful, and Frank's hearing that the San Francisco earthquake returned to the ship is not allowed, and turning to swim to the shore are several scenes, which are also much more powerful.

Erol Flynn plays Frank in this play, and his acting skills are not weak. We have seen his "General Blood" and "Robin Hood", thinking that he will only play roles that are brave and fighting. In this play, he is actually calm and skillful, and the handsome spirit in the martial arts film makes people feel the loveliness of a manly man. Bette Davis's Louise is not bad either. This big-eyed actress can convey her identity and emotions very well, that is, even the actress who plays the second sister Helen, Irene Louise, also has very good acting skills. Other supporting roles are also quite well-matched. After being tired of watching the funny and flirtatious movies, seeing such a movie with literary interest, although it is still too little content actively, it cannot but be said to be a movie that is worth watching.

### Happy Angel (9)

She walked towards the window, and as she passed Harry, she really glanced at him. Harry was about to speak, but on her face, he couldn't find a trace of her remembering him. It seemed that her looking at him was only because she disliked his gaze on her. She walked to the window. "Ah! An airport," she suddenly exclaimed, "So many bombers!"

Just then, a horn was heard, and she quieted down. "What is this?"

"Don't worry," Donnell explained from the side, "I think it's for war."

"War?" she continued, "There won't be a war. Archer, there won't be a war, will there?"

"Yes, there won't be a war," Archer Weiber said calmly, with a strange smile on his lips, "They are all too well prepared."

"You..." Irene smiled happily, "They won't fight, they are too wary of each other. They will put on beautiful uniforms, strut about, and call themselves heroes, but they won't fight. Mr. Weiber also said so, he knows."

After they went to see the rooms, Harry asked Donnell, "Who is that?"

"That's a big shot from Europe, Mr. Archer Weiber."

"What about the woman?"

"I guess she's his wife."

"You can only 'guess'," Harry sat down at the piano and began to play a Russian song called "Evening Song."

The next day, after dinner, while sitting idly in the drawing room, Harry met her. She was sitting with a British couple who were on their honeymoon. Mr. Weiber was not present. Mr. Cheyne introduced them, and in the introduction, she had no other name than "Madam."

She talked about many places she had been to and the dangers she had encountered. Then, she asked Harry directly for the first time, "Mr. Fan, have you been to these places?"

"No, I have only performed in Omah," he stared intently at her face, "Madam, have you been to Omah too?"

"Omah? Where is that? Persia?"

"It's in America, in our own country."

At this moment, someone came to tell her that Mr. Weiber was asking her to come, and she excused herself and left. As soon as she left the room, a guest walked in with a newspaper. "Any news?" Mr. Cheyne asked seriously.

"The war has begun. If you want to know the real facts, go ask that big shot Mr. Weiber. He can give you all the war news because he created it. He organizes munitions factories all over the world. The people's desire for peace has been destroyed by people like Archer Weiber."

In Archer Weiber's sitting room, Irene stood facing the fireplace, with Weiber pacing back and forth behind her.

### Soccer Award Presentation Performance Match: South China Overwhelms Hong Kong League Select; Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang Each Score Three Goals for Their Teams, Truly a Double Marvel; Second Division Match: South China Defeats League Select 2-1

[Our Reporter's Special Dispatch] This year's soccer season has been extremely prosperous. From beginning to end, business has been booming. Yesterday's award presentation performance match also attracted tens of thousands of fans who went up the mountain to watch the game, creating a lively scene.

The wonderful performance was exciting, and the fans were overjoyed, cheering in unison. The South China brothers, winning the championship in one fell swoop, are truly talented. Yesterday, they overwhelmed the League Select team, fully displaying the colors of the champion.

There are many noteworthy things in the two matches. Let me tell you, don't mind the details: (1) In the second division match, in the second half, South China's seventh player had a problem with his feet. Many players were suffering from muscle cramps and pain. They were falling down and unable to form a team. However, they actually won 2-1. It was truly a miracle and also a stroke of luck. (2) The Hong Kong League Select team in the first division match, with center forward Li Huitang and goalkeeper Tan Junqian as partners, had never lost before. However, their record could not be maintained yesterday. They were finally broken by South China. Fortunately, they were broken by "their own people," which didn't matter much and even showed "our" skills. (3) South China's center forward Feng Jingxiang and Hong Kong League Select's center forward, the "Oriental Standard Ball Player," both performed a "hat trick" (meaning they both scored three goals). It is rare for such a coincidence to happen. (4) In the past, there were only first division award presentation performance matches, not second division matches. This time, it was specially added, and there were more spectators, setting a new record.

In a soccer match where the skills of the two sides are evenly matched, the winning side has its own reasons for winning, and the losing team also has its own problems. For example, yesterday, South China overwhelmed the Hong Kong League Select. The most obvious thing was that South China's team had coordination in their operations and cooperated extremely well in the front line, causing the Hong Kong League Select defenders to be unable to resist, thus determining the outcome. However, their front line had a dangerous person like Huitang, who broke through three barriers alone, which was still considered effective. However, "the music of Xia Chu and Fang Qing was played, and the drums of Yuyang frequently startled," and in the end, they lost more than they gained due to slightly inferior defense.

Jingxiang and Huitang were originally one family and were used to cooperating, but yesterday, they played for different teams, confronting each other. The performances of the two also had their own unique features. Jingxiang won by technique, being clever and active, while Huitang was unmatched in shooting, with powerful feet. Each had their own merits and could be called a double marvel. However, Jingxiang had the assistance of Chai Beihua, so their cooperation was effective. Huitang felt lonely and helpless without Jingxiang. Therefore, Jingxiang's "hat trick" was actually greatly helped by Beihua. As for Huitang, the three goals he scored relied more on his personal strength. It is great to have such achievements with little assistance.

Speaking of the performances of each player, on the South China side, only Li Enliang in the front line still lacked experience and seemed a little restrained. The others were excellent. The midfielder Guo Yingqi was the most refreshing and spicy, attracting attention. He was the smallest in stature but had the highest skills, truly proving that "you cannot judge a book by its cover." Liu Qingcai returned to his original position, providing a clear path for passes, which was much better than playing as a left forward. The two Li's in the inner defense had crisp footwork, especially Guo Wei, who repeatedly stopped Huitang's progress, which was praised by the audience. However, Huitang was still able to break through three barriers by taking advantage of gaps, showing that Huitang is not easily restrained.

On the Hong Kong League Select side, being able to score three goals showed that their offensive power was not weak. However, their defensive power was slightly reduced due to changes in several players, which was the basis for their defeat.

The dignitaries who came to watch the game yesterday included Auxiliary Police Secretary Smith, Police Commissioner and his wife, Sir Zhou Shoushen, and Chinese representatives Mr. and Mrs. Luo Wenjin, as well as you and me.

After the game, Auxiliary Police Secretary Smith, the president of the Football Association, gave a speech, praising the excellent results of this year's soccer season and commending all the soccer players. Then, Mrs. Luo Wenjin presented the championship prizes for the first, second, and third divisions. Finally, South China team captain Bao Jiaping presented flowers to Mrs. Luo, and they dispersed after shouting three cheers. The champions of the three divisions are named as follows:

First Division Champion: South China South (each player received a gold medal)

Second Division Champion: South China Zeng (each player received a silver medal)

Third Division Champion: Soldiers Team (each player received a good medal)

After the Second Division Champion South China team defeated the League Select team 3-1, the highly anticipated All-Hong Kong Elite Assembly was vividly presented. The new champion South China South lacked the "bomb" Liang Rongzhao, and transferred Qingcai to defend the center, with Liang Baiwei playing right forward in reverse. Li Zhaorong's foot was twisted in the right inner record, and the "Young General" Li Enliang filled in. Although the main figures of the Hong Kong League Select did not all appear, the high-stepping Da Gaoshanu also made an appearance, which excited the fans. However, the absence of midfielder Birodo, the mastermind, inevitably affected the combat effectiveness. (Soccer Field Tycoon)

### First Half Battle Situation

The two teams faced each other, and the battle broke out. In the blink of an eye, Huitang was seen charging across the river, coming fiercely, but was eventually rejected by Yingqi. Douwen advanced along the side and encountered Rongsheng, also failing. You came and went, making the battle quite spectacular.

(Nine minutes) Huitang seized an opportunity to enter, launching a cold arrow from afar, as fast as a shooting star. Jiaping quickly intercepted and saved it, turning danger into safety. Jingxiang advanced and joined forces with Guangsen to force a corner kick. Although the kick was good, Jingxiang fired an over-the-mountain cannon. Then, Huitang came with another fierce shot, also missing the target.

(Seventeen minutes) Guangsen launched an offensive from the side, with Beihua supporting on the right. Jingxiang and Guangsen passed the ball to each other, like lions rolling a ball. Junqian was under the danger of the ball, his heart pounding, rushing forward to intercept and save. However, Jingxiang had already swept the shot first, the ball hitting the goal post and rebounding out. Junqian struggled to entangle, but Jingxiang followed up and gently pushed it, making it impossible for Junqian to recover. (1-0)

(Twenty-one minutes) Soon after, Jingxiang suddenly launched another cold arrow, its momentum very strong. However, Junqian was alert and quickly received it, preventing a disaster.

(Thirty-one minutes) Beihua passed quickly, Jingxiang followed up with a fierce shot, but it became a wild shot. On the other side, Huitang led the army to attack several times, but to no avail.

(Thirty-two minutes) Jingxiang crossed Xia Xian and shot a ground ball from a distance. Junqian's save was effective, turning hostility into friendship. The first half ended with South China South leading 1-0.

### Second Half Battle Situation

Five minutes into the second half, Rongsheng committed a handball foul on the midfield line, and Yingqi was ordered to take the kick. Han Nibal headed the ball on the left side of the goal, but it was intercepted by Jingxiang, who shot and hit the target. (2-0)

(Five and a half minutes) After South China South scored another goal, the game was restarted in the center circle. Huitang suddenly advanced and launched a cold shot from about 20 yards from the goal. Jiaping was unaware of this and conceded a goal. 1-2, Hong Kong League Select scored a consolation goal.

(Twelve minutes) Douwen passed far to Guangsen, who headed the ball to Jingxiang. Jingxiang shot into the net without waiting for the ball to land, scoring a hat trick. (3-1)

(Twenty minutes) Douwen broke through and transported the ball. Junqian, as the defender, was unable to return in time and rushed out to save. Unexpectedly, Beihua arrived first and pushed the ball into the net. (4-1)

(Twenty-five minutes) Chengtou rushed forward and dodged Tiansheng, passing on the baseline. Gaoshanu received the pass from the side and cleverly passed it to Huitang. Huitang lived up to expectations and scored. (2-4)

(Thirty-four minutes) In the sound of the final whistle, South China South's offense was slightly slack, and Hong Kong League Select launched a rapid attack. Huitang received a pass from Li Anna and shot into the bullseye, also performing a "hat trick." In a 3-4 situation, Hong Kong League Select was defeated.

### Open Basketball Tournament: Two First Division Matches Tonight; Yesterday, Chuncao, Huaqiao, and Peiying Won

The Open Men's Basketball Tournament held only three second division matches yesterday. In the first match, Chuncao played against Guanlei. The strength of the two teams was similar, and the game was quite exciting. During the game, Guanlei's coordination and interception skills were more agile than Chuncao's. Unfortunately, their shots in the first half were inaccurate and mostly failed. However, Chuncao was not willing to show weakness and often launched counterattacks. Kuang Zhanwen scored many shots, taking the lead with 18-14. In the second half, Chuncao's Zhanwen and Shixiang scored many points one after another. At this time, Guanlei also tried hard to counterattack, with Yu Jinbang and Bo Yu Kui returning the favor one after another. However, time was running out, and Chuncao defeated them again with 33-30 at the end of the game.

In the next match, Huaqiao played against Lingying. Huaqiao had strong strength, and their defense and offense were far above Lingying's. In the first half, although Lingying tried their best to resist, they still lagged behind 10-13. In the second half, Huaqiao's morale became even stronger. Wu Xu and Huang Jie successively scored points, and then Fu Qixiang scored again, creating an advantageous situation. Later, Jiang Shihan scored several times, but unfortunately, he was unable to turn the tide alone. As a result, Huaqiao won 39-25.

In the last match, Zhong Sheng played against Peiying. Both teams are strong teams in the race for promotion, with strong strength. They met on a narrow road yesterday, and the battle was extremely tense. The score was tied several times. At the end of the first half, Zhong Sheng led 16-15. The battle in the second half was even more intense. Peiying tried hard to counterattack and scored several times. However, Zhong Sheng was not willing to show weakness, and the points were quickly lost and regained. Peiying finally won 48-41 with the efforts of their soldiers.

### Today's Competition Schedule

There will be two first division matches and one second division match tonight. In the first match, first division Guangda will play against Huanan. Judging from the strength of the two teams, although Huanan once lost to Xingdao, they are extremely strong. It will be difficult for Guangda to avoid defeat when facing their strength. In the second match, first division Xingdao will play against the Police. Xingdao is a strong team in this tournament, with many talented players. Although the Police are brave, their offense is not evenly distributed and they are unlikely to be a match for their opponent. In the final match, second division Huanan will play against Taikoo. Huanan's offensive power is strong, and they are likely to win.

### On Balancing Commodity Prices

— Bao Ledi

(I) How to View This Problem

Although everyone now feels that prices are outrageously high, everyone believes that this is a phenomenon inherent to wartime. Indeed, this is the case, and it's the same both domestically and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this wartime reality, which reflects the entire nation's spirit of steadfast sacrifice, something to be proud of to the world.

However, we must not simply let things drift because we deem it inevitable. Because there are many who are taking advantage of this excuse to manipulate prices and deliberately inflate them. For the sake of the overall interests of the nation, everyone should steadfastly sacrifice everything. But in reality, we cannot deny that there is a limit to how much we can endure in terms of material life. At the same time, we must consider that when the lives of the people are so burdened by high prices that they cannot sustain themselves, it will not help the war effort.

Moreover, rather than saying, "There is an urgent need to resolve this issue," it would be better to say, "For the sake of future security, we must now take precautionary measures to prevent problems before they arise." Since the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war, then as long as there is no hope of ending the war, and as long as all the reasons that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited price increases, which is beyond doubt.

(II) Analysis of the Reasons for High Prices

Why does the existence of war stimulate soaring prices? The reason is simple. Let's take the current situation as an example.

(1) Before the war, the country's expenses were at most only about 800 to 900 million yuan. The budget for the 26th year of the Republic [1937] set an unprecedented record, but it was still only a little over 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military spending, it is said to have exceeded 2.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods is almost more than double what it was in peacetime. When demand increases, prices naturally increase. Shanghai, for example, has also seen a sharp increase in population, which has greatly increased demand, but this is not a major factor. Because,

(2) If the increase in demand is accompanied by a proportional increase in production, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a curve and will not rise higher and higher. However, our production capacity was already so backward in peacetime, and it has been so damaged during the war that it is beyond recognition. Not only is the industrial equipment dilapidated, but also vast rural areas have abandoned farming in the war zones. In addition, the Japanese army's looting everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and widened the gap between supply and demand.

(3) Domestic production has been greatly reduced or destroyed, plus the Japanese looting, so our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. The reduction in exports affects the balance of international payments. In addition, our country's military and civilian needs are mostly supplied from overseas, so the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese are also trying their best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the black market for foreign exchange, the value of the currency has fallen by about 60 to 70 percent. The fall in currency value will inevitably lead to a more drastic surge in the price of imported goods. Therefore, the currency burden on the government and the people for purchasing foreign goods is even greater, and the amount of currency circulating domestically naturally has to increase.

(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the circulation of goods is smooth, then the degree to which the currency stimulates prices can still be reduced by the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese. Even if relying on foreign merchants, freight transportation cannot meet the needs. Therefore, the situation of supply and demand imbalance is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.

(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transportation, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort along the way in the war zones and are now promoting their so-called "trade control." In addition, the increase in freight, insurance, and domestic remittance rates are all strengthening the imbalance of supply and demand and the extent of price increases.

These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of the war. As long as the war exists, then the possibility of rising prices will also exist. We can offset the pain of these high prices caused by the war with the harvest of the final victory. But in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, manipulation, monopolies, and hoarding. Moreover, these phenomena have a more violent impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the position occupied by speculative prices in the price of various goods, but we can just give an example to prove the degree to which it occupies the current price level.

(III) Speculative Prices in the Price Level

For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year. But this time, it was contrary to the usual practice, and suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices, it is said, was that the Japanese army was buying it, so there was a risk of a rice shortage in Shanghai. Everyone competed to hoard rice to prevent the famine. It is okay to purchase rice to prevent famine, but it is suspicious why the rice price stopped rising at the limit of fourteen yuan. If there is really a risk of rice shortage, even under strong control, there will be a black market, just like the black market during the rice shortage last year. Moreover, when the rice price rose to fourteen yuan, why didn't the Japanese army continue to buy it? If it is said that it is too expensive to buy, but the Japanese army does not pay according to the market price for anything they buy. Whether it is expensive or not is not related to whether they buy it. Later, it was heard that the rise in rice prices this time can be regarded as the "complaint" of Shanghai rice merchants, because now, except for the rice price, which is still the same as before the war, other prices have risen sharply.

One of the factors of the current high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. Rice prices are not affected by this, because they are local products. But cotton is also a local product, why can't it be as stable as rice prices? If it is for needs, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than that for rice. If it is said that it is because of the Japanese puppet control and harsh taxes, rice has also been treated the same. But now the market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the half year before the war. The rise in cotton prices is mostly caused by the soaring yarn prices, in addition to the actual reasons such as supply and demand. Looking at last year from January to October, yarn prices continued to rise, while cotton prices saw both rises and falls. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year rose by 32.3% compared with January to August of the 26th year of the Republic, while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January this year, the yarn price rose by 52.5% compared with the average price in the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44.%. (See the Sixth Shanghai Table in the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)

Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to the many reasons mentioned above, but the speculative component is even more related. Although many figures on the destruction of production equipment can be put forward from the reduction in production to prove it, Shanghai is, after all, the place where cotton yarn production is easiest to supply in total. There is no reason to make yarn prices rise sharply in circulation. Moreover, it is a domestic product and is not affected by currency. Shanghai yarn prices have always dominated the national yarn prices. If its price is indeed reasonable, then the inland demand price cannot be used to deliberately wait for a high price to sell. But now, because the inland yarn prices are extremely high, the Shanghai yarn prices are also raised in anticipation, so it has become the situation where the more it rises, the more expensive it becomes today. It should be known that using demand to wait for a high price to sell is one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.

We may as well compare it from the increase in price levels. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. For the sake of material limitations, let us compare July of the 26th year of the Republic and August of the 27th year of the Republic.

Comparison of Price Indices in Shanghai and the Interior (Average Price for the Whole Year of 1937 as the Base Period)

July of the 26th Year of the Republic　August of the 27th Year of the Republic　Increase

Shanghai　97.4　127.6　33.2

Guangzhou　96.3　122.2　25.9

Chongqing　104.2　113.1　8.9

(Note) Shanghai and Guangzhou originally used 1926 as the base period, and were recalculated using the average for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so as to compare with the Chongqing index using 1937 as the base period as above. The materials refer to the Chinese and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.

Shanghai had already experienced the outbreak of war in the 26th year of the Republic. The other provinces of Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base period and comparing it with the prices afterwards, in principle, the increase rate should be lower than that in the interior. But the opposite is true. For example, the amount of Shanghai prices in August of the 27th year of the Republic, which has changed from the front line to the rear, has risen more sharply than in the interior. The reason that the high prices in the interior affect the prices in Shanghai is untenable, but it proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more severe than in other places. (End)

### The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy

— Jie

The following two potential benefits of these regulations for China's wartime finance are apparent:

First, the deepening of the legal currency [Fabi] among the people. Taking silver alone, since the implementation of the Fabi system, the silver collected by the government, excluding the original reserves of the various banks, totaled 222.5 million yuan by the end of June 1936. However, it is estimated that as a result of imports and exports over the years, there should be at least 700 million yuan of silver in the country. The minimum that can be concentrated should be 350 million yuan. Then, at least half of the silver in the country should still be scattered among the people. Now, the regulations stipulate that local silver firms and banks may purchase silver to be used as reserves for issuing currency, which makes the Fabi more widely available in poor and remote areas.

Second, the increase in overseas funds. The so-called overseas funds are the financial resources that can be used for international payments. Although all countries in the world have now stopped the gold standard, gold still retains the function of value storage in international payments. As for silver, although it does not have the same storage function as gold, under the Sino-US Monetary Agreement, China can easily exchange silver for gold. Now, through the use of this method, it will be easier to collect gold and silver from various places than relying solely on the Gold and Silver Collection Office to handle it, and rapidly increase overseas funds.

The progress of China's wartime gold and silver collection policy, as discussed in the second paragraph of this article, and the current implementation of the silver firms' gold and silver collection methods, show that the collection methods are becoming more diversified and the anti-fraud rules are becoming more stringent. It is commendable that this has progressed to such a point in just a year and a half. As for using gold and silver collection as a monetary policy in wartime financial policy, replacing the inflationary monetary policy, and using it in parallel with the mutually coordinated policies of taxes, rents, and public debt, this type of wartime financial policy is worth studying.

### The Question of "Atmosphere" in Literary Works

— Yu Hua

What the soldiers at the current stage need is spiritual food, and their heads also need to be armed. Slogans alone, simple works that only shout until the throat is hoarse, already belong to yesterday.

Our advanced writers have deeply felt this point, and have all begun to walk towards the path of "popularizing and improving." That is an excellent phenomenon that follows the war.

Recently, readers everywhere, even the brave soldiers in the trenches, have gradually developed a warm love for literary works. They compete to read battlefield reports full of gunpowder, new and substantial poems, soul-stirring plays, and beautiful and robust novels. They talk about the characters and vivid battle scenes displayed in each literary work. Finally, they gradually felt that literary works were not enough.

Yes, I don't think anyone would satisfiedly admit that our literary works during the War of Resistance have been quite sufficient in terms of quantity and quality, right?

What I want to mention now is the issue of the substance of literary works. But I don't want to review the past here. What I especially want to point out is that our writers have paid too little attention to the question of "atmosphere" in literary works.

Here, I should quote a passage from Forster:

"If the author wants to enhance the reality of his characters, and wants to give the kind of tension required by that action to the main mechanism in his works, then this subtle relationship between things and environment, which is very difficult to obtain, is the most important thing for him. Naturally, this is the nature that most novels with social phenomena as the theme lack. The socialist author's attitude towards 'atmosphere' is certainly different from that of the old realist writers, but he cannot despise it. He can learn the same good methods of creating 'atmosphere' from past writers and from the best novelists of modern times. ... The author must try very subtly to express the transformation of 'atmosphere'."

Currently, our country is immersed in a vigorous struggle, and every small part of everyone's life is closely linked to this great and sacred struggle. Therefore, our literary works are reflecting these great dynamics and artistically organizing people's consciousness. If those works that belonged to yesterday were rewritten by our writers today, we can imagine what kind of results they would reap.

When a writer writes a work, he must pay a lot of attention to the process of transformation of "atmosphere" in his own works. In the process of transformation of "atmosphere", it is necessary to grasp these new factors. And it is necessary to control the "atmosphere" very naturally.

When I read Gorky's "The Forties", he endowed those characters in "Wood Money", and in "Dune Sand", with a character and action that were influenced by the "atmosphere" he controlled. We can explain it from its opposite. In this successful masterpiece, we can study how these "atmospheres" are created. —— We must never ignore Gorky's substantial life!

Therefore, it is also necessary to observe reality more! And to analyze it carefully, to understand the new factors that constitute the development and results of reality.

It is necessary to write the spiritual food that the soldiers need, and be able to live with the soldiers, so our writers will write the most considerate works. —— The question of "atmosphere" in literary works that has been raised is closely related to the question of enriching the lives of our writers.

### Countrymen

— Lv

In the afternoon, two countrymen in their twenties, each carrying a rattan basket, walked one after the other towards the small city gate. The one in front, seeing the yellow-clothed guard, bowed to him as usual, put the rattan basket on the ground, opened the lid, and let him inspect it.

There was only one yellow-clothed guard. As usual, he didn't say a word, put on a stern face, leaned down with one hand on his gun, and stirred up the contents of the rattan basket with the other hand. Impatient, he threw it on the ground as soon as he turned it out.

The countrymen in the back began to do the same as the one in the front, bowing, placing the rattan basket on the ground, and opening the lid. But the yellow-clothed guard was inspecting the first rattan basket and did not notice the second rattan basket. And the [basket] was also somewhat to his side, making it difficult for him to see.

Suddenly, the countrymen in the back took out a small black thing from the second basket. Taking advantage of the yellow-clothed man's lowered head, he pointed the mouth of the small thing at his temple and pulled the trigger. With a pop, the yellow-clothed man fell to the ground, blood gushing out from his temples.

The two countrymen threw the rattan baskets on the ground and turned to run.

The sound alarmed the other yellow-clothed men in the Guandi Temple inside the big city gate. They, about five or six of them, rushed out to see what was going on. At a glance, they knew what had happened. They left two people to attend to the man on the ground and chased after them. However, after crossing the drawbridge, turning two corners, and reaching the crossroads, they had no way to go. They could only stop and hesitate.

Of course, they didn't know that the intruders had already escaped from that street and couldn't chase them in that direction. Also, they knew very well that no matter which street they went down, they could only go half a li before they reached the end, and beyond that were fields and villages. And the fields and villages were a forbidden area that they didn't dare to enter easily.

After asking people on the street without getting any results, they mumbled to each other for a while and had to return to the city.

At the small city gate, while they were cleaning up the dead companion on the ground, they re-examined the things on the ground. Among the broken clothes and messy paper, they found a letter. They opened it and saw the following words inside.

...Don't赖[rely on] dying inside the city walls! If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and let's see who's better on the battlefield! If you don't come down, we'll come up.

Now, let's give you a little color to see...

Below was a formal name: Li Yilong, Captain of the ×× Army's ×× Squad.

Everything was handed over to the city garrison headquarters, and the commander sent someone to find Guo Laoer to discuss it.

Guo Laoer was originally a local bully and was despised by the villagers. Because of his meritorious service in welcoming the yellow-clothed men, they sent him to work in the "Police Bureau". From then on, he said he had obtained the law, and he had wealth and power.

When Guo Laoer arrived, he said that this matter could not be easily let go, and at least a demonstration should be held. They discussed it and divided into half of the people, about fifty or sixty, lined up and left the city. When they reached the crossroads, they went straight ahead, regardless of the left or right.

The street ended, but after another three li, they reached a town. This was Guo Laoer's hometown. Everyone saw Guo Laoer walking at the head of a group of yellow-clothed men, and they all cast poisonous glances at him. They cursed in their hearts, "Shameless beast!" (To be continued)

### In Spring

— Chang

Warrior, Talents, Cat, Old Man Essay

It is now spring, yes, it brings warmth, comfort, vigor, and the vitality of life. We like spring, but often there is warmth, vigor, and the vitality of life. Spring may have its seductiveness, but it can never make the heroic, rational warrior feel depressed, annoyed, or irritable. Although they, who were in icy and snowy conditions, are more active in the spring, continuing a more severe struggle. Shelley said: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" That's right; it's this spring.

"In the third month of late spring, grasses grow in Jiangnan, miscellaneous flowers bloom on trees, and orioles fly in a chaotic manner." This is originally a phenomenon of spring, but it does not yet grasp the rich meaning of spring. We love Jiangnan, and we also love Jiangbei. We love long grass, we love miscellaneous flowers, we also love the White Mountains, we also love the Black Water, even love ice and snow, love wind and rain, love hail, love thunder and lightning. The motherland's great earth is warm everywhere, with its fragrance, even if it is not in spring, we express even greater love, and all of it is forever greater strength. We are forever developing the power of strong battle.

In the feeling of some talented people, spring can become lazy and endlessly lingering. ": "Good times and beautiful scenery, what can be done? Whose courtyard is a delightful thing?" Isn't that the evening's troubles? "A ten-thousand-gold sword is hidden in the autumn waters, and a horse is full of spring sorrows pressing on the embroidered saddle." That was originally the heroic-style spring's suffering of sexual depression of those who are good at sadness and disease. There are not a few romantic talents under the sky, "The flowing water and fallen flowers are gone in spring, in the heavens and on earth." It is precisely the heartbreaking sound before decline, "Leave the soul behind, the remaining body seeks ashes; the green fire does not go out, illuminating the Yan Terrace every night"! "Young heads" are bound to vent a little in secret when they fail in the spring, although they still act in such a secretive manner.

Let us praise the greatness of the power of spring, even if some people dare not face it squarely.

The arrival of spring this year brings with it a solemn and cold atmosphere, but we use a more tragic and joyful heart to caress it, and then let it fly by leisurely. Next year's spring will come again!

That's right, it will come, next year's spring. But even if it is spring, flowers will not grow on the cold white bones. The sorrowful emotions of the samurai talents have been touched, and they are angry, resentful, distressed, and worried, "Spring closes the dreamers" and then takes a long, faint breath. Apart from the venting of wild crab instincts, there is only a full emptiness, "Waiting is having a home but not returning" Ah, ah, ah!

Then the beauty of spring came, the cat was calling on the roof, and the samurai talents under the eaves heard it and immediately went crazy hysterically, finally launching a general attack, a small team surrounded, Dong, Dong, Dong! The spring call stopped sorrowfully, and the cat fell down. But it was even more lonely, and the talents were even more desolate, "A subtle symbol of depression"! Frowning and gnashing their teeth, they felt the same as the cat, in spring.

However, there is no spring in their country, "The authorities of the country yesterday entertained experts in the film industry to explain that films depicting lucky games, which are recognized by the agency as having a negative impact, are also excluded from the ban (according to a Haitong telegram on April 6)." Oh my god, they strangled the cat's heart like this first, and they have already grown old, not acknowledging this article. This line is dead, and they have already grown old, not acknowledging that this is spring—but even if they want to return to youth, it is also a matter of heaven's lack of skill; to prevent this spring, they first carry out the work of castration, and they are usually indifferent to the crazy enjoyment of military-industrial capitalists. This is due to ten thousand new tax increases at work.)

They give you a small amount of non-inheritance, and make some young talents swallow their voices" (the samurai's "calling the sky and pushing the earth" spirit has long been gone from tradition.) However, this reflection is increasingly seen as its foundation is unstable.

Recalling that the Aixin Gioro clan was at the end of the dynasty, although it had also reached the stage of reflection, the skills of "obeying the mandate of heaven" were still done quite well. In response to the "faint smoke and sparse falling flowers" test, there was a sentence "flowers fall but spring remains", which was highly praised by the officials (see Notes from the Chun Zai Hall.) That was to cater to the rulers' mentality of "concealing" the inevitable decline of the world. "Spring often stays here, send! Ah!" Now, I have never heard them start all over again. It's just "concealing" to console the loneliness. The "emptiness" of the Aixin Gioro ruling class itself was already clear. However, that dynasty's unreserved talk of the "falling flowers" phenomenon of Mo Lu undoubtedly had great courage, and they admitted spring.

In the aging period, we still have to castrate spring, and the collapse of a certain ×× is just around the corner. — Whether you admit spring or not is up to you.

A certain warrior filled in the word abacus in suffering, although it also has some talented meaning, but it shows his fighting demeanor. The second half is: "Flowers fall and know the remnants of spring, let the wind and rain go; believe that spring will come again next year, and there should be the same fragrance as before."

Even if this year's spring is solemn and cold, we will welcome him with a tragic and joyful heart, and the arrival of next year's spring will be warmer, and we will be even more joyful.

### Inferior People

— Wen Zongshan

Woodpeckers specialize in finding their food in trees, while pests living in trees are always avoiding their targets.

There are always two different kinds of people in society, which can never be solved with emotion, namely brave people and inferior people.

Late at night, thinking about these small questions, I hope to give myself an unusually accurate answer and clarify my thoughts.

Today I found a satisfactory answer and saw the symbolic woodpeckers and corrosive insects. To put it bluntly, the brave and the inferior are performing very vividly and tragically against the enemy.

Penetrating into the temptation of profit and falling into the deep abyss of wealth, such a person, an inferior fellow, was killed by the brave man according to justice. Someone was surprised, this is "assassination". I said; it's ordinary. Many people are willing to "die for gold", not to mention that this death is quick and its "going to sea" for fame and profit is rapid, which is directly proportional. If you say it's strange, you are probably surprised that his method of death is ordinary, not to everyone's satisfaction, and let's execute him under the judiciary.

Corrosive insects can never escape the woodpecker's sharp beak. You should know that when its sharp beak and tongue curl up the insect, it is an opportunity to tell you the answer.

Inferior people will one day be killed by the brave.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

The sky outside the window is already bright, but the turbid air has not spread out, and the darkness still fills every corner; this is not an ideal morning, with a clear sky and a fiery red sun——

Suddenly, she woke up.

At this time, on the dressing table, someone had already prepared new toothbrushes, toothpaste, towels, soap, and a washbasin filled with warm water for her.
