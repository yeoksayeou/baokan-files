### The Basic Tasks of Commemorating Teachers' Day

— Xu Xin

The War of Resistance has lasted for nearly two years. Today we commemorate Teachers' Day, and the significance of this day is self-evident. However, to properly adapt to this significant meaning, each of us teachers should grasp our basic tasks and work hard, ××××××××××××.

Because of the motherland's ××, Hong Kong has seen a dramatic increase in the number and quality of teachers. Due to the contradiction between "supply and demand," most teachers staying in Hong Kong live an inhuman life in a poor economic environment. Being able to afford two meals of rice is already considered great luck, and there are young teachers who have drifted here after enduring countless hardships, ×××××××××××××××××××, only to find themselves in a desperate situation.

Therefore, as the public enthusiastically calls for "spiritual mobilization" and "national oaths" to commemorate Teachers' Day, we must solemnly raise the issue of our basic tasks to everyone's attention.

(1) Expand the unity of teachers and consolidate the unified group of teachers. As the new stage of ×× is about to begin, everyone should understand ××××××××××××××××××. Therefore, the Fifth Plenary Session specifically declared the importance of "strengthening unity" and "consolidating unification." Anyone who engages in divisive activities today is a traitor, ××, and a pawn in the schemes of the pro-peace faction. Every patriot loyal to the nation can see through their treachery. However, when it comes to the unity of teachers in Hong Kong, it is not enough. Especially in the form of this year's Teachers' Day commemoration, the two districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon have not been able to centralize and unify. Unity has not been fully developed in form. This can be said to be a regrettable thing! However, "it is no use crying over spilt milk." We don't need to excessively investigate "who is to blame." As long as we teachers, who bear the mission of nurturing talent for the country, should self-reflect and consciously strive to strengthen the unity of all teachers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and consolidate and expand the organization of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association. Especially those teachers who are responsible for leading this organization should urgently seek remedial measures. To consolidate the people's united front, to pledge allegiance to the nation, and to implement today's national oath.

(2) Rapidly Rescue Unemployed and Destitute Young Teachers: Rescuing unemployed teachers while solving the problem of out-of-school children. We believe that the measures taken by the wise authorities of the provincial government are "perfect." However, unfortunately, financial resources are limited, and there is ultimately a feeling of "too many monks, too little porridge." Of course, the rescue method should not completely rely on government assistance, but should be initiated and advocated by the leaders of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Associations.

For example, how to conduct a broad survey and statistics on out-of-school children and young workers, women, and newspaper delivery boys who need to be educated in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and also register unemployed and destitute teachers. On the one hand, mobilize the support or donations of wealthy schools, and on the other hand, appeal to the society, so that all sectors or overseas Chinese shareholders and wealthy households can provide strong assistance. This can largely solve their livelihood problems. Secondly, mobilize the brave, spirited, and politically conscious unemployed or destitute teachers to organize a service team to return to the country and dedicate themselves directly to the nation. In short, all of this should be actively shouldered by the responsible officials leading the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association.

Secondly, I also hope that the principals of "schools with resources" should reflect on their conscience and not take advantage of others' misfortune for profit. Although we are actively seeking the highest principles of "unity" and "unification" today, we should not emphasize the conflict of interests between principals and teachers. But in fact, in today's situation of national destruction and family tragedy, even people from friendly countries are aroused with human sympathy, let alone compatriots who are also "fellow sufferers"?

(3) Promote ×× Education: "×××××××××××××××××" This is the common feeling of most teachers staying in Hong Kong. However, upon closer examination, the facts do not seem to be entirely true. The biggest problem lies in whether we have the determination to implement it. Indeed, due to various difficulties, the education authorities have to limit the curriculum of each school, but fundamentally they are absolutely sympathetic to China's self-defense ××. With this sympathy as a foundation, if we do not excessively expose childish tendencies, it is possible and will be tacitly approved by them. But before we promote and implement ×× Education, we must first rectify and correct the backward, prison-like old-fashioned education. For example, most of the primary schools in Hong Kong still exist in the form of old-style private schools. They are still using the "Classics" to blur the minds of a large group of innocent children and to destroy their potential. This should be corrected before implementing wartime education. As for how to improve general wartime knowledge. ×××××××××××××, and all kinds of knowledge that students urgently need. All kinds of teaching methods and forms should be brought to the general organization of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association for detailed discussion and active promotion.

In short, we should not just hold a commemorative ceremony in vain and be done with it. We should put forward the current urgent basic tasks and widely discuss them with all the teachers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. This is an opinion that is beneficial to the nation, and I believe it will definitely arouse social resonance and become a concrete action, which would be fortunate indeed.

### Ashamed to Be a Teacher

— Huang Sheng

A person ashamed to be a teacher really feels a little apprehensive about making comments on "Teachers' Day." Let's borrow a savior.

Mencius said: "People's problem lies in being fond of being teachers!"

Mentioning this sentence, friends in the chalk-dust profession cannot help but tremble. -- Teachers' Day is really not a happy day, so I have to take this opportunity to deeply blame myself. However, many friends have held the teaching whip for a long time. If it is said that they are all "afflicted," then the disease has penetrated into the marrow and cannot be cured. Even if it is just entering the door, the time is still shallow; but if white paper is stained, it will take a lot of effort to wash it again. What to do, what to do!

However, friends, please listen to my explanation. Mencius's words are certainly correct, and we should deeply alert ourselves. However, we are not guilty and do not need to repent, because we are just "being teachers," but we are not "fond of being teachers." The difference of one word makes the meaning different: The so-called "fond of being teachers" means "being a teacher without anything to teach." We are not high above, being a dignified teacher. Instead, we live with young students, sharing their love, joy, sorrow, and happiness, and only seek to be of some help and benefit to them, which we are happy about. As for putting on airs, being arrogant, with eyes on the top of the head, not looking at reality; or flaunting erudition, as if knowing everything, that is the attitude of what famous people. We do not have such courage and dare not emulate it; we are also ashamed of our appearance and dare not follow it. And the reason why we think we are innocent and do not need to repent lies precisely in this.

A bunch of idle talk. Friends, please forgive my rudeness and do not blame me deeply. That would be very fortunate.

It seems that it is necessary to talk about how a teacher should be; but in this way, it is a theory, that kind of grand article, let other friends write it. I really do not have this ability. If it is necessary to say a few words to join in the fun, it is just a humble opinion, very shallow.

Here, young students launched a self-renewal movement not long ago. That kind of conscious cry and rational flame is still in my ears and before my eyes. This place is full of the decadent style of the "end of the century" and the remnants of feudalism, which poison the body and mind of young students and foster their improper desires. Thanks to the gift of the great era, they have all begun to awaken. If we teachers take training young cadres as a way to serve the War of Resistance, then it is our urgent task to promote the self-renewal movement of young people in a down-to-earth manner.

We should not stand outside and be a "consultant," as if it has nothing to do with us and let success or failure take its course. Instead, we must encourage ourselves and others in the movement to achieve results. Moreover, the so-called "self-renewal" is not meaningless to us. Above, it is said that we are not guilty and do not need to repent, which means that we have never been "fond of being teachers" and presumptuously arrogant, but it does not mean that we have no defects and can be self-satisfied. Taking advantage of this Teachers' Day, we deeply reflect on ourselves, review the past, and plan for the future, which is necessary. We first admit that the connection between friends is really not enough. At a small gathering of teaching friends, I also heard great discussions against organizing symposiums. How that kind of individualism hinders our progress. I have no other courage, but today I dare to make an urgent suggestion to all teaching friends in Hong Kong:

Establish a united front of Hong Kong teachers!

### How Should ×× Teachers Be Inspired by the "June 6th Festival"?

— Lei Tongqun

The implementation of the "June 6th Festival" in Guangdong has been going on for four years. At the beginning, only a few teachers advocated it, and the rest did not participate. Even those who participated did not know its meaning. Therefore, the general social psychology mistakenly believes that this is a sign of teachers' "tiredness," and secretly calls it a "Teachers' Lazy Day," just as they regard "Children's Day" as a "Students' Lazy Day." Especially in Guangdong, fathers and elder brothers have always been particularly demanding of teachers, with a feeling that "even a tiny flaw cannot be tolerated." Therefore, they often harbor slanderous words about the "June 6th Festival." Moreover, in recent years, the education authorities and even the school authorities in ×× have formally made some diligent rectification efforts, believing that this innovation is unnecessary. Therefore, on the one hand, there are principals who talk about "no holidays on Sundays," and on the other hand, there are those who advocate "abolishing annual vacations and summer vacations," as if the service level of education in Guangdong is about to surpass that of emerging countries in Europe and America?

However, when we retreat and think deeply about it, the more extreme formalism becomes, the more empty its content becomes. And education must not be imitated in appearance. "Those who value the external must be clumsy internally." This has been a clear lesson since ancient times. If one believes that not allowing holidays throughout the year is the essence of education, then the general winter teachers would have already excelled in it, and today's emerging educators would become fools. It must be known that they are not machines, nor are they melons, and their spirit has three vigor and three decline every day. If we calculate the whole year, there must be vigor, decline, tension, and relaxation. Modern enlightened schools, every seven or five years, specially allow teachers to stop teaching for a year for rest and recuperation, or to travel for research and travel. Their intention is derived from the ancient Israelites' legacy of stopping plowing every seven years, so it is specially called the "Sabbath year." If a whole year, as the saying goes, "the old grain is gone, the new grain is up, drilling wood to get fire," can still be used for rest, then why say that this "June 6th Festival" can be begrudged and not used as a "rest day" for teachers? Therefore, I say that the establishment of Teachers' Day, solely for the spiritual recuperation of sacred servers, already feels well-founded and reasonable.

Moreover, the education of our country - especially primary and secondary schools! As far as the current stage is concerned, it is already very large. According to the investigation of the League of Nations Investigation Team, it is precisely believed that the teaching hours of teachers are too many, and the hours of students' free research are too many, which leads to the danger of indigestion and the stripping of personality. This point is so different from what our bureaucratic education authorities are worried about! Why not observe the schools at all levels in the United States, which are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, teaching only five days a week, and only a few hours each day, reducing the teaching hours by one-third compared with our country. If so, if it is said that all American teachers are lazy, would they accept it cheerfully? It is known that the inferiority of Chinese education lies not in the lack of quantity, but in the lack of quality! Some say that in recent years, Chinese schools have been taking too many holidays for no reason, and we really cannot bear to fuel the flames. I say that from now on, holidays must be very measured and should not be abolished because of one choking. Generally speaking, memorials or local events that are only about individuals do not need to be taken off, and one hour of lectures or recollections in the daily lessons is enough. However, in the case of national celebrations or major events, or even reflections and recuperations of all teachers and students, they cannot be left out. From the perspective of the government and the general society, proper respect should be shown to Teachers' Day, so as to promote the good customs of "respecting teachers and valuing the Tao" in our country, and invisibly increase the sense of responsibility of the general clergy, and no longer use " monkeys" or "cattle and horses" and other private names to belittle themselves; only by the self-respect of teachers can the character of future citizens be raised to a higher level, which is of great importance. Also, from the perspective of the teachers themselves, every time this festival is approaching, there should be an expression of spiritual inspiration, making good plans for far-sightedness and grand plans for reflection and planning for the future. By no means should this day be regarded as a convenience for enjoyment, or throwing pheasants and shouting at the casino, staying up all night, or taking cups and raising glasses, relying on beautiful women. If so, it is not only digging one's own grave, but also harming the children of others. Looking at the future of the nation, it can be predicted that the country will perish and families will be broken up!

We live in seclusion, and we are ashamed of our decline ×× as a great shame, and we have the thought of "not forgetting being in Ju" every moment. Like fish in ponds and birds in forests, their aspirations lie in rivers, lakes, mountains, and swamps. On the occasion of this exciting festival and the sudden publication of articles, I feel like there are thorns in my throat and I cannot but speak out - based on my own knowledge, I believe that there should be concrete expressions and spiritual reflections in Teachers' Day, and I list the main points on the left, so that people in this field can know a little about the direction and encourage each other to move forward?

【A】Concrete expressions that should be had:

【1】 Send letters to the ×× leaders and generals on the front line, representing the people's respect, and pledge to be the backing of the spiritual front.

【2】 Focus on the problems that should be studied and implemented in ×× education, and widely solicit research and investigation methods and their implementation steps.

【3】 There should be a new organization of the "Teachers' Federation," to wash away the old sectarian opinions, and strive to achieve the level of educational academicization and socialization. That is, take advantage of the teachers to strengthen or reorganize it, and those who take advantage of private plans can be allowed not to join.

【4】 Now in the process of continuing ××, the general public has repeatedly made concrete expressions of donations. Teachers are originally spiritual guides of the people. Even if they cannot donate as much as they want, they must make appropriate suggestions for the country and society, and publish them on the "June 6th Festival."

【5】 There should be a temporary publication to add concrete ornaments to educational improvement ideas and rescue ideas. If it is inconvenient to organize, you must still collect valuable works and publish them in newspapers to show the spirit and thoughts of teachers in wartime, and not to be depressed.

(6) On a personal level, in this great era, it is also not advisable to only focus on teaching, but to measure one's strengths. Personally take on one of the rear service work: such as continuing to complete a certain ××××, or thoroughly researching a certain topic in wartime; or supervising students to collect certain items, etc., anything that has not been started on weekdays should be started anew on Teachers' Day.

(B) Spiritual reflections that should be had:

(1) We, with our small bodies, are admired by the crowd, and we are the forward and rear sentries of the spiritual front of the general public. How should we practice courage, mind, and strength, so that the last line of defense will never be "disordered and disorderly"?

(2) The role of education originally has a kind of character infectiousness. How should we make personal character perfect and consistent in order to achieve the effect of "teaching without words" and "doing nothing and achieving everything"?

(3) What is valuable to educators lies in "spiritual property" Intelleetuil Treasury, not in "material property" Materal Treasury. Is it true that our philosophy of life has Mencius's so-called "wealth and nobility cannot be adulterous, poverty and humility cannot be moved, and power cannot be bent," "they use their position, and I use my benevolence, they use their rank, and I use my righteousness" and other awareness? Is it "seeing wealth and nobility and flattering, and meeting poverty and humility and acting"? Is it still happy in vegetables and water, and still not sad in tattered clothes? This key is currently teaching the teacher if he does not.

(4) All teaching materials and activities in modern education must reach the level of "socialization" and "childization" in order to make the educated people hear and enter the heart, dance with hands and feet, learn one and have one use, and at the same time, they must also consider one learning and one migration, so that what they learn has multiple professional relationships with the society, and then they can learn by analogy and respond endlessly. Is what we teach still using the "high-headed chapter" method of the winter teachers, only explaining the literal meaning or the meaning of the article, so that the scholars' intentions cannot go beyond the books, or even return to the nature of Heshu and Wuhuai? If so, what we implement will always be a kind of "dead education," how can we promote "×××××××"? This must be thoroughly reflected on

(5) The four words "production education" have so far become an oily throat, and very few teachers have actually shouldered the burden - however, if Chinese education at the current stage is not promoted to be positive "productionization," it will become negative "bankruptcy." The general "abolition of education theory" and even "the uselessness of education theory" are actually due to the unremitting efforts of one person who does not work with four limbs and does not distinguish between five grains - technicians, and graduates who have cultivated "hands do not cooperate" on weekdays, adding a large number of unemployed troops to the society, which has led to this. How should we urgently test various skin-changing drugs from "family design" and "school work design"? This is even the last and most serious reflection.

### Our Army in Hubei and Henan Shows a New Look; All Roads in Central Hubei Are Completely Under Our Control; Yan Xishan Discusses the Anti-Japanese War Situation in Shanxi

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 5th] Laohekou Telegram, our forces in Hubei and Henan have been strengthened, and the deployment is new. The battle situation on the Xiang River bank, and on the Jingzhong, Hanyi, and Huaxiang roads has been stable in recent days. We are using a large-scale control strategy to strike at the invading ×. There have been fierce battles near Tianmen and Jingshan. More than a thousand invading enemy forces in Qianjiang are still surrounded by us.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 5th] In the northern occupied areas, × and puppet forces are actively extorting land taxes and forcibly conscripting civilian labor, so the people are indignant, and their determination to resist the war is even stronger. The number of guerrillas is increasing daily, attacking × everywhere, and the × and puppet schemes are not succeeding. × are constantly increasing to the occupied areas, still being transferred from various places. Many have been departing from Qingdao along the Jinan-Jinan West route recently. The Tianjin-Pukou × transportation is also busy, but our troops are lurking everywhere on both routes, destroying transportation and inflicting great blows. Except for the transportation lines in Hebei and Shandong, there is still no trace of ×. The × at the junction of Hebei and Shandong has been mostly eliminated. More than a thousand in Wuchang mutinied.

[Min Ge She, Electric Message from Xingji on the 5th] This reporter recently met General Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the × War Zone, in a certain place in Shanxi. He has been personally lecturing military, government, and civilian cadres at all levels on national revolutionary warfare. In the midst of his busy schedule, he spoke freely with this reporter, stating briefly: "At present, no matter how the × people compete for strongholds, because our army has penetrated deep into the rear of the × people, the area actually occupied by the × people is shrinking day by day, and the area controlled by our army is expanding day by day. Our army is located within a few miles of the ×. In Shanxi Province, all 105 counties now have our county magistrates. National revolutionary warfare has been launched on a large scale. Our army already has a combined force, and our soldiers have the confidence of not letting the × come, not being afraid of the × coming, the × coming is even better, driving the × away, not being afraid of the × not leaving, not leaving is even better. Empty houses and clear fields further blind the eyes of the ×, block the ears of the ×, block the mouths of the ×, and bind the legs of the ×, so that the × cannot see the common people, cannot hear our military situation, cannot eat food, and cannot move. At present, Shanxi is engaged in consolidating a million organized people and forging an iron army of 300,000 capable forces to fiercely strike the × and defend the Northwest."

Silence in Hunan and Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 4th] Our army on the north bank of the Xinqiang River, after defeating the × who harassed near Caoxieling on the 3rd, carried out a powerful search around Caoxieling and Mabushan that night, and cleared out the remaining enemy within five miles in front of our position. The enemy facing us is still entrenched in the original minority strongholds near the ten-kilometer area southeast of Yuezhou, stubbornly defending with strong fortifications.

Silence in Hunan and Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 4th] × in Yueyang recently forced hundreds of workers in the city to forcibly build the Yueyang to Xitang highway, which has now been completed. × then executed more than 20 workers in the suburbs of Yueyang on the 1st without any reason. The workers in Yueyang City were greatly shocked when they heard the news, and the whole city went on strike. As of the 3rd, work had not yet resumed.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 4th] Recently, our guerrillas have been extremely active in the area between Banailing, Yekou City, Dawu, Caotang, Xiali, Baishaqiao, Baidun, and Gaozui in the Xianning-Chongyang-Tongyu region. The transportation and communication of × in various places have been destroyed by us from time to time. Many cars have been overturned, and traffic between Xianning and Tongcheng is impossible.

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 4th] On the 3rd and 4th, a small number of × troops repeatedly attacked the Inner Li Yu family area on the north bank of the Jin River. Our army bravely resisted, and the × were unsuccessful and retreated in a panic. They have now turned silent.

Stalemate in Guangdong

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 5th] According to reliable foreign news, the Japanese garrison on Haifu Island suffered heavy losses from a surprise attack by Chinese guerrillas. On the 29th of last month, 30 Japanese military vehicles were attacked by ambushing guerrillas, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese also opened fire to retaliate. About ten guerrillas were injured. The guerrillas there have repeatedly received military fire supplies from the outside world to attack the Japanese army, causing the Japanese to only be able to hold on to some important strongholds and not to penetrate inland. At present, most of the Japanese troops on Hainan Island have been transferred to Guangdong to prevent a counterattack by the Chinese army, leaving only naval landing battle teams and reconnaissance bombers of about 50 aircraft to defend Hainan.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shaoguan, 5th] From the 1st to the 4th of this month, × troops were active in the south of Yueyang and Nanchang and were repelled by our army. At present, the battle situation on both lines has quieted down, and Shaoguan is no longer threatened. The × in Guangdong Province are concentrated in Xinhui and Heshan, because the terrain is flat and conducive to mechanized units. Our army is temporarily taking a defensive posture. However, in Conghua, Huaxian, Dongguan, and Zengcheng, our army is still taking an offensive posture. In the Shantou area, two newly arrived × destroyers have made the situation tense again. Air raid alert today.

Jin-Sui Offensive

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] The × in Daying, Shahe, and Wutai in northeastern Shanxi recently attacked our army's positions in Huaitai Gengjiazhuang. The × departing from Daying to Shentangbao fought with our army for seven days and nights, and finally surrounded the × in the Daying Tulouzi area. Except for a few × who fled to Daying, most were wiped out. In this battle, more than 500 × were annihilated, and more than 200 rifles, more than 20 heavy machine guns, one mortar, more than 100 war horses, and many other military supplies were seized.

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 4th] Our Detachment Commander Chen led his unit of more than 200 men and more than 150 men from Detachment Wu to cross the river and carry out guerrilla warfare in Guyang, Wuchuan County, on April 11th and returned on May 1st. During this trip, Detachment Commander fought eight battles with ×. Two of our Chen commanders and 37 soldiers were killed. The × killed Yamaguchi, two second lieutenants, and more than 90 soldiers. Two cars were destroyed. The ratio of × to our deaths was three to one. × mobilized cavalry, cars, and airplanes to surround us twice, and we broke through each time with minimal losses.

At noon on the 4th, six × aircraft flew to the military crossing at Songjiachuan. × aircraft have been reconnoitering the Yellow River crossings from Songjiachuan to Kuangou for days.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] One × aircraft flew to Suide City today and dropped three bombs. We suffered no losses.

### Puppet Mongolian Soldiers Are War-Weary; Intercepted Military Letters Full of Blood and Tears; Painfully Narrating the Tragic Situation After the Fall of the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 4th] Our unit recently intercepted several letters in Japanese and Mongolian from the relatives of puppet military officers in the puppet Manchukuo in Wuchuan County, describing the bandit's war-weariness and the tragic situation of the × trampling on the Mongolian people in the Northeast. Two pieces are translated as follows: (1) A certain Mongolian citizen wrote to Gao Xingge, an officer of the puppet Eighth Division, saying, "I was conscripted and am now serving in the army in Xinglin. My body is not free. My family is really in trouble. The old and young are dependent on no one. After receiving the letter, please find a way to ask the commander to let me go home. If it is difficult to do so, please also send a letter, and I will come up with another idea." (2) Lu Guan'er, a Mongolian citizen from the Houqi of Guandong, wrote to Hu, the puppet military commander, saying, "I received the letter on the 29th and learned that my father had died in battle. I am so sad that I cannot bear to live. (Omission) My family also has a grandmother in her eighties and an eight-year-old child. Speaking of it, only the whole family cries. Since the establishment of 'Manchukuo' in our area, three or five families have lived together. Livestock, land, and household appliances are all taxed. All kinds of hardships are difficult to describe in one word. The Mongolian people oppressed by 'Manchukuo' can hardly breathe. Everyone's tears are exhausted, followed by blood. Please find a way to transport my father's body to Wutaishan for burial. I am infinitely grateful. At present, Qian Dan is serving in the army in your regiment, and his family really has no one to take care of. Please let him go home early," and so on. The tears and blood vessels are heartbreaking to read, and one cannot help but shed tears of sympathy, and feel sad for the Mongolian compatriots in the puppet Manchukuo.

### Private Feng Denggao Single-Handedly Rejects ×; Shoots and Kills × Soldiers, Preventing × Battalion from Invading; A Good Story in the History of the War of Resistance

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 4th] In the battle of Xiashuichengwan, Qingshuihe, where a certain cavalry division ambushed in Suiyou, Private Feng Denggao rejected the enemy alone, creating a glorious record. The process is as follows: On the 27th of last month, the × Division fought fiercely with × in Xiangshuba, Qingshuihe. Feng Denggao, a private in the communications platoon of the × regiment, was killed in battle. Feng was ordered to retreat to the rear. When resting in the village of Xiashuichengwan on the riverbank on the afternoon of the 28th, he discovered that the entire village was being invaded by × cavalry. The villagers fled in all directions. Feng stayed alone, aiming and shooting. Six × cavalrymen were shot and killed, three of them. The × unit of two to three hundred was at Taijianliang, four or five miles away from Xiashuichengwan. The outpost was blocked, and they occupied the mountain head and shot at Xiashuichengwan with machine guns and small iron cannons. Feng also kept fighting back and changing direction, confusing the ×. At dusk, the × knew that there were no large forces in Xiashuichengwan, so they surrounded and invaded the village. Fortunately, a certain regiment of the Sui Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army arrived to reinforce, and the × retreated. In this battle, Feng killed several × soldiers alone, and rejected the × battalion, causing the × to consume a large amount of ammunition. Feng himself fought hard for a day, and only two holes were shot through his trouser legs by × bullets. According to reports, Feng is a native of Fanxian, Shandong, and is 26 years old.

### British Military Attaché C.M. Spink Still in Custody; × Regards Him as a Spy

[Reuters, Beiping, 1st] A Japanese spokesman admitted this afternoon that the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou did detain Colonel C.M. Spink, the military attaché of the British Embassy in China, on May 26. Spink was originally scheduled to arrive in Beiping from Chongqing at the end of May, but last Tuesday, a Japanese newspaper suddenly published a news item saying that a mysterious foreigner claiming to be a military officer of a third country's embassy had been detained in Zhangjiakou on May 26. It was heard that Colonel Spink was carrying a passport. The Japanese did not admit until today that they had detained a British person. The Japanese spokesman explained this action, saying that people from the Chinese front are all regarded as spies.

### Bishop Yu Bin Lectures in the United States; Ford Presents Him with a Car

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] American Jicai Port, May 18th Air News, The 35th Anniversary Conference of the National Anliang Industry and Commerce Association of America was held in Jicai Port on April 24th. Bishop Yu Bin was specially invited to attend the meeting to speak about the situation of the Chinese War of Resistance. Bishop Yu arrived in Port on the 2nd with his secretaries Mao Zhenxiang and Pan Chaoying. Representatives of the conference went to the station to meet him. Consul General Lv Ziqin, Chairman of the Chinese Association Chen Kunlou, and representatives of hundreds of organizations such as the Jicai Anti-Japanese Association and the Women's Association were also at the station to welcome him. First, Zhou Zizai and Ruan Benwan, the general managers of the Anliang Industry and Commerce Association, introduced Bishop Yu to the overseas Chinese and friendly people. Then, he went to the Anliang Industry and Commerce Association to give a lecture, with more than 400 members attending. Bishop Yu analyzed the recent situation of the War of Resistance, strongly denounced the violence of the × and the tragic suffering of the refugees in various places, saying that it was unprecedented in ancient times. The lecture lasted for an hour before the meeting was adjourned. Then, there was a joint meeting between China and the United States. The mayor of the port and leaders from all walks of life participated. The association felt that disaster relief was as urgent as putting out a fire, and immediately remitted 3,000 US dollars back to the country to handle emergency relief. In addition, the general manager of the Ford Motor Factory in the port admired Bishop Yu Bin and hosted a luncheon for him on May 3. The elderly Ford did not hesitate to travel to meet and talk with him. After the conversation, the elderly man generously gave him a brand-new car and a newly invented light cultivator that had not yet been put into use. His intention was to provide Bishop Yu with a means of transportation and to help farmers increase production. The meaning is profound and worth recording.

### Expansion of Haiphong Port to Meet the Needs of Our War of Resistance

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kunming, 5th] Since the start of the war, the port of Haiphong in Vietnam has been crowded with officials and people. The French authorities in Vietnam are now consulting with the Haiphong Municipal Government and the local Chamber of Commerce to appoint a committee to study ways to expand the port.

### Wang Is Very Active; There Is a Saying That He Flew to Fukuoka with Kita; He Is Trying to Buy Newspapers in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] Shanghai News, It was rumored yesterday that Wang Jingwei returned to Shanghai from Tokyo on the 2nd, but according to confidential information from the × and puppet side, a giant aircraft was sent from Tokyo to Shanghai on the 2nd to pick up Wang. Wang then flew to Fukuoka with Kita and Harada on the 2nd.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] Shanghai News, Since Wang Jingwei left Chongqing, he has colluded with × and repeatedly published absurd claims, hoping to confuse the people and undermine the war of resistance. However, most of the people deeply understand the righteousness, and not only are not deceived by him, but also strongly criticize him. Wang felt that his ability to call was insufficient, so he decided to buy newspapers in Shanghai and Hong Kong to carry out his tricks to poison the people. It was heard that in March, Han once sent his dog to contact Yan Baoli, the manager of Wenhui News, saying that he could invest 500,000, but on the condition that the newspaper must abandon its anti-Japanese stance, not oppose the peace talks, and publish the views of the system in moderation. Yan refused. Now, according to reliable information, Wang is planning to spend 65,000 to 100,000 yuan to contact the British director of the newspaper, Ke Ming, to buy the matter, which was heard by the colleagues of the editorial department of the newspaper, and immediately published a notice, saying that due to internal changes in the newspaper, Manager Yan resigned, and specifically asked the newspaper authorities to guarantee that the original editorial policy would not be changed and that the original consistent position would be maintained. Before a satisfactory reply was received, colleagues would not participate in the editorial work for the time being. The Chinese shareholders of the newspaper also sent a letter to the British director, Ke Ming, based on the notice, expressing their attitude. His righteousness and integrity are commendable. It is also heard that Wang is also interested in the Daily Translation News and International Daily, etc., in Shanghai, in addition to the Wenhui News. Currently, they are all in the midst of being tempted and firmly rejected.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 5th] The Guilin Provisional Senate passed a resolution on the 5th to request the National Government to severely punish Wang Jingwei.

Short Comment

### Congratulations on Teachers' Day

Today is the great Teachers' Day.

Teachers in Hong Kong and Kowloon will jointly hold a celebration meeting today and hold a national oath-taking ceremony. 3,000 people will participate. We celebrate this unprecedented grand event in the Hong Kong and Kowloon teaching community. We celebrate the glorious day when teachers and staff in Kowloon are united under the flag of the motherland.

In the past, various European and American countries have used the glory of victory to repay the virtue of teachers. At present, the struggle of our motherland is not only for the independence of our country, but also for defending democratic politics, defending world peace and human culture. Compared with any war in history, it has a more progressive and great significance. How to make all education serve the struggle of the motherland should be the central task of every teacher today. This is the first point we hope from the gentlemen who participate in the celebration and national oath-taking today.

However, to serve loyally in supporting the supreme leader and policies of the Central Government, the main thing is to strengthen the unity of our education sector itself, improve our lives, and strive to study and cultivate ourselves in all our work, in the student masses, and in collective life. ××××××××. This is the second point we hope from the gentlemen of the teaching staff under the threat of artillery fire.

Although the overseas Chinese education community is fortunate to be spared the bombing of × artillery fire, the environment is more difficult, the education objects are more complex, and the responsibilities it bears today are particularly important—"The task is heavy and the road is long." We cannot but pay our lofty respect to the gentlemen here for the liberation of the motherland and the progress of world culture!

### Consolidation of the Xiang River Position; Valiant Soldiers in the North Are Brave and Good at Fighting; A Reuters Reporter's Inspection Report

[Reuters, May 28th] After inspecting the Chinese front line on the Han River opposite Zhongxiang, 120 miles northwest of Hankou, the reporter felt that everything seemed to be in favor of the Chinese army. The reporter took a truck to Jinmen Town on the Xiangyi Highway, and from there rode a horse for 30 miles to reach the Han River. The villages between Jinmen and the Han River are mountainous and undulating, with many watery rice fields, so the situation seems to be quite favorable for defense. After the complete destruction of the Zhongxiang-Jindou Highway, the natural national difficulties of the mountainous area have become increasingly important. I witnessed the destruction of the last stage of the highway. A large number of farmers dug tank traps in higher places, and the road surface passing through the rice fields was collapsed into the water by water buffaloes and turned into a wet field. It is said that the farmers participated in this road destruction work completely voluntarily, because the villages along the highway were all subjected to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, so there was no need to guide them, and they were all happy to participate actively and enthusiastically. After I arrived at the headquarters of the military corps, the officers and their subordinates gave me a warm reception. The soldiers here were all strong and healthy northerners who liked to eat raw scallions and drink strong alcohol. They were extremely brave in resisting the Japanese army. The next day, I went to the front line to visit the situation at that time, which was quite quiet. After the Japanese army repeatedly tried to cross the river in that area and failed, it moved its main force north yesterday. I was led by a military officer to inspect the trenches along the Han River. The fortifications were very strong and had air-raid shelters, which were quite similar to those seen in Suixian. At that time, a few sentries were stationed in the trenches, and the main force was resting in the rear. The place where we were standing at that time was directly opposite the city of Zhongxiang, and we could clearly see its city walls. The river surface there was about a jia ban, and the river water was very shallow and not very rapid. Because of the width of the river and the machine gun fire on the shore, the Japanese army repeatedly tried to cross the river and failed. Those stationed in this area are all North China troops, and their physique is extremely strong. Because of their brave fighting, the residents here gave them high praise. Their discipline and equipment are very good, but they feel the lack of heavy artillery. The morale is also very high. Among the military and civilians in various parts of northern Hubei, although there are inevitable expressions of difficulty, unease, and resentment, no one is willing to seek peace immediately. The various commanders and officials of the Chinese army praise the strategy of firmly defending the current position while guerrilla teams harass the rear of the Japanese army. On that day, the Chinese army ordered a certain regiment to cross the Han River south of Zhongxiang and move north to attack the Japanese army, and then establish contact with the Chinese army closest to the Da Hongshan area. A certain military officer said to me that this move is feasible, and it can be clearly seen that the Japanese claim that they have surrounded 100,000 Chinese troops in this area is unreliable. On the way back, the reporter saw the fake artillery positions set up by the Chinese army, and the surrounding areas were all craters formed by Japanese aircraft dropping bombs. This kind of clever trick is often used by the Chinese army, and they are happy to see the Japanese army wasting bombs. The health of the soldiers has now become a matter of great concern in the armies in various parts of Hubei Province. There are not many mosquitoes, and malaria is common. Other diseases, such as skin diseases, are also quite rampant. Because the weather is gradually getting warmer, there is a great possibility of cholera and dysentery occurring one after another. The lack of quinine makes malaria more difficult to control. It is hoped that China's agricultural harvest this year will be as abundant as last year, which is extremely important for the long-term war of resistance, because only when the army and farmers have enough food and clothing can they be loyal to the country. Judging from the current strategy used by the Chinese army, it is also expected that the Sino-Japanese war will be extended for several years, because the Chinese army is determined to use this to deplete the strength of the Japanese army. To achieve this goal, sufficient food is an important factor. The Chinese army's strategy has now made the Japanese army tired, and Chinese military officers believe that this strategy will not change until the Japanese army sends reinforcements.

### 西寧 Observations

— 君 [Name of Author]

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Xining is an ancient central location. From the time Emperor Wu of Han drove out the Western Qiang people and established "Lingju," for over two thousand years, it has been a battleground for the survival and competition between our Han people and other ethnic groups. It was occupied for a long period by the Tubo people. During the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty, the homeland was recovered, and it was renamed Xining Guard. When the Manchu Qing dynasty took control of China, Xining also fell. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was renamed Xining Dao. In the fifteenth year, the Dao was abolished and replaced with an administrative region. In the seventeenth year, Qinghai province was established, and Xining became the capital of Qinghai. Xining is bordered by the Huangshui River to the north and the Lajishan Mountains to the south. It is surrounded by undulating and undefined mountain ranges. The provincial capital is located in a basin. The city circumference is about four kilometers, with four city gates. Three gates were opened outside the city. The city walls are brick on the outside and earth on the inside, more imposing than Lanzhou. The city is full of memorial archways and magnificent halls, more ancient and elegant than Lanzhou. People say it resembles Beiping in some ways, especially the elm and willow trees lining the northern outskirts, and the undulating landscape, which resembles the area along the city walls of the four suburbs of Beiping.

Because Xining is irrigated by the Huangshui River, the soil is fertile, suitable for planting forests and crops such as beans and wheat. Because the area is in a cold zone, spring arrives later. However, pear and apple trees have already blossomed, and wheat seedlings have been transplanted. After entering Qinghai, one immediately feels like being in a rural area south of the Yangtze River. We arrived in Xining on the evening of April 30th, which happened to be the eleventh night of the third lunar month. The bright moon was in the sky. Walking on East Street, one felt like treading the moon on the passage outside Tiananmen Square in Beiping. Therefore, one feels that Tang poet Liu Zhongyong's line: "The city of Qinghai has only the moon, the yellow sands have no end," is an exaggeration. Perhaps in the Tang Dynasty, Qinghai was still a cold and desolate region beyond the border. When our car entered the city through the East Gate, the first impression was the slogan written on the city gate. The horizontal banner read: "Build a New Qinghai" in five large characters. The two couplets on the sides were: "Obey the Supreme Leader Chairman Chiang" and "Support Chairman Ma, who has worked hard." It also listed the province's six major central tasks: (1) Line and group Baojia, (2) Training strong men, (3) Actively afforestation, (4) Strictly prohibit opium, (5) Build highways, (6) Promote literacy. This shows that the spirit of hard work of the Qinghai Provincial Government is far beyond what people outside the province can imagine.

Xining is a metropolis where six ethnic groups, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and Tu, live together. Except for the Manchu, who have been assimilated by the Han, and the Mongolian, with only a few Mongolian princes and their children residing and studying in Mongolian schools, there are 100,000 Han, 50,000 Hui, and 7,000 Tibetan, totaling slightly less than 160,000 people. Some say that the Han and Hui together only number 59,000, while the population of the Mongolian and Tibetan has not yet been investigated. The latter statement is an estimate by the Department of Civil Affairs and seems more accurate. In recent years, in Xining, Ma Chairman’s son Xiang has been working hard to maintain the principle of equality among all ethnic groups, and they can still coexist harmoniously. However, the Hui strictly adhere to religious laws, and their way of life is different from the Han. They also rely on their superior military strength to enjoy preferential treatment everywhere. Whether in Xining or Qinghai as a whole, the Han are in a disadvantaged position. As for the Mongolian and Tibetan, although they still lead a nomadic life, moving with water and grass, the Mongolian are shrinking everywhere. All their language, writing, and living habits have been assimilated by the Tibetan. The martial and courageous heredity of their ancestors has disappeared without a trace. The Tibetan rely on the deep influence of the Yellow Sect on the hearts of the Mongolian and Tibetan, and their strong and robust character. However, because of the excessive freedom in male-female relations, many suffer from venereal diseases, and the reproductive capacity of the population has been reduced to the extreme. As for the Tu people, they only remain in Minhe and other counties. It is not easy to see them elsewhere. Their race is not far from extinction. In the future, the rise and fall of the Han and Hui will depend on the Han's self-awareness, strict prohibition of opium and foot binding, and replenishment of vitality, and the Hui's absorption of new culture and sincere cooperation with the Han, so as to avoid the intrusion of foreign races.

Xining has achieved fairness and universality in civic training. Fairness means that no one, regardless of occupation, between the ages of eight and fifty, can avoid training for any reason. Universality means that all townships and villages must follow the rules, and no one can request a delay due to special reasons. In Xining, strong men not only have to do morning exercises every day, but also have to participate in road construction and tree planting. It is also their duty to repair the built roads from time to time and water the planted trees every day. In addition, there is a kind of corvée system, which is to conscript workers with various skills to serve the government and the army without pay. For example, the uniforms of the army are sewn by tailors in various districts, who are only given cloth but not wages. For example, when the government builds civil works, local masons and carpenters also have the obligation to serve the government without remuneration. Therefore, the Qinghai Provincial Government not only provides civic training for strong men, but also implements a labor service policy. As a result, considerable achievements have been made in afforestation and road construction, two of the six major central tasks. The Baojia system in the outer counties of Xining is also well organized. There are no bandits in the entire province. People entering the province from other provinces and people leaving the province are registered. Even petty thieves have disappeared in the city, which is also the result of the Baojia system.

The salaries of civil servants in Xining are very low. The heads of departments only receive a maintenance fee of 80 yuan. Now, this has to be discounted by 27%, leaving only 39.2 yuan in real terms. The salaries of section chiefs and department heads are even lower, which goes without saying. However, Chairman Ma has other ways to supplement their livelihoods, such as providing essential living supplies and transferring them to be county magistrates or tax bureau chiefs in other counties. However, instead of thinking about increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, he only pays some maintenance fees and thinks of some superficial remedies. As a result, it is inevitable that some people will appear to be clean on the surface but are determined to seize opportunities to make a big profit. Civil servants in Xining wear blue cloth uniforms. Only Chairman Ma has a special covered car when he goes out. The heads of other departments and committee members mostly have a mule cart for transportation. Most people rely on their own two feet. The prices of goods in Xining are not only cheaper than Lanzhou for local products such as wheat, but also lower for general domestic and foreign goods. This is probably because there are no unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market, so it does not affect the lives of civil servants.

There are two things that exist elsewhere but not in Xining. The first is electric lights, and the second is rickshaws. It is said that the Lanzhou Electric Light Factory has been contacted. Once their new machines are installed, the old machines can be transported and installed in the Xining Electric Light Factory. When we come again in the second half of next year, there should be electric lights available. It is not known why rickshaws have not yet been imitated. Perhaps Qinghai is a place that produces livestock. Every household has its own livestock that can be used to drive carts or ride on, so there is no need for rickshaws. There is also one thing worth writing about in Qinghai Province. Since the early years of the Republic of China, when Chairman Ma's late father, Ma Gong Yuanzhen, was the garrison commissioner, the planting of opium has been banned. Since then, it has been strictly prohibited. Although the financial situation is difficult, the ban will never be lifted. This is the best among the provinces in the Northwest. Currently, opium addicts are limited to the Han and some Mongolian who specialize in learning the bad habits of the Han. We hope that the provincial government will implement a ban on trafficking and smoking, which will benefit the Han and Mongolian compatriots.

The level of education and culture in Xining is certainly not comparable to that of the Southeast and Southwest. However, school education is quite developed. The central government has established the Central Political School, the Xining Mongolian and Tibetan Branch School, and the Sichuan High School founded with British Boxer Indemnity funds. The provincial government has established the Mongolian and Tibetan Normal School, the Simple Normal School, the Junior High School, the Women's Normal School, and the Vocational School. The Islamic Promotion Association has established Islamic primary and secondary schools. Every village has primary schools, totaling more than eighty. We visited the Islamic Middle School. Chairman Ma himself serves as the principal, with a vice principal and a dean of academic affairs. The school buildings were built by the engineering corps. All the students in the school are militarized. The student soldiers guarding the school gate are all armed with live ammunition. It is said that most of them go on to apply for the Central Military Academy. The school can be regarded as a military preparatory school for Qinghai. In addition to the courses stipulated by the Ministry of Education, primary school students are taught Arabic for four to five hours a week, and secondary school students are taught Arabic for two hours a week. Other subjects include military science and military service, which are not usually found in ordinary primary and secondary schools. There is only one newspaper in Xining, the Minguo Daily, and its news is not up-to-date and the printing is poor. It is said that it is sponsored by the Party Department and lacks spirit. In addition, there is the Qinghai Youth, published by the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Star-Moon Weekly, published by the Islamic Promotion Association, and the Education Newsletter, published by the Education Section of the Xining County Government. These are the only publications in Xining.

Chairman Ma concurrently serves as the commander of the Eighty-second Army, the chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Party Department, and the chairman of the Islamic Promotion Association. The provincial government also handles the purchase of wool and other items in Qinghai for the Ministry of Finance's Trade Committee, with Chairman Ma personally presiding over it. It can be said that he is the leader of the Party, education (religion and education), military, government, and business in the entire province of Qinghai. Therefore, he gets up early in the morning and works tirelessly all day long, without a moment of rest. We are quite concerned about his health. It is said that Chairman Ma is only thirty-six years old and has achieved great success in managing the army. Since he took office as the provincial chairman, he has made many improvements to the provincial administration. Because he has lived in Qinghai for generations, many of his relatives, clansmen, party members, and colleagues reside in various counties. Therefore, if a county magistrate takes actions that disregard the people's feelings, he can go to see him face to face. As a result, every county magistrate is in a state of self-preservation. We hope that Chairman Ma will investigate this matter clearly and not make decisions based on one-sided statements. Chairman Ma is extremely obedient to the central government, especially protective of Chairman Chiang, and can treat all ethnic groups equally and live in peace. We sincerely hope that he can become a politician like General Bai Jiansheng, who is also a Muslim military man.

Qinghai's products are mainly minerals, grains, furs, and medicinal materials. According to a survey by the Department of Finance, it can produce 4,000 taels of gold ore, 18 million catties of coal, 400,000 shi of grain, 6 million catties of wool, 150,000 lambskins, 3,000 fox skins, 500 sable skins, 50,000 tiger skins, 800 wolf skins, 100,000 catties of rhubarb, 2,000 catties of licorice, 700 catties of deer antler, and 300 taels of musk every year. Qing salt is directly managed by the central government, and the provincial government has no way of knowing about it. Qinghai has so many products. If it can improve animal husbandry, develop agriculture, and exploit various mineral deposits, not only will Qinghai not have to worry about poverty, but the future of the war of resistance and nation-building will also depend heavily on the active development of Qinghai.

In today's China, the four northeastern provinces have long been occupied by Japanese forces. The provincial capitals and important cities of the southeastern provinces have also fallen one after another. Although the southwestern provinces are still in our hands, they have long been surrounded by international capitalism. Although various countries sympathize with our war of resistance, since we have to ask for help from others in everything, we have to rely on others everywhere. Only the few northwestern provinces can use their own strength as a rear support for the war of resistance and nation-building. Moreover, with the external independence of Outer Mongolia and the nominal unity of Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Gansu are already facing the front line and cannot be developed at ease. Only Qinghai has a piece of pure land to save the fate of the country from decay. In addition, since the start of the war of resistance, the national territory has shrunk day by day, and the people in the occupied areas have been displaced. If the central government and the Qinghai authorities can cooperate thoroughly to transplant the people in the Southeast to Qinghai and other places, and carry out planned economic construction, then there would be nothing better for the benefit of the country and the people.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Unfinished, Aggressor Nations Active; Germany: Seeking to Win Over Various Countries, Demanding Treaties; Japan: Claims to Have Decided on Basic Policy Towards Europe; Pope: Plans to Organize Anti-Communist Front in Europe and America

Hitler Makes Threatening Speech

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Hitler gave a speech today in Cassel to 300,000 veterans. German army and navy leaders, senior military officers from Italy, Spain, Finland, Hungary and the Japanese ambassador to Germany attended. He stated, "I have taken steps to ensure that all important positions are filled by military personnel. If I find any exceptions, I will immediately remove them." Hitler mentioned the major changes in Germany after the war, saying, "These changes are more permanent than all other changes. The Treaty of Versailles has shown that the purpose of the Allied powers in the war was to plunder our colonies, destroy our fleet, and destroy our commerce. It is the same as the policy of encirclement planned by today's politicians. However, we are no longer belittling ourselves. We are determined to maintain our rights, and external intimidation is not enough to frighten us." He mentioned war guilt, saying, "Germany has never had any ambitions of power. However, the Treaty of Versailles has shown that other countries do have ambitions to plunder our colonies, deplete our fleet, and destroy our industry. These were the ambitions of Britain in those days, and they have not changed to this day. Germany's guilt was only due to negligence in military preparations before the war. If today's encirclement policy is the same as the one before the last war, then Germany's situation today is very different, that is, its defense policy has changed. Another difference is that the person who leads the country is no longer a civilian wearing a military uniform, but a pure soldier. I have taken steps to ensure that all important positions are filled by military personnel. If I find any exceptions, I will immediately remove them. I firmly believe that the policy of strengthening national defense will be supported by the people of the whole country, and it is certain that the people of the whole country must receive military training. Germany's leaders are as brave as the German people, and as pure soldiers, they will obey orders as soon as they receive them, even if it means being crushed to pieces."

Germany Hunts Small Countries Everywhere

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th] On April 28th, the German government simultaneously announced the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. At that time, all newspapers ridiculed the negotiations between Britain, Turkey, and the Soviet Union as "treaty disease." Now, Germany itself seems to be infected with this disease. In March, the country signed an agreement with Lithuania to recover the Memel region and agreed not to use force against each other. Since then, it has wanted to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Baltic states and the Scandinavian peninsula. Among them, only the negotiations with Denmark have been completed. The negotiations with Estonia and Latvia were supposed to be concluded half a month ago. These countries are now wary of the Soviet Union's attitude. As for Yugoslavia, Prince Paul is currently visiting here. People around him say that Yugoslavia will not sign any treaties with Germany, has no intention of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, and does not want to conclude an agreement with Germany to avoid hindering Yugoslavia's friendship with Romania. According to informed sources here, Germany is actively engaged in diplomatic activities with Spain. Germany has stated that if Britain and the Soviet Union form an agreement, the Axis powers of Germany and Italy will definitely respond. Regarding this, political figures believe that it is not enough to strengthen ties with Japan alone. It is best to win over Spain to join the German-Italian military alliance agreement.

Japan Decides on Basic Policy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Tokyo electric dispatch: Japan's basic policy in the midst of the new European situation has been passed by the Five Ministers Conference this morning. Prime Minister Hiranuma will enter the Imperial Palace in the afternoon to meet the Emperor and report everything. Hiranuma originally took a weekend vacation at the Noma Villa. He returned here today and immediately summoned the Ministers of the Army and Navy to continue the talks from last Saturday and hold consultations on Japan's basic policy. After the three decided on this, the Prime Minister separately summoned the Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Ishiwatari to discuss Japan's basic policy in the midst of the new European situation. A final decision was reached on this, and Hiranuma will report everything to the Imperial Palace this afternoon. Also, Konoe visited Elder Saionji at his villa this morning to report on the Japanese domestic and foreign situation over the past twelve months and Japan's policy in the new European situation. The two also exchanged opinions freely on the latter item.

Pope Makes Suggestions to Four Powers

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to this morning's newspapers, the Pope is now sending new telegrams to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. "Every Day Ahead Report" and "Every Day Mail Report" both claim that this telegram is related to the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, because the Vatican fears that Bolshevism will invade Europe. "News Chronicle Report" claims that the Pope's telegrams are being sent to many countries, including the United States, Belgium, and South American countries. It is understood that the Pope has not abandoned his previous intention, that is, to urge all countries, especially Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to resolve all disputes.

[Associated Press, Vatican, 5th] According to authoritative sources, the Pope has sent a new instruction to the Vatican representatives stationed in Rome, Berlin, Paris, London, and Warsaw, urging them to convene an international conference to discuss outstanding international issues. The Pope specifically pointed out the necessity of a five-nation conference to resolve Germany's demands for the Polish Corridor and Danzig, as well as Italy's demands for Suez, Gibraltar, and Tunisia.

Germany Makes Demands on the South Again

[Central News Agency, Cologne, Germany, 4th] German and Yugoslav representatives are conducting economic negotiations here. Germany has made five demands, including: (1) The exchange rate of the Yugoslavian currency, the dinar, to the mark should be increased; (2) Germany should have priority in purchasing various raw materials produced in Yugoslavia. This priority is currently enjoyed by countries that implement free exchange methods; (3) Reorganize the Yugoslavian economy to produce items that Germany lacks, such as vegetable oil, minerals, and oilseeds; (4) The economic agreement established between Germany and Yugoslavia should be extended to the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia; (5) The debts owed to Germany by the former Serbia and Bosnia provinces (formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now Yugoslavian provinces) should be paid off immediately. According to general opinion, if Yugoslavia accepts these demands, it would be tantamount to allowing Germany to control its economy.

### Britain Studies Soviet Reply, Plans to Cater to Soviet Conditions; French Premier Speaks Out Against Violence

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Regarding the Anglo-French proposal for a trilateral anti-aggression agreement, the Soviet government's reply has not yet been released. Responsible government officials are now carefully studying it. It is understood that the second step is to find an appropriate way to cater to the conditions proposed by the Soviet side, that is, the guarantee system should be extended to the Baltic states. The remaining points involved in the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov should not cause any difficulties. It is no longer a problem that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will be able to conclude a purely defensive mutual assistance treaty. As for how to provide effective assistance to countries outside of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union if they are subjected to aggression, the form and extent of the problem can be resolved satisfactorily, which is generally believed.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] The Radical Socialist Party is one of the major political parties in the French parliament. Its executive committee held a meeting here today, and Premier Daladier delivered a speech to the members. The meeting immediately passed a resolution, expressing unanimous support for the French government's domestic and foreign policies, and firmly believing that the government will be able to take all necessary measures for the country's future. Daladier said that recently, international negotiations must be concluded quickly and smoothly. We have facts to prove that we have this hope. The future of Europe has only two paths to follow: either mutual cooperation or listening to control. The French government has done everything possible to make Europe live happily in a state of free cooperation. At the same time, I must respectfully tell the world that France must do everything possible to prevent Europe from being involved in an unprecedented catastrophe due to some parties' attempts to monopolize it. If anyone tries to subvert the balance and peace of Europe in any way, we will resolutely resist this adventurous move. On the one hand, we block the path of aggressors, and on the other hand, we extend our hand to welcome all those who hope for free cooperation. Therefore, judging from our actions and the spirit of cooperation, we can see that we are indeed defenders of freedom. We now shout "opposition" to the violent and crazy thugs and violent people of the aggressors, and we shout "welcome" to all those who are committed to sincere cooperation, economic revival, and the fair distribution of raw materials.

### U.S. General Election Next Year, Roosevelt's Participation Undecided

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] The U.S. general election is scheduled to be held in November of next year. From next month, it will be the preliminary stage of the general election. At that time, the Democratic and Republican parties will each elect representatives to the national convention, and the candidates participating in the general election will be nominated by the respective conventions. In this general election, it is still unclear which candidates from the Democratic and Republican parties have hope. Taking the Democratic Party as an example, President Roosevelt has not yet indicated whether he will participate in the election for a third term. According to U.S. practice, a president can only be re-elected once after being elected. Even with the great virtues and fame of Presidents Washington and Jefferson, they were not re-elected for a second term. Now President Roosevelt's political opponents are using this as an excuse to oppose President Roosevelt's third election and say that the abuses will lead to the formation of "personal authority," which is inappropriate. People in the government faction say that President Roosevelt is the founder of the "New Deal" and that only he can continue to promote it.

### Japan's Intentions in Attacking Britain and the Soviet Union

Japan's most obvious diplomatic posture recently has been to simultaneously threaten and pressure Britain and the Soviet Union. Japan's anti-British movement has been underway for a long time, but its offensive against the Soviet Union, since the Changkufeng Incident, is the most active this time. This implies a profound meaning: although the actions of attacking and threatening Britain and the Soviet Union are the same, their purposes and attitudes are completely different.

Our observation of Japan's attacks on Britain and the Soviet Union is: threatening Britain is the main goal, while attacking the Soviet Union is only a side effect; the purpose that Japan wants to achieve lies with Britain, not with the Soviet Union. For months, Japan's intimidation and pressure on Britain have been primarily aimed at threatening Britain to step forward, intercede for it, mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, in order to save its increasingly mired feet. Some commentators believe that Japan has been greatly disappointed after the meeting of the two British ambassadors in Shanghai and has given up the dream of asking Britain for help; moreover, the recent reckless actions of the Japanese army in China against Britain have further emphasized that the era of Japan's dependence on Britain has passed. However, this view is somewhat too mechanical. The domestic and international situation of the Japanese aggressors is deteriorating day by day, and the Sino-Japanese War cannot be ended through direct negotiations as they had hoped. The relatively quickest path for them is still to ask a third country to step forward and mediate. Currently, the faction of elder statesmen and senior officials in Japan is strongly advocating this approach. Today, with the military aggression against China stagnating, the proposition of the elder statesmen and senior officials naturally holds sway. Although the young officers also want to break this deadlock by force, repeated attempts have only proven that truly offending Britain, the United States, and France is ultimately not a viable solution. Therefore, the true intention of pressuring Britain is only a form of "first the stick, then the carrot" threat, not a genuine declaration of war. Japan's genuine confrontation with Britain is still pending.

Japan's purpose in making a show of force against the Soviet Union and expanding propaganda is also to assist its diplomatic policy towards Britain. Japan has always consistently sought to win the favor and trust of Britain, the United States, and France by acting as the anti-communist policeman of the East for capitalist countries. Japan has consistently used the signboard of the Anti-Comintern Pact to maintain its relationship with Britain, the United States, and France. However, in fact, the core of the German-Italian-Japanese aggressors is pushing Britain, the United States, and France to approach and cooperate with the Soviet Union, and even form an alliance. Britain, the Soviet Union, and France have recently reached the point of signing a mutual assistance agreement, which, in other words, means that Japan's utilization of the Anti-Comintern Pact has gradually reached saturation, and Japan's greatest international deception will completely lose its effectiveness. Therefore, Japan is greatly panicked. Before the draft of the Anglo-Soviet-French mutual assistance agreement is negotiated and the Three-Power Pact is signed, it is desperately trying to maximize the role of the Anti-Comintern Pact. More precisely, Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is just begging Britain: "Britain, my old ally, I am faithfully acting as your policeman, please don't doubt me, and don't abandon me!" Therefore, the recent conflicts on the Mongolian-Manchurian border are all staged by Japan. At the same time, Japan is also trying to pour cold water on Britain, making it hesitate about the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance. Therefore, no matter how much it suffers in attacking Mongolia and the Soviet Union, it still proclaims its own victory and how bad the Soviet Union's planes are. This is truly the most authentic Ah Q, plus an oriental flavor.

Japan is still quite far from the time when it will resolutely go to war with the Soviet Union. It knows very well that the strong power in the north is not to be trifled with, and it also knows deeply that the war of aggression against China has fallen into an irreparable situation, and it cannot have another strong enemy. It is just using it to deceive foreigners and deceive itself. Japan's recent special flattery of Italy is also intended to obstruct Britain, the United States, and France from approaching the Soviet Union, which is also a demonstration to Britain. It is faintly heard that Japan's consultations with Britain and the United States in Shanghai are taking a very subtle approach, first conducting individual negotiations and then discussing together. Japan has many tricks and conspiracies, but its narrow mind has only one goal. Today, when the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China are under the greatest threat, it is our sincere hope that Britain will give more consideration, make a firm decision, and take a straight course, ××××××××××××××!

### British Air Force Strength Soars; Possesses Large Number of Latest Aircraft; Sufficient to Defend Major Cities

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The increase in the number of aircraft manufactured in Britain is approaching a rate of one thousand per day, to the point where storing the completed aircraft has become a problem. At present, the Air Force already possesses a large number of the latest aircraft, with ample reserves to undertake its duties. According to experts, the strength of the British Air Force was quite weak last September. This has now completely changed. If aggressor countries send aircraft to bomb major British cities, 80 percent of them will be shot down, and only 20 percent will be able to fly back to their own country. This is due to two reasons: (1) The quality of British-made new fighter planes is excellent, and their speed is far superior to that of fighter planes from other countries; (2) Britain has manufactured a large number of anti-aircraft guns, capable of defending London. It is expected that the density of their firepower will be sufficient to make it impossible for enemy aircraft to approach. The same protection can be obtained in other major cities within a short period of time. Military authorities are currently drafting plans to station a large number of new aircraft at key strategic points throughout the Empire, to ensure that they can effectively dominate the skies. In addition, the metal used in the manufacture of British aircraft is of extremely high quality, and the durability of the aircraft is five to six times greater than that of German and Italian products. This is another reason why the British Air Force possesses a superior advantage.

The King telegraphed Navy Minister Stanhope, saying, "The Queen and I are deeply saddened by the news of the 'Thetis' submarine disaster. Please convey our deepest condolences to the families of all those who died on board." The Queen also sent a separate telegram of condolence. When the House of Commons meets tomorrow, Navy Undersecretary Shakespeare will report to the entire House on the "Thetis" disaster. Liverpool Recounts,

Liverpool Recounts Perilous Work

[Reuters, London, 5th] Divers landed in Liverpool today on the destroyer "Winchelsea" to recount the perilous work of rescuing the crew of the submarine "Thetis" and the various difficulties encountered. Diver Taylor told a "News Chronicle" reporter, "My colleague Mackenzie dived to the seabed at 11:55 p.m. last Saturday. The rapid currents made the work extremely difficult. When he touched a metal object, he knew it was the sunken submarine, but the strong currents still posed a danger. He then used a hammer to knock on the submarine four or five times, and there was a faint response from inside the submarine. Mackenzie was exhausted when he surfaced. Another diver, Thompson, and I dived down at 6 a.m. The water was very clear at the time, but the conditions underwater were very poor. We were forced to surface after only a dozen minutes underwater. We also knocked on the submarine while underwater, but there was no response. At that time, we had to wait for the tide to recede before we could continue working."

Naval Undersecretary Issues Statement [Reuters, London, 5th] Naval Undersecretary Shakespeare told a "Daily Mail" reporter today, "I will submit a detailed report to the House of Commons on the tragic disaster of the submarine "Thetis." This report will be as complete as possible. You can be sure that this matter will be thoroughly investigated by the government and made public so that the public can know the truth and there will be no concealment."

### Gunfight Between Police Detectives and Robbers in Des Voeux Road Central Yesterday Afternoon; Four Robbers Intercept Detectives and Exchange Gunfire; Four Bystanders Injured; One Detective and One Robber Killed; Chinese Detective Tam Chung Bravely Captures Two Robbers Single-Handedly

The unrest in the local area and the rampant activities of robbers are unparalleled today. Whether on land or sea, cases of armed robbery occur almost every day. Moreover, these people carry sharp firearms, as fierce as wolves and tigers. If the victims resist in the slightest, they are often subjected to cruel treatment. Although police detectives work hard to arrest them, the robbers are not afraid of the law and are becoming increasingly fierce. At around 11 a.m. yesterday, in the most prosperous area of Central, at the intersection of Li Yuen Street East and Des Voeux Road Central, a major gunfight broke out between police detectives and robbers, resulting in a total of seven people injured or killed, including police detectives, robbers, and passersby. The severity of the incident is rare in Hong Kong in recent years. The case was triggered by four robbers intercepting a passerby. They were discovered and arrested by police detectives. Three robbers fired guns to resist, leading to a fierce battle. As a result, one robber was shot dead and one was captured. One robber escaped. A Chinese detective was shot and injured by the robbers. During the incident, stray bullets flew everywhere, and four passersby were injured in the chaos. Due to the seriousness of the case, it caused a sensation throughout Hong Kong after it occurred. Superintendents, deputy superintendents, Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:

Bank Withdrawal; Robbers Covetous; The case originated when Cheung Tak-chi, a 30-year-old employee of Chung Tak Pharmacy on Wing Lok Street in Hong Kong, went to the Overseas Chinese Bank at 13 Queen's Road Central at around 11 a.m. yesterday to collect a sum of money on a check. He received 500 dollars and kept it on his person. He then returned to the store along Des Voeux Road Central. It is not known how four robbers discovered this. When Cheung left the bank, they secretly followed him. Although Cheung was carrying a large sum of money, he did not realize that he was being secretly followed by robbers, so he did not take it to heart. He walked west along Des Voeux Road Central. Because there were many pedestrians along the way, the robbers followed him but did not dare to take action. When he reached Queen's Road, near the intersection of Li Yuen Street East, near the front of the Chinese Department Store, the robbers began to act. One of them walked past Cheung's face, and two robbers responded behind Cheung. Because Cheung did not notice anything unusual along the way, he did not know that three robbers were about to rob him.

Armed Robbery; Police Detectives Pursue; At that time, the robber in front took out a packet of pepper powder from his pocket and sprinkled it into Cheung's eyes while he was unprepared. Cheung was blinded and knew that it was a robbery, so he shouted "Robbery!" The other two robbers pointed guns at Cheung, prohibiting him from making any noise, while searching Cheung's pockets. Although Cheung could not open his eyes, he still struggled desperately, trying his best to protect the pocket containing the money and continuing to shout. At that time, Chinese detectives Yin Man, number 612, and Tam Chung, number 623, were patrolling the area. Seeing the situation, they stepped forward to arrest the robbers. The robbers knew that their actions had been exposed, so they abandoned the robbery. One of the robbers raised his gun to resist and fled towards Li Yuen Street East. Seeing that the robbers were fierce, Yin and Tam also drew their guns and gave chase, pursuing them along Li Yuen Street East. The three robbers were about two lengths ahead of the two detectives.

Firing Guns to Resist Arrest; Fierce Gunfight Breaks Out; When the two detectives chased to the front of number 28 Li Yuen Street East, the three robbers turned around and fired guns, intending to resist. Seeing that the robbers were fierce, the two detectives also returned fire, shooting at the robbers. Gunshots rang out, and a fierce battle broke out. The four robbers retreated while fighting, and the two detectives chased relentlessly. In the melee, Detective Yin was shot in the abdomen and fell to the ground. The three robbers then tried to take this opportunity to escape, running madly towards Des Voeux Road. Tam Chung pursued closely, and the three robbers ran and fired guns at Tam Chung. Tam Chung bravely pursued. Gunshots rang out like firecrackers. One of the robbers was shot by Tam Chung and fell to the ground near Pottinger Street. One robber escaped in the chaos. The remaining robber ran to the arcade in front of the Malayan Restaurant and Wang Hing Photographic Equipment Company on Des Voeux Road and had no way to escape. He tried to pull out a pistol from his pocket to resist arrest. At that time, Tam Chung's pistol bullets had been used up. Because the situation was critical, he did not have time to add bullets, so he lunged forward with his bare hands and captured the robber. Although the robber did not have time to draw his gun, he still struggled desperately. Tam Chung then struck the robber hard on the head with the butt of his pistol, injuring the robber's head, and then captured him.

Stray Bullets Flying; Bystanders Injured; As a result of the battle between the police detectives and the three robbers, in addition to Detective Yin Man and two robbers being injured, four other bystanders were also injured. One was Ho Ki-sai, a 31-year-old resident of the third floor of number 4 Li Yuen Street East. He was sitting on the side of the staircase when he heard gunshots. He was unable to avoid them and was shot in the foot, bleeding profusely. Another was Kwan Lam, 27 years old, residing on the third floor of a building in San Ka Li, Central. Another was Tam Leung, 18 years old. Both of them were selling fruit at the intersection of Li Yuen Street and Des Voeux Road. Their hands and feet were each shot. Another was Law Kai, 35 years old, a servant for a doctor on the upper floor of the nearby Aikun Building. He was developing photos in the Wang Hing Photographic Equipment Company on Li Yuen Street when two gunshots suddenly rang out. His left hand was shot, and another bullet pierced a hole in the glass mirror of the Wang Hing's display case. After the incident, Chinese and Western Indian police officers stationed nearby arrived at the scene, helped Tam Chung guard the two injured robbers, reported the case to the Central Police Station, and summoned ambulances to take the injured to the hospital for treatment. The robber who was shot died en route. The robber whose head was struck was first taken back to the station.

Chinese and Western Police Mobilize to Search; After receiving the report, the police station dispatched a riot car carrying a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. Police Commissioner Pilditch, believing that the case was serious, personally went to the scene with Deputy Police Commissioner Shuffton, Chief Detective Inspector Maffey, and the duty inspectors to investigate. After the police detectives arrived, believing that there was still one robber on the run, they blockaded Li Yuen Street and surrounded the area near Pottinger Street and Des Voeux Road, conducting a large-scale search. Indian constables were sent to each floor of Li Yuen Street to search one by one, and shopkeepers and employees of all the shops on the street were asked about what they had seen at the time. The scene of the incident was photographed and filed for investigation. After a search lasting two hours, a suspicious man, about 30 years old, wearing a black silk shirt and pants, with bare feet, was captured on Des Voeux Road. Police detectives took him back to the police station for investigation.

Questioning in the Detective Division; Soon after the incident occurred, it caused a sensation throughout the Central District. Passersby gathered to watch in the area around Des Voeux Road Central, Li Yuen Street, and Pottinger Street. Rumors spread, some saying it was a robbery, others saying it was a murder, but most did not know the details. The police detectives investigated at the scene until 2 p.m. before withdrawing. The detained robber was then questioned by the chief detective inspector in the detective division of the Central Police Station. According to his confession, his name was Lau Man-chu, 31 years old, from Amoy. He had come to Hong Kong from Amoy via Swatow in November of last year. He admitted that he and the robber who was shot dead had committed the robbery. When asked by the police detectives about the name of the deceased, he said that the deceased's name was Lam Ah-fong, age unknown, also from Amoy. The police detectives also found a knife, a pistol, more than 20 bullets, and several cigarettes on his person. The police detectives recorded his confession, first confiscated his weapons, and sent him to the detention center. As for the suspicious man arrested afterwards, he identified himself as Chan Fuk and denied any involvement in the robbery. He was also detained at the station for investigation. At present, the police are strictly investigating the robber who is on the run. As for the injured police detective Yin Man, he was shot in the abdomen and died after being treated by doctors in the hospital. The injuries of the other four passersby were not serious and there should be no major problems. The Chinese detective Tam Chung, who bravely captured the fierce robbers, has been serving in the police force for many years and was only promoted to Chinese detective last year.

Victim Safe; Money Unharmed; The reporter met Cheung Tak-chi, the victim of the robbery, yesterday afternoon. According to him, he has always been responsible for going to the bank to withdraw money. Yesterday afternoon, he was ordered to go to the Overseas Chinese Bank to withdraw 500 dollars. At that time, he noticed a man in a suit staring at him, and he suspected that he was not a good person. Therefore, he was especially careful with the money he withdrew. After leaving the bank, he saw the man following him, so he became even more vigilant. As soon as he turned into Li Yuen Street, the robber took action. One robber hugged him tightly, one grabbed his neck, and one sprinkled pepper powder. Fortunately, he did not open his eyes at the time, otherwise, it would have been even worse. Under these circumstances, he still struggled with the robber and shouted "Robbery!" He also grabbed the robber's shirt with his backhand, tearing it. Later, he heard gunshots and saw someone being shot down. At first, he thought the robber had been shot. The situation afterwards was not very clear. However, the money he was carrying was not lost at all.

Hope for Police Detectives to Conduct Foot Patrols; Recently, robbery and murder cases have continued to occur in Hong Kong and the New Territories. People who are concerned about social security still believe that the police force in the New Territories is too weak. Each police station is far apart, and the police force is insufficient to control the area. In Hong Kong, the police have not implemented foot patrols. If the goal is to eliminate robbery and murder cases, it is necessary to increase the police force in the New Territories and immediately implement foot patrols. If the police budget is insufficient, they should instruct merchants to implement armed self-defense and establish merchant corps-like organizations. It should be noted that the number of residents in Hong Kong is now more than double what it was two years ago, but the number of police detectives has not increased. This is also one of the reasons why robbery and murder cases continue to occur.

### Women's New Life Movement Association Establishes Night School for Refugee Children; Providing Both Care and Education to Complete the Way of Conservation; Active Preparations So That Enrollment Can Begin Soon

Since Mrs. Wu Tieh-cheng took charge of the Hong Kong office of the Guangdong Provincial New Life Movement Promotion Association, she has worked extremely hard for the war effort in the rear areas. Recently, the association, seeing the increasing number of refugee children coming to Hong Kong, many of whom are out of school, and believing that providing care without education is not the way to conserve resources, has convened comrades of the New Life Movement Association to initiate the establishment of a wartime charity night school for refugee children. It plans to temporarily find suitable locations in Hong Kong to establish several night schools, all free of charge, for poor refugee children coming to Hong Kong who have no ability to transfer to or borrow books from other schools, so that they can attend school at night without hindering their work during the day. The night school is named the Hong Kong Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association Charity Night School for Refugee Children. The number of schools, from the first to the nth, will be expanded depending on the amount of funds raised and the number of refugee children enrolled. The curriculum will be based on the regulations for ordinary literacy night schools and adapted to the lives of refugee children. The location and enrollment date will be announced after preparations are complete.

### More than 20,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Japanese Army in Full Retreat for Over 500 Li - Major Victory in Northern Hubei!

— Qi Zhuo

A Conversation with Principal Wang Shutao Upon His Return to Hong Kong from Chongqing

Mr. Wang Shutao, Principal of Huaqiao Middle School and President of Huaqiao College, went to Chongqing on official business in early February and has now safely returned to school. What did Principal Wang bring back? Our reporter visited him yesterday for an interview.

He still wore the same simple Zhongshan suit, the true color of an educator committed to hard work. Though he looked tired after a four-month journey, he seemed more spirited than before. His impressions of the wartime capital could not help but excite him.

Regarding the affairs of Huaqiao College and seeking instructions from the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Principal Wang said the progress was very smooth. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education also had somewhat extreme plans for developing overseas education, which would be implemented in order.

The capital unanimously supports the national policy of resisting the war to the end, and everywhere presents an atmosphere of hard work and optimism. There is no trace of peaceful sentiment. Rumors about detaining certain people are entirely the old tricks of the Japanese to sow discord.

During the large-scale bombing of Chongqing, Principal Wang's residence was also destroyed by Japanese bombs. Fortunately, he took refuge in a shelter and was unharmed. The post-bombing disaster was terrible, but the relief efforts were well-handled, and the sentiment of shared hatred against the Japanese became even more intense.

In addition to general conversation, the reporter originally wanted to obtain some materials from Principal Wang about the central government's policy on overseas Chinese education. However, Principal Wang excitedly reported to the reporter about the victory in Northern Hubei, saying: "This is a greater victory than the Battle of Taierzhuang. It is ironclad proof that the Japanese have no combat capability. However, after the bombing of Chongqing, the newspapers published joint editions, which led to insufficient publicity. The Hong Kong newspapers' reports on this great victory are also very good. I obtained very accurate information in Chongqing and can tell you some of it, hoping that the press will promote it and give the defeatists a head-on blow." As he spoke, he picked up a pencil and sketched the terrain of Northern Hubei on a piece of paper, exhaustively detailing it to the reporter. A "gentle scholar" was surprisingly interested in military affairs like a military expert, and he was very knowledgeable. It would be difficult to speak of it without military knowledge. The reporter was excited and moved. Military affairs first, victory first. The vigilant educator has established this firm belief.

It turns out that this large-scale encirclement of Northern Hubei by the Japanese can be regarded as the third "grand feat" after the "encirclement of Nanjing" and the "encirclement of Xuzhou." The Japanese shamelessly exaggerated it as the "May Offensive," attempting to eliminate 200,000 of our best and most elite troops in Central China. They implemented the "Xiangyang Meicheng Great Advance," creating a situation that would coordinate with the Japanese troops in northern Henan and southern Shanxi to attempt to seize Guanzhong, opening up a roundabout route to the northwest of Hunan Province to coordinate with the large army on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and opening up the "shortcut" of the Yuehan Railway. At the same time, politically, it could both ease the internal anti-war upsurge and frustrate the spirit of our country's insistence on a protracted war, facilitating the traitors to carry out the conspiracy to subjugate the entire China under the guise of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China." However, this conspiracy was finally met with an unprecedented blow under our increasingly courageous spirit.

The heroic command of Commander Li Zongren and the leading of Generals Tang Enbo and Zhang Zizhong not only resulted in the complete failure of the Japanese conspiracy, but also a complete collapse of the entire front line.

In this battle—in late May—more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, and corpses littered the fields. The Japanese had no way to transport their bones back to Japan. This was an unprecedented failure for Japan. The Japanese retreated more than 500 li, and we recovered many famous cities and strongholds. This was also an unprecedented failure for the Japanese. In the past, the Japanese still had the ability to counterattack after retreating, as was the case in the Battle of Taierzhuang. However, after this defeat, they no longer have the ability to counterattack. This is another unprecedented failure for the Japanese. As for the number of Japanese wounded and other losses, they are countless. This unprecedented failure of the Japanese is * * * * * * * *, and it is also a great victory for our second phase of the war of resistance, the prelude to the final victory. Why hasn't this victory, which is greater than the Battle of Taierzhuang, aroused the attention and interest of the vast overseas Chinese community in Hong Kong? The reason is that the Central News Agency in Chongqing was in the process of relocating, and the release of information was somewhat delayed after the bombing, which affected the reports in various newspapers.

--This is an important piece of good news that Principal Wang brought back from Chongqing, and it also adds an example to the editorial of this newspaper on June 1st and the "World Trends in a Week" on June 4th.

### Our Troops in Northern Guangdong Take Advantage of Momentum to Advance Southward; Two-Pronged Assault Captures Victory at Xinjie; Japanese Incursions into Two Dragons on Guangzhou-Huaxian Road Thwarted; Japanese Aircraft Heavily Bomb Huangqi Mountain, Our Troops Suffer No Losses

(North River Express News) The battle situation on the front line in northern Guangdong: small skirmishes have occurred frequently within the week. Japanese troops have been repeatedly probing our positions, but all attempts have been thwarted. Our Zhao and Peng divisions took advantage of the momentum to advance southward. One morning, the Zhao division charged into Xinjie and ambushed the Japanese, killing a considerable number of them. The Japanese, suffering damage, then harassed various villages nearby. The military situation is as follows:

Surprise Attack on Xinjie - Major Victory

South of Xinjie along the Yuehan Railway, Japanese troops have been busy, and transportation continues all day long. The Zhao division of the 12th Army Group, which is responsible for this line, launched a surprise attack on the Japanese at Xinjie one morning. One route bypassed Letong to the south along the railway, attacking the front of the Japanese position. Another route attacked from the side of Huangqi Mountain, engaging the Japanese in the near suburbs northwest of Xinjie. The Japanese bombarded our positions with artillery, but our entire regiment of officers and soldiers were extremely brave, breaking into the Japanese positions, charging in melee combat. The battle became more intense. After holding out for two hours, the Japanese were unable to withstand it and fled back to Xinjie, stubbornly defending the corners. In this battle, nearly a hundred Japanese were killed, and more than twenty guns were seized. Our side suffered no losses.

Japanese Harassment of Two Dragons - Repulsed

On the Guangzhou-Huaxian road, the Japanese at Longkou have recently received reinforcements and frequently launched incursions into our positions. On the 30th, the Japanese at Longkou again sent hundreds of infantry and cavalry, dividing into two routes to launch incursions. One route sneaked to the vicinity of Xiangshan and Jiuchuan Lake east of Pingshan, and the other route increased incursions into Two Dragons on the Guangzhou-Huaxian line, each with about two hundred men. After reaching various places, they thoroughly searched various villages, arresting young men and forcibly injecting villagers with poisonous needles. Our garrison, the Zhao division, upon receiving the report, immediately sent troops to intercept and annihilate them in separate routes. Knowing that we were prepared, the Japanese only put up a brief resistance before fleeing in a panic along the original route. As a result, dozens of Japanese were killed, and a large amount of poison and poisonous liquid were seized. About a hundred villagers were captured by the Japanese.

Bombing of Huangqi Mountain - Minimal Damage

Huangqi Mountain near Xinjie is still being firmly defended by our army and the guerrillas of Wu Guanqi's unit. The Japanese have repeatedly attacked but have been repulsed. Unwilling to give up, on the 2nd, the Japanese sent a reconnaissance plane to scout over Huangqi Mountain, circling for a long time. At about 2 p.m., two Japanese planes returned to the area and continued to drop more than ten bombs on our positions, attempting to wipe out our guerrillas. Fortunately, we were properly dispersed and suffered no damage. Only more than thirty houses in the vicinity were destroyed, and several villagers were killed or injured.

### Japanese Troops Shorten Defense Line on Chantan Road; All Japanese Troops Withdraw East from Guanyao; Small Unit Occupies Suburbs, We Have Not Formally Entered; We Night-Raided Songgang Market and Destroyed Nearby Highways

(West River Express News) On the Chantan Highway along the northwest and west rivers, our troops have had small skirmishes with Japanese troops in the past few days. Japanese military transportation has been busy, and they seem to be planning to attack us. However, our army is cooperating with guerrillas, adopting mobile attacks to harass the Japanese, making them exhausted from running around. Therefore, the Japanese are now shortening their defense line to seek preservation.

Japanese Troops Withdraw from Guanyao

The Japanese troops at Guanyao Market in the Nanhai area, after being attacked by our guerrillas on the evening of the 26th, have been harassing nearby villages in order to eliminate our guerrillas, requesting assistance from the Japanese headquarters in Foshan on the one hand and sending out "mopping-up teams" on the other. On the 27th and 28th, the Japanese used more than ten motorboats, carrying more than a hundred soldiers, to invade the Sanjiang Township in the Sanshui area west of Guanyao. Our guerrilla company led by He of the 10th Regiment immediately took advantage of the terrain to counterattack. The Japanese boats repeatedly attempted to land, but were repulsed by our dense artillery fire. The Japanese retreated to Guanyao. Our Zhao division cooperated with the Guanyao guerrillas led by Tang and counterattacked Guanyao on the 29th. The Japanese relied on superior firepower and stubbornly resisted inside fortifications. Our army bravely charged into the market, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and some retreated to the Jinshan Temple in Masha. On the morning of the 30th, all the Japanese troops in Guanyao Market withdrew eastward, and there were no Japanese troops in the market. However, a small unit still occupies the suburbs. Our army has not formally stationed in order to be careful.

Our Army Raids Songgang Market

In addition, along the Chantan Highway from Fengyong Jinshan Temple to Foshan, Japanese military transportation has been very busy in the past ten days, and Japanese troops have also been frequently mobilized. On the morning of the 30th, more than ten Japanese military trucks, fully loaded with military supplies, were transported from Foshan to Fengyong, and more than two hundred Japanese soldiers were sent to the Jinshan Temple area to reinforce defenses. Our guerrillas, who are active along the line, in order to contain Japanese military transportation, gathered more than a hundred team members on the evening of the 30th and night-raided Songgang Market, with dozens of daredevils charging into the market and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops. The rest carried explosives and destroyed and blew up nearby highways. Hearing the sound of gunfire, the Japanese troops were startled and responded, sending teams to search for us. However, in the dark, the Japanese were unable to use their powerful firepower and only randomly swept at us with machine guns. After holding out until about 3 a.m. the next day (the 31st), our team members triumphantly withdrew after completing their mission. That night, more than ten Japanese sentries were annihilated, and more than twenty feet of nearby highways were dug up and blown up.

Those who violate the order will be arrested and sent to the investigation office for strict punishment in accordance with the law, so as to maintain the tax administration and benefit the War of Resistance. The above-mentioned matters are of great importance to the tax administration and the future of the War of Resistance, and they have a particularly profound impact on the military's reputation. Strict prohibition should be enforced, and those who dare to violate it will be arrested and punished in accordance with the law. All soldiers and civilians are hereby informed. This announcement is made on behalf of Commander Zhang Fakui.

### Hollywood: Twelve Beautiful Female Stars

— Fang Yao

Recently, a magazine very famous in the Far East selected twelve beautiful Hollywood female stars. They are: Deanna Durbin, Shirley Temple, Loretta Young, Olivia de Havilland, Myrna Loy, Ann Sheridan, Jane Froman, Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers, Deanna Durbin, Annabella, and Louise Rainer.

Regarding the qualifications for being selected, it is said that technique and physical beauty each account for half. However, child stars and young actresses generally have a slight advantage.

That magazine provided concise and clear introductions to these twelve selected beautiful stars. I will translate and describe them one by one below:

Deanna Durbin

She is a young and infinitely promising girl. She is eighteen years old this year. She has a clever and melodious singing voice, brown hair with golden highlights, a smile as beautiful as a newly opened rose, and lively, sparkling eyes. She is now the mainstay of New Universal Pictures. Her recent work is (That Certain Age) – the main performers here are the three young ladies from "Three Smart Girls Grow Up."

Shirley Temple

Although she is already an eleven-year-old child, she is even more innocent and lively than before she was eight years old. Last May, she traveled to various places in the eastern United States. President Roosevelt specially summoned her for a chat and praised her. Her first Technicolor film is called "The Little Princess." The plot is very compact and is currently being screened in the United States.

Loretta Young

A twenty-three-year-old beautiful young woman. She is now the mainstay of 20th Century Fox. Her eyes are the most powerful. Many American artists say that Loretta Young's eyes are the most beautiful among female stars. In the past, she had a "trial marriage" with Grand Weathers, the son of a wealthy businessman in New York. Later, due to disagreements, they broke up. Last year, she also had a passionate affair with Tyrone Power, which also ended without results. Now, Tyrone Power has married Annabella. Loretta Young, having experienced these two setbacks, has vowed not to fall in love and to devote herself to her film career.

Olivia de Havilland

She is twenty-four years old this year, weighs one hundred and five pounds, and has charming brown eyes. On set, she is nicknamed "Squirrel." She was promoted by the great European director Max Reinhardt. She is the mainstay of Warner Bros. Her famous works include "The Life of Emile Zola," "Anthony Adverse," "The Great Garrick," and "The Adventures of Robin Hood."

Myrna Loy

A thirty-four-year-old "virtuous wife," a typical actress. Her husband is the famous director Arthur Hornblow Jr. She originally studied sculpture. Her entry into the film industry was quite accidental. It is said that once, "The Great Lover of the Screen" Rudolph Valentino met her in Hollywood. Because he found her very feminine, he asked her to make a film. For fun, she agreed, intending to give it a try. Unexpectedly, this trial led to fame.

Deanna Durbin

Among American French film stars, the most popular male actor is Charles Boyer, and the most popular female star is her. She is French, born in Paris, and is twenty-one years old this year. Her debut in the French film industry was "Every Day's a Holiday," followed by "Mademoiselle Marie," both of which were very successful. Later, she was recruited by New Universal Pictures with a large sum of money to film "That Certain Age," which made her famous.

Annabella

Also a French actress. The greatest magic she gives the audience is a pair of eyes and dimples on her cheeks. She came from a dance troupe. She is physically fit. Initially, Paramount scouts saw her superb dancing skills in a "French Ballroom" in New York and signed a dance contract with her. Later, because they discovered her acting talent, they sent her to a drama school for training. After completing her training, she co-starred with Henry Fonda in "Wings of the Morning," and she immediately became famous.

Bette Davis

She and Olivia de Havilland are both mainstays of Warner Bros. She has a certain status in the American film industry. In every film, she always plays a strong-willed woman. In the past, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the film "Dangerous." This year, she also received an award.

Ginger Rogers

She is an absolutely romantic woman. Even in winter, she likes to expose her fair legs for everyone to admire. She has had many lovers. Lew Ayres, George Brent, James Stewart, etc., have all dated her and have all broken up with her. Recently, she has taken a fancy to Howard Hughes, a pilot who holds the world record for the longest flight distance. Rumor has it that their love affair is quite passionate, and the engagement procedures are underway. She is famous for co-starring in musicals with Fred Astaire.

Ann Sheridan

Foreign film fans generally call her a "standard beauty" because when she smiles, she has a special kind of pleasant emotion. Her most beautiful part is a well-defined nose. This girl is twenty-one years old this year and has starred in "Black Legion." Recently, she also starred in "Stella Dallas."

Jane Froman

She is the mainstay of Columbia Pictures. She has a naturally beautiful voice, and her singing is clear and melodious. Last year, she co-starred with Laird Cregar, Edward Arnold, and James Stewart in "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," making a big splash. This film has now been selected as the champion of the top ten films of 1938. She is past her prime, but her charm remains, especially in the moment of her charming eyes.

Louise Rainer

Her famous work is "The Great Ziegfeld." Last year, she received the Academy Award for Best Actress of 1937 for "The Good Earth." She has two lovely dimples on her face, which have the magic of holding the audience's attention. She was married to the American writer Clifford Odets. Due to emotional discord, they divorced last year. MGM attaches great importance to her and has signed a six-year long-term contract with her.

Hollywood Good News

1939 is the year of Hollywood star marriages. The biggest stars, such as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Tyrone Power and Annabella, Loretta Young and Blanche Sweet, have all married this year.

News has come that there are three more Hollywood star couples preparing to marry.

The first couple is Merle Oberon and Alexander Korda. They are both British, and Alexander Korda is one of the three giants of the British film industry. Previously, Merle Oberon had a passionate affair with David Niven, but unexpectedly, she is now marrying Korda. No one would have thought of this.

The second couple is Janet Gaynor and Adrian. Counting it up, Adrian should be Janet Gaynor's tenth lover. Now, they have discovered that there are no obstacles to their marriage, so Janet only wants to marry Adrian and live a comfortable life. Adrian's house, a mansion with eighteen rooms, is already being decorated.

The third couple is Hedy Lamarr and Gene Markey. Since Gene Markey divorced Hollywood's first beauty, Joan Bennett, he met Hedy Lamarr through Mona Maris's introduction. Soon, they fell in love. Hedy, because Gene Markey liked Joan Bennett's dark and beautiful hair, started wearing wigs and often asked others: "Do you think my hair is like Joan Bennett's?" Now, according to their good friends, they are preparing to marry soon.

### Chinese Swimming Pool Added Exercise Equipment

The Chinese Swimming Club has always strived for perfection in the facilities of the venue. This year, in view of the increasing number of members bringing young children to the venue, in order to increase the interest of the children, a playground has been specially set up on the east side of the venue, with two swings, one slide, and double bars and inverted rings for adult members to have the opportunity to exercise. The playground was opened yesterday. The club also offers various swimming training classes, hiring famous swimmers as coaches, including beginner freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, water polo, lifesaving, diving, and sampan classes. All members can participate for free.

### Group B Basketball: Lihang and Pui Ying Both Win

Three Group B basketball matches were held last night. In the first match, Lihang played against Chunfeng. Chunfeng forfeited due to insufficient players. Lihang got two points for nothing. In the second match, International played against Guangzhong. As a result, International won 39-29. In the final match, Pui Ying played against Wah Hung. In the first half, Pui Ying took the lead and won repeatedly, with a higher score than Wah Hung. Although Wah Hung tried to catch up in the second half, they lost too much in the first half and could not catch up, losing to Pui Ying with a score of 24-30.

### Strongman Tam Man Piu Arrives in Hong Kong

Strongman Tam Man Piu arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday. According to him, after Guangzhou fell, he joined the Taxation Police Corps of the Ministry of Finance as a technical instructor. Recently, because the training period of the corps has expired, he came to Hong Kong. During his stay in Hong Kong, he hopes to train a group of young people with fitness skills and welcomes participation in various fundraising rallies to serve the country's war of resistance.

### Inter-School Volleyball: Senior Pui Ying Defeats Hanzhong Courageously. Three More Matches Today.

Three inter-school volleyball matches were held yesterday, including senior, junior, and children's grades. In the senior Pui Ying vs. Hanzhong match, Pui Ying coordinated well, and Hanzhong's defense was weak, so it was repeatedly broken by Pui Ying.

After the start of the match, Pui Ying gave Hanzhong a surprise attack. Li Bingze, Liang Jinwu, Ma Quandong, and others successively spiked, doing well. Li Yufen, Lin Guangju, Guan Xi Shi, Yang Zhen of Hanzhong also returned the fire, taking the opportunity to split and kill. However, the entire army of Pui Ying cooperated consistently, and the attack could not be stopped, so Hanzhong lost the first game with a score of 14-21.

Taking advantage of the victory, Pui Ying frequently attacked Hanzhong. Hanzhong finally failed to defend firmly, and Pui Ying occupied the second game with a score of 21-11. After that, Hanzhong tried to counterattack, but Pui Ying's attack was fierce and could not cope with it, so they lost again with a score of 17-21. Pui Ying won with a score of 3-0.

In the junior Pui Ying vs. St. Paul's match, Pui Ying had strong strength. Although St. Paul's tried their best to fight, they could not support it. As a result, they lost 0-2. In the first game, Pui Ying won 21-13, and in the second game, 21-17.

In the children's grade Southwest vs. St. Paul's match, both sides played quite brilliantly. Southwest was repeatedly trapped by St. Paul's at the beginning. Later, the entire army worked hard and held the draw several times. St. Paul's finally won 3-2 at the final moment. In the first game, St. Paul's won 21-8, in the second game, 21-3, and in the third game, 20-4.

At 4:30 p.m. today, three more matches will be held according to the schedule: senior St. Paul's vs. Queen's College, junior Wah Yan vs. Queen's College, and children's Fam Lam vs. Yu Choi. The senior St. Paul's has a strong fighting spirit and is probably not an enemy of Queen's College. The junior Wah Yan has a strong aggressive power and should win. The children's Fam Lam coordinates well and can also be regarded as guaranteed. All matches will be held at the Bu Gong football field.

### Post-War Repayment of National Debt: 530 Million Yuan
### Issuance of Construction and Military Expenditure Bonds in Installments
### New Bonds of Great Significance to the Future of the War of Resistance

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government is striving to repay maturing debts, which has earned the trust of both Chinese and foreign individuals. Following the first issue of Construction Bonds, the first issue of Military Expenditure Bonds is approved for release on June 1st. Funds are reserved by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, and various domestic debts are repaid according to the usual lottery system. Details are as follows:

Striving to Maintain Domestic and Foreign Creditworthiness

The government's commitment to maintaining creditworthiness remains consistent. Although customs and salt taxes have been seized, it has been declared that overdrafts will no longer be permitted. However, the fact that the unified reconstruction secured by customs revenue and the principal and interest due are being paid as scheduled proves the government's efforts to maintain creditworthiness. From July 1937 to March 1939, a total of 198,764,508 yuan of foreign debt and 331,650,392 yuan of domestic debt were repaid, totaling 530,414,900 yuan.

Custody of Construction and Military Expenditure Funds

The total amount of the 1939 Construction Bonds is 600 million yuan. The first tranche of 300 million yuan was issued on April 1st, and the second tranche of 300 million yuan is scheduled for issue on August 1st. The total amount of the 1939 Military Expenditure Bonds is 600 million yuan. The first tranche of 300 million yuan is approved for issue on June 1st, and the second tranche of 300 million yuan is scheduled for issue on October 1st. The principal and interest repayment funds for both types of bonds are managed by the Shanghai National Debt Fund Management Committee. The Central Bank and its entrusted banks are designated as managing institutions for payment matters.

Unified Repayment of Principal and Interest on Various Debts

The lottery for the unified public bonds secured by customs revenue, types A, B, C, and D, has been held separately. The lottery for type E was held on June 10th. This is the seventh time, and a total of 14.23 million yuan of principal and 42.3735 million yuan of interest have been repaid. It is approved to be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications on July 31st. Specific payment methods will be announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time.

Yuping Road Loan Payment and Telecommunications Lottery

The eighth principal repayment of the 1934 Yuping Railway Public Bonds totals 600,000 yuan. Together with interest, it is approved to be paid by the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in various locations on the 30th of this month. The fifteenth principal repayment lottery for the 1935 Telecommunications Public Bonds is scheduled for June 10th. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will send letters to various institutions and organizations to send personnel to supervise at that time. Furthermore, the seventh principal repayment lottery for the 1936 Reconstruction Public Bonds is scheduled for July 10th, repaying a total of 1.7 million yuan of principal and 9.8944 million yuan of interest.

Great Significance of the Two New Public Bonds

The significance of the two new public bonds is very significant. (1) Construction Bonds are entirely used for domestic construction projects, ensuring the completion of inland construction. Therefore, the banking industry has agreed to provide mortgage loans to assist the government in handling construction. (2) Military Expenditure Bonds aim to supplement the costs of the Second War of Resistance. Therefore, the people hope for early issuance and actively subscribe to them, wishing for victory in the War of Resistance. As for the guarantee of the two types of bond funds, one is the special fund for construction projects levied under the salt tax and the surplus profits from newly established national construction projects. The other is the revenue from consolidated taxes and tobacco and alcohol taxes, so both are reliable.

### What If They Blockade the Chinese Sea?

— Bao Leti

In the past few days, the Japanese side has loudly declared that they will blockade the Chinese Sea. Logically speaking, this is a decisive measure that should have been implemented from the start of the war. When Japan launched its war against China, people both inside and outside the country were waiting for this move. However, almost two years into the war, they are still just shouting loudly. If this is considered a threat to Britain and the United States, helping them seize concessions, or even coordinating with Germany and Italy in Europe to alienate Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, then it is hard to see any threatening power. It is just an act of screaming in response to being attacked.

We don't need to consult anyone about what it really means. However, now some people are raising the question of what changes will occur in China's economy if the Chinese Sea is blockaded. The most common concern is that after the blockade, China will not be able to buy munitions from abroad, the daily necessities of the Chinese people will not be able to be imported, and Chinese products will not be able to be exported.

These are indeed questions worth considering, but the answer is "obviously, there will be no problem."

First, since the fall of the southwestern ports, the Chinese government's military supplies have been transported through certain international routes, without needing to pass through the Chinese Sea. Therefore, if Japan wants to cut off overseas military supplies to China, it should ask the Japanese Navy to break through the Singapore military port, or ask the Japanese Army to defeat Xinjiang, otherwise it will be useless.

The second question should be answered on two levels: the occupied areas and the rear areas. In terms of lifestyle, it should also be divided into frugal and extravagant people. Indeed, many of the daily necessities in the rear areas are transported from the Chinese Sea. However, even today, when the Chinese Sea has not been cut off, the Chongqing newspapers still sell for more than 80 yuan. The current market price in Shanghai is only about 7.1 yuan. The price of paper in Chongqing is so expensive, but the local publishing industry has not stopped because they have all adopted local paper. The same is true for essential items such as gauze in the interior. This shows that even though there is no blockade, it is effectively the same as if there was one. At present, the lives of the people in the interior are not only being maintained, but their incomes are increasing due to the development of handicrafts. Shanghai, a market for foreign goods, will of course face major problems after the blockade. The most unlucky will be the European and American merchants. Japanese merchants are unwilling to give up this opportunity. However, when the Chinese also become frugal and use domestic products like the people in the interior, then the Japanese merchants will suffer the consequences themselves.

The above answers also apply to the third question. In fact, it cannot hit the Chinese government's ability to obtain export foreign exchange. The result is that it will destroy Japan's own existing method of obtaining export foreign exchange.

The Japanese economy is completely dependent on the world commodity market. It seizes Chinese raw materials, processes them, and then exports them. However, when Japan blockades the Chinese Sea, its overseas markets will also be completely blockaded at the same time. Although it may monopolize the Chinese market, and Japanese goods may still have customers in China, the general purchasing power of China at that time will be drastically reduced as exports decrease. Moreover, its current exports are solely for exchanging for military supplies. China has no military supplies to provide, and as for Europe and the United States, they are already prohibiting the sale of military supplies to Japan, and they will definitely carry this out even more thoroughly at that time. Some people say that although Japan has been at war with China for nearly two years, it has not dared to formally declare war or truly blockade the Chinese seaports. One of the main reasons is this. That's right, this is indeed one of the biggest reasons, and it still exists now. Therefore, everyone believes that this time the Japanese side's frantic roar is mostly just a diplomatic intimidation tactic.

### Creating a New Style of Literature

— Jie Ru

The unique style of human literature and art has always been constantly changing, following objective reality. On top of a certain social reality, a group of literary writers will inevitably express the unity of content and form in their entire artistic system, due to the commonality of social interests, the connectivity of cognitive methods, and the consistency of creative content, blending their unique literary style. This establishes a consistent and pure literary technique among ordinary writers and within individual writers themselves, allowing a particular era or a particular writer to achieve consistency in style. Style is not necessarily immutable, as the famous Soviet literary theorist Dov said, it is permanently developing.

"No matter what the style, it is never static. Style changes with the changes in its social state, changes depending on its class. The arrival of new society and reality also brings new literary content, new social interests, and new organization of thoughts and feelings. These will necessarily establish its new literary style."

The arrival of new realities, the awakening of new humanity, and the unfolding of new struggles, inevitably demand new expressions in literature, demanding the transformation or reconstruction of its new style. These are especially evident in today's Chinese reality. China today is in the midst of a great war. Countless Chinese production masses and laboring masses are beginning to raise their heads in the war against Japanese fascists. China's history today is infinitely brilliant and has infinitely rich content. The literature in front of this history has not only the "task of reflecting," but also the "task of fighting." It needs to combine with today's emerging masses in China, and at the same time, it needs to walk in front of today's Chinese masses. It wants to enlighten, to educate, and to lead. All these urgent real needs are demanding innovation in the methods of expression in literature, demanding the creation of an entirely new style.

The road that Chinese literature has traveled since the May Fourth Movement has been long and multifaceted. After many stylistic attempts, absorption, and changes, it has become insufficient and unusable when facing the rapids of today's national revolutionary war. Today's Chinese literature needs to accept the new tasks assigned to it by the new stage of the Chinese revolution in an entirely new posture. It wants to establish a completely new form, and it needs a systematic method. It needs to create a brand new style to strengthen its war power and improve the mass influence it can have in the national revolutionary war, so that it can fundamentally break away from the past in terms of style, form, and content. By relying on the power of stylistic innovation, it can intensify its penetration into the masses and become the center of the masses' lives and actions, influencing the masses, leading the masses, learning from the masses, and creating towards the masses.

The maturation of new realities and new masses in free China is urgently demanding the creation of its new style in literature. Although this creation seems quite difficult because today's China is in a tense, difficult, and struggling situation, and because countless writers in China today are engaged in a fierce battle, in fact, it is only in the face of the objective and pressing situation and the subjective great power of fierce battles and constant struggles that it can be created. Without the nourishment of struggle and without the cultivation of reality, the creation of a new literary style becomes impossible. Only in the sharp and great tide of struggle can a new type of great literary style be created. Therefore, today's Chinese literary and artistic writers should redouble their confidence in the creation of their literary style.

How should the task of creating a new literary style be carried out today? The author believes that the following points cannot be missing: First, writers must expand their understanding of the entire life of China today in their consciousness. Only when we have a deep understanding of the entire life of China can we create a new literary style that is appropriate to our lives based on the characteristics of our lives. Second, we must try our best to expand our horizons to the entire field of our lives. For the sake of our literary descriptions and literary struggles, we must select topics from various new aspects of Chinese life and give new interpretations to old lives and old themes, so that the content of our literature can obtain boundless nourishment and lay the foundation for the creation of a new style. Third, we must absorb the positive and progressive causalities from the comprehensive beams of human artistic practice around the world, learn from the excellent experiences of the great literary pioneers of the world, so as to accumulate our methods of artistic cognition and techniques of literary expression, and establish our system of artistic ability to grasp new aspects of life and express new content of life, to ensure the possibility of creating a new style. These points are all necessary conditions for the creation of a new style.

Of course, the critical acceptance of the old literary heritage is also indispensable for the creation of a new literary style, especially in China, where there are many valuable crystallizations of mass literature in reality. In order to enable the style we create to penetrate into the masses and become an organic part of the masses, we must first not forget these valuable legacies in reality. We need to learn and absorb from it, and we need to obtain the necessary nutrients from it. Therefore, we must take a new and progressive attitude towards the old literature, research, explore, and grasp it, and establish the foundation for the creation of our new literary style from its development possibilities.

The formation and establishment of a new literary style needs to be carried out in the theoretical research and realistic review of various literary issues. "In order to form a new system of artistic means, it is necessary to arouse vigorous struggle in criticism." Today, our literary and artistic criticism circles should rise up and give this issue a heated discussion.

### Wilderness

— Luo Pin

Over the years

How many times the flowers bloom

How many times guarding the setting sun

Carrying the twilight westward

Heroes of thousands of years

Scenic spots become desolate

Let tourists pay tribute to the loyal souls

Generations of incense ashes

Fishing boats on the river

Through many storms

To this day

Only the long river flows

Year after year waiting for the flowers to bloom

Emptyly attracting spring

### Five Minutes (1)

— Luo Feng

One minute ago, the tail of dusk still descended from the swaying evening mist to the foot of this desolate mountain. In the blink of an eye, the rugged paths, flowers, jungles, and the Japanese military headquarters' shelters on the mountain were all merged into the hazy night sky.

Quietly, as if all the creatures of this desolate mountain were suffocated by the dull evening mist, the silent wind, blowing its light wings, hovered under the mist, sometimes rising, sometimes falling, sometimes passing, and sometimes appearing again.

Darkness embraced this rugged desolate mountain, everything seemed to shrink and become invisible, and everything seemed to expand, making it difficult to touch its outline even with illusions. Only the flickering starlight, with its sly and suspicious eyes, monitored the heads of all creatures.

Suddenly, the clanging sound of iron rings broke the deathly silence of this desolate mountain. Then, in the even and crisp rhythm, a Chinese military officer walked out of the Japanese military headquarters. From his complete military uniform and complete collar insignia, it could be proved that he was a lieutenant colonel staff officer. From the shackles on his ankles, it could be further proved that he was a prisoner of war.

His name was He Zheng.

He was unfortunately captured by a Japanese army asphyxiation shell before dawn today. When he woke up from the poison, he had already left his position and his defeated troops, half of whom were wounded or killed, and was lying in the × army headquarters more than a hundred li away. Although he immediately noticed that the collar insignia was still hanging on his clothes, taking it off would be useless. Therefore, he still let it hang there.

He believed that his motherland would definitely defeat its enemies in the future, but it was absolutely impossible for him to overcome death at the present moment.

Therefore, he felt that all fear was extraordinarily ordinary. In any case, he was determined to fulfill his military duty and his calling with his youth.

He Zheng's calmness and firm answers confused the × army commander. In the interrogation lasting more than three hours, he exhausted all means, both soft and hard. However, his urgent need to obtain the × army's operational plan, the deployment of combat forces, and the artillery positions... etc., all ended in disappointment. In the end, he had no choice but to threaten this seemingly invincible prisoner with death and the imminence of death.

"Kōben!"

This was already the last sentence. He Zheng no longer imagined the sinister face of the × army commander when he said this sentence. Because the residue of the poison gas and the surrounding thick cigarette smoke made his oral cavity, nasal passages, and lungs feel as dry as a long-droughted field. He desperately needed something moist to moisten them. Therefore, when he walked out of the headquarters' shelter, he greedily took a breath of cool, moist air. Then, he took a second breath... and stretched out his solid waist, and his stuffy chest felt unexpectedly comfortable.

Two armed Japanese soldiers escorted him, groping forward on a small path buried in reeds. After walking a dozen steps, he heard the bright shout of the communicator again:

"Five minutes."

Those words had already resounded in He Zheng's ears no less than ten times. But those same words pierced his heart, colder each time, until this last sound, as if leading his soul to another world. The more this was the case, the less he missed this world, and the less easily his determination wavered. (To be continued)

### On Winning Over the Reader Masses

— Lat

The unfolding of the New Literature Movement and the emergence of New Art and Literature works have still not received enthusiastic support from the reader masses today, which is undoubtedly a serious matter. However, if anyone therefore attempts to deny the existence and development trend of New Art and Literature works, or to deny the bright future of the New Literature Movement, then such a person clearly does not understand the painful and tortuous path taken by the New Literature Movement itself; moreover, they do not understand that the reader masses' own love of New Literature is still subject to various obstacles. If one does not seek a correct understanding from this point, then "defeatist" thoughts will inevitably arise regarding the New Literature Movement, and the seeds of the New Art and Literature Movement will be abandoned intentionally or unintentionally, which is a very dangerous tendency that must be overcome immediately.

Therefore, the posing of the question "Winning Over the Reader Masses" should be regarded as one of the important tasks of our New Literature Movement, especially at a time when the dregs of old literature are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the reader masses and are secreting toxins. Our "Winning Over the Reader Masses" is especially a central theme of the Anti-Japanese War culture.

What we want to point out now is that the intellectual and cultural level of the reader masses has not yet achieved mutual consistency with New Art and Literature works, and Art and Literature works have not yet adopted forms and content that satisfy the demands of the masses in order to suit the masses. This is one reason why New Literature works have not been able to gain the welcome of the reader masses. Another more important reason is that outdated works, those so-called "flowery women" and "magical ghosts," are still rather advantageously entrenched in the reader masses' positions, hindering the development of New Art and Literature works among the reader masses. This is the most obvious fact that we can see at a glance.

From this fact, we can clearly point out that the most important work of "Winning Over the Reader Masses" lies not only in the use of old forms, nor only in the development of popularization. The large-scale production of works with popular new content is likely to accomplish this arduous task.

We have the right to solemnly ask whether the slogan "Winning Over the Reader Masses" can quickly reap practical results. We still need to arm ourselves with fighting "word-bullets," sharpen our fighting "pen-points," and first resolutely and seriously criticize the dissemination of those outdated, rotten, and toxic works that hinder the penetration of New Literature works into the masses, and eliminate and strike at the existence of these works. Only by using this fighting posture as a way to educate the reader masses, influence the reader masses, and shake the reader masses' preference for harmful works of the old education can we gradually change the reader masses' old views and bring them to popular New Literature works. It is unimaginable to hope to win over the reader masses without a considerable period of arduous struggle. Therefore, we still firmly advocate that in our literary position, in order to win the final victory of winning over the reader masses, we must pay attention to the following points:

1. Establishing a new mutual relationship between our literature and the reader masses.

2. Popularization and qualitative improvement of thought and technique in all departments of literature.

3. The moral obligations of literary artists.

4. The fighting tasks of editors and critics.

5. Active elimination of old and harmful works.

If we can enthusiastically and persistently exert its power from these few points, then the final victory of winning over the reader masses will surely belong to us.

### All Sorts of Things in Xi'an

— Su Hongshu

The enemy at Fenglingdu did not move, and no sound of artillery could be heard at Zhangguan. Xi'an, which had been turbulent for a while, calmed down.

"The Yellow River is a natural barrier, and moreover, there is Tongguan, where one man can hold the pass and ten thousand cannot pass. No matter what great skills they have, how can they get through!"

Xi'an settled down under this kind of confidence. Although there were air raid alarms every day, anyway, there were air raid shelters that could not be destroyed by thousands of tons of bombs. When airplanes came, it was enough to hide in the air raid shelter. In the evening, one could still go to Pearl Spring to bathe, and take a rickshaw to Afang Palace to listen to Peking opera. After listening, one would return to Yu Shun Restaurant to order two Tianjin dishes and drink Consort Yu wine. If one's heart was filled with spring, one could take advantage of the darkness to go to Kaiyuan Ancient Temple to find a Jiangsu-Zhejiang prostitute to have a good time and enjoy the whole night. Tomorrow, as long as the airplane doesn't bomb it away, one can come again in the evening. Anyway, what time is this? If you don't die today, maybe tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, you can't escape in the end. Merchants in the rear who don't die in the front may die in enemy air raids. Other high-level refugees fled here from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan, facing death all day long. How could anyone not enjoy themselves happily for a while when they returned to a safe area? At this time, maybe a [certain country's] airplane would drop a bomb, and life would still be precarious, wouldn't it? "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold" is lamenting why not enjoy yourself in time!

Xi'an flourished under this kind of philosophy of life.

In the evening, as soon as the lights came on, the powdered faces crowded the streets, waiting for employers. In the theaters, bathhouses, and restaurants, guests shuttled back and forth. The errand runners and tea waiters with fragrant towels were busy, running east and west like ants on a hot pot. Old [proprietor] Lie opened his wide face, revealing two large gold teeth, smiling and nodding frequently to the guests who entered, swaying his big buttocks. A noisy sound of laughter came from inside.

Dong Street, Mafangdou, and Gulou were bustling with pedestrians coming and going: cloth-soled shoes, silk-cotton felt shoes, and velvet shoes mixed with velvet military leather shoes, walking proudly, with chests out. Epaulettes, shoulder straps, and collar badges shone in the light. The sound of people, vehicles, and hawkers mixed together. In the midst of this, although the newspaper boys tried their best to shout, "Xijing Evening News, Xinqin Evening News," they were all lost in the clamor.

At the same time, the Pinghu Restaurant in Lianhu Park was holding a grand banquet, while in the street corner, someone was sobbing and sighing to the sky.

Night covered this gray ancient city. This ancient city was staging a new era of old tragedies of licentiousness and shamelessness, but on the other side of the Yellow River, light was released.

May this ancient capital one day awaken.
