### Dedication to Publication

Now is the great era of the 20th century, an era when the old social system has developed to its peak and is beginning to collapse dramatically. It is also an era when the new ideal society is born and growing stronger. This is an era when dawn is about to break and darkness displays its last vestiges of power. It is a very turbulent, very difficult, and very great era.

We, the young masses, are growing up in this era, neither too early nor too late. We cannot help but lament the unprecedented darkness and suffering, but we should rejoice even more at the scene of unprecedented great battles. How worthy of song and tears is the life of modern youth! How much more should the life of modern youth strive to eliminate the old and usher in the new, to create a glorious history! "The responsibility is heavy and the road is long." None of us young people growing up in this era should underestimate ourselves.

"Modern Youth" is launched in this newspaper today, without any exaggerated mission or profound ideals. We hope that this "Modern Youth" will become the most loyal and best companion of modern youth, a gathering place for modern youth to learn, work, and rest, a venue for modern youth to speak and act for themselves. We want to record here the traces of the struggles of the youth of this great era, and we also want to discuss here the experiences and lessons of the lives and struggles of youth in ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign.

Although our expectations are not great, they cannot be realized without the guidance of advanced youth social leaders and the mutual assistance of the broad masses of youth! At the beginning of this publication, we dare to express our infinitely warm and devout hopes for your guidance, criticism, and contributions! Let us not fail the great era of the 20th century, let us move forward hand in hand calmly and joyfully, towards that brand new ideal era!

### Expanding Compulsory Education for Women

— Aying

Whether the construction work of ×× is completed or not, the mobilization of the vast number of women, who account for half of the population, has a decisive effect. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, how to mobilize the vast masses of women who are dormant has long been regarded as a very serious and urgent problem to be solved. As for the central key to solving this problem, it is to immediately intensify the basic education and universal education for these vast masses of women.

At this year's "March 8th International Women's Day Commemoration," the advanced women in Hong Kong also began to feel the importance of education work and determined to use the more than one thousand yuan of righteous funds obtained from the sale of commemorative items at the conference as funding for expanding compulsory education work for women. In the past three months, how much progress has been made on the resolutions at that time? The Women's Federation was automatically dissolved. At the last meeting, it was decided to hand over this work entirely to the Young Women's Christian Association. Can this be said to be entrusted properly?

The Hong Kong Young Women's Christian Association has been recognized as the most well-established and historically significant women's organization in Hong Kong. It has also paid attention to women's education work earlier than others, and has indeed put in a lot of effort, with considerable experience and achievements.

Welcome criticism! Welcome submissions!

Now, the 600,000 uneducated female workers and poor housewives in Hong Kong and Kowloon are still hoping with the greatest enthusiasm that the Young Women's Christian Association can, as soon as possible, put forward a plan and earnestly implement it based on the resolution of the Women's Federation.

First, we believe that the Young Women's Christian Association should regard this work as a great social undertaking; it should call on a wider range of enthusiastic people and cadres to participate; it should mobilize various social groups and female students from various schools to take joint responsibility. We advocate that the Young Women's Christian Association should convene an expanded women's compulsory education conference in the shortest possible time; this conference should have members from various social groups who are enthusiastic about women's education and female cadres with experience in women's education to participate; it can better give play to collective wisdom and accelerate the implementation of this work in a truly universal and in-depth way.

Second, according to what we have heard, many female workers in factories have written letters to the Women's Federation asking them to set up night schools for them; these female workers are mostly members who have participated in the "March 8th" commemoration conference. They are very satisfied with the Women's Federation's resolution on expanding compulsory education for women and are eager for the early realization of this resolution. Therefore, we believe that the Young Women's Christian Association should immediately accept the demands of these female workers first, and at the very least, immediately set up several free night schools in various districts.

Third, we believe that we should not limit this work to running night schools only, but should expand the scope of its work as much as possible to include newspapers, literacy, patriotic songs, drama, and even the establishment of libraries and the study of women's movement issues... Only in this way can the work be carried out on a broader scale. At the same time, there should be such determination and plans - to expand fundraising, expand organization, and continue the work for a long time.

Regarding the issue of teachers, we believe that there should be careful selection and training; we should call on enthusiastic cadres from various schools and social groups to give a general basic understanding of the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and to give full play to their greatest spirit of service, without taking salaries; so that we can create the greatest work achievements with the least material conditions.

Sisters! Do not hesitate and delay any longer, remember that "whether the completion of ××'s nation-building work or not, the mobilization of the vast women's power, which accounts for half of the national population, is decisive!"

### Manned Bomb

— Yuan

A bomb that can accommodate a driver inside has now been designed. This bomb is dropped from an altitude of 10,000 feet, controlled by the driver lying inside the bomb, causing it to glide to a position directly above the target object about 3,500 feet away, and then let it fall straight down, making it easy to hit. What about the driver? He has a parachute on his back, ready to detach from the bomb and land safely before he reaches his destination. To avoid the danger of landing in enemy camps, this bomb can now only be used for naval warfare. Therefore, a portable rubber boat and sufficient food are specially prepared for him so that he can drift on the water after landing to await rescue. It is said that this bomb can sink a battleship worth 20 million gold pounds, while the driver himself can ride in a small boat and return victoriously.

### Rambling on Food

— Xinqiu

The structure and function of the human body are very much like a sophisticated and complex machine. Humans need to take in food, just like machines need to add coal. However, the food we take in, some increase heat, some compensate for physique, and some are stored for future use, which is very complicated. The general characteristics of animals are often determined by heredity, but the food they take in is also of great importance. If a person can usually only grow to a height of five feet eight inches, no specially made food can make him exceed this number. Conversely, if the food is not nutritious enough, this person will not be able to reach a height of five feet eight inches.

On average, each person consumes about 50 tons of food in their lifetime. It takes 70 pounds of food to grow one pound of flesh on the body. We absorb about 3,000 calories of heat every day. Healthy people convert 30 to 40% of these "heat energy" into "kinetic energy." In addition to transforming it into energy or storing it, some of the food consumed by humans is discarded outside the body because digestion and absorption are not perfect. Therefore, on the one hand, we should pay attention to its nutritional value, and at the same time, whether digestion and absorption can be fully carried out is an important matter.

The necessary food raw materials for humans can usually be divided into four categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Carbohydrates often become flour and sugar. Their main function is to generate energy. In metabolism, they and fat can interact to some extent. In healthy people, roughly 40 to 50% of the energy of the total food comes from carbohydrates, and 30 to 35% comes from fat. Fat often forms a protective layer around the nerves, it is the cushion of the nerves. Lack of fat in the human body will certainly make it easy to become weak and sick, and at the same time, it cannot obtain an appropriate amount of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, F, etc., which has a great impact on physiology. Protein is the element that forms the basic protoplasm of cell life. Its molecules are very complex, but only a few chemical elements are included in its organization. Most proteins contain about 51 to 55% carbon, 7% hydrogen, 32.0 to 23% oxygen, 15 to 2% sulfur, and some even contain a small amount of phosphorus or iron. Plants can compose amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, so most of the protein needed by animals is taken from plants. Pure carbohydrates and proteins generate about four calories of heat per gram when oxidized in the body, while animal or vegetable fats generate nine calories of heat. Water only constitutes most of the weight of food, and it does not generate any energy. The chemical composition of various human foods can represent the cross-section of various substances on the earth. Not only are various elements present in food, but they also form a way that makes it easy for the human body to absorb. If the body lacks iron, it cannot directly eat iron ore to compensate for this deficiency, because these elements must wait until they have undergone a special composition before the body can absorb and utilize them.

It has now been proven that the condition for individual health requires at least 50% minerals. According to this standard, the average adult must obtain 0.68 grams of calcium per day. Calcium is very important for the preservation of teeth and bones, and phosphorus is equally important. Iron is an element of blood. The index of anemia is determined according to the content of hemoglobin. About 3% of the blood cells in the human body are constantly being destroyed there. If there is no iron to compensate, the number of blood cells will be abnormal and anemia will occur. It can be seen that minerals in food are also a major element in physiology.

Usually, the degree of digestion of food is often higher for mixed foods than for simple ones. The purpose of cooking food is to shorten the digestion time and make it easier to absorb. The time it takes to pass through the entire digestive tract is in the range of 12 to 47 hours. Excess or deficiency are both abnormal phenomena. The most important thing to pay attention to when cooking vegetables is the amount of water used, so as to avoid the loss of minerals and vitamin C.

Life relies on food to maintain life, and health is enhanced by various nutrients. The close relationship between food and the body is really worthy of attention.

### The Conspiracy of the × Traitors and the Task of the People

The art of war says: "In using the military, victory is prized. If operations are protracted, the soldiers' edge will be blunted and their ardor dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. If the army is exposed to long campaigns, the resources of the State will not be adequate. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor dampened, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your plight. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue." How could the Japanese invaders not know this reason? Since the twenty-third month of the war of aggression, especially after the recent major defeats on the border of Hubei and Henan and the major defeats in western and southern Shanxi, has the Japanese × not completely exposed its dull soldiers, blunted edges, exhausted strength, depleted goods, and isolated international position, and chaotic domestic situation? However, the Japanese × at the same time cannot but admit that the isolation of the Japanese ×'s international position, the seriousness of the domestic situation, and the determination of our united resistance are not only their chances of "quick victory and quick decision" have failed, but also the fantasy of "quick peace and quick conclusion" using Wang Jingwei's betrayal that followed was shattered! What other way do they have to solve their current increasingly difficult difficulties and crises? They stole the essence of our country's military tactics of "soldiers are not conscripted again, and supplies are taken from the country; grain is not transported for three years, and supplies are taken from the enemy" and adopted the conspiracy of "supporting the war with war," that is, using the human and material resources of our occupied areas to support its war of aggression. The specific contents are nothing more than:

First, instruct traitors in various places to establish small-unit puppet regimes as tools to consolidate the occupied areas:

Second, in the rear of the × puppet army, implement the so-called "appeasement" policy, using a little favor to buy people's hearts and drive them, while at the same time carrying out various absurd propaganda to our compatriots in the occupied areas, saying that our anti-Japanese parties have split and the anti-Japanese forces have been destroyed, and re-shaking the belief of our compatriots in the occupied areas in the victory of the war of resistance;

Third, carry out cruel exploitation and plunder in an attempt to squeeze the blood and sweat of our compatriots in the occupied areas to supplement their financial exhaustion;

Fourth, step up efforts to help Wang Jingwei and others promote the propaganda and agitation movement of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China," sow discord and division in our internal unity, slander our authorities and leaders from all walks of life, and attempt to divide and eliminate our country's resistance forces;

Fifth, risk pushing forward the anti-British movement in an attempt to plunder all the rights and interests of Britain and France in China, and at the same time blackmail and deceive Britain in an attempt to jointly force our country to submit.

There is no doubt that this new conspiracy of Japanese × traitors will also encounter failure. However, the severity and speed of our failure depends on whether our countermeasures to combat this conspiracy are appropriate and sufficient. First of all, we must have a full understanding of the specific circumstances of the Japanese × traitors implementing this conspiracy. What arrangements do they have? What impact has it had? What is the basis of these influences on social institutions and past political situations? Secondly, we must clearly understand what the anti-Japanese forces behind the enemy, especially in the occupied areas, are like? What difficulties do many groups and cadres and individuals doing salvation work have in the political and military aspects that must be helped? What undesirable phenomena should be strictly corrected? What statements and behaviors are easily directly or indirectly used by Japanese × traitors? And what kind of clear-cut handling methods should be adopted? What are the advantages and strengths that should be promoted selflessly, so that the whole country can learn from them and strive for the final victory together?

"Politics is more important than military affairs" "The people are more important than soldiers," especially "the battle behind the enemy's army is more important than the front line." This is the characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance that the leader has revealed to the whole country. Whether we can successfully enter the counter-offensive stage, whether we can exhaust the enemy's power to the point where they cannot sustain it in the current situation, on the one hand, depends on how our new forces are cultivated, and at the same time, it depends on whether we can make our human and material resources in the occupied areas not be used by the enemy, but instead become a disaster for the enemy; it depends on whether we can consolidate unity, persist in the war of resistance, oppose shaking and conservatism, increase international sympathy and assistance; that is, it depends on whether we can break the conspiracy of the Japanese × traitors.

We know the ferocity and brutality of the Japanese × traitors, but we do not pay attention to their sinister schemes and vicious plans, which is very insufficient and quite dangerous; we only know that the compatriots behind the enemy are also like the compatriots in other places, hating the enemy and resisting the enemy, but we do not pay attention to the difficulties and dangers of their battle and the hardship of their lives, and we do not try to help them, which is even more insufficient and extremely dangerous. We compatriots in the "safe zone" must know more about the above situation, study these situations, and make more efforts to improve, in order to crush the conspiracy of the Japanese × traitors today.

### 500,000 Young Men and Women Serving the Country in the Rear, Engaged in Propaganda and Rescue Work, Enthusiastic and Working Intensely

— Xishan

Seeking National Liberation Through Hard Work

(A dispatch from a certain place) In the nineteen months since the July 7th Incident, what has made Chinese youth feel most honored is the victory in the work of saving the country. This has not only won the sympathy of people across the country, but also won the praise of people all over the world. Since the beginning of China's all-out war of resistance, Chinese youth have indeed done a lot of practical work to save the country. These more than 500,000 young men and women scattered in various regions of the interior, from any aspect, their spirit is sufficient to express their enthusiasm for the country.

In fact, under this all-out war of resistance, every two young people have felt the importance of their responsibilities. They can no longer bear to sit in the classroom, driven by passionate emotions. So they left school. A part of the young people bravely ran to the front line. They joined the formal army or formed small units of guerrillas to engage in direct anti-Japanese work. The best examples are the young college students from Tianjin and Beiping. Most of the young men and women, although they are not fighting on the front line, are very busy serving in the rear.

In Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Xi'an and many other areas, much of the political propaganda work, the rescue work of wounded soldiers, and the work of accommodating refugees are now entirely undertaken by young people. What is most admirable is the young people from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They used to live a very comfortable life in Shanghai, a large city, but today they are serving in the interior. Not only do they not feel uncomfortable with life, but their spirit of service is even better than others.

What we should mention is the efforts of young women to participate in the war of resistance. In many hospitals in the interior, female students are responsible for caring for the wounded soldiers. The best phenomenon is that they treat the wounded soldiers as their own brothers. They talk to them, comfort them, write letters home, sing songs, and read war news to them. They have a slogan that says, "Reducing the suffering of wounded soldiers and restoring the health of wounded soldiers is our first responsibility!"

Many young women are also receiving military training. They put on uniforms, cut their hair short, and when the sun rises, they are already lined up with guns on their backs, practicing in the square.

In every university or middle school in ××, there are at least eight hours of military subjects per week. Their daily life is completely militarized. Going to class, eating meals, getting up, and doing exercises are all carried out under the same discipline. In the suburbs, there are often teams of young student troops conducting field exercises. Agile and accurate movements symbolize that everyone is a brave warrior of the future.

In terms of propaganda work, they are expanding it. At the same time, many professors from schools are also helping to participate. Their highest goal is to improve the knowledge of the general public in order to strengthen and consolidate the public's patriotic sentiments. They have decided on four guidelines to promote this work: (1) Teach the illiterate masses to write and read. (2) Enlighten the public's thoughts on saving the country. (3) Train farmers to improve cultivation and handicraft production. (4) Train people how to organize themselves to resist aggression. Under this plan, many young people are engaged in various different ways to achieve this goal. They divide into teams and districts and go to various villages and cities, organizing drama and song and dance troupes, performing patriotic dramas in various places, and teaching the public to sing patriotic songs. Liu Liangmo, a composer of popular songs, led many young men and women to work in various places in Changsha. These means of reality propaganda containing high consciousness have awakened the public's will to resist the war.

Many college students in Chengdu organized rural service groups and used their vacations to work in nearby rural areas. They established temporary schools and people's night schools, gathered nearby farmers to study, and set up mobile libraries and traveling lecture groups, explaining wartime knowledge such as air defense, poison gas, and first aid. In the summer of last year, students from various universities in Chongqing, including Fudan University, successively organized economic investigation groups to various provinces (also joining economic investigation groups organized by the authorities). The inspections to Guiyang and various provinces in the southwest have all achieved considerable results.

At the Northwest Anti-Japanese University, many young men and women are training in difficult living conditions. The graduates of each session are assigned to lead important anti-Japanese work in various places, totaling five or six thousand people.

Secondly, in ××, under the leadership of Ms. Soong Mei-ling, hundreds of young women are also being trained. They will also shoulder special rear work.

In summary, in the past year or so, Chinese youth have been working hard and successfully in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. Every young person serving in the interior is not only enthusiastic, but also working hard in practice. There are no individuals among them, but they care for the group with each other. Under the arduous struggle, they hope to open up a new path and seek true national liberation!

### Our Army's Search and Advance in Southern Shanxi; Fierce Fighting Continues on Both Sides of the Zhangmao Highway; We Are Closely Monitoring Enemy Activity in Northwestern Shanxi

[Special Dispatch from Tongguan by this newspaper, 20th] Several of our aircraft bombed the enemy positions in Western Shanxi on the 18th, inflicting heavy damage.

[Dispatch from Shanzhou by the Central News Agency, 20th] After our army in Southern Shanxi recaptured Yan Di Village, it advanced towards the enemy like splitting bamboo. On the 16th, it successively captured Ji Wang Gu Zhu and Dongxi Yancun (northeast of Maojin). The remnants of the enemy troops at each stronghold were routed and fled in disarray towards the northwest. We are currently in pursuit. Furthermore, a certain unit of ours fiercely attacked the enemy at Houjia Majia Mountain (east of Zhangdian). After four hours of intense fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled. Both locations have been recovered, and we are currently advancing towards Zhangjia.

They are merely building new defensive fortifications in places such as Jiangmen, Shilong, and Zengcheng. Enemy naval aircraft have been bombing coastal areas for days, but while our civilians have suffered casualties, this indiscriminate bombing has no military value whatsoever.

[Special Dispatch from Guilin by this newspaper, 20th] According to reports, the Guangdong enemy will support the Tianjin enemy's actions and, if necessary, will take unfavorable actions against foreign nationals there. They are currently awaiting instructions. However, this information has not yet been confirmed.

### Large Quantities of National Tea Exported to the Soviet Union; Tung Oil Mostly Exported to the United States

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] Foreign news from Shanghai: According to business sources, between January and April of this year, China exported tea worth 500,000 British pounds to the Soviet Union, totaling 9,000 tons, accounting for 86% of all tea exports. It is said that the tea exported to the Soviet Union and the tung oil exported to the United States were both "bartered for goods." It is recalled that several months ago, the United States used tung oil exports as collateral to lend money to the Chinese. It is generally believed that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the export of the above-mentioned products has increased over the past year.

### Military Affairs Commission Strictly Orders All Levels of Government to Respect Public Opinion, Protect Lives, Use Labor Cautiously, and Save Money

Strive to Convey Public Sentiment Upwards and Shatter Enemy Conspiracy

[Special Dispatch from Guilin by this newspaper, 20th] The War Zone Command of the Military Affairs Commission issued an order to all Pacification Headquarters, which was then forwarded to all levels of military and political organs, instructing them to respect public opinion, protect lives, use labor cautiously, and save money. The telegram stated, "This war of resistance against Japan is purely for the sake of the independence and survival of the nation and the race. Now that the war of resistance has lasted for more than twenty months, the public has always warmly supported the national policy of resisting to the end, which fully demonstrates that the launch of the war of resistance is in line with the requirements of public opinion. However, 'reward those who cherish me, and hate those who abuse me' is the most common psychology of human beings. All levels of civil and military officials should absolutely respect public opinion, so that the feelings of the people can be conveyed upwards. When intentions are conveyed, emotions will arise, thereby inspiring their patriotic enthusiasm, strengthening their centripetal force, and making them enthusiastically contribute their wealth and labor, and even dedicate their lives, for the benefit of the country. We should also respect lives and use labor cautiously, so as to obtain the guarantee of final victory. The victory or defeat of the war of resistance depends entirely on the continued support of lives, labor, and wealth, the length of time, and the amount of supply. All use of labor and wealth, or sacrifice of lives, must be reduced to the minimum extent possible during times of necessity. If it is unavoidable to sacrifice lives, the people will die without complaint; if labor and wealth are used within the minimum limit, there will be more than enough even if used. The violent enemy is currently destroying labor and extorting wealth in the occupied areas on the one hand, and attempting to win over and unite the hearts of the people on the other. Both are being carried out simultaneously, with all kinds of fraud and deceit. We should especially adhere to the above-mentioned principles, and provide comfort to the people in the war of resistance in every possible way, so that they will not be shaken by them. Only then can the belief that the war of resistance will surely succeed be thoroughly realized. In addition to separate orders, this order is to be strictly followed. And forward to the integral subordination for the must be followed" and other words.

### The United States Adopts a Tough Stance Towards Japan; US Agent Lodges Two Protests with Japan; Japan Deeply Fears the US Will Publicize the Details of the Negotiations; Hiranuma, Arita, and Itagaki Hold Emergency Meetings

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] Foreign news from Tokyo: It is reported that the US government has now adopted a tough attitude towards various Far East issues that are not directly related to the Tianjin incident. This attitude will also affect the Tianjin matter. US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan Grew lodged two strong protests with the Japanese government last night: one protesting the arbitrary bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft, and the other protesting the Japanese ban on the transport of food to Gulangyu. Regarding the bombing of American property, Grew first stated each instance of the bombing of American property, one by one. Next, he pointed out that the Japanese government had made a guarantee to the United States that it would no longer bomb American property, but it has not fulfilled its promise to date. Finally, Grew stated that if the Japanese side does not immediately stop the bombing, the United States will immediately publish all the details of the US-Japan negotiations. As for the protest against the Japanese military's blockade of Gulangyu, the US note expressed surprise at the Japanese actions. It is reported that the US attitude towards the Tianjin incident has not been lenient, but it has put pressure on Japan regarding other issues, which may affect the resolution of the Tianjin incident in the future. After the Japanese government received the US note, Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki discussed the matter. It is reported that the Japanese side deeply fears that the United States will publish the details of the US-Japan negotiations, because the result will affect US public opinion and support Britain's position on the Tianjin incident.

[Dispatch from Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan Grew visited Japanese Foreign Ministry's American Bureau Director Yosizawa yesterday to discuss the Tianjin incident. According to local newspapers, the two diplomats also discussed the issue of the United States acting as a mediator, but the newspapers also stated that the Japanese government will definitely reject this proposal, as the Tianjin incident is only a matter between Britain and Japan and has nothing to do with third countries, and the only solution is for Britain to provide a guarantee to completely abandon its "anti-Japanese" attitude.

### Special Correspondent's Report: Travel Notes on Mount Luofu (7)

— Liuying

We gathered with the telegraph squad and staff officers and advanced towards the north of Mount Luofu. Along the way, enemy planes kept circling above us. At first, we were afraid that the enemy planes would spot our target because there were too many people. After walking three or four miles, we were in a deep and densely forested area. The sounds of artillery and bombs accompanied us all the way. Along the way, refugees asked us for news, concerned about their homes, their fields, their lives, and their property, frowning and angry at the flames of war.

At this time, Chen's regiment had already moved from Futian to the southeast of Mount Luofu, Wei's regiment had moved from the east of Mount Luofu towards the north, and the mass salvation workers, the Zengcheng guerrillas, and the Third Guerrilla District's XX Brigade were all approaching Mount Luofu from different directions. In short, all forces were concentrated on Mount Luofu. The northwest sides were filled with the clear sounds of artillery and machine guns.

Looking into the Distance at Hulu Hun

We climbed Mount Luofu layer by layer. The road became narrower and smaller, and more rugged, and higher above the horizon. At first, looking up, the gray clouds swallowed the entire mountain peak, but when we reached one peak, there was another peak above it, swallowed by the clouds.

Enemy planes slipped through the gaps in the clouds, leveling with us. Walking and walking again, we climbed another mountain peak, and it started pouring rain. The rain was so heavy, but the enemy planes were flying crazily, circling constantly to our left and behind. However, their altitude had already been placed under our feet. I felt my own greatness and nobility. The sounds of artillery and bombs, and the sounds of the rain and the pine waves, merged into one.

We reached another mountain peak and the rain stopped. Looking back, we saw the milky white Dongjiang River lying horizontally at the foot of Mount Luofu, and looking north, it was full of artillery fire, full of the combined forces of our nation's resistance and the villages. Over there, in a distant valley, was a cluster of small trees, with the corners of houses faintly visible within the trees. Liu Kechang was staring at it in a daze. "That is Hulu Hun, the home of Gan Guquan, the former Village Chief, Rui Cong," he told us, pointing.

When we heard the three words "Hulu Hun," we were all filled with awe and stopped in our tracks, staring in that direction, asking each other questions and talking about Lai Ruicong's glorious history of resistance.

That village, hidden in the mountains and growing on the branches of Mount Luofu, seemed very small, with a total of less than two hundred people. However, in the great cause of resistance, it had established an incomparably great achievement. Under the leadership of the village chief Lai, the villagers, young and old, male and female, had launched ten attacks against the enemy, and the ashes of the invaders had been packaged into more than thirty bags and sent back by this small village. Later, the enemy soldiers had no choice but to bow their heads to this village, but this vital force of the nation was tightly entangled with them. So one time, a large number of traitors led more than five hundred enemy troops to specifically attack this village, and the village chief Lai also sacrificed himself in this attack. Therefore, another glorious page was written in the history of the resistance in Boluo.

This small village played such a big role, which shows that our mobilization work is not enough. The progress of politics is not keeping up with the military, and at the same time, it reflects the inadequacy of the Baojia system. If all the villages were like Hulu Village, and all the village chiefs were like Lai, no matter how fierce the enemy was, they would not be able to run rampant. I remembered our eulogy for Village Chief Lai: "If all the village chiefs were like you, the enemy would not be afraid. If all the villagers rise up, the spirit will not die and the hero will be comforted."

A Female Comrade Sacrificed

We were already forty miles away from the front line - we had reached a place just six miles from Sulao, where a waterfall cut off our path. This mountain torrent was pouring down from the top of Mount Luofu, and the water was rushing down like a mountain collapsing. The trees in the mountain stream were swaying, and although the water was only two or three feet deep, the majestic force could not but make us hesitate. So we spent a lot of energy and time considering this mountain stream, which was only six feet wide. The rain was pouring down constantly, and there were no villages to stay in if we retreated, and it was impossible for this mountain stream to recede in a short time. So I and comrades Chen and Liu became an exploration team. We climbed upstream by clinging to vines, exploring the path. We climbed like mice for less than two zhang and found trees crossing the two banks. We made a signal - because the impact of the water and the sound of the rain made it impossible for people only a few feet away to hear each other - and then climbed across the small tree that was stretched out, step by step. Our feet were skewed by the water,

We climbed to the hillside on the opposite bank and waved to them, and they did the same, one by one. Of course, everyone was soaked, and the raincoats had lost their effectiveness.

More than a dozen people had reached the "other shore." Over there, there were only three porters and the important items of the staff office, which could not be carried over. We asked the porters and Squad Leader Hu to wait here for the political training director of the Zengcheng Guerrilla, and to guard the public property. Because Director Liu Zhengxun was ill and had fallen behind, but Staff Officer Ruan and his wife were carrying him, along with a guard, probably one person. So we were relatively relieved. But it was precisely because we were "relieved" that it became "heartbreaking."

We passed through the alert line of Wei's regiment and Liang's battalion, and soon after arriving at the Sulao Temple, we received the news that a certain female comrade had sacrificed in that turbulent mountain stream, and her body could not be found. We were very sad. We understood that there was only one female comrade, which was the wife of Director Liu Zhengxun who followed him. For the nation, for her husband, she was swallowed by that turbulent mountain torrent. It was glorious, but we had to be more vigilant. All salvation workers must practice climbing mountains, crossing rivers, swimming, and climbing trees. Delicate young ladies must work harder to learn.

The Night Before Sulao Was Burned Down

We braved the heavy rain and passed through the cordon. The soldiers at the sentry post told us that enemy soldiers had been discovered at Duling Ao, ten miles away from Sulao. There was a possibility of being attacked immediately. At that time, we all felt a kind of luck. If the enemy had arrived at the same time as us, we would have been attacked on both sides, with the enemy on our left and our troops in front, and the result would have been terrible.

After circling around many low, mud houses attached to the mountainside fields, we arrived at Sulao Temple. It was already seven o'clock. The temple was already closed, and after much negotiation, we were able to enter. When we knocked on the door, a heavy response came from inside, and some opened the windows to look at our group of distinguished guests. At the same time, the dogs in the neighboring village also started barking.

Suliao Temple is the largest of the temples on Mount Luofu, with no less than a hundred Taoists inside. They are all men at least forty years old, each with a room. The right side is the guest room, and each room is very elegant and clean. Rather than a temple, it is more like a large hotel in the mountains. Because they are prepared to accommodate tourists, they charge different amounts of silver per person, and the meals are fixed at two cents per person. If it were a peaceful and prosperous time, many wealthy guests would come here to play in the summer. The Taoists also boasted about their coolness and cleanliness, welcoming the summer, but now it is different. No matter how quiet and elegant the place is, the enemy's artillery fire will come to visit.

After we arrived at Sulao Temple, the first lesson was to count the number of people, and the second was to take off our clothes, unpack our packages, and bake our clothes. In less than ten minutes, two charcoal stoves were lit, and everyone gathered around, and the charcoal smoke and the hot smell of wet cloth filled the whole room.

We were eating dinner, and artillery fire was heard from Duling. One comrade mistook it for a tree falling. No one from Battalion Commander Liang's side contacted us. We were still wondering whether there had been any changes in the enemy's situation. But we were sure that the enemy would not dare to invade Sulao at night, because the terrain was not conducive to their night march, and we also had many troops here.

Everyone was extremely tired. At ten o'clock, we were already sleeping quietly. The night was dark and terrifying.

"No trace of the enemy in Mazha, Chen's regiment XX battalion gathered in Lanshi,... Dozens of enemy plainclothes teams were found below Duling. The team is being searched. The situation in Futian is unknown... This battalion will not move tonight." This was the information Battalion Commander Liang gave us. It was already midnight when it was delivered, but everyone got up to take turns looking at it.

### British Response to the Tianjin Incident: Preparing to Seek Peaceful Resolution; British Foreign Secretary Meets with Japanese Ambassador; British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee Continues Discussions

[Reuters, London, 20th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held another meeting this morning at 10 Downing Street, lasting an hour and a half, to further discuss the Far East situation caused by the blockade of Tianjin.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, visited the British Foreign Office this evening to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for an hour. Afterwards, neither side would comment on the details of the negotiations.

[Reuters, London, 20th] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, "Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax expressed Britain's stance to Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu yesterday, stating that it is difficult to accept Japan's unreasonable and extensive demands regarding the recent situation in Tianjin. The Foreign Secretary specifically pointed out the incidents of British women being violated and British citizens being forcibly stripped and searched, expressing the British government's inability to tolerate such incidents." The report also stated, "Any unreasonable steps taken by the Japanese side will be met with protests from the British government. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain has clearly indicated that if the Tokyo central authorities genuinely intend to restrain the provocative actions of Japanese troops in Tianjin, then Britain is also unwilling to expand the tense region. Before implementing economic retaliation, Britain is still giving the Japanese side an opportunity to resolve the matter locally, but unfortunately, this opportunity has not affected Japan's xenophobic and provocative behavior."

Chamberlain's Report to the House of Commons: Still Hoping for a Local Resolution

[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Far East situation, stating, "The blockade of the Tianjin concession continues, and all British citizens entering and leaving are being detained and subjected to strict searches, some of which are insulting and infuriating." Perishable foods and ice, among other things, are being subjected to strict inspections when being transported into the concession, causing delays under various pretexts. However, the transport of these items is becoming increasingly urgent. It is reported that ordinary supplies can be transported to markets near the French concession, and for the time being, there seems to be no need for special measures. However, more reliable information is currently being gathered from the British authorities in Tianjin regarding the matter. Chamberlain then explained that on the morning of June 10, two British merchant ships sailed directly to Tianjin along the Hai River and were not subjected to inspection. However, in general, British tugboats and barges are being detained and inspected by the Japanese side. The British Consul-General in Tianjin has lodged a protest, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also been instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government. The overall situation is not yet clear, but in reality, since the Japanese side raised the broad issue of general policy, their previous request for the extradition of the four Chinese has been muddled. The Japanese government has not yet sent a formal note to Britain, and it is hoped that a local resolution will be possible this time. The Prime Minister continued, "The British Imperial Government believes that the Japanese government must also hope to avoid expanding the scope of the dispute, which would only make the difficult situation more acute. At the same time, the British government is paying close attention to the reactions of the current events to other British and public concessions within China. Lord Halifax will meet with the Japanese Ambassador today, and Sir Robert Craigie in Tokyo is also trying to clarify the situation there. We are maintaining the closest contact with the French and American governments." Chamberlain then responded to Labour MP Henderson, stating that the British proposal to extradite the four suspects is still ready to be implemented. Eden then questioned whether the government had clearly guaranteed to all relevant parties that food and energy would be supplied to the British citizens in Tianjin. Chamberlain replied, "Yes, we are currently conducting inquiries and are prepared to implement any necessary measures to ensure the supply of food." Finally, he responded to Labour MP Baker, stating that the blockade of Gulangyu has not been lifted either.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The Under-Secretary of the Navy, Rear Admiral Wake Walker, reported to the House of Commons today that, given the draft of the Tianjin river, the largest British warship that can sail to Tianjin is HMS "Rosroyston," which is currently stationed in Tianjin. Therefore, under the current circumstances, considering sending other British warships, which are thirty miles from Tianjin, to Tianjin is useless. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler responded to Sörensen's suggestion that the Prime Minister should propose to U.S. President Roosevelt the organization of an international federation and a world parliament, saying, "Under the current circumstances, this suggestion does not seem appropriate." Labour MP Baring asked whether the British government had planned any special measures to ensure sufficient food supplies for the concessions in Tianjin and Gulangyu. Butler referred him to Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on the Tianjin issue and went on to say that the food situation in Gulangyu was not very serious, but the sources of firewood, meat, and vegetables were rather difficult. A food commission has been established in the Gulangyu concession, and it is hoped that food can be transported from other ports in Britain to provide assistance. Butler replied to Conservative MP Graham's question, "The British government denies that the Japanese have the right to arrest or detain British people under any circumstances. On this point, the Japanese government should have no doubt." In his question, Graham mentioned a statement by a Japanese spokesperson in Shanghai, stating that they reserve the right to impose punitive measures on any foreigners deemed to endanger the safety of Japanese troops in the occupied areas.

Hull Issues Statement: Expressing Close Attention

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Hull today formally expressed that the United States is extremely concerned about all "broad developments" in the Tianjin incident. He said that the U.S. Consul in Tianjin had offered to mediate. The original text of Hull's statement is as follows: "The U.S. government is not concerned about the cause of the Tianjin problem, namely Japan's request for the extradition of the four suspected Chinese. What the U.S. government is concerned about is the subsequent events of broad significance and the developments in other parts of China. The U.S. government is now paying special attention to the developments in China that are related to the U.S. on a daily basis." Hull then discussed the U.S. offer to mediate, stating that the scope of mediation was limited to the extradition of the four Chinese and was proposed before the lifting of the Tianjin blockade. He continued that Washington has not drafted any plans to evacuate American women and children residing in Tianjin.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Regarding Hull's statement, sources close to the State Department here said that its intention was to warn Japan that its strategy of alienating the United States from Britain and France would not succeed. This is because the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East are closely related. The Japanese spokesperson's attack on the concession system and the policies of Western countries in China, while Britain is bearing the brunt, the interests of the United States are also threatened and cannot be ignored. The U.S. government is still maintaining a detached attitude to facilitate mediation between Britain and Japan, although the hope that Japan will accept mediation is very slim. However, the State Department does not want to block the path to a peaceful resolution. Experienced observers said that the U.S. government's position in the Far East is very weak because Japan imports approximately three-quarters of its goods from the United States, and the cotton and other resources it needs are entirely purchased from the United States. Economic retaliation against Japan, if not joined by the United States, will have very little effect. If the United States participates, political figures fear that it will harm the country's peace. Most believe that the U.S. government should strive for a resolution between Britain and Japan and should only resort to economic pressure as a last resort. In addition, the impression that the United States advocated taking firm action at the beginning of the Manchurian Incident in 1931, but Britain did not agree to help, has not been forgotten by political figures. Therefore, there is no doubt about their suspicion of cooperation with the United States. Another group of people said that the Tianjin incident involves Britain and France more than the United States, and therefore, the United States should take a detached and observant attitude.

[Reuters, New York, 20th] U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement expressing concern about the broad developments in the Tianjin situation. The New York Times said, "The issuance of this statement is timely. The Japanese launched the Tianjin incident to directly challenge the entire structure of British interests in China. We also have treaties with China and should pay close attention to the methods and objectives of the Japanese attack, as well as its inherent significance."

British and American Media Continue to Demand Strong Action

[Reuters, London, 20th] The Daily Mail said today, "Britain should not compromise with the instigators of the Tianjin incident. If Tokyo does not have the strength or will to stop these instigators, then we have no choice but to take active steps to protect our interests."

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The Daily Telegraph reported that Japan's actions in Tianjin have provoked British protests. The British government should make it clear that if the Japanese central government can effectively curb the illegal actions of the Japanese local authorities in Tianjin, then the British government is unwilling to expand the situation. Therefore, before implementing economic sanctions against Japan, Japan is given another opportunity to resolve the matter locally. However, to this day, the government has not shown any signs of persuading the Tianjin local authorities to implement suppression, and instead, the movement against Western expatriates has expanded.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Today's Washington Star editorial stated that the situation caused by the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin affects the interests of the United States no differently than those of Britain and France, because the future of the economic interests of all countries in China depends on the outcome of this blockade. Tokyo clearly intends to use the Tianjin incident to settle accounts with democratic countries that oppose the "New Order in East Asia." Britain is now planning to take decisive measures to deal with it. It is difficult to say at this time to what extent the United States intends to support it. In short, the feelings of the American people regarding Japan's trampling of international rights in China have been expressed in public opinion polls. An increasing number of Americans advocate boycotting Japanese goods and banning the transport of military supplies to Japan. Furthermore, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew is currently here, and the U.S. government will surely be able to make wise decisions.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Today, various newspapers here continue to publish Tianjin news and write special articles to comment on it. Tillman wrote in the News Chronicle, "The wealth of the British concession, such as docks, warehouses, and valuable trade, is the true goal of the Japanese warlords. Unless the British concession belongs to Japan, the Japanese cannot claim North China as part of the Japanese Empire." The Manchester Guardian's New York correspondent reported that the situation in China remains the focus of American public opinion. Americans believe that Japan's pressure on the British concession in Tianjin is aimed at dealing with all Caucasians in Asia. In recent months, the U.S. attitude towards Japan has become much tougher. According to a survey a year ago, most Americans did not approve of suspending trade relations with Japan. Now, the opposite is true.

Roman Fascist Newspaper Heavily Reports on the Collapse of the Old Empire

[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Italian newspapers mostly "downplay" the situation in the Far East. Among the newspapers in Rome, only Il Fascista heavily reports on the Tianjin news, publishing the eye-catching headline "The Old Empire Collapses" on the front page.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] The Deutsche Zeitung discusses the British-Japanese dispute in Tianjin, while also mentioning the Danzig issue in the same breath, stating, "Moscow has gained the upper hand. Although Britain wants to turn the Tianjin dispute into a local event, the Soviet Union is linking it to the European convention issue, making it the center of international politics. Moscow is confident that once Britain has a disagreement, it can be manipulated by the Soviet Union in the European part. Ask, among British people, who has ever thought that they must fight for Danzig or Tianjin?"

### Troop Movements on the Czech Border; Germany Still Denies; Government Orders Young Students to Help with Rural Harvest Work

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] Today, German newspapers republished an authorized statement strongly denying the troop movements of German troops in Slovakia, Bohemia, and Moravia, as well as claims of German-Hungarian intentions to divide Slovakia. The statement said that, according to authoritative sources, the publication of such absurd rumors in foreign newspapers is clearly a meticulously considered plan to suit the basic work of the encirclement policy. In addition, the German government had previously summoned 25,000 students to help with rural harvest work, and now members of the Hitler Youth are also being summoned to participate in this work.

### Endless Hidden Dangers in American Labor-Management Disputes; Losses of 700 Billion Yuan in Six Years; Democratic System in Great Danger of Collapse

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th] On Monday (19th), the U.S. Senate's "Committee on Improving Labor-Management Relations" released a report stating that since 1933, the United States has suffered losses of no less than 7,000,000,000 yuan due to strikes and other labor disputes. If this situation is allowed to drag on, the American democratic system will soon be in danger of collapse. Therefore, it is currently necessary to find another way to solve the labor problem, otherwise, a centralized government controlling the economic system will be inevitable.

### London Stores Purchase Large Quantities of Japanese Goods; British Newspapers Unanimously Criticize

[Reuters, London, 19th] The "Food Weekly" here recently published an article stating that several British stores purchased 680,000 cases of Japanese canned fish last week, valued at £1.75 million. This transaction was due to Britain's preparation to store food. The Purchasing Department of the Ministry of Commerce said that they had not heard of this transaction. Newspapers wrote articles questioning why this huge amount of money was not used for the badly affected British fishing industry, but instead was used for the largest commercial rogue nation in history.

### German-Bulgarian Negotiations to Strengthen Economic Relations

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] Bulgarian Finance Minister Ivan Popov arrived here on Monday to negotiate with the German authorities to strengthen the economic relations between the two countries.

### British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses British-Soviet Negotiations; Officials Deny Including the Far East; Rumor that the British Side Has New Instructions

[Reuters, London, 20th] The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee continued to meet at 10 Downing Street this morning. It is reported that the British-Soviet negotiations currently underway in Moscow were also discussed.

[Reuters, London, 20th] It is rumored that the talks between Strang and Molotov yesterday included the Far East issue, but officials here declared today that this statement is absolutely inaccurate, and pointed out that the British-Soviet negotiations are purely based on European issues.

[London 20th Radio Broadcast Message] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday, "British-Soviet negotiations are still underway in Moscow. Last Thursday afternoon, the British and French Ambassadors to the Soviet Union, along with Strang, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, visited Molotov. British Ambassador Seeds explained the latest British and French proposals to Mr. Molotov. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Molotov met with the British and French representatives again and put forward some of the Soviet Union's views on the British and French proposals." Mr. Chamberlain then stated that the main differences between Britain and the Soviet Union were not limited to the status of the Baltic states. A member asked, "Are the instructions granted to Seeds by the British government broad enough to make it unnecessary for Seeds to seek instructions from London again?" He replied, "This must be determined based on the situation of the negotiations. New focal points may arise during the negotiation process, thus requiring instructions, but I do not know of any new focal points at present."

[Reuters, London, 20th] The News Chronicle said, "The government must know that under these circumstances, the British-Soviet agreement must be concluded as soon as possible. Prime Minister Chamberlain reiterated in the House of Commons yesterday that British-Soviet negotiations are still in progress, and the time for success is not far away."

[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] This morning, the newspapers here did not explain the reason for the sudden postponement of the British-Soviet negotiations, which were originally scheduled to be held yesterday. The Daily Telegraph denied that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds had received new instructions from the British government, and said that rumors that the Latvian Ambassador to Britain had met with the Head of the Eastern European Department of the Foreign Office yesterday, and that this was related to the British-Soviet negotiations, were also inaccurate. However, the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Express said that the British Embassy in the Soviet Union did receive new instructions from the government, the content of which was to suggest accepting the Soviet Union's request to guarantee the Baltic states. The report also said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations in the House of Commons at the end of the week.

German-Soviet Trade Agreement

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] Since the return of German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Count Schulenburg to Berlin, rumors about German-Soviet negotiations have been rampant. However, German political figures say that German-Soviet commercial relations remain the same as before, and the trade in goods between the two countries is quite smooth.

### British Special Envoy Stationed in Czechoslovakia; Eden Raises Questions in the House of Commons; Butler Does Not Answer

[Haitong News Agency, London, England, Day] British Foreign Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons on Monday that Britain had requested the German government to issue a "service permit" for the British Consul-General to be stationed in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Britain's opinion was also solemnly stated by Mr. Butler, but the attitude towards the recognition of the Bohemian and Moravian Protectorate remained unchanged. Former Foreign Secretary Eden, a Conservative MP, then questioned Mr. Butler, "How does the French government still recognize the Czech Ambassador to France?" Mr. Butler refused to answer.

### Polish Government Rejects Unreasonable Demands from Nazi Danzig

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 20th] According to a report from a semi-official British news agency today, the Polish government sent a reply to the Danzig parliament rejecting its appeal as inaccurate. The Danzig parliament recently protested to the Polish government against the increase in Polish customs officers and the activities of various tax officers.

Short Commentary

### Respect Public Opinion

Today's report from Guilin in this newspaper stated that the Military Affairs Commission issued a general order to all civil and military officials across the country to respect public opinion, public lives, and use public resources and finances with caution. This is truly a very important order! Originally, since the War of Resistance, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the wise central government, China's politics have made leaps and bounds. The government has repeatedly ordered that public opinion be respected and civil governance be promoted, and the people's support for the government and national unity has presented an unprecedentedly good atmosphere! However, there are still some localities that have not yet understood or faithfully implemented this, and Wang Jingwei and a small number of traitorous and backward elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord, doing all kinds of evil. This kind of countercurrent is naturally beneficial to × and harmful to the cause of resistance and national construction. The current general order from the Central Military Affairs Commission is a major blow to × people and traitors! We, the people, should further interpret it widely, persuade and encourage each other, redouble our efforts, support the government, and revive the nation.

"××"

### Clan Fighting

A report from Boluo stated that dozens of villages in the Su Village area of Boluo, including Puxin, have recently engaged in clan fighting, dividing themselves into red and white flag factions. The previous day, while they were fighting each other, several × planes happened to fly over. Mistaking them for guerrilla teams, they immediately flew low and carried out machine gun strafing. This time, the atrocities of the × planes will probably prompt the feuding factions to wake up! This time, the Japanese × invasion of China, humiliating our Guangdong people, is particularly cruel and inhumane. Is there any greater hatred in the world than this?

### Finland Shaken by International Contention; Rumor that the Chairman of the National Defense Council Has Resigned; British Military Officials Visit

[Haitong News Agency, Finland, Helsinki, 20th] The local "Uusi Suomi" newspaper published an "Extra" edition on Monday afternoon, stating that General Mannerheim, Chairman of the National Defense Council, had submitted his resignation to Finnish Prime Minister A. K. Cajander. When asked if this statement was reliable, Mr. Cajander replied that he had not received Mr. Mannerheim's resignation. The Finnish official news agency had not yet been able to obtain confirmation of the news by Monday evening, as all cabinet members were resting outside the capital. However, political circles still believe that Mr. Mannerheim has indeed resigned, and the reason for his resignation may be related to the Åland Islands issue. It is noteworthy that Mr. Mannerheim had invited British "Home Forces Inspector General" Lieutenant-General Sir Robert H. Haining to dinner on Monday, and Sir Robert had just arrived in the Finnish capital from the Swedish capital on Sunday. Upon his arrival, Finnish Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko and various army generals welcomed Sir Robert. After unpacking, Sir Robert formally visited various Finnish authorities, attended Foreign Minister Erkko's banquet on Sunday evening, and inspected various equipment of the Finnish Defense Forces on Monday.

### Account of a Duel with Little Mussolini

Blood Splattered Across the Sky

September 28, 1937. American volunteer in the Spanish government forces, Mr. Trick Dickinson, engaged in an aerial duel with Bruno Mussolini, the eldest son of Mussolini. The following is Dickinson's report.

I fought in Spain for a total of sixteen months. In the autumn of 1937, I was the leader of the "Red Wing" squadron in Gastron. At that time, Little Mussolini also commanded a squadron of the Nationalist Air Force, stationed in Palma, facing us from afar.

It was at the end of August, one evening, I learned from Colonel Reyes, my superior, that Little Mussolini had broadcast on the Nationalist radio, challenging five government aircraft to a duel. Perhaps this was Little Mussolini's way of boosting morale. Unexpectedly, the duel finally took place.

I immediately sent a telegram, volunteering to fight Little Mussolini alone. Later, I sent another telegram urging him. Finally, ten days later, I received his reply:

"I accept Captain Dickinson's proposal. The single combat is set for noon on September 28th, at the center of the battlefield between the two armies, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Each side will bring two reconnaissance aircraft. Absolutely no participation in the battle is allowed. After the two sides meet, they will perform a loop to indicate the start of the battle. When one side admits defeat, they can tie their gloves to a long scarf and throw it out. Please agree to abide by all the above points. Bruno Mussolini."

After that, I did not make any special preparations. My plane was a Soviet Boeing, with 1,050 horsepower, equipped with four twin-barreled Vickers machine guns, and two electrically controlled machine guns on the wings.

That day arrived. Four comrades departed first in two reconnaissance planes. A quarter of an hour later, I also bravely advanced towards Palma.

It was noon. Four reconnaissance planes were circling above me. In the direction of the Nationalist forces, a black dot appeared. That was Little Mussolini, coming in a 1,300-horsepower monoplane.

We simultaneously flew in a large circle and then inverted once, and then the close combat began. What I saw were sparks from the enemy's machine guns, what I heard was the shriek of bullets passing by my ears, and what I felt on my body was the vibration of bullets hitting the wings. We charged at each other, engaging at close quarters, only inches apart.

The two planes separated, followed by semi-circular rolls, at extremely close range. I could clearly make out all the features on Mussolini's face. I took a breath, turned my plane, and charged into battle again.

The next fifteen minutes were even more intense, because the various maneuvers were too fast, and I could hardly remember them clearly. But I felt that whatever maneuver he did, I must do the same or better. The enemy plane had 250 more horsepower than mine, so speed helped him a lot.

My plane was shaking very badly. Soviet planes could not be overloaded with excessive weight and horsepower, which greatly affected my aim.

Ascending, descending, circling, rolling – these were continuous movements in a matter of seconds. The speed of the movement caused the blood in my limbs to stagnate, and the air hit my body with unrelenting force. The sound of the engine and machine guns numbed my brain, until I lost my hearing.

In my experience, I had never been the target of so many bullets.

We were descending – 14,000 feet, 11,000, 8,000... Our reconnaissance planes were also circling, watching.

Suddenly, I discovered a wound on my left arm, and blood was spurting out. I immediately descended, which was actually a mistake, because Mussolini was right behind me, pouring lead bullets into me!

I tried my best to balance myself, stopping the engine's forward motion, and side-slipped. When the enemy plane rushed past, I delivered a blow. This time, I saw that I hit him, because his plane swayed. Afterwards, I heard that his leg was injured – although we had no way to confirm it – I think he was hit by a bullet at this time. But within a second, he was back.

5,000 feet, 4,000, 3,000. Eighteen minutes, twenty minutes, we continued to fight hand-to-hand. At that time, I was hungry and exhausted. Bullets broke my instruments, and glass hit my face. I thought I was going to fail. But I seized the last opportunity, and untied my scarf at the same time.

I pretended to circle, turning to the top. At that time, I was a huge target for him. I reduced myself to the smallest possible position, anticipating that lead bullets would shatter my body, but nothing happened. When I finished turning, I got the opportunity. The enemy plane was such a big target for my machine guns, it felt like a house. My heart was beating even harder, and my fingers began to tighten on the machine guns, firing a fierce burst. Then I saw his hand raise, and a black object was thrown from his plane, unfurling a long white tail – a scarf and gloves!

I was relieved that he didn't know I was almost going to do the same thing as him.

As I leveled off, I saw him waving, tilting his plane forward, as a sign of respect. Then we parted ways and went back.

In the 22-minute aerial battle, my plane had 326 bullet holes. I was lucky to have only suffered one arm injury. After that, Bruno Mussolini was no longer the captain of the Palma Air Force.

### Weather Forecast

Yesterday, the police announced the results of their investigation: From May 28th to June 15th, there were twelve robbery cases in three weeks – not counting theft cases, of course – involving sixty-seven thieves, resulting in nineteen deaths and injuries, and a loss of over three thousand yuan. (Space) However, compared to the previous period, the number has already decreased, presumably due to the hot weather and the effectiveness of the anti-crime efforts.

It is said that in Hong Kong, when buying chickens and ducks, one must carry them in one's arms and is not allowed to carry them by the feet, because that is animal cruelty.

According to newspaper reports, there are now people criticizing explorers for capturing pandas, considering it a cruel act. Excellent, excellent.

Now, I would like to make a suggestion to support the protection of livestock. That is, please, people in Hong Kong, simply don't eat beef, don't eat chickens and ducks, and certainly don't eat cats.

Everyone knows how numerous, fierce, and ruthless the rats in Hong Kong are. Regarding this, one gentleman put forward a reason, saying: There are already very few cats here. As a result, they are still cooked into "Dragon Tiger Fight" and used by gentlemen to fill their stomachs. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer cats, and more and more rats, which are becoming more and more rampant and uncontrollable. Whether this statement is true is unknown; I will just say it for what it's worth, and record it for what it's worth.

### Ghost

Four people were chatting late at night in an old house. Suddenly, they started talking about ghosts. One person said: It is said that a ghost's chin is soft. So, everyone made a commotion, joking around and touching each other's chins. The youngest of them blushed and refused to let anyone touch him. Of course, they were even more determined to touch him. But when they touched his chin, it was as soft as cotton. The three were greatly frightened and rushed out of the door. They only heard many people laughing heartily in the room.

### Statistics

Do you know the losses of the last war? Here are some statistics for you. Human casualties: 10,000,000 people killed in action; 4,000,000 people "missing" – a euphemism for death without burial; 6,500,000 people seriously injured; 14,000,000 people slightly injured.

The material destruction of the war reached $40,000,000,000,000. If the United States' war expenses were distributed, every family in the United States could build a $5,000 house and buy a $500 piece of land. In addition, they would still have $1,000 left over to use as they pleased.

Please Criticize. Contributions Welcome.

### After Adjustment of Exchange Rate, Export of Domestic Goods Is Expected to Increase Sharply. Successful Management of Southwest Customs Leads to Trade Surplus. Trade Deficit of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs May Be Reduced Hereafter.

Astonishing Value of Imported Foreign Goods

In terms of imported foreign goods, from January to April of this year, the first category was cereals and cereal flours, valued at 59,196,000 yuan; the second was candles, soap, oils, fats, waxes, rosin, valued at 42,246,000 yuan; the third was cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, valued at 40,039,000 yuan; the fourth was sundries, valued at 22,413,000 yuan; the fifth was metals and mineral sands, valued at 20,065,800 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, except for a decrease in sundries and metals and mineral sands, the cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread category actually increased by 37,427,000 yuan.

Adjusting Exchange Rates to Encourage Exports

Since our government adjusted the exchange rate and HSBC and other British banks restricted the supply of black market foreign exchange, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange has tightened, which can reduce the import of useless foreign goods, and the trade deficit of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs will naturally be eliminated. The export of our country's main domestic goods can be increased. The government, in addition to striving to increase the production of tung oil, medicinal materials, mineral sands, silk, cotton, and other goods, also designates the Trade Commission, etc., to be responsible for control and centralized export from Hong Kong and other places. For the export of domestic goods that settle foreign exchange, in addition to exemption from export tax and transit tax, the Central Trust Bureau will also provide insurance on behalf of various insurance companies.

Stabilization Committee Responsible for Maintenance

The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is determined to continue to maintain the Shanghai black market foreign exchange with all its strength, to ensure that the price is far from the break-even point. At the same time, HSBC and the committee are working together to stabilize the exchange rate of the Shanghai black market. For importers with legitimate needs, they will still provide as much foreign exchange as possible. Other banks such as The Mercantile Bank, Citibank, etc., are also taking the same action. Therefore, the exchange rate of the Shanghai black market has stabilized and will not collapse again. The statutory foreign exchange price of the Central Bank remains the same and has not changed in the slightest.

### Sea Adventures 10

— By Captain Lao, Translated by Yang Bi

Summary of Previous Chapter: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kailong Boqi" was carrying eight million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Qiukes Company, and the mechanic Bill also took this opportunity to travel to Europe. On the ship, when Jack was acting as the wireless operator, he received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wildly without a destination. Soon, a message came over the radio that there was an iceberg nearby. Passengers demanded that the speed be reduced, but the captain refused...

"We have already detected the iceberg, perhaps they will fire a steam horn to deal with that mountain with the echo."

"They won't fire the steam horn tonight. The captain has decided that we cannot reveal any traces, fearing that the cruiser will know our direction. I'm going to take a walk on the deck. Anyway, if anything comes on the radio, the bell will ring. Will you come with me?"

"Okay, but it's hardly an evening for a stroll."

"In any case, it's better than knowing nothing and squatting in this cabin!"

"You seem very excited, Jack."

"It's not entirely for myself. Just think, this several-thousand-ton steel ship is flying at twenty-four knots, with an iceberg ahead. Isn't that madness?"

"Come on, at sea, what the captain says is law, there's no arguing. We can only hope for the best."

On the lower deck, there were piles of passengers huddled behind the thick curtains that shielded the light. On the upper deck, however, there were only Jack and Bill. Although they tried to talk about other things, they kept thinking about the iceberg. Looking at the darkness ahead, and the ship drilling into the darkness like a bullet, they felt a ghostly feeling all around.

Time passed moment by moment. The fog did not lighten. Although it was August weather, the cold air penetrated to the bone. Jack and Bill had almost decided to return to the cabin, when suddenly the lookout at the front let out a sharp cry. Involuntarily, Bill grabbed Jack's arm. This tense situation far exceeded what they had expected to encounter.

In an instant, death seemed to have arrived. In the fog, vaguely, a huge white specter could be seen. It stood upright, almost reaching the ship's mast, appearing to be a wall hanging in front of the ship.

A great cry immediately rose on the deck, followed by a rough echo. On the passenger decks below, a woman let out a piercing scream, followed by frightened cries. In just a moment, a slight tremor, followed by a long and violent shudder, threatened the ship's hull. This large iceberg had obviously split open. But, in fact, the ship miraculously only suffered slight friction on both sides and drifted past safely, continuing on its journey after reducing its speed a little.

"We escaped death!" Jack shouted after the iceberg disappeared into the dense fog.

"Really, I thought we were done for," Bill said miserably. "This little incident really took a lot of effort, cough!"

The frightened crowd on the lower deck broke out in an uproar. Now, it was possible to hear a hysterical woman shouting, sharply and forcefully. It was presumed that she was yelling at a crew member, who was trying to calm them down, but the people who had suffered sudden fright were making a clamor.

"They're coming this way!" Jack suddenly shouted. Footsteps could be heard rushing up, quickly reaching the position of the wireless cabin. "Bill, quickly, we are at the forefront."

"Yes! If this group runs to the lifeboats, they will run around like crazy ghosts. What about us?"

"Run to the wireless room. In the desk drawer, for safety, there are two pistols, one is Bofu's, and one is mine. Hurry!"

Bill didn't need long to get there this time. But, in the instant he left, these panicked passengers had almost crossed the long corridor and run to the lifeboats. Jack stood in front.

"Calm down, everyone!" He shouted loudly. "There is no danger."

### One Person a Day

The Soviet Union still seems to be a rather mysterious country, and many people want to explore it. Here is a story, whether it is true or false, the source is not responsible.

Once upon a time, an American reporter arrived in Moscow. He visited red officials.

He first met Comrade Simonov, a respectable figure. There was just one strange thing: a large spittoon was placed right on his desk, which was really puzzling to him.

"Comrade Simonov," the reporter asked, "please forgive me for asking, but why do you put this thing on your desk?"

He didn't know that this question actually made Simonov furious. "That's my spittoon!" he shouted. "I can put it wherever I like!"

In Comrade Li Nuozhi's office, a chair was hanging from the ceiling. The inquisitive reporter asked again. Comrade Li also became furious. "That's my chair," he said angrily. "I like to put it like this."

Finally, the reporter went to see Stalin. He asked about the strange actions of these officials.

"Ah, don't pay attention to them," Stalin said with a smile. "Those people are fools."

"But if they are fools," the reporter did not let up, "how can they be officials?"

This sentence also made Stalin's hair stand on end with anger.

"They are my fools," he roared. "I put them where I like!" Hitler's Four-Year Plan

### Fellow Townsman

— Geng Zhi

A certain organization where people of a certain surname swarm like bees and ants can be called a "Surname Ancestral Hall." Similarly, a certain organization where people from a certain region gather like maggots and flies can be called a "Hometown Association" or "Regional Guild Hall."

The creation of such "Hometown Associations" or "Guild Halls" is, of course, due to those in higher positions not forgetting their origins and offering assistance. Examples from the past include the Warden of Sishui Pavilion arranging positions for people from Fengpei and Gushui. Recent examples include the Dog Meat General providing opportunities for barbers and foot masseuses from Yexian County. Thus, within these "Associations," if you're not royalty, you're bound to be a high-ranking official or nobleman wearing a yellow jacket. Then, they call upon their friends and relatives, creating a pure and magnificent spectacle. When Liu An attained enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascended to immortality. If you're not a chicken or a dog, don't even think about getting involved. If you, with your dignified seven-foot frame, try to replace the chickens and dogs, it's even more impossible, and you'd be lucky to escape without being pecked or bitten. After all, Liu An belongs to them, not to you!

The unity of those with the same surname is the backbone of a patriarchal society. Similarly, the support of those from the same hometown is a vestige of the feudal system. I can't bear to say that a patriarchal society is wrong. Similarly, how dare I say that the feudal system is bad? Furthermore, erudite scholars often use present-day examples to prove that the feudal system is not entirely wrong, and the existence of hometown relationships is both inevitable and necessary. They say:

When Chinese people go abroad, all Chinese people are fellow townsmen in that foreign country. In the future, when people from Earth go to Mars or any other planet, people from Earth will be fellow townsmen on that planet. When people from the solar system go to another star system, people from our solar system will be fellow townsmen in that other star system. When people from this universe go to another universe, people from this universe will be fellow townsmen in that other universe... So, to narrow it down and make it more immediate, within an organization, recognizing someone as a fellow townsman instantly creates a sense of closeness. And the belief that those not of our kind are sure to be of a different mind is not surprising.

Sometimes, I want to be a spoilsport and say, since we are all fellow townsmen within the same universe, or to put it more simply, since all Chinese people are fellow townsmen, isn't such a large "hometown" good enough? Why must we insist on these small "hometowns" where we are doing a temple in a snail shell? The scholars retort that this is a division of labor, accumulating drops to form a bag: with small hometowns, it's naturally easier to combine them into a large hometown; everyone organizes small hometowns, excluding those who are not fellow townsmen: the way of the ancient kings, this is beautiful. Once they bring up the ancient kings, I can only remain silent because I am, after all, a modern person and don't understand the ancient kings.

However, the human heart is, after all, made of flesh. Thinking about all the good things that hometown associations do, it's truly impossible to ignore them. For example, hometown associations have mortuaries, so you won't be left without a place to be buried when you die. Hometown associations transport coffins, so you'll be able to return to your homeland after death, your soul returning to your ancestral graves… The Chinese, who traditionally pay attention to posthumous glory, must rely on hometown associations to be able to die in peace. So, who knows, maybe these concrete, microcosmic "hometown associations," these certain organizations, might not only place the living but also the dead? We should especially praise their boundless merits on this point.

Because fellow townsmen offer so many benefits, most people like to recognize fellow townsmen. If there is a big shot or any famous person among the fellow townsmen, that is naturally their glory, especially something to boast about to everyone they meet. Neighboring provinces are also fellow townsmen. Within a province, those from the same prefecture, district, or special region are fellow townsmen. The starting point of a hometown is originally the county, but when necessary, the definition is expanded. Even when there is only the name of fellow townsman without the reality, people still keep saying "fellow townsman, fellow townsman." It seems that the term "fellow townsman" is truly mesmerizing.

"Su Xiao from Qiantang is a fellow kinsman," "kinsman" means "fellow townsman," "Hou Shi Weng" was so delighted about it. "Fellow countrymen" going on stage in Tianjin, won so much welcome, "Stopping the boat to ask each other, perhaps we are fellow countrymen," sweet voice, seeing his personality…

However, you may want to recognize him as a fellow townsman, but he refuses to recognize you as a fellow townsman. This happens a lot. The reason is that you are obviously down on your luck, and he is obviously successful. You will be a detriment to him, so of course, he won't acknowledge you. Gongsun Hong of the Han Dynasty sighed and said: "I'd rather meet a nasty guest than an old friend," which is the same principle. And those who betray fellow townsmen to curry favor are not unheard of. It is said that in the past, imperial censors often impeached their relatives, old friends, and fellow townsmen, because only they knew the details of their fellow townsmen's wrongdoings and could avoid errors based on hearsay…

Writing this far, I can't help but feel a chill about fellow townsmen. What should I do?

### In the Mountain Hollow

— Li Qiao

——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou

After walking through that wheat field, ahead was a dangerous pass flanked by bare, bald rocky mountains. Next to the pass stood a high mountain covered with green grass—so majestic and perilous that if the enemy had just one machine gun positioned there, we could never pass through the valley. But they were blocking the mountain peaks in front of the highway, thinking we would definitely follow the highway, unaware that we were detouring through this route.

Just as we were walking through the narrow pass, suddenly a plane came chasing after us from behind. Everyone was anxious and wanted to disperse quickly, but in this rugged valley with no cover, scattering was impossible. There was no choice but to be bold and ignore it, continuing to move forward dispersed.

After passing through the pass, we sat at the foot of a mountain, waiting for Division Commander Zhang, who was behind us. An endless stream of troops emerged from the pass like a flood, blurring our vision. Suddenly, three heavy bombers flew over, making a terrifying, deep sound. The men and horses scattered and lay prone beside the road and in the wheat fields. But some of the men and horses had nowhere to hide and could only squat on the road, letting the horses eat the grass by the roadside.

The three heavy bombers, gleaming in the sunset, leisurely circled in the sky, flying over the pass and suddenly swooping down.

Boom! Boom!

A burst of fire erupted, followed by a thin plume of black smoke that drifted in the sky and slowly disappeared.

The mountains and fields were unusually silent. Only the monotonous buzzing sound echoed.

After circling once, the three heavy bombers flew to the front, not far away, and a long series of explosions rang out like thunder:

——Boom! Boom! Boom!…

A plane flew back, suddenly descending and swooping over the wheat field with half its wings tilted, strafing:

——Da-da-da-da…

Following the brothers of the Special Service Company, we lay neatly at the foot of the mountain, watching helplessly as the three planes, full of arrogance and shame, patrolled madly in the sky, our hearts filled with extreme anger!

The sun set, the sky was gloomy, and the night crept to the far side of the fields, appearing somewhat hazy. Only then did the three planes fly away.

The brothers who had been lying by the roadside and in the wheat fields, resting enough, got up, smiles on their faces:

"Damn it, they come to bomb us every day, but they never manage to kill us!"

"Those big liars, after bombing us today, I wonder how they'll tell their people: How many of us they killed today!"

"Their people are so pitiful! Their hard-earned money is just used by their warlords to buy bombs and drop them on our land, and they are deceived by their propaganda every day. What injustice!"

Treading on the vast twilight, along an uneven dirt road, the troops set off again.

### The Pit (Part 2)

— Dian Chang

He was wailing and singing up there, so unpleasant, so miserably…

At this time, only my shoulders were showing above ground; looking ahead, a blood-red sun hung in the sky, empty and deserted…I started to get worried, wiped the sweat from my forehead, and dug, dug, dug.

Now, my body was completely buried in the pit, only my head was above ground. Dig, dig, my hands were already a bit sore. Damn it!

I shivered and pretended to dig, dig, stealing a glance and seeing him hand over the shredded banknotes, putting on a demonic face. I ignored him. He stomped his feet and muttered as he paced past. I couldn't help cursing under my breath and raised the shovel casually. Whoosh, mud splattered over, and some even landed on the guy's leggings. He turned his head sharply, retreated a few steps hurriedly, cowering, clutching the gun tightly, and pulled the trigger…but then didn't, just grumbling hatefully. I couldn't help but suppress a laugh, bent down to dig, dig; I thought about raising the shovel again, splashing him all over his head and face, but I didn't do it this time.

I looked ahead and saw two legs moving over, so I bent down again to dig, dig; suddenly, with a pat, he turned away again, the sound of footsteps gradually fading from my ears. I then breathed a sigh of relief and pushed all the mud behind me, piling it higher and higher on the ground.

I thought, if that guy came from behind and kicked me a few times, sweeping all the mud down, I would be completely buried here.

The sweat flowed from my forehead. Was this really digging my own father's grave? Is this my tomb? Sigh, the more I thought about it, the more frightened I became…So, I hurriedly turned my head, raised up on tiptoe, and looked around. Then, I busily carved the pit wall, desperately digging out a few mud steps.

After a while, I heard a faint sound of footsteps nearby. So, I pressed myself tightly against the pit wall, stepped on the pit wall with my right foot, looked over the ground, and saw that the guy's legs suddenly turned slightly backwards, but then stopped again.

I immediately stepped up a step, my heart jumping and jumping, but I saw that the guy was holding his rifle, aiming at someone running towards him.

"Bang—" The gunshot pierced the long sky. I hurriedly ducked down, waited a while, then used the shovel to prop myself up and look. The two legs in front were shaking and retreating. The guy's knees buckled to the sides once, then straightened again, and he stood still.

"Bang—" I thought that the person who was running was finished, so I lay on the pit wall and listened quietly. The sound of leather boots rubbing against the ground was very clear. I tiptoed again, and the two trembling legs were only five or six feet away from my head. Suddenly, I became excited unconsciously. Quickly climbing up from the pit wall, I rolled onto the ground. But the guy immediately turned his head, stabbing at me with his rifle like a mad dog.

"Bang—" My vision went black, and braving the gunfire, I stood up mightily, taking the opportunity to swing the shovel and strike him on the shoulder with force. He fell down stiffly.

I wiped the sweat from my forehead and smiled proudly at this horizontal yellow candle. I looked into the distance again, and the person who was walking this way.

"Haha, is that Lu Ci A Ba?" I saw that it was him and called out, "I saved your life!"

He walked closer slowly, holding a Mauser pistol in his hand, and said calmly, "I've been watching you dig your grave for quite some time. Now, bury him."

So, I went over to take a closer look, and the ground was covered in blood. I looked to see how deep the wound on his shoulder was - this was my masterpiece, such a powerful strike.

But there wasn't even a tear in the guy's clothes on his shoulder, and blood was gushing from his back.

I then understood and greeted Lu Ci A Ba with shame:

"I was digging a grave for the grandson for a long time, I'm really tired: thank you, help me carry it to that pit, okay?"

### A Truth

— Shi Di

If there was no truth in the world, I would add this one: if there are already many truths, I only believe in this one: "Will is the first life of mankind."

If I had not established this belief in my heart long ago, I might have committed suicide because of that setback two years ago; if it weren't for the encouragement of this sentence, I would have been surprised to ask myself: why haven't I shed a single tear for a disappointing thing in recent years?

Currently, countless people have lost their homes, but they don't complain to anyone. They feel that in these difficult times, perseverance and fighting spirit are more precious than gaining the sympathy of others.

Friends! If you believe this is a truth, you should continue to believe it. If you don't know it yet, then please think it over carefully.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Cai Huanping

7.  Hanzhong Permeated with Wartime Atmosphere

Hanzhong (Nanzheng), which I yearned for during the four days of arduous travel and couldn't wait to reach even a minute earlier, finally arrived at 3 p.m. on the 14th. I jumped off the bus, handed in the ticket, and carried my luggage out of the station. At the station gate was the military police's luggage inspection station. I said to a military policeman:

"Excuse me, please inspect my luggage!"

I put my suitcase down and wanted to open the lock. I don't know what power made him believe me, he said:

"Alright, you can go out!"

At this moment, another military policeman was inspecting the luggage of three students who came with me, opening their books one by one to look at them. He said:

"I know you students can't bring anything with you. I just want to check what books you are reading. Because there are many books that you don't know are prohibited."

After leaving the station, I took a rickshaw south into the city. Looking at the city walls, they were still quite solid. The city gate had double walls. Like other cities in the north, there was a three-story ancient-style gate tower above the city gate, with the four large characters "Yongliang Lock" written on it. After entering the city gate, I stayed at the Fuxing Grand Hotel on the right side. There are many hotels and inns; this is a better one. It is a two-story wooden building with fresh paint. The rooms are divided into special rooms upstairs, costing $1.50 per day; Class A rooms upstairs cost $1 per day. Class B rooms downstairs cost 80 cents per day; Class C rooms cost 60 cents per day. Quilts are charged separately, at 10 cents each. I stayed in a single room upstairs, with only a wooden bed frame, using wheat straw as a mattress, without a pillow: a long table, also used as a washbasin stand, and a wooden hanger. The four walls are covered with patterned paper, still fairly clean; there is a wooden lattice window, covered with thin paper instead of glass; facing the city wall, the light and air are not bad. Compared to the inns in Mianyang County and Guangyuan County that cost 20 cents a night, this is like heaven.

I toured the city for a week. The shops are still all wooden bungalows, the roads are quite narrow and also broken. There are quite a few watch shops, including a branch of Heng De Li; there are also many photo studios, and they are decorated most luxuriously; are the people here very fond of weddings and taking pictures? There are also many clothing stores and laundry shops. There are three or four bookstores, such as Shenghuo and Bingxue, but there are not many books. The citizens' clothing seems slightly better than what I saw along the way; along the street, I saw soldiers wearing grass-green uniforms; perhaps there are many civil servants working here. Occasionally, I saw women dressed neatly. Also, because this place is in the middle of the North China and Central China battlefields, closer to the front lines; and because of the reasons of war, anti-Japanese slogans and comics are written and posted all over the streets. The anti-war atmosphere seems to be much stronger than in Chengdu. In several places along the road, I saw a pile of ruins and rubble, and workers were still excavating. (To be continued)

Special Report

### Representatives from Various Circles of Relief Associations Present a Banner Yesterday, Sending Off the China Salvation Drama Troupe, Wishing Everyone Well, See You Again at Work

— Qi Zhuo

Although "welcoming and sending off" is a "routine matter" in social interactions, the sincerity of the heart has different degrees.

As soon as the China Salvation Drama Troupe arrived in Hong Kong, the climax of welcome surged up. What did the China Salvation Drama Troupe rely on to win such care from overseas Chinese? The answer is very simple: they overcame the lifestyle that should be promoted in the great era, sharing joys and sorrows with soldiers and the people. In serious work, they humbly learned. They used drama and all possible methods to touch tens of millions of soldiers and civilians in the north and south battlefields for twenty months. — Such a group that was born for the war of resistance and grew up in the war of resistance, full of enthusiasm and strength, won people's love, and it was not accidental.

For two months, the life attitude and mutual expression of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" in Hong Kong proved that they did not live up to the expectations of the welcomers. At the very least, the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" spiritually influenced upward-minded compatriots, making people deeply experience the strict discipline. Strict life, high enthusiasm, and correct understanding are indispensable elements for forming a sound group. In terms of drama movement, "China Salvation Drama Troupe" made people deeply realize the great role of national defense drama that reflects and promotes the era, giving a strong encouragement to drama workers and an opportunity for reflection to those who still have prejudices against national defense drama.

Therefore, when "China Salvation Drama Troupe" is about to go abroad to continue propaganda, "sending off" is more meaningful, and the send-off party has a higher degree of sincerity.

Various Circles of Relief Associations held a joint meeting with various overseas countries at the library on the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 1 pm yesterday to send off and hold a banner presentation ceremony to strengthen the trip and encourage those who come.

Those who participated in the farewell party included Li [missing name] from the Journalists Association, Liu Qing [missing name] from the Women's War Relief Association, Fei Zhaoruolan from the Young Women's Association, Xiong Maozhao and Su Anping from the Women's New Movement Association, Chen Lanfang [missing name] from the Zhisheng Charity, Lin Xingsheng from the Dongzhisheng Hospital, and Lin Peisheng from the Federation of Trade Unions.  The China Salvation Drama Troupe included head Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and all the troupe members, totaling dozens of people, gathered together, which was very lively. Although the weather was very hot, they enjoyed chatting with each other, and their hearts were very comforted. After refreshments, Chairman Li Jianfeng first delivered a speech, saying that today's meeting is both a reception and a farewell party. We are standing on the front line of national salvation today, and we are all members of the national salvation work, so today can be said to be an intimate meeting of workers. In today's environment, we only need to identify our goals and work together, diligently, hard, and painstakingly. Huang Zhaoruolan then spoke, praising the troupe's work and the dedication of the members.

Jin Shan and Wang Ying stood up and gave replies one after another, saying that the troupe passed through Hong Kong on this trip abroad and stayed for two months. Seeing that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are very enthusiastic about the work of saving the country, they feel very happy. After going abroad, they will definitely publicize the enthusiastic situation of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong in saving the country to overseas Chinese everywhere, so that they can encourage each other. During the troupe's stay in Hong Kong, they have been welcomed and praised by all circles of overseas Chinese, and they feel ashamed. In the future, they will continue to work hard to repay the love of compatriots at home and abroad. After the speech, Cao Xueyu from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Lu Guomian from the Zhongsheng Club spoke one after another, praising the troupe in many ways. Finally, the banner presentation ceremony was held. The Journalists Association presented a banner with the words "Winning Hearts is Paramount." The Relief Associations presented a banner with the words "Testifying in Person." Li Jian[missing character] presented a banner with the words "Verbal Condemnation". Each has a profound meaning, used to encourage each other. The chairman presented the banner on behalf of the group, and the head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, Jin Shan, accepted it. The farewell party ended happily at about 3 pm.

It is reported that there were many people who could not get tickets when the troupe performed at the Lee Theatre. Now, in response to the requests of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, they will give a farewell performance in Kowloon at the beginning of next month. After the performance, they will leave Hong Kong immediately. The procedures for obtaining passports have been completed in Shantou. The itinerary for this trip abroad is scheduled for eight months, and the destinations are the Philippines, the South Seas Islands, and San Francisco and Honolulu in the Americas.

As for the troupe's work plan, it can be roughly divided into two aspects: spiritual and economic. Regarding the spiritual aspect, drama, writing, speeches, picture exhibitions, and other methods will be used to make overseas Chinese deeply aware of the bright future of the motherland in hardship, and that the past contributions of money and effort have not been wasted at all. Regarding the economic aspect, it is planned to raise a huge sum of 500,000 yuan, the use of which is estimated as follows: 1. To establish wounded soldier reception stations, wounded soldier hospitals, and cultural supply stations in the war zone. 2. To establish reception homes for families of soldiers on expeditions, reception homes for orphans of war heroes who died in the war of resistance, and rehabilitation homes for disabled soldiers in the rear.

We believe that with the past abilities and spirit of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe", it will be able to complete this great mission. Our overseas Chinese in Hong Kong should also encourage them and help them complete this mission. We wish the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" a smooth journey and see you again in the future. The next gathering will be to gather all the forces of counterattack and participate in the final battle for the final victory of the motherland. Take care! We will meet at work.

### The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Plans to Request Improvements in Pig Transportation Methods; All Bamboo Cages Used in the Past Easily Injure Pigs; Using Wooden Barriers for Transportation Can Eliminate This Problem; The Government Drafts Regulations for Bird Shops

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals yesterday published its annual report, which stated that due to the war, progress on improving the transportation of pigs and cattle has been hindered. Pigs transported to Hong Kong are all transported in bamboo cages, and after long land and water journeys, eight or nine out of ten are injured by bamboo shards or have their [body part] broken. The Society plans to request the authorities to prohibit the use of bamboo cages for transportation and switch to wooden barriers to avoid harming pigs. Bird shops that sell poultry should also be improved. The Society's inspectors and committee members visit various bird shops every week and believe that the general situation is worse than that of bird shops in Guangzhou. Most of the shops are dark and cramped. The Society has conveyed this idea to the government, and the government has now drafted regulations for bird shops, hoping that the health authorities will strictly enforce them in the future. The report also attacked the recent explorations by explorers who often go deep into the Chinese interior to capture pandas and display them in zoos around the world, considering it a cruel act, because pandas often suffer and die during this long journey. For the sake of the public's enjoyment, these ignorant animals are subjected to this suffering, which has to be called cruel. However, this kind of action is unfortunately beyond the power of the Hong Kong authorities and the Society to prohibit.

### Disease Report

This year: Cholera a total of 106 cases, tuberculosis 3,396 cases. According to the Medical Department's report, five cases of cholera were discovered in Hong Kong in the 24 hours before yesterday, and 30 cases were counted in the past ten days, with 25 deaths. One hundred and six cases have already been discovered this year, which is slightly less than the same period last year, but this proves the importance of preventive measures. In addition, 42 cases of tuberculosis were discovered in Hong Kong in the 24 hours before yesterday, and 3,396 cases were counted in the past six months, with an average of 566 cases per month. In addition, other infectious diseases discovered yesterday included three cases of intestinal fever and one case each of measles and cerebrospinal meningitis.

### Children's Welfare Association: The Entertainment Fair Achieved Excellent Results; A Total Net Profit of Over 6,000 Yuan Was Earned in Two Sessions; The Association Will Elect a Director and Supervisor Today

The Hong Kong Branch of the Children's Welfare Association held two charity bazaar entertainment fairs, one near the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon and the other at Sir Robert Ho Tung's private residence on the Peak. A large number of people visited each day, and the situation was lively and the results were excellent. The event held at Sir Robert Ho Tung's private residence raised 3,337 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 cents (there are still several hundred yuan that have not been collected), and the event held in Kowloon raised 2,500 yuan. After deducting the expenses of the two entertainment fairs, a total of more than 6,000 yuan was raised. The association is scheduled to hold elections for a director and supervisor at the South China Club at 11:30 this morning.

### Import and Export Surtax to Be Levied for Another Year: Kowloon Customs Announcement

The Kowloon Customs Office issued Announcement No. 827 yesterday, stating that "The customs office has been collecting a 5% surtax on import and export goods based on the tax rate, which will be extended for another year from July 1, 1938, and has been notified in Announcement No. 753 on June 15, 1938. Now, an order from the Ministry of Finance states that the customs surtax should be extended for another year from July 1, 1939, according to the original plan. It is hereby announced for general knowledge."

### Women's Temperance Society Branch: General Committee Meeting to Be Held at Noon Today

The South China Women's Temperance Society is scheduled to hold a general committee meeting at 12 noon today. In addition to reporting on the society's affairs and the start of work on the South China Refugee Self-Help Society, important matters will be discussed, and Mr. Li Guansen, a financial expert, will be invited to give a lecture on the decline of the national currency and the prospects of the war of resistance.

### Central Market Returns Stalls; Merchants to Be Recruited Again at the End of This Month; A Total of Seventy-Three Stalls of Various Businesses; Interested Bidders Must Arrive on Time

In recent years, Hong Kong's population has increased sharply, and there has been a promising turnaround in various businesses. Generally, merchants are seeking to obtain a position during this period for business purposes. As a result, empty shops in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been rented out. The newly completed Central Market in the Central District is also the target of these merchants, who are seeking to obtain a stall in the new market for business purposes. When the Sanitary Bureau opened bidding for the stalls in the market, they did not hesitate to bid heavily against each other, and the monthly rent was as high as more than 280 yuan. In their opinion, they firmly believed that business would make great progress after the market opened, but the opposite was true. The market situation deteriorated day by day. Within a month of the market opening, some stallholders could not sustain their businesses due to excessive losses. They jointly requested the Sanitary Bureau to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties and reduce the rent to maintain their businesses, but the authorities did not seem to have any response. They were forced to stop their businesses and returned their stalls to the Sanitary Bureau, totaling as many as 73 stalls, including 7 fish stalls, 10 beef stalls, 13 pork stalls, 35 vegetable stalls, 5 fresh fruit stalls, and 3 chicken and duck stalls. Regarding this matter, according to the Sanitary Bureau's intention, it is planned to re-open bidding for these 73 stalls, and the bidding for pork, beef, fish, chicken, and duck stalls will be opened at 9:30 am on the 28th of this month, according to the original base price. The bidding for fresh fruit and vegetable stalls will also be held at 9:30 am on the 30th of this month at the Bureau, according to the original base price. The base price labels will be posted today.

### Norwegian Cargo Ship Catches Fire Due to Electrical Leakage; Fortunately, It Was Discovered Early and the Losses Were Minimal

The Norwegian cargo ship Tianshaya, which was moored in the waters of Sai Wan, arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th of this month (Sunday) with 6,000 tons of coal from Calcutta, India. This coal belongs to the Hong Kong Gas Company. Yesterday, the 20th, the company hired four large lighters and dozens of coal coolies, moored on both sides of the ship, to unload the coal. At 8:20 am, while the ship's crew and the coal coolies were busy working, a fire suddenly broke out in the cabin of Chief Officer Mona Hodge, located under the bow drawbridge of the ship. Thick smoke came out of the cabin, and the fire was extremely fierce. Fortunately, the shipowner Johnson saw it and immediately summoned 30 crew members, armed with fire hoses and fire extinguishers, and bravely rushed through the smoke to rescue the ship, regardless of the irritation of the thick smoke to their eyes and noses. After half an hour, the fire was finally extinguished. As for the cause of the fire in the cabin, it was found after investigation that it was caused by an electrical leak in the cabin. At that time, Mr. Moore was supervising the workers' work, so there was no one in the cabin, and there was no one in the neighboring cabins either. The door was tightly locked. Fortunately, shipowner Johnson discovered it in time and rescued the ship quickly, so the fire did not spread and the losses were very minimal. The ship, which carries 4,441 tons, was originally scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 23rd of this month (Friday), and the voyage will not be disrupted as a result.

### British Naval Ships Build Two New Vessels, Northward to Station on the Yangtze River

Two new inland river gunboats, the "Dragonfly" and the "Grasshopper," built by the British Navy's Yangtze River Fleet in England, have been completed. They recently sailed from England to Hong Kong, where they were handed over to the naval authorities by Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd. of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Navy ordered Bidas to represent the naval authorities and formally took over the "Dragonfly" on the 5th of this month and the "Grasshopper" on the 13th of this month. The "Dragonfly" has been led north by Captain Chaton to station on the Yangtze River, and the "Grasshopper" will be led north by Captain Nevis within days.

### Chinese Representatives to Attend the World Student Federation Conference Arrive in Hong Kong from Chongqing; Depart for France Tomorrow on the French Mail Ship Athos; Several Proposals Will Be Submitted at the Conference; Student Representatives from Shanghai Have Already Departed

Lu Qinchi, the representative of the Third International Conference of the National Student Union of China, flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing yesterday and plans to leave the country on the French mail ship Athos II on the 22nd. According to Mr. Lu, the Third International Conference of the International Student Federation will be held in Nice, southern France, from August 14 to 19. In addition to himself, the Chinese representatives also include Ms. Gong Pusheng, a student representative from Shanghai. Ms. Xi will pass through Hong Kong on the French mail ship Athos from Shanghai on the 20th and travel together.

The mission of this trip is to report to the World Student Federation on behalf of Chinese students, the situation of Chinese students participating in various difficult wartime work, national construction movements, and striving to study during the two years of war for independence and freedom. At the same time, several proposals will be submitted at the conference. However, they cannot be announced at present because the consent of Ms. Gong, the representative from Shanghai, is still required, or some modifications may be made.

Subsequently, Mr. Mu talked to reporters about the work of the National Student Union itself. He said that the headquarters of the Student Union is now located in Chongqing. As for the current work, the most important thing is to connect with various schools and promote internal work in various schools. As for other student work, because schools are scattered in the interior and Chongqing and other cities are evacuating people, the promotion of work is extremely difficult.

### Red Pill Manufacturing Operation Cracked in a Bay on Lantau Island; The Quantity of Narcotics Is Unprecedented in Recent Years; Five Defendants Sentenced to Five Years of Hard Labor

Five people, Huang Guang, Yu Yao, and the women Li Liang, Zhu Qu, and He Rong, were previously charged with possessing 48 ounces of heroin powder, 56,200 red pills, and 960 ounces of powder containing narcotics in Da'ao Shan [missing character] Bay on the 17th of last month. The case was transferred to the High Court at 10 am yesterday, where Justice McKerron, together with jurors Deng Jian, Chen Jinshu, Bida Tumai, Di Gu Na, Ge Ming, and Ge Yun, jointly heard the case. The first defendant, Huang Guang, and the third defendant, Li Liang, pleaded guilty, while the other defendants pleaded not guilty. Senior Barrister Anderson defended them, and Government Barrister Wyatt prosecuted. The prosecutor first stated the case, saying that the amount of drugs seized in this case actually broke the record of the drug possession case cracked by the Customs Superintendent several years ago. The total amount of raw materials seized can be used to refine more than one million red pills. The details of the cracking of the case are as follows: Senior Customs Inspector Creamen and Woody received a report from an informant and sailed to a bay on Lantau Island on a customs patrol boat on the morning of the 17th of last month. They arrived at 7 am and landed together. They went to a house about 50 yards away from the beach. The house had two entrances. They went inside together and saw the fifth defendant standing alone in the front hall. They went straight to the inner entrance and saw five men and women sitting around a large bed, engaged in manufacturing red pills. Later, Inspector Wood examined the palms of the defendants, and only the fifth defendant's hands were not stained with red powder. This point cannot be said that he has nothing to do with this case. Later, the defendants, along with the narcotics and red pill manufacturing tools, were returned to the police station. After the narcotics were handed over to the government chemist for testing, it was believed that they could be used to make more than 1.1 million red pills. After collecting evidence and testimony, the government authorities charged them. After the prosecutor finished speaking, he summoned various relevant witnesses to testify. Finally, the second, fourth, fifth, and third defendants took the stand and pleaded not guilty. After both lawyers presented their opinions, Judge Mai gave a detailed explanation of the case to guide the jurors in their verdict. As a result, the jurors unanimously found the defendants guilty. The judge then sentenced all the defendants to five years of hard labor. (Note: It is rare for red pill manufacturers to be punished as severely as this time).

Important Local News from South China

### Stable Finances in Guangdong Province; Revenue and Expenditure Remain Balanced Despite Wartime

【Special Dispatch from Shaoguan】According to reliable sources from the Finance Department, the financial situation in Guangdong Province remains extremely stable despite wartime conditions. This is because the province's finances have undergone thorough reorganization in recent years, and all revenue and expenditure items have been brought onto the right track. Therefore, it is fortunate that revenue and expenditure can still be balanced, even though the entire province is in a state of war. Furthermore, according to the Finance Department's announcement of the revenue and expenditure figures during the tenure of former Director Zeng Yangfu, the accounts have now been thoroughly verified. In addition to ensuring that all military and administrative expenses borne by the provincial treasury are cleared on a monthly basis, as of the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), when he handed over the office, the treasury had a balance of over 6.62 million yuan in national currency. This included 2.88 million yuan deposited with the Provincial Bank and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau as agent treasuries, and 3.74 million yuan deposited with various banks. In addition, there were over 600,000 yuan in fines, etc., handed over during his tenure, totaling over 7.2 million yuan in national currency handed over to the new administration. Furthermore, there were treasury bills with a face value of over 4.8 million yuan in national currency. The current provincial treasury budget is approximately 1.3 million yuan per month, and the funds transferred are sufficient to cover one year of expenses. With some reorganization, it should be even more ample, and the future is very promising.

### Our Guerrilla Force Is Extremely Active; Once Attacked Sanshui County Town; 500 Troops from Xin Xu × Army Withdraw to Guangzhou

(West River Quick News) On the evening of the 14th, the resting unit of the □th Brigade of the Sanshui Guerrilla Force gathered over a hundred men, all equipped with hand grenades, and advanced towards Sanshui County Town. Taking advantage of their familiarity with the terrain, they detoured to the base and charged into the city from the north. They first encountered the × security team guarding the city, and the national troops who had been ambushed in the city also rose up in response. At that moment, machine guns and hand grenades fired simultaneously, as dense as a string of firecrackers. The × soldiers were at a loss and their formation was in great disarray. After several hours of fierce fighting, our army began to retreat to its original position. It was later learned that over 50 × soldiers were killed, and many × fortifications and barracks were destroyed. Our side also suffered slight casualties.

He Kou × Army Shells Qing Qi

In recent days, the frontline × army has feared our forces emerging from the He River, and has frequently fired shells at our positions to threaten our army's crossing of the river. On the 16th and 17th, the Sanshui × army again set up cannons in Xin Xu, Gua Bang Ridge, Bao Ya Gang, and other places to bombard Qing Qi, Zhu Zhou, Heng Shi, Wang Lou, and other places, intermittently, firing throughout the day. The shelling was particularly intense on the morning of the 17th, starting from 8 a.m. to around 9 a.m., with over a hundred shells fired, but the range was inaccurate, and most of the shells landed in the wilderness, causing minimal losses to our side.

Part of the Xin Xu × Army Retreats

According to reports from the front, there are currently approximately 3,000 × soldiers in Sanshui, with the main force concentrated in He Kou, Xin Xu, and other places. It is estimated that there are 600-700 soldiers of the × Matsuno unit in Sanshui City and Southwest Town, and over 1,000 soldiers of the × Ikeda, Kanazawa, and Noo units in the He Kou and Xin Xu area. There are over 600 soldiers of the × Takada unit in Okane Maguchi, most of whom are engineers. It was learned that the Xin Xu × army has recently been sending teams to Lao Ya Zhou, Ge Wei, and other places to build fortifications and conscript and train young men. On the 15th and 16th of this month, over 500 × soldiers from Xin Xu returned to He Kou and retreated towards Guangzhou along the Bao-San Road. Their intentions are unclear.

### Our Counterattack on Jiangmen and Xinhui; Days of Artillery Battles

(Zhongshan Quick News) At 4 a.m. on the 19th, our troops once again charged to Gangzhou Port in Xinhui County and Baisha Township between Jiangmen and Xinhui, killing a × pacification squad leader named Sanxiangjiao. From 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. that morning, the × army fiercely fired cannons from Dog Mountain in Du City, bombarding Xin Kai Road. Our artillery positions in the area also fired back, and the fighting was quite intense. Cannon fire was heard in Shiqi that morning. Yesterday (the 20th) morning, there was also very dense cannon fire from the Waihai area, which was fired at our troops who were counterattacking.

### Our Troops in Gao Lei Repeatedly Uncover Pro-Japanese Traitor Spy Agencies; Key Figures Captured, Remnants Largely Dispersed

(South Road Quick News) In the South Road area of Guangdong Province, the × army has been harboring ambitions of invasion, so the × warships sometimes disperse and sometimes gather, and the situation is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. Their intention is to confuse our troops. It was learned that recently, in order to spy on the secrets of our South Road militia defense, the × side dispatched a large number of pro-Japanese traitors and lackeys to infiltrate the inland and carry out their missions separately. Our authorities, aware of the violent × plot, have ordered strict investigations. Recently, many important pro-Japanese traitor agencies have been uncovered in Yangjiang, Maoming, Pu, and other places. The key figures have been captured in one fell swoop, and other outcasts in various places have also disappeared. The × disruptive conspiracy has completely failed. It was learned that their main agency is located on Hainan Island, named the "South Branch Special Service Agency," which recruits cold-blooded animals for training, especially welcoming local ruffians and gangsters from various counties in southern Guangdong, because they are familiar with the situation and can operate more easily. It was found that the first batch of 56 people completed their training on May 25th and infiltrated the inland to work at the locations designated by ×. Most of those recently captured by us belong to this group.

### × Planes Bomb Nanning for Days

(Xuwen Quick News) An × aircraft carrier is still hiding near Weizhou Island. On the 12th and 13th, it continuously dispatched planes to bomb Nanning. It was learned that at 7 a.m. on the 12th, eight × planes flew over Hechong and Qinxian and attacked Nanning, dropping 25 bombs in the downtown area, including Xiguan Road, Minsheng Road, outside the North Gate, and at the senior high school, etc., destroying only two houses. There were no deaths or injuries among the people. On the 13th, eight × planes again attacked Nanning along the eastern route, dropping 12 bombs in the downtown area, including Shifan Street, Wuquan Road, Huaqiang Road, South First Lane, North First Lane, West First Lane, and Shangren Lane, etc., one of which was an incendiary bomb, destroying a total of 23 houses, killing one woman, and injuring three men.

### Old Tune of Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Swimming Competition Repeated; Shanghai Invites Hong Kong Team to Go North

Victoria Swimming Club Sends Letter to Hong Kong Chinese Swimming Organizations for Meeting; Everything Can Be Decided After the Meeting on the 26th of This Month

The Hong Kong-Shanghai interport swimming competition has been suspended for two sessions due to the current situation. Recently, the Victoria Swimming Club of Hong Kong received a letter from the Shanghai Swimming Association, inviting Hong Kong to send a team to compete and restore the past Hong Kong-Shanghai interport competition. After receiving the letter, the Victoria Swimming Club immediately sent letters to various Chinese and Western swimming organizations in Hong Kong, inviting them to send representatives to a meeting at the Victoria Swimming Club at 4:45 p.m. on Monday, the 26th of this month, to discuss everything. Whether Hong Kong will send a team to Shanghai for the competition will be decided on that day. If it is decided to go, the selection of personnel will also be carried out successively.

In the past, when the world was peaceful, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tianjin held interport aquatic competitions once a year. Now, Tianjin is blockaded by the Japanese, and the Tianjin British Concession is struggling to save itself, so it naturally has no leisure to send a team to compete. Since the British Concession has no such intention, the French Concession will not act alone, so the Tianjin area may not be invited. In the future, this year's interport aquatic competition will only be held between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which may feel monotonous. Will the athletes participating in the competition miss their comrades in Tianjin?

### South China Army Goes to Singapore; Detailed Record of Victory Over Champion China; Overall Score 4-3, First Half Score 3-1

(Singapore 16th Airmail News) The South China Football Team arrived in Singapore yesterday morning at 7 a.m. with its elite troops. However, because the team had reached an agreement with the Yangon Football Club in Vietnam to compete in Yangon on the 21st of this month, the time was very tight. Therefore, they could not stay in Singapore for a long time. Upon arriving in Singapore, they unloaded their luggage and immediately played a game with the China Team to catch up with their appointment in Yangon. On the day the South China players arrived in Singapore, football fans rejoiced. Therefore, in yesterday's match against China, the Anshun Law Stadium was not only packed on the left and right sides, but also the one-dollar and five-cent seats on the East Curve grandstand were full. The total number of people was over 7,000, and the scene was unprecedentedly lively. The Consul-General of our embassy in Singapore and his wife also attended the match together. At 5:10 p.m., the South China players, wearing red and white jerseys, first greeted the audience. Then the China team also followed suit and entered the field. The lineups of both sides were as follows:

South China Team

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng Hou Rongsheng

Li Guowei Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao

Luo Douwen Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Feng Jingxiang Yang Shuiyi

China Team

Li Botang

Sun Chunlai Wen Shunshan

Xu Yuankun Zhu Chenggui Ji Youling

Yan Jixiang Ruan Kunxiang Xie Qingfu Xia Zhixiang Wu Renshi

German Army Shoots Quickly; Record Opens First

With the lineup as described above, the referee blew the whistle, and the battle immediately broke out. China's Qingfu first issued an ultimatum, and then China's five forwards went north together. Qingbian dribbled the ball straight up and invaded the hinterland, but returned without success. The guest team's Jingxiang galloped horizontally and vertically in China's hinterland. Guowei took the opportunity to attack, but also worked hard to no avail. Right winger Jingxiang pressed the palace again, stopped the ball and passed it to Dehui. This gentleman led the charge but missed by a hair. It was China's blessing that this ball was not in. In the first few minutes of the battle, China's position was constantly ravaged by the guest team. Fortunately, his teammates worked together to defend, and they were able to turn the danger into safety. Later, China's five roads advanced forward, and the three fierce men in the middle followed and moved. In an instant, they had reached the bottom of the opponent's city. However, Qing's feet were not agile, and a big mistake was made. Around the eleventh minute of the battle, alarms were frequent under the city of China. Goalkeeper Botang, seeing the situation was critical, personally led the charge and pushed the ball back, falling beside Qingcai. Qingcai passed it to the middle, and Dehui took the opportunity to attack fiercely, and sure enough, he entered the room and opened the record first.

Divine Leg Is Effective; Douwen Reports Good News

After China lost a city, they were eager to avenge themselves. Jixiang took a breath and went straight to the bottom of the city. Qingfu knocked on the door, but still could not get the key. Two minutes later, the second alarm was sounded under the city of China. The guest car Songsheng sent a secret signal. Jingxiang, receiving the secret report, would not lose the opportunity. With a labor of one foot, China broke through another pass.

At that time, it was time for the guest team to dominate the world. Douwen on the left saw his comrades crowned and promoted, and could not help but feel hot and red. Therefore, he seized an opportunity in China's second line of defense and shot from afar, hitting the target. At this point, China had lost half of Jiangnan and was laughing. The audience around, seeing China lose three passes in a row, were all worried about the future of the home team. Fortunately, when the battle reached the 26th minute, China's Zhixiang rode alone for thousands of miles and pressed the switch in the opponent's third line of defense, shooting a bullet from afar, which really went straight to Huanglong. This ball was not only unexpected by the South China players, but also unimaginable by the general audience. At halftime, the score was 3-1, with South China leading.

Dehui and Qingfu Shine Together

After moistening their throats with ice water, they changed places and fought again. South China, taking advantage of the victory, ordered their troops to march north. The entire army, in a mighty manner, attacked the main force's defense again. Rongzhao pointed east, and Dehui took the opportunity to act. Although Botang went out of the city to meet the enemy, the bullet had already penetrated the net. Although China was humiliated again, its morale was even more boosted, and it launched a counterattack. Rengshi, a fresh force, came from afar, and the bullet was passed to the middle. Kunxiang turned his head, and the ball went over the edge of the city. Afterwards, the guest car Jingxiang also once attacked a ball no more than ten meters away from China's city gate, kissing Botang. After China recovered from this crisis, the time came, and they went straight to the top. Eleven minutes after the resumption of the battle, Qingfu tried his best to win back a ball. Not long after, Qingfu once again made a contribution. At this point, China was only one goal behind. Afterwards, although both sides fought desperately to compete for the final territory, they fought for more than ten minutes, and neither side made any progress. Time flew by like a white horse passing through a gap. In a blink of an eye, it was time to end the game. The referee blew the silver whistle, and both sides reined in their horses and withdrew their troops to rest in camp. The score for the whole game was 4-3, with South China triumphing.

### South China Club Members' Summer Football; More Than Sixty Participants

### Jin Quan Cup; Women's Championship Tonight

The Jin Quan Cup table tennis tournament has entered the final stage. Tonight (21st) there will be a women's match, with South A playing against the Xinxiu team. This match is a championship battle between the two teams and is of utmost importance. In terms of strength, South A has Yang Weibin, Mo Huanqiong, Shi Baolian, Luo Xiushui, and Lu Cuiying, all of whom can attack and defend well. And the Xinxiu team, such as Chen Meiyou, Lu Zhaoyi, Zhu Jiaoxin, Chen Cui, and Pan Yinghong, are also masters in their own right. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle between the two sides. However, the South A players are more experienced and should have a chance of winning.

### B Group Basketball Enters Finals; Tonight's Second Place Battle; First Match Huaxiong vs. Guangzhong; Second Match Pei Ying vs. Li Hang

The B Group basketball finals have reached the final stage. Tonight's finale has two matches. After this, when the rose blooms are over, you will have to wait until next year to see them again. According to the schedule, the first match tonight is Chunfeng vs. International, but Chunfeng was disqualified by the league for using a Qingming player in place of another last week, so it has been changed to Guangzhong vs. Huaxiong. The second match is Li Hang vs. Pei Ying.

In the Guangzhong vs. Huaxiong match, neither team has a chance of winning the championship. However, in terms of strength, Guangzhong has good coordination, and Huaxiong has a strong offensive, each with its own advantages, and there should be a fierce battle. As for the Li Hang vs. Pei Ying match, both teams once lost to International, and the championship has become a bubble. However, the two teams have equal scores and are both in second place. Tonight's match is a battle for second place. Li Hang has Lin Youpei, Lu Dezhang, Huang Jiuwu, and Chen Yuting, all of whom are capable and experienced. Pei Ying's combat power is also extremely fierce, and there are also generals such as Guan Zhenbin, Zhao Zhenyuan, and Chen Xiyang. Their skills are evenly matched, and it is impossible to predict who will win.

Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics; Zou Falu

Lecture

### Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics

— Zou Falu

"New Gymnastics" is what? When was "New Gymnastics" discovered? Some people may have such questions. Before this so-called "New Gymnastics" is popularized throughout the country (Guangxi has not seen this kind of gymnastics, and what about the provinces southwest and beyond, I dare not make a dogmatic judgment), it is not surprising that those who have not tried it have questions. Therefore, before writing this article, the definitions of new and old gymnastics seem to need explanation.

The so-called "New Gymnastics" is what Professor Wu Cheng of the Physical Education Department of National Central University and others have advocated a few years ago. It is a combination of European and American (mostly German) new gymnastics and Chinese martial arts movements, which have been transformed and melted by Mr. Wu and others. It has been popular in East China for several years, especially in Jiangsu Province, where it has been implemented more effectively. Old gymnastics, of course, is the gymnastics that our country has always used. Now that a kind of gymnastics that is different from the ones that have always been used has been discovered, it seems appropriate to call it "New Gymnastics", and it is also acceptable to call the ones that have always been used "Old Gymnastics".

After explaining the definitions of the names, I have a statement, that is, this "comparison view" is entirely what I feel after practicing both new and old gymnastics. I dare not blindly say whether the inventor Mr. Wu meant it this way, so I hope that Mr. Wu will correct it after seeing this text.

The comparison of new and old gymnastics can be discussed from several aspects such as movement, method, amount of exercise, and use of muscles and value.

A. In terms of movement, the movement can be compared from the following points:

First, the difference between "lifting" and "swinging": The "swinging" movement in new gymnastics is equivalent to the "lifting" in old gymnastics. The "lifting" movement, after being lifted to a certain part, must be slightly paused, and then the next movement is done. The "swinging" movement, after swinging to a certain part, is immediately swung back, without any pause. We can see the true meaning of this movement by looking at the pendulum. From this, we can understand: "Lifting" is moving and stopping, stiff, and swinging is continuous, lively. (One)
