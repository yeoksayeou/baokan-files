### Czech Partition and the European Situation

Just as Chamberlain was expressing an optimistic view of the European situation and preparing to realize a new balance of power in Europe, the Czech crisis has suddenly turned serious in recent days. A telegram from Berlin on the 13th has already proven that "Czechoslovakia has made another major sacrifice" and that "Czechoslovakia has accepted Germany's demands and has been forced to partition again!" What is the significance of this event? What impact will it have on the future situation in Europe and the world? What understanding and preparations should we make regarding this event?

Since the Munich Conference last year, Czechoslovakia suffered its first partition. The German fascist chieftain gained control over Czechoslovakia in all areas and sectors, and the fascist poison spread deeply throughout the country. The most important reason for Czechoslovakia's suffering such a heavy sacrifice last year was the appeasement policy of the British and French rulers towards the aggressor nations. In particular, the French Daladier government, following Chamberlain's foreign policy, attempted to exchange the interests of its small allies for a guarantee from the aggressor nations to postpone the outbreak of a European war. This ultimately led to the automatic abandonment of the Franco-Czech mutual assistance treaty and the destruction of the Soviet-Czech mutual assistance treaty, causing Czechoslovakia to suffer the pain of actual national subjugation. The second important reason was that the Czech government did not trust the power of the entire nation to unite and prepare to fight to defend its homeland. Under international pressure, especially the pressure of France's breach of contract, it accepted humiliating conditions for a compromised peace in an attempt to maintain Czechoslovakia's nominal existence.

However, all policies of compromise and capitulation not only failed to achieve stability and peace, but in fact made the invaders even more rampant. Czechoslovakia, under the control of the German fascist terror, certainly experienced the pain of actual national subjugation. Even the British and French rulers keenly felt that the appeasement policy had increased the threat of the aggressor nations to Britain, France, and even all of Europe. Therefore, in the six months since the Munich Conference, the Czech people's movement to organize a united front against fascism and fight for freedom has been secretly growing. The united action of the British and French people against the appeasement policy has also been developing rapidly, and Poland has taken Czechoslovakia's compromise with Germany as a warning, beginning to change its policy and gradually moving towards the Soviet Union, the "guardian of world peace."

The development of this new situation has naturally been a cause of concern and unease for the German fascist chieftain! At the same time, the British and French rulers have not abandoned their policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy. The Spanish war has begun to intensify under the increasingly intensified manifestation of this policy by Britain and France. Italy's aggressive actions against French North Africa are becoming increasingly fierce. The entire European situation is becoming increasingly serious. All these new developments have led the German aggressors to believe that the time is ripe for further partitioning Czechoslovakia and establishing a base for eastward aggression. Thus, there is the recent conspiracy to instigate the Slovakian autonomy movement.

Although the Czech government struck at the German-instigated Slovak "independent autonomy" movement due to the surging tide of national anger against fascism and for freedom, on the one hand, the German fascist forces had already controlled the overall situation in Czechoslovakia. On the other hand, Germany further exerted pressure, implementing troop mobilization and a fierce anti-Czech movement. At the same time, it made demands on Czechoslovakia: (1) grant the Slovaks the right to self-determination, (2) dismiss the current Czech Minister of National Defense, General Syrový, and the Minister of the Interior, and (3) guarantee the German minority in Bohemia and Moravia protection. As a result, according to a Berlin telegram on the 13th, "Diplomatic sources here confirm that the government has accepted the Slovak demand for autonomy and the dismissal of Czech Defense Minister Syrový. News from the Czech capital also indicates that the Czech government has accepted the German government's demand to establish an independent Slovak state, or even to establish an independent Ruthenian state." The secession of Slovakia from Czechoslovakia has almost become an inevitable fact.

After the partition of Czechoslovakia, the Czech territory will shrink by more than one-third again and will be surrounded by Germany. With the activity of fascists internally, the Czech people's struggle against fascism and for freedom will naturally become more difficult. At the same time, the European situation will change again after Germany actually gains Slovakia. What we should pay attention to is that, first, because Hungary has joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact" and Slovakia has fallen under fascist rule again, Hungary and Poland have already bordered each other, and Poland and Romania will become targets of plunder. Second, the voices of Germany and Italy in Europe are becoming increasingly rampant, while the position of Britain and France in Europe and even the world is becoming increasingly low. Although the British and French governments are fantasizing about the organization of a new Locarno, they will ultimately inevitably sacrifice themselves to serve the aggressor nations of Germany and Italy. Third, since the future situation in Europe will become increasingly critical and the war crisis will become more serious, the conspiratorial activities of the Japanese aggressors in the East will inevitably become more intense. This is something we cannot ignore! Finally, we should more deeply recognize the consequences of the British and French appeasement foreign policy, and deeply recognize the disaster of Czechoslovakia's defeatist policy of seeking peace. Today's partition of Czechoslovakia is a warning to us—we must intensify the elimination of open and latent defeatist pro-peace and pro-× remarks and actions, strengthen national unity, vow to abide by the National Covenant, and adhere to the long-term resistance war.

### On New Decisions in Military Resistance

— Pan Lang

The overall war situation is currently generally stable, but the overall situation has undergone major changes. The main facts of this change are that the internal and external difficulties of the × people are becoming increasingly serious, the offensive power of the × people has been greatly weakened, and we have established the foundation for a long-term resistance war strategically in the twenty months of bloody struggle, and have won the initiative; and politically, we have unfolded a bright future of long-term unity to strive for final victory. However, we must also understand that the difficulties of the × people and the degradation of the × army have not yet reached their highest degree; and that the × people are intensifying their military, political, and even economic conspiracies to complete their plan to quickly conquer China. Chiang Kai-shek's circular on the 12th of this month, therefore, used "the lifeblood of the nation and the race is still in the balance, and the success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is still extremely distant" to warn the national compatriots. Therefore, our task today is to adapt to the new situation of the war of resistance, to do our best to increase the difficulties of the × people, to prevent the advance of the × people, to crush the conspiracies of the × people, and at the same time to do our best to promote our national spirit, and to accelerate the growth of new forces, in order to achieve the goal of driving out the × people and recovering the lost territory.

According to a telegram from a certain place on the 13th from the Central News Agency, a certain director said that a certain important meeting recently convened has, in response to the current stage of the war of resistance, made important decisions on future military affairs. Generally divided into two aspects: active and passive. On the active side, in addition to deciding on precise tactics for the overall active war, it was also decided to take the troops to the front and rear of the × people with a spirit of dying for the nation to fight for national liberation. In order to counter the × people's recent use of military intimidation methods in their exhausted state to cover up the promotion of ×× politics and the expansion of insidious economic plans, it was decided to bravely defeat the main force of the × people militarily, and at the same time implement the National Covenant to crush the political tricks of the × people. Then, with the method of economic blockade, × commodities are not allowed to be transported into the inland, and our food products are not allowed to be transported into the ×-occupied areas. If this new decision, which advances on the military, political, and economic fronts at the same time, can be quickly implemented and further sought universally and practically, then the blow to the conspiracies of the × people will naturally be extremely serious. However, what we should understand is that the so-called military defeat of the main force of the × people not only depends on the improvement of the combat effectiveness of our Wang Force army and the active strengthening of the defense forces in Central China, South China, and the Northwest; but also depends on the counterattack on the flanks and rear of the × people by mobile corps with larger forces, and even greater efforts must be made to unify the organization and widely mobilize the guerrilla war in the occupied areas; this is one aspect. As for the political implementation of the National Covenant to crush the political conspiracies of the × people, it not only depends on the extensive and practical development of the traitor-elimination movement, but also on the resolute attack and eradication of all remarks and actions that violate the war of resistance and nation-building, such as all remarks and actions that advocate "anti-communism," "peace," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "exclusion of European and American forces"; at the same time, it is also necessary to expand the unified mass movement and implement democratic politics under centralized leadership, starting with the rapid establishment of provincial, municipal, and county councils, and fully develop the initiative and enthusiasm of the people across the country to participate in the war of resistance and nation-building; this is the second aspect. The economic implementation of mutual blockades must also be accompanied by the improvement of the necessary living standards for farmers and workers, the promotion of the economic resistance movement of the people in the occupied areas and war zones, and the accelerated development of industrial and agricultural production and cooperative enterprises in the vast rear areas in order to achieve complete success; this is the third aspect. All three of these points are what the authorities must pay attention to today, and what the compatriots across the country, especially the overseas Chinese, should do their best to contribute their loyalty, labor, and material resources to promote their success.

On the passive side, this meeting also made some rather important decisions, paying particular attention to the consolidation of political, cultural, and various other forces in order to coordinate with the two-pronged revolutionary tactics. Politically, it was decided to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate revolutionary political institutions, and to enhance the strength of the masses in resisting the war. Culturally, it was decided to increase cultural work in resisting the war and promote the national spirit in order to raise revolutionary emotions. In terms of personnel, it was decided to follow personnel laws and regulations to select and appoint the virtuous and capable. In terms of management, it was decided to follow management laws and regulations to be honest and perform duties faithfully. Finally, simple and effective steps for leading troops, training troops, and using troops were formulated. These decisions are quite broad in scope, and there must be precise and concrete methods for them. However, they have already outlined the key points and provide us with a clear and optimistic basis for observing future military administration. Those who are concerned about the future of the war of resistance and nation-building and the national revolution will undoubtedly be pleased and look forward to their rapid realization. However, all these are, after all, the general and basic requirements for winning the war of resistance. For example, in terms of strengthening and consolidating political institutions and enhancing the strength of the masses in resisting the war, how to adjust the relationship between the various political parties, ethnic groups, and classes so that they can proceed smoothly under the organizational form of great national unity is still the most urgent issue at present. For example, in terms of strengthening cultural work in resisting the war, promoting the national spirit, and raising revolutionary emotions, how to clear the obstacles to cultural work in resisting the war, such as all the latent elements of compromise and peace and defeatists in the country, will be purged? How will all the traitorous remarks and actions overseas that serve Japan × and aim to attack the war of resistance and nation-building movement be swept away? All are the most serious problems at present. For example, in terms of implementing the selection of the virtuous and capable in personnel matters, the first thing to consider is how to break down partisan prejudices and crush the feudal tradition of appointing relatives and friends. For example, in terms of promoting honesty and public service in management, the first thing to consider is how to eliminate the remnants of feudalism? How to create an atmosphere that is adapted to revolutionary resistance? And so on. The government authorities must be able to see far and wide, resolutely make decisions, and provide a thorough solution. And our compatriots across the country who are loyal, patriotic, and courageous in self-love should also do their best to assist the government in perfecting the solution.

In addition, regardless of the current new military plan for the war of resistance, cultivating a large number of cadres and talents to work for the war of resistance and nation-building is the most urgent task for us today. Since the combat effectiveness of the × people has not been greatly depleted, the strategy of the × people has not suffered a fatal blow, and the conspiracies of the × people are still continuing to operate by taking advantage of every international opportunity and the remaining weaknesses of our side, it is true, as Chiang Kai-shek pointed out, that "the lifeblood of our nation and race is still in the balance, and the success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is extremely distant." Then we must step up the cultivation of human resources, develop new forces, in order to persist in the long-term resistance war and thereby strive for final victory. The formulation of simple and effective steps for leading troops, training troops, and using troops at this meeting is a clear indication that the authorities are paying attention to this. According to a late-night report on the 14th, Liang Han Cao, director of the political department of the Southwest Headquarters, said, "To refresh the political work cadres of the national army, a total of 60,000 people need to be trained. After six months of training, more than 5,000 people have graduated, and more than 10,000 people are currently undergoing training. At the same time, recruitment continues and is widely collected to achieve the goal of setting up one instructor per company and attaching a working team to improve the combat spirit of the soldiers. In the future, new troop training will pay more attention to political training." This decision by the authorities deeply meets the needs of previous appeals from all parties and 20 months of practical experience in the war of resistance. In addition to our satisfaction, we would like to offer a foolish insight: to improve the training of military political work cadres, we must first pay attention to the careful selection of trainers, focusing on those with rich experience and knowledge and a strong reputation among the people and in the troops, while disregarding their social class and partisan affiliations; secondly, regarding the recruitment of trainees, we should also abandon discrimination based on social class, ethnicity, or partisan affiliation, and focus on the degree of their national consciousness and revolutionary sentiments, and should especially encourage those who enthusiastically volunteer from overseas Chinese communities. If this can be done, then it can respond to the current military needs of the war of resistance, or it can be flexible and effective and achieve the expected results.

### The Guangdong Provincial Military and Political Authorities Encourage People's Teams in the Occupied Areas

Promote the Guangdong Spirit and Maintain the Inherent Glory; Strictly Abide by Revolutionary Discipline and Launch Guerrilla Warfare

[Quick News from a Certain Place] Zhang Fa Kui, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, Yu Han Mou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Li Han Hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, issued a letter to the self-defense guerrilla teams in the occupied areas. The following is a transcript of the foreword: Fellow countrymen! Comrades:

It has been half a year since the Japanese × landed in Daya Bay and invaded our Guangdong on a large scale. During this half year, the × people have been rampant and unscrupulous in the occupied areas. ×× women, killing strong men and refugees, trampling on our fields and houses, and wantonly oppressing and enslaving our people, causing our compatriots to be displaced, wives and children to be separated, families to be destroyed, and people to die. The means of the × people are so poisonous and their conscience so evil that they are truly unprecedented in the world. During this half year, no one in the whole of South China has not been concerned about the situation of the compatriots in the occupied areas, and no one has not been heartbroken and vowed to avenge the compatriots who have suffered so much. Fa Kui and others have been entrusted by the Party and the country, shouldering the responsibility of military and political affairs in South China. We have never forgotten the suffering of our compatriots for a moment, and we have never ceased to encourage the military and civilians to fight against the Japanese × in order to eliminate the disasters of our compatriots and rescue them from the abyss of suffering.

Since the × people invaded South China, the self-defense corps and guerrilla teams in various parts of Guangdong have been able to understand the great righteousness and have risen up to participate in the war of resistance. Fa Kui and others, the military and civilians of South China, and the compatriots across the country all know very well about your heroic deeds of attacking the × people in various battles and disrupting the × people. Whenever such news comes, it is the glory of Guangdong people and also the glory of the Chinese nation.

Our Guangdong people have always been the vanguard in resisting foreign aggression. In the past, the Guangdong Taiping fishermen, the residents of Sanyuanli, and the people of Bao'an all rose up to resist the foreign troops that invaded our country, beating them into a rout and forcing them to withdraw from our territory. They established immortal achievements in the history of resistance against foreign aggression. Recently, in the War of Resistance against Japan, Wu Fa, a strong man from Zhongshan County, crossed the sea to attack the × bandits on Sanao Island several times. Hong Zhi Zheng, the captain of the self-defense corps in Chaoshan, led his team to overcome Nanao, killing the ×× so frightened that they lost their courage. Even Suma, the former Japanese consul in Nanjing, said: "The 'Guangdong Spirit' is the revolutionary spirit." From this, we can see how afraid the × bandits are of the public sentiment in Guangdong.

Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must carry forward this heroic spirit of the Guangdong people in resisting foreign aggression, promote the Guangdong people's spirit, and train your self-defense corps and guerrilla teams into iron anti-Japanese teams!

How can the local teams be transformed into iron anti-Japanese teams?

First, we must obey orders, strictly observe discipline, and cherish the people. If we do not obey orders and strictly observe discipline, we will not be able to fight. If we do not cherish the people, we will never be able to win the war. Everyone must not forget that we ourselves come from the people. After the war, we will return to the people. The local armed forces were originally the power of the people, so we must cherish the people, help the people, and pay attention to the interests of the people at all times. We must truly achieve the point of not disturbing the people or harming the people locally. We must pay the price for buying things, return what we borrow, and keep the places where we stay clean. We must speak kindly - only such a team can win the war.

Second, we must develop correct guerrilla warfare everywhere, attacking the × people everywhere and containing the × people. When we find small groups of × people, we annihilate them. When we encounter the × people's sentries or outposts, we become shameless collaborators and destroy them. When we discover the weaknesses of the × people, we give them a lightning strike that they cannot cover up, so that they do not have time to send reinforcements. When we seize the opportunity to attack the × army, we ambush them. Pay special attention to when they are unprepared, when they are camping or resting, and give them a powerful blow. If we encounter a large force of × troops and cannot win, we quickly disperse in a planned manner in order to regroup at a predetermined location later. When the × army comes to attack and cannot defend, we must destroy the nearby bridges and roads in advance, hide the food and daily necessities, and let both men and women escape to avoid being massacred by the × people, so that they come and find nothing. When they are stationed, we constantly harass them. When they retreat, we ambush and attack them along the way. We investigate the × people's communication lines and destroy them at any time and place. We pay attention to the × people's transportation everywhere, and when we have the opportunity, we intercept their baggage trains and cut off the supplies of their troops. Only by constantly attacking the × people in this way and resisting the × people in various ways can we make our troops healthy.

Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must recognize the true face of the × people and never forget that the Japanese × are the deadly enemies of our entire nation. Sometimes they abandon the policy of burning and killing in order to make us bow our heads and do their slaves, cattle, and horses, allowing them to drive and slaughter us. You must call on all the local compatriots to agree together and never be fooled by the bait and threats of the × people!

You must encourage each other from house to house, never be obedient people, never be collaborators, never use Japanese puppet banknotes, and never be slaves to the country.

Fellow countrymen! Comrades! You must fight to the end resolutely. The compatriots across the country are waiting for you, asking you to endure humiliation and continue the war of resistance to the end. The government and the compatriots across the country will never let you down. We are concerned about your hard struggle, and we also cherish your future!

Fellow countrymen! Comrades! Carry forward the inherent glory of Guangdong, determine your fighting determination, and continue to attack the × people. Cooperate with the national army to resist the war to the end, drive the Japanese × out of the territory, and strive for final victory. So that our Chinese people and grandchildren can live permanently in equality and freedom in the world for all ages and thousands of years (National Salvation Society)

### China-Vietnam Route to Officially Open This Morning; Opening of China-Europe Route Postponed

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The China National Aviation Corporation's China-Vietnam route, originally scheduled to officially open on the 14th, has been postponed to 10 AM on the morning of the 15th due to unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, the company's planned China-Europe route has also completed its trial flight successfully. It was originally intended to open on the 28th of last month, but because the airport at a certain station on the route was deemed slightly too small, urgent repairs are being carried out. It is expected that it will officially open in the near future after completion.

### During Flight from Chongqing to Kunming, Eurasia Passenger Plane Goes Missing: Sent a Distress Signal Near the Sichuan-Yunnan Border; Company Dispatched Aircraft for Two Days of Searching with No News; Passengers on Board Reportedly Include Tan Guang and 24 Others

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A certain large Eurasia Corporation aircraft, flying from Chongqing to Kunming on the 12th, suddenly went missing. The Eurasia Corporation immediately dispatched aircraft to search along the route, but as of 4 PM on the 14th, no official news has been received. It cannot be determined whether the aircraft has crashed or landed safely.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 14th] A Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane, which departed from here for Kunming on the 12th of this month, has been reported missing. The aircraft sent an emergency distress signal when it was flying near the Sichuan-Yunnan border. The aircraft carried 14 passengers, including Tan Guang, the chief secretary of the Central Bank.

[Hong Kong News] The Eurasia aircraft on the Chongqing-Yunnan route, carrying 14 passengers, took off from Chongqing on Sunday morning. It encountered an obstacle mid-flight and sent a distress call to Kunming. Subsequently, there was no further contact. As of yesterday, the aircraft had not arrived in Kunming, and it is suspected that it crashed en route. The aircraft is a "Junkers" type aircraft with 18 seats and three engines. The flight from Chongqing to Yunnan usually takes only four hours. After receiving the information, the reporter inquired with the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong. The person in charge replied that they had not received any reports from the aircraft, and only knew that the aircraft had departed from Chongqing on Sunday. The Kai Tak Airport authorities also stated that they had not received any news of the aircraft going missing. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, although Eurasia aircraft have flown from Kai Tak to the interior of China, most passengers travel via Hanoi. There are daily flights between Chongqing and Kunming. The number of Eurasia aircraft has recently been reduced to three, which is not enough to meet demand. Therefore, there was a proposal to add more passenger aircraft. Furthermore, it is known that the company's capital is a joint venture between the German Lufthansa company and the Chinese government. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Imperial Airways office announced that the company has reached an agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities and has obtained civil aviation rights. The only restriction is the regulations regarding domestic and ticket prices. In the future, Imperial Airways aircraft will be able to transport mail and cargo between Hong Kong and Hanoi, as well as carry passengers. The greatest impact will be the increased convenience of communication between Hong Kong and the mainland. Those traveling from Hong Kong to the mainland can take Imperial Airways aircraft to Hanoi and then transfer to China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia aircraft.

The policy of "Empty Fields" (a popular term for "Strengthening the Walls and Clearing the Fields," which has become common in various guerrilla areas in North China) is a clever method in our national revolutionary war, especially in guerrilla warfare, to strive for victory and exhaust the enemy.

This method has been widely used in various guerrilla areas in North China, especially in Shanxi, and has achieved significant results. In the process of its implementation, there are naturally many experiences and lessons that can serve as a reference for the development of guerrilla warfare in various war zones throughout the country.

What harm does the "Empty Fields" policy do to the enemy? What benefits does it bring to us?

First, the "Empty Fields" policy can deprive the enemy of all military conveniences when attacking us, such as using our people to act as guides, scouts, and perform all military service. It can deprive the enemy of the convenience of manpower and material resources in the occupied areas, such as capturing conscripts, requisitioning grain, fuel, livestock, etc. locally. This can create favorable conditions for us to annihilate the enemy. The enemy will either be eliminated by us along the way or be unable to gain a foothold after occupying an area, and will have no choice but to retreat.

Second, after repeated implementation of the "Empty Fields" policy, the enemy has had painful experiences. The next time they attack us, they will have to carry a large number of supply trains and mule teams to accompany the army and supply provisions. This will further encumber the enemy's march. In other words, it can create favorable conditions for us to attack the enemy and seize a large amount of their supplies.

Third, the "Empty Fields" policy can not only avoid the enemy's use of our material and human resources, but also avoid the enemy's burning, killing, and looting, which would cause great losses to our people. This can preserve our manpower and material resources, and thus maintain our strength for a prolonged war of resistance.

Fourth, the "Empty Fields" policy is not a passive escapism, but an active organization of the people to form genuine military-civilian cooperation and increase the strength of the war of resistance.

II. Methods

Passive methods of the "Empty Fields" policy: First, estimate the possible routes of the enemy's attack. Before the enemy reaches a considerable distance, mobilize the masses near these routes to first move heavy objects that are easily seized and easily destroyed by the enemy, such as grain and goods in shops, to pre-determined concealed locations. Secondly, the weak, the young, domestic animals, clothing, pots, bellows, bowls, dishes, firewood, etc. should also be hidden in an orderly manner. When the masses set out or move things, if there are sick, elderly, or weak people who are unable to walk, or if there are heavy objects that are not easy to move, strong men should be selected to organize stretcher teams or transport teams to assist. If there is grain, etc. that cannot be moved in time, it should also be destroyed to prevent the enemy from seizing it. For merchants, safe places should also be selected outside the village for temporary business.

Active methods: Passive methods only avoid losses. Active methods also involve inflicting various blows on the enemy. In addition to guarding the above-mentioned hiding places, the strong men must be organized to cooperate with the troops in combat. Even if some people are occasionally captured by the enemy, they should pretend to be deaf and mute and mislead the enemy, not serve the enemy, and further put the enemy at a disadvantage. Secondly, all the wells should be blocked, and paint should be poured into the ponds or upstream of nearby rivers to make the enemy suspicious and afraid to drink the water. Third, landmines and explosives should be buried in the villages, intersections, toilets, vegetable gardens, and other places where the enemy is expected to go and pass through. Bombs should be hung behind doors or on trees. Fourth, doors should be locked to make the enemy suspect that there are ambushes or explosives planted inside, and dare not enter.

III. Preparatory Work for Implementation

The "Empty Fields" policy is a difficult task. If not done well, it will not only fail to strike the enemy, but will also cause unexpected losses to oneself.

Political workers in the troops and personnel engaged in mass mobilization must, at all times, propagate and explain the significance of the "Empty Fields" policy to the people as much as possible so that the people understand. If necessary, practical exercises should also be conducted to cultivate rapid and orderly habits.

The government, troops, and people must be united and fully cooperate at all times. The government and troops must assist the people in implementing the "Empty Fields" policy with all their strength. For example, for the people's concealment work, it is necessary to organize them and make them act in an orderly manner. The safety of the concealment locations and the locations where grain is buried must be planned as safely as possible to protect the interests of the people. The distribution of food and lodging in the concealment locations and the amount of surplus grain and supplies that should be retained for the troops must be fully planned in advance to prevent the military and civilians from feeling a lack of food due to the "Empty Fields" policy. The route and time of the enemy's attack should be accurately estimated as much as possible based on correct intelligence to avoid the implementation of the "Empty Fields" policy being too late or too early, thereby affecting the safety of the people and military actions. If it becomes necessary to retreat, the people must be informed so that they are prepared. If the hiding place is discovered by the enemy, it must be protected as much as possible. When the people retreat, they must also cover up their retreat. Only in this way can the trust of the people be obtained, can genuine cooperation between the military, government, and people be achieved, and can the effect of the "Empty Fields" policy be achieved.

In summary, the government and troops must have a plan for the "Empty Fields" policy and must not panic when the time comes. Second, there must be steps and they must not flee in a disorderly manner. Third, there must be leadership and the people must not consider the "Empty Fields" policy to be a simple form of fleeing, thus losing its active political significance.

IV. Results Achieved

In October of last year, when the enemy attacked the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region; in December of last year, when the enemy attacked western Shanxi; in January of this year, when the enemy attacked southeastern Shanxi; and in other large and small battles in North China in the past, the "Empty Fields" policy was often one of the important conditions for our victory. In those places, there was always preparation for the "Empty Fields" policy. Therefore, when the sound of the enemy's attack began, the villages near the enemy-occupied areas could generally implement the "Empty Fields" policy in an orderly manner, making the enemy's march cautious and therefore extremely slow. After arriving at or occupying a place, not to mention having nothing to eat, they could not even find firewood, and as a result, they had no choice but to retreat. The retreat of the enemy in Ji County, Liao County, Heshun County, and other counties was mainly determined by our resolute combat, but the role of the "Empty Fields" policy was also very significant. Although the enemy in Wutai occupied the county seat, it was only an empty city that was of no use. Even a match was later transported by the enemy from elsewhere.

In early October of last year, the enemy occupying Fuping County in northwestern Hebei could not find a single civilian or obtain a single grain of food. They had to use a large number of trucks to transport supplies from Ding County, which gave us the opportunity to attack the enemy's supplies along the way. In the Dangcheng Wangkuaizhen area, we intercepted a large number of the enemy's supplies, making it impossible for the enemy in Fuping to stay for long. Therefore, they withdrew in parts, and we eventually recovered the county seat.

In early October of last year, the enemy attacking the Bailan Railway in northeastern Shanxi had more than 300 camels and mules in their supply train accompanying the army. As a result, they were all seized by us, and military victory was quickly achieved. These are all the effects of the "Empty Fields" policy. (To be continued)

### Afforestation in Southwestern Jiangxi: Hosted by the Agricultural College

The college's future forestry development policies are: (1) In addition to afforestation in this province, attention will also be paid to local forestry, encouraging private afforestation, promoting cooperative afforestation, and promoting afforestation in rural townships and baojia units. (2) Surveying forests and barren forests, and then focusing on cultivating firs, larches, birch, linden trees, and other timber suitable for building aircraft, as well as military wood.

### Japanese People's Lives are Deteriorating; Anti-War Sentiment is Spreading Throughout the Country; The Japanese Cabinet's Statistics Bureau Provides a Self-Indictment; First-Hand Observation by a Third-Country Writer

Twenty Months of Invasion of China: The Situation of Japanese Hardship

[Reuters, Tokyo, 14th] According to a survey by the Cabinet Statistics Bureau, the cost of living index for salaried and wage-earning classes in Japan in February was higher than in July 1937 (by 15%). The cost of living index for the wage-earning class in 24 major Japanese cities in February of this year was 115.3 (July 1937 was the base month), an increase of 0.8% compared to January and 9% compared to February 1938. Furthermore, the cost of living index for salaried classes in 11 major Japanese cities in February of this year was 114.6, an increase of 1% compared to January and 8.6% compared to February 1938.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A New York dispatch: The February issue of the Commentary magazine recently published an article by Hauser entitled "The Japanese Awakening from the Dream," describing the author's firsthand observations of the plight of Japanese soldiers in Japan and the phenomenon of anti-war sentiment spreading and causing unrest.

It first describes a wounded soldier being sent back from China. Because the soldier had broken legs and arms, he was placed in a wooden barrel. The soldier begged to be spared, but was refused and bit his tongue to commit suicide. Japanese newspapers absolutely prohibited the publication of this news, but almost everyone in the country, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, knew about it.

It then describes the tragic scene of Japanese soldiers being sent to war and the domestic control of war news. What the general public sees in the newspaper every day is the following: "Under the command of Lieutenant So-and-so, the XXX unit advanced from its position to XXX before dawn at X o'clock, occupied the walled city, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and we suffered no casualties." But it is unknown what XXX represents.

On one occasion, a soldier on the front lines in China sent a letter to his relatives and friends discussing the situation on the battlefield and the suffering from a lack of food. It was intercepted by the authorities, creating the so-called "strange incident of front-line letters." Since then, such letters have not been able to reach the recipients.

There is also the so-called "strange incident of comfort bags." Because the military wanted to boost morale on the front lines, it ordered the people to prepare comfort bags containing whiskey, cigarettes, soap, toothbrushes, books, etc., and send them to the front to comfort the soldiers. However, it was recently discovered that the comfort bags contained anonymous letters of anti-revolutionary propaganda, advising the soldiers to stop fighting, return home, and raise their wives and children. This was done by university students. Because they were discovered by the police, the comfort bags were also banned.

It then describes the abuse of wounded soldiers by Japanese military doctors and the reasons for the mutiny of the Japanese army on the Yangtze River front line, stating briefly that there were not enough Japanese soldiers, and wounded soldiers could hardly be allowed to leave the front line for too long. Therefore, as soon as the wound healed, the medical officer would order them to return to the front line. This situation was especially common in the Yangtze River, where the Japanese army suffered particularly heavy losses. Military doctors were often met with stubborn resistance, which led to mutiny. However, such incidents of discontent are all kept secret and should not be disclosed.

It further describes the various ugly behaviors of the Japanese army, such as collapsing military discipline and depressing morale, and the psychological state of the Japanese army's war weariness. It finally describes the situation of resistance to conscription and mutiny in various counties and villages, and the author's personal observations of returning soldiers with disheveled hair and dirty faces, and the uneasy state of the audience in Shimonoseki and Osaka, predicting that the Japanese people have reached the point of exhaustion. Under the high pressure of the warlords, a great revolution will inevitably break out in the near future. When the author was in Tokyo, he was allowed to visit the largest military hospital, so the situation he described is extremely real.

### Council of Academia Sinica Opens in Yunnan

[Special Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper on the 13th] (Delayed) The Council of Academia Sinica opened this morning. It was chaired by Secretary Weng Wenhao, and the atmosphere was extremely solemn. Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram of congratulations.

### The Resources Commission Develops Mineral Resources in Yunnan Province; Designates Dongchuan Mining Company to Undertake the Project; New Mining Machinery Has Been Transported to Yunnan

[Kunming Correspondence] My Resources Commission, as the foundation for building the country through resistance against aggression, recently submitted a request to the Central Government to allocate funds to develop the rich resources of Yunnan Province. This was approved by the Central Government, and 1 million yuan was allocated as the first phase of operating expenses. The Yunnan Provincial Government then allocated 1 million yuan, bringing the total capital to 2 million yuan, and a large-scale Yunnan Northern Mining Company was jointly established to develop resources. This matter is actively underway. After several meetings, the Dongchuan Mining Company, which previously had the most successful operations, was designated to take over the project. The Luoxue, Simin, and Maolu areas of Dongchuan were designated as the first phase of mining areas under its jurisdiction. These areas produce the most copper and other minerals. The latest mining machinery and materials ordered from a certain European country were partially shipped from Yangon via a certain highway on the 3rd of this month and arrived in Kunming. A large number of engineers and experts have now been sent to various areas to survey the mineral reserves. The installation of this equipment is expected to be completed by the middle of this month, and mining will begin.

### Central Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Party Affairs in Yunnan Province

[Special Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper on the 14th] The Central Government has sent Huang Shi to inspect Party affairs in Yunnan Province.

### Japanese Legislators Point Out That the People Are Panicked; Deeply Afraid of the Outbreak of War Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Questions Arise in the Japanese Diet

[Tokyo, 14th] Foreign News: Questions are arising in the Diet, indicating that general public opinion feels extremely pressured by China's heroic resistance. Yesterday, when the House of Representatives discussed the army and navy budgets, legislators raised questions one after another. Legislator Mitamura stated that the current general public opinion in the country desires an end to the war. Is this sufficient to represent the government's opinion? He pointed out that there is considerable panic in the country, and a deep fear that conflict with other countries may occur before the war against China is over, and said, "Can the war against China be ended as soon as possible in order to cope with another war?" Army Minister Itagaki replied that the government is determined to fundamentally resolve the "incident" this time, but the government cannot publicly announce in the House of Representatives how to accomplish this arduous task. He also said that if the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchuria can be strengthened, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union can be eased, but unless China's communists are completely eliminated, the threat from the Soviet Union can still hardly be avoided. At the same time, Minei replied to a question that friction caused by the implementation of Japanese national policy cannot be resolved through diplomatic discussions. The Japanese Navy should take cautious measures.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 13th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita discussed the issue of the Soviet-Japanese fishery treaty negotiations in the House of Peers yesterday, saying that if the Soviet Union disregards Japan's legitimate demands, the Soviet Union should bear the consequences. He further stated that the Japanese government is openly and firmly prepared to take all effective and necessary measures to safeguard Japanese interests and deal with substantive incidents.

### German Troops Pressure the Border; Czechoslovakia Submits Again; Syrový Dismissed, Government Reorganized; Slovakia and Other Two Groups Declare Independence

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 13th] After 8 PM tonight, a serious riot occurred in the square between the National Theater and the Carlton Hotel in this city. Police ordered large groups of Slovak nationalists and pro-independence demonstrators to disperse, but they refused to leave, shouting slogans such as "We demand independence." The police then used bayonets, tear gas, and bombs to force them to leave.

[Reuters, Prague, 13th] According to reports from Bratislava, a major riot broke out after the conclusion of a meeting of the Hlinka Guard today. Troops were dispatched to suppress it.

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 13th] Three bombing incidents occurred here tonight, killing six people. One bomb exploded on the Danube Bridge, killing two and injuring three. The second bomb exploded at a German shoe factory, killing four. The third bomb exploded on Leicester Street, with no casualties. Demonstrations dispersed at 10 AM. Mark spoke from the terrace of the Carlton Hotel, saying that he had received a telegram from Tiso, stating that "the Slovak problem has been resolved."

[Reuters, Prague, 14th] Slovakia has formally declared independence. Tiso will serve as President and Prime Minister, with Dukanský and many others who were arrested and imprisoned serving as cabinet members. Reports from Vienna state that German troops have already invaded Slovakia.

[Reuters, Bratislava, 14th] After secret consultations between the Slovak Cabinet and top leaders, Slovakia formally declared independence. The first step of the new government was to send a telegram to Hitler, appealing for assistance.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] According to reliable sources, Carpatho-Ukraine has also declared independence. The new Prime Minister, Volosin, has also telegraphed Hitler and Mussolini, appealing for assistance.

[Reuters, Vienna, 14th] German troops will enter Slovakia within hours. This morning, vehicular traffic here was temporarily interrupted as large numbers of fully armed troops passed through the streets, heading towards the Slovak border. When reporters asked a German official spokesman when the invasion of Slovakia would begin, he replied, "It is not yet time," but added, "This is certainly possible."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 13th] Diplomatic circles here have confirmed that the Czech government has accepted the demands for Slovak autonomy and the dismissal of Czech Defense Minister General Syrový. These demands were made by Tiso and Dukanský after they flew to Berlin to meet with Hitler. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler is determined to make it clear to the world that Germany will be the sole arbiter of Czech politics from now on. According to Czech sources, the Czech government has accepted Germany's demands, allowing Slovakia to become independent, and may have even allowed Ruthenia to become independent. It is said that the Slovak government will officially announce this at a meeting tomorrow. At the same time, the Czech government has also agreed to dismiss General Syrový and reorganize the cabinet. Furthermore, a Central News Agency dispatch from Prague on the 14th states that the Czech cabinet has resigned.

[Haitong, Prague, 13th] As rumors of the imminent resignation of the Czech government grow, the situation here has become even more tense. These rumors state that not only will the Czech cabinet resign, but also President Hácha will resign to take responsibility, as Hácha bears considerable responsibility for the actions of the Czech police authorities. It is said that the new cabinet will be headed by General Gajda.

[Reuters, Prague, 14th] Former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso returned to Bratislava by plane from Berlin today. A cabinet meeting was convened immediately after Tiso's arrival, with both Tiso and Tosi attending. Tiso also described the results of his talks in Germany. After the cabinet meeting, several key Slovak parliamentarians held a private meeting.

[Central News Agency, Prague, 14th] The new Slovak Prime Minister, Sidor, was originally scheduled to come here yesterday morning to hold talks with the central government's standing committee on the current situation. However, due to increasing internal difficulties, he was unable to do so. This shows that the situation is becoming increasingly serious.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Tiso and Dukanský arrived in Berlin from Vienna by special plane today. After leaving the plane, the two immediately traveled by car to the Foreign Ministry to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and then to the Chancellery to meet with Hitler. As for what Tiso and others discussed with Hitler, it is being kept strictly secret. Afterwards, an official announcement was issued, stating briefly that "all outstanding issues" were discussed. However, according to other sources, Hitler may make demands or suggestions to Prague tonight.

[Reuters, Prague, 13th] According to semi-official sources, Tiso has notified Dr. Holcha that the Slovak Parliament will be convened at 10 AM tomorrow in Bratislava, and said that Tiso's actions were initiated after meeting with Hitler. Dr. Holcha has complied. The Slovak Parliament will discuss the future of Slovakia. Germany has made three demands to the Czech central government: (1) grant Slovakia the right to self-determination and autonomy; (2) remove the current Czech Defense Minister General Syrový and the Minister of the Interior; and (3) guarantee that the German minority in Bohemia and Moravia receive full protection.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] It is widely rumored here that Hitler will make demands or suggestions to Prague today. Germany firmly believes that the Czech government will not reject them, so the entire European crisis can be avoided. It is believed that Germany's plan is to promote the autonomy of Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine and protect the lives and property of Germans. It is rumored that the Prague government will resign.

[Reuters, Munich, 13th] The large-scale movements of German troops in Bavaria in recent weeks have attracted attention from all parties. This matter is now a topic of discussion everywhere, most notably in Salzburg. The movements between Nuremberg and Munich are also quite frequent. The troop movements are all mechanized, with light artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and armored vehicles.

[Reuters, Rome, 13th] German Air Minister Göring, who has been here on vacation, suddenly returned to Berlin by car this afternoon. It is generally speculated that Göring's sudden return to the German capital is related to the Czech situation.

Germany's Malicious Remarks; Czech Government Lodges Protest

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th] Germany is now taking this opportunity to force the Czech Republic to submit, so that it can resolve the Czech problem once and for all. The Nazi Party newspapers are heavily stirring up hatred of the Czech people, in a manner similar to September of last year, when Czech-German relations were strained. The demands that Germany is considering making include: (1) the Czech government must renounce the Soviet-Czech alliance; (2) the Czech Republic must join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The Czech situation has recently been commented on by individuals close to the German Foreign Ministry, stating that the internal affairs of the Czech Republic are extremely chaotic. The faction of former President Beneš, encouraged by Roosevelt, wants to renege on the rights of autonomy previously granted to the Slovak and Ukrainian peoples. It can be seen from this that the Czech Republic has not yet learned the lesson it received six months ago. In political circles, it is said that Germany's intention is only to strengthen the autonomy of the Slovak people, and does not want the complete separation of the Slovak province, for several reasons: (1) After the province's separation, it will completely fall into the German sphere of influence. If that were the case, the world would see German foreign policy as having imperialistic overtones, and would have a negative impact on Germany's various states; (2) The Czech federal system still maintains its original form, and the financial deficit of the Slovak province can be borne by the country's central government. After separation, Germany may have to bear the responsibility for it. Another faction in political circles advocates a thorough solution to the Slovak problem as a once-and-for-all solution.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th] The struggle between the Czech and Slovak peoples is highly valued in semi-official circles here, which speak up for the Slovak people, stating that the actions of the Czech central government are completely contrary to the policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration document regarding the demarcation of the Czech-Hungarian border). The methods of the former Beneš era have reappeared today, which is beyond our country's expectations, and therefore we are concerned, with good reason. The policies led by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration were intended to build a new Central Europe and put an end to the original state of affairs in the Balkans. Who would have known that the current policies of the Czech government authorities are completely contrary to this goal, and they seem to have lost their sense of reason and responsibility.

[Reuters, Prague, 13th] The government here is preparing to send a note to Berlin protesting against the anti-Czech propaganda of the Vienna radio station and the anti-Czech remarks of the German press.

Britain and France Exchange Views; Do Not Intervene in the Situation

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Two hours after Hitler and Tiso discussed making demands on the Czech government, Halifax told a Conservative parliamentarian that the UK "does not wish to interfere with other countries together." This seems to indicate that Britain will not get involved in the complex disputes of Central Europe. After Halifax made this statement, he exchanged views with France and confirmed that the borders of Czechoslovakia, guaranteed by the Four Powers, no longer exist, and said, "Even if the guarantee were still valid, it would only apply to aggression, and not to separation."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps this afternoon to discuss the situation in Czechoslovakia. According to responsible sources, although the Munich Agreement states that the borders of Czechoslovakia should be guaranteed by Britain and France, it has not yet come into effect due to certain conditions that have not been met. Based on this, no matter how the situation in Czechoslovakia evolves in the future, Britain and France will naturally have no intention of intervening.

[Reuters, London, 13th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Czech situation, stating that according to reports he has received, there have only been minor conflicts in Bratislava in the past few days, and the overall situation appears to be quite calm on the surface.

[Haitong Agency, London, 14th] Officials here are keeping silent on the Czech situation. According to well-informed sources, Britain has no promise to guarantee the integrity of Czech territory. Even if there is an agreement on protection, it must be in response to external forces invading the Czech Republic, and it is definitely not an intervention in Czech internal affairs. For the time being, British interests are not affected by the Pressburg incident. Regarding the Czech question, the British government is maintaining close ties with the French authorities, but has not yet decided on joint measures to deal with it. The Czech government has also not sent a formal report to the British side.

### Japan Destroys North China's Monetary System; Britain and the United States Both Protest; British Under-Secretary Says Yangtze River Problem is Serious; Has Discussed Solutions with Fleet Commander

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] US Under Secretary of State Welles announced today that the United States has protested against Japan's implementation of the "new monetary system" in North China, especially against the forced circulation of Japanese currency in the hope of banning Chinese currency.

[Reuters, London, 13th] British Under-Secretary Butler reported in the House of Commons today that the puppet organization in North China has announced that from March 11, the export of twelve types of special goods will be prohibited unless they have a certificate proving that all foreign exchange has been sold to the puppet reserve bank at a price of one shilling and two pence per yuan. The above-mentioned special goods account for the bulk of North China's exports. The British government has protested to the Japanese government about this matter, stating that the currency measures implemented by Japan in North China clearly infringe upon legitimate British commercial interests.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Information has been received here that there is a pro-Japanese terrorist organization outside the Tianjin concession. The task of this organization is to launch terrorist incidents in the concession and then flee outside the concession. It is generally expected that the British government will lodge another protest with the Japanese side.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Member of Parliament Moore-Brabazon asked the government authorities in the House of Commons whether the Prime Minister would pay attention to the fact that over a hundred British nationals in Hankou now want to go to Shanghai, and that British nationals in Shanghai also need to go to Hankou for commercial reasons, and what measures would be taken to ensure their safe and rapid arrival. Butler replied that this matter has attracted the attention of Foreign Secretary Halifax, and that active measures are being taken. Moore-Brabazon also asked whether the Under-Secretary should discuss with the commander of the China Fleet whether British ships are not allowed to trade in the Yangtze River basin, and British people are not allowed to travel on Japanese ships, so that this international waterway can be reopened. Butler said, "The government, in view of the seriousness of this matter, will certainly consult with the aforementioned parties in earnest."

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The newly appointed British military commander in Shanghai, Colonel Simonds, is scheduled to depart for Shanghai tomorrow.

22 Protests Due to Losses of British Nationals

[Reuters, London, 13th] Under-Secretary Butler said today in the House of Commons in response to questions that since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the British government has filed 22 protests with the Japanese government regarding the material losses suffered by British nationals, of which 9 have received apologies, 4 have received compensation and payments, and 3 have promised compensation. When asked about the Japanese government's reply to the note on the "Open Door Policy" in China, Butler said that this was a statement by the British government based on the Japanese side's policy declaration on the Far East issue. Whether or not to reply is up to Japan, so no reply has been received to date. As for the bombing of the British hospital in Xi'an, Butler said that the hospital was hit by three bombs, and the hospital and the surrounding area suffered heavy losses. The British flag was marked on the buildings here. It is estimated that one Chinese nurse was killed on the spot. As for foreign personnel, it is said that they are all safe. The government authorities have lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government about this matter and reserve the right to demand compensation for all losses. When asked about the Japanese demand that the Guanghai Customs replace 32 positions with Japanese personnel, Butler said that the Foreign Secretary has received this information, but has not heard of the extent to which this request has been accepted. However, the British government believes that such personnel changes are purely a temporary measure, and this issue will still be seriously considered after the end of the war. Butler said that the bridge built by the Japanese across the Haihe River in Tianjin has been completed and opened to traffic on March 10. This bridge connects the Italian and Japanese concessions and is located upstream of the British and French concessions, so the British government has no need to lodge representations on this matter.

British Under-Secretary Reports on the Situation in the Tianjin Concession

[Reuters, London, 13th] Under-Secretary Butler reported on the situation in the Tianjin concession in the House of Commons, saying that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie delivered a note to the Japanese Foreign Minister on March 4, pointing out that the attitude adopted by the authorities of the British concession in Tianjin was cautious and correct, and also mentioning the various excessive actions taken by the Japanese side against the British concession. Later, he asked the Japanese government to instruct the local Japanese officials to adopt a more moderate attitude as soon as possible. Member of Parliament Peake asked whether it was correct to say that the British concession in Tianjin had gradually become a concentration camp for the Japanese. Butler replied, "No, it certainly won't be like that. However, the seriousness of the Tianjin concession will not be reduced by my reply." In response to another question, Butler said that the Zhongda Yarn Factory in Suzhou has now been occupied by a Japanese yarn factory, and went on to deny that the British factory owner, the British Ambassador, had protested to the Japanese government again, and that the Japanese government had therefore instructed the Japanese side in Shanghai again, and that a solution might be obtained thereafter. When asked if the Under-Secretary was aware that this was just one example of the confiscation of British property, Butler said that he was personally aware of the difficulties, but as far as this example was concerned, he had described his negotiation steps in detail. He hopes to obtain a solution from this.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Regarding the erection of barbed wire fences around the British and French concessions in Tianjin by the Japanese military authorities, after the British consulate lodged a protest, the Japanese authorities have recently submitted a reply, which is being studied by the relevant departments of the British Foreign Office. According to diplomatic sources, the content of this reply only repeats the previous explanation, briefly stating that the concession authorities have no intention of cracking down on anti-Japanese activities, and the Japanese authorities have no choice but to take action.

### British Foreign Secretary Discusses the International Situation; Foreign Governments Order the Spreading of Rumors; Hope that the British People Will Distinguish Facts

[Reuters, London, March 3rd] Foreign Secretary Halifax, in a statement on the international situation in the House of Lords today, said, "Lately, it has been filled with alarming rumors, and it is truly feared that some people cannot distinguish facts from rumors. This kind of disregard for facts and deliberate spreading of rumors may suit a certain type of person, but it shows that the responsibility of the newspapers is very important, especially in Britain, where we enjoy complete freedom of the press. I hope that those who write and read news will give careful consideration to reports ordered by foreign governments. As we strive for peace, we must continue to take all necessary steps to strengthen our confidence and increase our strength. We do this as other great powers do, because we want to maintain independence on equal terms, and we believe that we can build a better world together with other countries. If we are to fulfill our primary obligations to our people, we will never neglect the opportunity to cooperate amicably with foreign countries, to eliminate all misunderstandings and doubts, and to strengthen the forces working for peace."

Brief Commentary

### Congratulations to the Council Meeting of Academia Sinica

Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in the country. In the past, under the leadership of Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Messrs. Ren Hongjun and Weng Wenhao, it made great contributions to the Chinese academic community. Now that the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction have entered a new stage, all matters related to cultural work and academic thought should be concentrated on serving the cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We are pleased to learn that the third council meeting of Academia Sinica opened on the 13th. We sincerely hope that this meeting will establish the guiding principles for cultural work and academic research for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, based on the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the People's Political Council, as well as the basic spirit of the leader's recent proclamations. At the same time, it should be coordinated with the General Mobilization Outline of National Spiritual Strength, and concrete plans and measures should be formulated for how to promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, how to improve the academic research atmosphere of the people across the country, how to develop the national revolutionary cultural movement, and how to make culture and academics strive for the thorough realization of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, and should be earnestly implemented to achieve practical results. The gentlemen participating in the council meeting are not only advancing the national academic community, but most of them are also responsible leaders in the government. It is deeply hoped that during the severe and tense meeting, they will make great contributions to ensuring victory in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and realizing national liberation.

### Escalating Tensions in Soviet-Japanese Relations

The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement has expired, and the Soviet Union has decided to auction off fishing grounds today (March 15th). While the Soviet Union is determined to adhere to a position of maintaining peace and avoiding any steps that could lead to war, in the Soviet-Japanese fisheries dispute, the Soviet side is confident in its justification. Even if taking strong measures leads to more serious disputes, Japan should bear the responsibility. This is the consensus of all parties, therefore it can be asserted that the Soviet Union will not compromise today. So, what will Japan do? According to news released today, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared on the 2nd, "If the Soviet Union does not consider Japan's reasonable demands," adding, "The Japanese government has already prepared to take the most effective and sufficient measures in the event of the most unfortunate situation, and resolutely defend Japan's interests." Japanese Navy Minister Yonai also stated at a parliamentary session on the 13th, "If disputes arising from the implementation of Japanese ethnic policies cannot be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, the Japanese Navy will be forced to give it full consideration." The Japanese side's unreasonable arguments are evident from this.

So, will the war between the Soviet Union and Japan move towards an outbreak stage from today onwards? This still requires careful observation. The first thing to note is Japan's strength, which is increasingly strained in China. How can it wage war against the Soviet Union? This can be clearly seen from the questioning about the army and navy's supplementary budget during the Japanese parliament on the evening of the 13th. When Mawamura, a member of the Daiwakai, questioned how Japan could engage in war with another country, Army Minister Itagaki only replied that the government was "determined to seek a fundamental solution," and was unable to say how to resolve it.

However, we should be even clearer that Japan's loud and tough stance against the Soviet Union today is primarily aimed at stimulating domestic morale, easing anti-war sentiment, and responding to German and Italian activities in Europe, while plotting to seize opportunities in the Far East. At the same time, it is especially important to note that by pretending to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, it is spreading rumors of suspending the invasion of China, in order to facilitate the activities of pro-Japanese peace advocates, to weaken our resistance, and to facilitate its new offensive. We firmly believe that the Soviet Union will eventually deal Japan an even greater blow. We must be vigilant against the "peace" conspiracy and persist in resisting to the end.

Hong Kong overseas Chinese organizations, such as the Chinese Machinery Association, the Motorcycle Workers' Union, and related organizations, are planning to hold meetings to welcome the enthusiastic return of overseas Chinese from various places to serve the country. However, they do not yet know the arrival dates of the corps, so the holding of the welcome meeting will have to wait until the corps arrive in Hong Kong before it can be decided.

Ye then elaborated on the significance of establishing the Cartoonists Association: (1) Cartoonists occupy an important position in the War of Resistance and should take unified steps to jointly pursue the War of Resistance and nation-building, and expand foreign propaganda work; (2) In order to improve the level of Chinese cartoons, we should contact each other and learn from each other.

### A Giant in China's Pharmaceutical Industry, the Hong Kong Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory Opens Today, A New Factory in Kowloon City Hosts Guests from All Walks of Life

(Special Report) Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, a giant in China's pharmaceutical industry, has been established for more than ten years. Due to its grand scale and outstanding reputation, its operations are thriving. Recently, because Hong Kong is the center of transportation in East Asia, commerce is developed, and the population is dense, it is regrettable that there is a lack of a Chinese pharmaceutical factory that is most closely related to the health of residents.

### Robbery with Weapons in Yau Ma Tei Pak Shing Lane, Four Robbers Injured the Victim, The Huo's Wife was Injured by the Chopping in the Robbery, The Losses were Dozens of Dollars After Binding the Co-resident

At 9:00 yesterday morning, a robbery with weapons occurred on the third floor of 236 Shanghai Street, Yau Ma Tei. The victim was injured by the robbers because he resisted, and the robbers escaped with silver jewelry. The details are as follows.

The Victim Entangled and Was Chopped in the Head. Mr. Cai and his wife Huo Ba Shui lived at 236 Shanghai Street. At 9:00, four robbers suddenly broke in with sharp swords and kitchen knives. At that time, Huo and a dozen co-residents were inside. Huo saw the robbers swarming in and asked loudly. The robbers threatened with weapons and forbade them to speak. Huo stepped forward and entangled with the robbers, which angered the robbers, and Huo was chopped in the head with a kitchen knife. After Huo was chopped, he was covered in blood and was afraid of being killed, so he dared not resist.

Emptying Boxes and Bags, Searching Separately. At that time, the people in the house did not dare to move because the robbers were fierce. The robbers then tied everyone up with ropes, and then emptied the boxes and bags and searched separately. After about half an hour, they escaped with the stolen goods. After the robbers left, the people in the house sounded the alarm. The police rushed to the scene after hearing the news, and reported to the police station, and sent Huo to Jiu Long Hospital for treatment.

### Carrying a Military Knife Leaving the Camp, Chinese Laborers Sentenced to Imprisonment, Three People Sentenced to Three Months in Prison

Huang Tian, 22 years old, Guo Zhong, 23 years old, and Lu Jinbao, 25 years old, three Chinese engineering soldiers of the British Army, were sentenced to three months in prison each by the magistrate Fu of the Central Police Station yesterday morning for possessing sharp weapons and plotting illegal actions. During the court hearing, all three defendants pleaded not guilty, claiming that although they had violated the military camp regulations by carrying sharp weapons, it was entirely for self-defense. The judge then ordered the officer of the British Army camp, Mr. Hua Xishi, to testify, saying that the British Army had issued an order on March 3 to prevent this group of Chinese engineering soldiers from fighting and causing trouble outside, and that all Chinese engineering soldiers, whether in plain clothes or military uniforms, were not allowed to carry sharp weapons. In addition to the English woman, the announcement also included Chinese characters. Then the assistant inspector of the detectives, Mr. Bi Jia, testified. After listening, the judge convicted each defendant. At this time, Mr. De Jian told the judge that he was obeying the order of his superior and asked the court to pay attention to this case, because the defendant seemed to want to have a big fight with other vendors or coolies at that time. Assistant Inspector Bi Jia told Si that the Chinese engineering soldiers often had disputes with vendors or coolies recently, which affected the security of the residents. Therefore, the police authorities recently informed the British Army headquarters and asked them to order the Chinese engineering soldiers to be prohibited from carrying sharp weapons. The judge also believed that this case was serious and could not be punished more severely, so he sentenced each defendant to three months in prison.

### Stabbed in the Toilet, Sailor Tan Sheng Died Yesterday Morning, The Police Bought an Errant Boy and Will Charge Him with Murder

The man, Tan Sheng, 45 years old, lived on the fourth floor of 3 Shandong Street, Mong Kok, and was employed as a chef on the Taikoo Steamship Company's "Blue Smoke" Ship No. 3. Later, due to the Lunar New Year, he asked for leave to stay in Hong Kong for the New Year. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 in the morning on March 7, when he went to the public toilet on Canton Road, Mong Kok, a man suddenly used an axe to chop him four times in the head. The murderer fled without a trace after committing the crime. After Tan Sheng was injured, he fainted in a pool of blood. Later, the person in charge of the toilet found out and reported to the police to the scene, and telegraphed the Mong Kok Police Station. The officer on duty immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the toilet to investigate, but the murderer had fled far away and was not caught. Then he immediately called a Red Cross ambulance to the scene and sent the injured person to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The police considered this case to be a stabbing case and tried their best to hunt down the murderer, and solicited witnesses to come to the police station to report the situation at the time of the incident. Unexpectedly, the injured person died in the hospital at 1:05 yesterday morning due to serious injuries after the doctor's treatment was ineffective. The police changed the case to a murder case after receiving the news, and offered a reward of fifty yuan to arrest the murderer and deal with it severely.

### Morale Gradually Dwindling, the Relief Association Actually Adjourned Yesterday, Only 13 Groups of Representatives Attended

The Hong Kong All-Circles Joint Relief Association for South China Refugees is the general group of charitable organizations in Hong Kong. In the past, the work achievements were quite satisfactory. The association holds meetings every week, and the number of attendees reaches 30 to 40 people, which is very enthusiastic. However, since the Japanese army re-committed Shenzhen, the work of the Unified Refugee Camp run by the association in Shenzhen was forced to stop, and the association's work was declining. In recent meetings, the number of people has gradually decreased. The 39th Joint Meeting, originally scheduled to be held at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 yesterday afternoon, was adjourned because there were only 15 representatives from 13 groups present, which is a pity. As for the agenda listed by the association yesterday, although there were not many, three groups appealed to the association to assist in serving the refugees. In addition, there was a slightly more important case, which was the disposal of the remaining accounts of the Shenzhen Refugee Camp proposed by the relief team. Although this case was not discussed due to the adjournment yesterday, it is reported that the association has a lot of relief supplies in stock, and there are also 600 bags of rice. Therefore, the reporter asked the attendees for their opinions on this matter. Most of them thought that the recent rice shortage in the mainland was serious, and they planned to request that the rice be transported to the mainland to hold a price, and at the same time, they were deeply afraid that the joint relief association would disintegrate due to the seemingly different attitudes of the members. It is also heard that the next meeting of the association will reduce the number of statutory attendees by a lamp.

### Yau Ma Tei Neighborhood Jointly Organizes a One-Yuan Debt Repayment Flea Market Carnival to be Held at the Ping On Theatre on the 26th of this Month

[Special Report] The Yau Ma Tei Neighborhood, jointly organized by the Hui Yang Youth Association, has decided to open a one-yuan debt repayment flea market carnival at the Ping On Theatre in Yau Ma Tei at 9:30 am on the 26th of this month. Since Mr. Du Qizhang became the chairman of the conference, the work has become more active. In terms of the carnival, in addition to the enthusiastic participation of the China Art Troupe, the China Bookstore Singing Team, the China Amateur School Choir, and the Amateur Friendship Society Singing Team, the National Defense Drama "Road", jointly arranged by the Yau Ma Tei neighborhood associations (Youth Amusement Society, Southern Breeze Society, etc.), is also actively rehearsing and preparing for a joint performance. In terms of flea market, it is reported that there will be free charity sales in the venue. The An Le Soda Company has been rewarded with soda for the entire venue, the Nanyang Smoked Herb Company has been rewarded with cigarettes, and the Xing De Duo Sugar Fruit Public Report has been rewarded with sugar fruit. Mr. Du Qizhang has been rewarded with calligraphy and painting. Because this event is for the country, I think the overseas Chinese will definitely have enthusiastic help for this association.

Vigor is the road to life, decadence is the road to death National Spiritual Mobilization, Qi Zhuo, Various Schools Have Formulated Specific Conventions for Practice

Special Report

### Vigor is the road to life, decadence is the road to death National Spiritual Mobilization, Various Schools Have Formulated Specific Conventions for Practice

Since the war began and the fires of war have risen, we are immensely gratified by the phenomena of hard work, seriousness, and progress. However, to this day, there are still dark shadows of decadence, licentiousness, and corruption, which truly sadden us!

In response to the needs of the nation at the present stage, Chairman Chiang recently formulated the "General Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization," which was submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session and the Third National Political Council for approval, and was recently telegraphed to the whole country for implementation. The full text has also been published in various newspapers. This is the most noteworthy and exciting major event of the past few days.

Enlightened people residing in Hong Kong are even more excited about this, because we live overseas, and our lives are already extremely superior compared to our compatriots in China, and even more wasteful and decadent than overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia. This not only fails to live up to the nation, but also affects international perceptions. Therefore, various schools in Hong Kong have decided to respond to the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement in order to revitalize the spirit of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, so that everyone can be aware and the atmosphere can be changed. In the midst of excitement, the reporter went to various schools yesterday to inquire about the details, in order to report to the readers.

The methods of Zhi Yong Middle School, which has nearly a thousand students and is full of vitality, are as follows:

1. The spiritual mobilization committee is organized by the school's instructors to implement the spiritual mobilization work:
2. The first oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for the 20th of this month. All staff and students will take a general oath once a week;
3. A joint guarantee method is adopted. Under each instructor, every ten people form a group, and each group supervises each other, and each group also supervises each other. The principle of the same group is to live close to each other;
4. Every week, the instructor convenes all or part of the students under their leadership to give a spiritual speech;
5. Each staff member and student must first promote to the family and then to relatives and friends the need for spiritual mobilization and the observance of national covenants, and gather all staff and students to publish publications to carry out general publicity in the society;
6. If you violate the oath, the students in the same group will be punished with joint responsibility if they do not report it. Those in the same group who swear far away will also be given appropriate punishment. Those who can fulfill the oath and have excellent results will be rewarded;
7. The Spiritual Mobilization Committee meets once a week to review the work of the week, discuss the issue of rewards and punishments, and promote the work of the entire committee.

After obtaining the fresh methods of Zhi Yong Middle School that had just emerged from the meeting, I immediately ran to the China Amateur School. From their past style of running the school, it can be predicted that they will not lag behind in this matter. Sure enough, the following is a good way for amateur schools to implement spiritual mobilization:

"Time" At 8:10 pm on Monday, March 20, 1939, the oath-taking ceremony will be held in the school auditorium to begin implementation.

"Common Goals" (1) The nation is supreme, and the nation is supreme! (2) Military affairs are first, and victory is first! (3) Concentrate your will and concentrate your strength!

"Implementation Methods" (1) Get up early: Get up at 6 o'clock! (2) Be on time: Be one minute early for class and assembly! (3) Fitness: Participate in manual labor, clean the indoors and outdoors, exercise, and travel on Sundays! (4) Responsibility: Be brave and forward in case of trouble, persevere to the end, and never retreat halfway! (5) Study: You must read newspapers, new paintings, and magazines every day, pursue and study the knowledge and new skills necessary for the times, and strive to serve the times! (6) Economy: Do not smoke, do not drink alcohol, do not gamble, do not wear lipstick, do not wear high-heeled leather shoes, do not wear gold and silver head masters, ××××××, donate the money saved to the country!

"Spiritual Speech" Every Monday, a spiritual speech is held to boost the spirit of the whole body.

In a happy mood after receiving the harvest, I drove again to the South China Middle School, which has 1,300 students and is well-managed.

Regarding the response to the National Spiritual Mobilization, the school first decided on four such thick rules:

1. The original "special course" will be given spiritual mobilization materials, in order to deepen it;
2. Teachers and students hold individual talks, in order to target the personality of each student, so that they can thoroughly realize and move forward vigorously;
3. The student union and class association wallpapers publish special editions of spiritual mobilization, in order to discuss and abide by them together;
4. Take "National Spiritual Mobilization" as the central work of moral education in the whole school at present.

As for the specific methods, the school is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon.

When I continued to visit Guangda Affiliated Middle School, Overseas Chinese Middle School, Zhenguang Girls' Middle School, etc., they had all dismissed from school. The schools led by Mr. Zhang Lanzhou, Li Daren, and Xie Feilie also decided to respond unanimously. The Hong Kong Yuan Education Federation also held a meeting last night and unanimously passed a letter to all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, requesting them to implement the "General Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization" in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Chiang.

It is also heard that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will also implement spiritual mobilization, which makes us even more excited, because the merchants and overseas Chinese owned by the association are a large number. If it is done well, the impact will be very large. However, in view of the coldness of past donations and the recent achievements of the New Year's flower market economy movement, we sincerely hope that the advanced members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the merchants and overseas Chinese will be cautious about this move and strive to promote it!

### Jinshan Ship Sailed to Guangzhou Yesterday Morning with 40 Passengers, 18 Chinese

### Air Transport Becomes More Convenient: Hong Kong-Vietnam-Yunnan-Chongqing Joint Transportation Realized; Imperial Airways Has Obtained the Right to Establish a Station in Hanoi; Myanmar-Chongqing Line Trial Flight Completed, Scheduled to Open at the End of the Month

The plan for British Imperial Airways to establish a station in Hanoi has been realized. According to the company's announcement yesterday morning, it has obtained approval from the French Vietnamese authorities. This franchise is the result of numerous contacts between the company and the Vietnamese authorities. Hereafter, British Imperial Airways aircraft can fly to Hanoi to pick up passengers, mail, and cargo. The most important effect of the realization of this plan is that passengers from Hong Kong to inland China can now take British Imperial Airways aircraft from Hong Kong to Hanoi, transfer to CNAC or Eurasia Aviation Corporation aircraft to Kunming, Chongqing, and other inland locations. The Vietnamese authorities have granted British Imperial Airways commercial rights, but only limited the sale of joint transportation tickets. According to CNAC sources, the Myanmar-Chongqing line, which is being prepared, has undergone numerous trial flights with satisfactory results. However, due to the small area of the Lashio Airport in Myanmar after testing, there are concerns about the safety of aircraft landing there. Reconstruction is currently underway, so the opening date of the Myanmar-Chongqing route must be postponed to the end of this month. Both Imperial Airways and CNAC have dispatched aircraft to test this route, and the process has been exceptionally smooth. It is expected that the business prospects of this important international route will be promising.

### Shenzhen Rural Relief Association Leads Villagers to Promote Credit Cooperatives; Youth Training Classes Continue; Establishment of Many Schools to Benefit Village Children

On Wednesday of last week, the Shenzhen Rural Relief Association led about 70 villagers from Caiwuwei Village to convene a preparatory meeting for the Credit Cooperative. The Relief Association has now dispatched responsible personnel to assist in everything. To promote relief work, offices have been established in Luohu, Caiwuwei, and other villages. Youth training classes continue, with the number of students increasing from 15 to 25.

### East River × Plotting Restlessly; Our Army Advances Towards Zengcheng

Surprise Attack on the Prince Pit × Camp Achieves Victory; Fierce Battle at Xiancun, × Suffers Heavy Losses Again

[East River Express] The invading × troops in Guangdong have been frequently mobilizing in recent weeks. The strength of the × forces on the East, West, and North River lines has changed compared to before. According to recent reports received by military agencies, the main force of the × troops is concentrated between Zengcheng and Conghua, and there is indeed an attempt to detour north. As for the remaining × forces on various points and lines, although there have been occasional disturbances and reinforcements, they are all a kind of bluff. Currently, due to the strength of the × forces on the East and West Rivers, they are temporarily adopting a defensive posture. Our army is closely monitoring the × forces in Zengcong and attacking the × forces. The following is a record of the battle situation on the East River:

Our Army in Zhengguo Attacks the × Forces

It has been verified that our armies in Longmen, Boluo, and Conghua have long formed a strong formation, closely controlling the × forces in Zengcong. It has been verified that our army, the Huang Division of a certain army group, which is stationed in the front line area at the foot of Luofu Mountain, has repeatedly engaged in outposts with the × army after advancing towards Zengcheng. On the 10th, a Huang Shuai detachment of our army advanced towards the Taizikeng Huangshishang × formation in the Zhengguo area, engaging in fierce battles with the ×, resulting in dozens of × being killed and a large number of war trophies obtained. After the × suffered heavy losses, they bribed villagers to infiltrate our positions to scout out our strength, but our defenses were tight, and the × plot failed. Currently, our army in the Zhengguo Paitan area has adopted close communications, preparing to launch a major offensive against the × in the shortest possible time.

Fierce Battle at Xiancun, × Suffers Heavy Losses

In addition, the guerrillas in the third and fourth districts were ordered to penetrate deep into the × formation and carry out guerrilla annihilation battles. Various teams have penetrated deep into the × army's base areas and have repeatedly achieved results. It has been verified that the Dongguan First Brigade Yin Zhongming, the Liang Geng and Shen Shui companies under its command, have been active in the Longhuang Highway (the Huangyong to Shilong Highway under Dongguan) area for several days. On the 9th, more than 200 members of the team suddenly attacked the Xiancun × camp, using machine guns and grenades to shoot and throw at the ×. The × were alerted and met the attack, leading to fierce fighting. Both sides fought fiercely for about an hour, with casualties on both sides. Our team was forced to retreat due to the ×'s numerical superiority. It is estimated that the × suffered more than 50 casualties, and more than 20 mules and horses were also killed. Our side suffered more than 30 casualties. The intensity of the battle was the most seen in the East River guerrilla raids on the × in recent days.

### × Land and Sea Attacks, Daliang Falls Again; Fierce Battle for Four Hours, County Government Team Retreats to Rongqi; First District First Task Force Immediately Reinforces

[Rongqi Express] Daliang, the county seat of Shunde County, was once captured by the ×, causing great suffering. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, the × again dispatched a large force from Dazhou and Shihuxu to attack. On the afternoon of that day, Daliang fell again. The details are as follows:

Shooting Traitors, × Army Sets Fire

The Dazhou Township Pseudo-Maintenance Committee, which is close to Daliang, was established long ago under the support of the ×. The pseudo-committee members, such as Mo Qi, acted as bullies and harmed the township. On the 11th of this month, our guerrilla team sent a team to sneak into Dazhou to carry out an anti-traitor campaign. Liao and two pseudo-committee members were shot dead, and other accomplices fled. They reported to the × army. That night, more than 200 × soldiers arrived in Dazhou, claiming to search for guerrillas, but found nothing. They were angry and set fire to three locations, which burned fiercely. More than 20 shops in the township were destroyed, families were ruined, and the number of people who were brutally killed has not yet been counted.

Land and Sea Advance, Capturing Daliang

On the next day (12th), the × again mobilized 200 soldiers, accompanied by many small steel cannons, and advanced to Shihuxu. In the morning, they set out from Dazhou and Shihuxu in two routes, land and sea, towards Daliang. The × of Dazhou drove rubber dinghies, and the × of Shihuxu went by land. At 12:00, the two routes arrived near Daliang at the same time, and immediately used small cannons and machine guns to sweep intensively. Lu Ling, the deputy commander of the First Column of the First District of our Guerrilla, and Su Liping, the magistrate of Shunde County, commanded the teams and police teams to resist separately. The sound of gunfire was deafening, the cries of women and children in the city shook the world, and the residents were extremely embarrassed. After fighting fiercely until 4:00 PM, our team gradually retreated due to the disparity in numbers and firepower. The × army then captured Daliang.

Retreat to Rongqi, Yuan Leads Reinforcements

During the fierce battle, the deputy commander immediately sent telegrams to teams in various places for reinforcements. Due to the short time, the reinforcements could not hold. The Rongqi County Government also followed the magistrate to retreat to that area. The × army still wanted to advance, but fortunately, Yuan Dai's troops of the First Task Force of the First District heard the alarm and rushed to the aid from Xiaolan and assisted in the defense of Rongqi. The × did not dare to advance again. At present, the guerrilla teams of the First and Third Districts are gathering separately, aiming to attack the × people in the shortest possible time and regain Daliang. According to the people who escaped from Daliang, the × looted and plundered even more than before. Those who failed to escape suffered unspeakable harm.

### Guangzhou Suburbs, Strong Men Repeatedly Brutally Killed; More Than 100 Killed in Yaotou Township Recently

[Panyu Express] After most of the × troops near Guangzhou and Foshan were transferred, the defenses were extremely empty, so they have been repeatedly attacked by our guerrilla teams in the past ten days, making it difficult for the × to cope. At present, the × are in a state of panic, and everyone is a soldier. Therefore, in recent times, they have been extremely attentive to the strong men in our villages, and they are killed if there is any suspicion. It has been verified that the guerrilla teams in Yaotou, Geshan, Zhuangtou, Ruibao, and other townships in the southern suburbs of Guangzhou secretly lurked near Yaotou on the 6th of this month and killed more than 20 × transport soldiers. The × army then identified Yaotou Township as the base of our guerrilla team, so at about 4:00 PM that afternoon, they dispatched more than 300 × soldiers to surround Yaotou. When they entered, they searched. Whenever they encountered a strong man, they killed him. Even middle-aged women were identified as female shooters and guerrillas, and they were killed immediately. They also burned down seven or eight civilian houses. It has been verified that more than 100 men and women were brutally killed by the × in this township.

### Shenzhen Rumors Flare Up Again; Residents Move into British Territory at Night; County Government Officials Disperse, Residents Misunderstand; Traitors Take the Opportunity to Incite, Unnecessary Trouble

[Shenzhen Express] After Shenzhen suffered a tragic × air raid last month, with more than 100 houses destroyed and more than 100 civilians killed or injured, the residents were almost completely evacuated after this unprecedented disaster. Fortunately, the Shenzhen Police Department tried its best to maintain law and order, so the market order has gradually recovered recently. The merchants and people who had to enter the British territory of Sheung Shui and Fanling have gradually returned to the market to live and do business, and most of the farmers have also returned to prepare for spring plowing. However, for some reason last (13th) night, many rumors suddenly occurred, and it was reported that the × army had intentions towards Bao'an, causing panic for a time. Many people moved into British territory at night, and even on the morning of the 14th, many people continued to transport coffins and other items.

Officials Disperse, Traitors Spread Rumors

I have learned from various sources that the occurrence of this rumor was due to the fact that a part of the Bao'an County Government officials were ordered to disperse. These officials moved out of the county government on the evening of the 13th. When the residents saw this, they thought that an accident was about to happen, and the rumors were also spread by some traitors, some of whom claimed that the × aircraft would bomb again on the morning of the 14th, while others said that the × army had an attempt to attack Shenzhen last (14th) morning, causing the general public to flee in panic like startled birds.

Police Admonish, Strictly Guard Against Traitors

The Shenzhen Police Department, in order to avoid panic among merchants and people, specially dispatched patrol officers and many police officers to patrol the market last night to prevent the activities of petty thieves and traitors. On the one hand, they also admonished merchants and people not to be deceived by rumors of traitors, and suffer the consequences. As for the former Director Zeng of the Police Department, he had gone to Hong Kong on official business to meet with the Police Commissioner. After receiving this news, he immediately took a car back to Shenzhen yesterday morning to suppress the situation. The County Government also dispatched a large number of police teams to conduct strict inspections of pedestrians at various strategic road junctions to prevent traitors from mingling.

### ...Shipping Special...

The passenger ship Gove, which came from London via Marseille and Singapore to Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to arrive tomorrow morning but will now arrive at 2:00 PM this afternoon and berth at the Kowloon Wharf. The departure time to Shanghai has been changed to 10:00 AM on the 17th, two hours earlier than originally scheduled.

The passenger ship Roul Robandi, which came from Japan via Shanghai to Hong Kong, is expected to arrive on the morning of the 17th and depart for Shek Leck, Marseille, and London at noon the next day.

The cargo ship Boppe arrived in Hong Kong from Japan on the 12th and is expected to arrive on the afternoon of the 17th, departing for Shek Leck, Colombo, Bombay, and Calcutta the next morning.

The cargo ship Chumarry, which came from Europe via Shek Leck to Hong Kong, is expected to arrive at 4:00 PM tomorrow and depart for Shanghai and Japan on the 18th. The number of ships sailing between Hong Kong and Macau has now increased to more than a dozen. Apart from three or four of them being freighters, there are as many as eleven. Currently, there are Taishan, Jinshan (now going to Guangzhou), Jiaotong, Haojiang (now in dock), Guang Fuxiang (now in dock), Anli, Xi'an, Quanzhou, Tianyi, and Fu'an, totaling ten. The most recent addition is the Jiangsu of the Xijiang Shipping Company. This ship was originally scheduled to go to Macau at 4:00 PM every day and return to Hong Kong at 2:00 AM, but now it has been changed to go to Macau at 8:00 AM and return to Hong Kong at 5:00 PM.

### × Army's Restlessness Exists; Fall of Jiangmen Unconfirmed; Few Air Raids Recently; Market Prosperity Has Also Recovered

[Jiangmen News] Yesterday, the local market was rumored to have fallen. The reporter investigated various aspects and found it to be untrue. Since Jiangmen was bombed by the × aircraft a month ago, there have been few air raids in Jiangmen recently, and the prosperity of the market has gradually recovered. However, at 5:00 AM yesterday (12th) morning, before dawn, Jiangmen issued an air raid alarm, and the public was awakened from their dreams. Before long, they heard the sound of planes rattling and flew east. At about 5:00 PM that afternoon, the alarm sounded again. However, at the time, there was light rain and the sky was dim. The × aircraft flew very high, crossed the sky over Jiangmen, and flew south. When the × aircraft was far away, the alarm was lifted.

### Several Famous Actresses' Unknown Husbands

— Text

Recently, a famous banker came to Hollywood. He was not very familiar with the film industry and asked a friend to introduce him to famous movie stars.

"Well, do you want to meet Claudette Pleasman, Chin Loth, Fotini Loping, Elin Griffen, Marte Lane Estherley, Martha Louise, and Margaret Hayward?" This friend asked him.

"I've never heard of them," he said. "Who wants to see those extras? I want to see some real big stars."

Were the people that friend mentioned really nobodies? The banker's reply dismissed a great opportunity to meet Claudette Colbert, Jean Arthur, Fotini Bruss, Irene Dunne, Marlene Dietrich, Martha Raye, and Margaret Sullavan. The names the friend said all had a husband's surname added to them, and these husbands are hardly known in Hollywood.

But many of them have one thing in common: a hatred of publicity. Take Claudette Colbert's husband, Dr. Zo Pleasman, for example. When Claudette married her ex-husband, Norman Foster, the marriage was often talked about. Everything written about Claudette always mentioned Norman Foster's name because he was a film actor and publicity was very beneficial to his career. But this time it's different. After marrying Pleasman, Claudette completely changed her style. When interviewed, she never talked about her private life or mentioned her husband's name. This was all done according to her husband's wishes, because Dr. Pleasman believes that it is a great shame to make a name for oneself as the husband of a movie star. When they were newly married, he even refused to have photos taken with Claudette, but later, after she explained that every actress's husband did this, and that refusing would cause resentment from the photographers, he no longer insisted on his own way. Friends close to her say that people in Hollywood think that Claudette's job is more arduous than her husband's. Claudette thinks this is wrong. According to her, his job is much more arduous. As long as we know what her husband does, we can probably agree with her.

Dr. Pleasman is a graduate of Harvard Medical School and was an intern at the famous Bella Hospital in New York. He now works in two important hospitals in Los Angeles and has ample experience. In his spare time, he often conducts medical research, which may even refresh the history of medicine. However, what the world knows about him is only that "He is Claudette Colbert's husband." How annoying is that?

He is a handsome man, now 36 years old, with a stately six-foot figure. In every way, he is enough to attract the attention of the opposite sex. Claudette first saw him in his office. She was seeing a doctor, and he seemed to ignore the arrival of such a big star. Perhaps it was this that particularly aroused Claudette's interest. However, she had no feeling of falling in love with her doctor at that time. It wasn't until she met him by chance on the golf course and talked for a while that Claudette realized what an interesting person he was outside the office. They got married in Yuma in December 1935.

Ren Hayward also feels the same as Pleasman. Although he is one of the country's top lawyers, in public, he is just "Mr. Margaret Sullavan." What's worse is that his name is often confused with Lewis Hayward, who is also the husband of movie star Ida Lupino.

When people in the film industry mention his name, they are always accompanied by a sense of respect or jealousy. True, he often gives those filmmakers a headache, but he is also the legal representative of many film stars—Marlene Hawkins, Fleur Stan, Chin Chou Luo Giller.

Because his methods are so clever and interesting, there are many anecdotes with him as the central figure. The most interesting of these is about his selling a script. He used high-pressure tactics to force a filmmaker to pay $50,000 for a script. The deal was done, and he made a phone call to the writer. "Hey, listen, I've already sold a script for you. You'd better write it quickly." How can they not have a headache when they buy a script for $50,000 that hasn't even been started?

Ren comes from a noble family. His father was Colonel Bill Hayward. He also received higher education and earned a degree at Princeton. He often accompanied women, so before marrying Margaret Sullavan, there was a belief that he would marry Katherine Hepburn.

It started like this: Margaret Sullavan went to his office as a party to an event. It was love at first sight. He fell madly in love with her. Now they are one of the happiest couples in Hollywood. Friends say that only he can tame Margaret Sullavan's wildness.

Jean Arthur rarely talks about her unknown husband, Frank Ross, to outsiders, but recently Frank often talks about her.

Frank is an assistant producer in the production department of Harold Studios, a dark-skinned, slender man with a very good appearance. He has had many opportunities to appear on the screen, but he has refused. He feels that it is better to leave the acting to Jean Arthur.

When he first met Jean Arthur, he was running a real estate business and came to California for a trip. He was also a student at Princeton, and the friends he came into contact with on a daily basis were all wealthy and conservative people from noble families. When he arrived in Hollywood, everything was new and exciting, which made him happy. When he met Jean, he felt that she was exactly the person in his mind. Others say she is proud, but he thinks that it is just a manifestation of her shyness. Jean has a bit of an "inferiority complex", and Frank has been working hard to help her get rid of it after they became friends. (To be continued)

### Dionne Quintuplets to go to Toronto for an Audience with the British Monarch

[Reuters Ottawa, 13th] The world-famous father of the Canadian quintuplets, Oliva Dionne, has accepted a government invitation to move his five daughters to Toronto so that they may be seen by the British King and Queen during their visit to Canada. The audience is scheduled to take place on March 22nd at the Legislative Assembly Building.

### Honeysuckle

— Xiang

Roedeer Hercheson, has as many boyfriends as collecting old stamps, and sometimes passes boyfriends on to others like sending stamps. But this newly acquired precious stamp! Hall Thompson—probably won't be passed on. Originally, her three-part boyfriend-collecting symphony was "liking," "loving," and "discarding" in three stages. This time, the third part can be skipped. Not only that, but even if her mother opposes this union, she would rather leave her family than give up Hall.

King George and Queen Mary of England are about to visit America. A group of English stars in Hollywood are very excited. Among them, notable figures like Colman, Leibling, Madalyn Carroll, and Ida Lupino will jointly send a letter to the King and Queen, expressing their strong hope that the King and Queen can visit Hollywood during their visit to America. This letter will be signed by all British actors in the film city. In addition, Madalyn Carroll also sent a special cable to a prominent figure she knows, asking him to urge the King and Queen to come. If this can become a reality, Hollywood should really thank them.

### A Tour of New Tamsui

— Furan

From the recovery of Tamsui to the Provisional Administrative Committee

(1) The Enemy Rolled Away

On November 7th, the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth waved over every prominent location in Tamsui, as if shouting, "Come back, compatriots of Tamsui, the ×eight have rolled away."

Why did the × people have to roll away? The active role of the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force in their vigilance relentlessly punished the treacherous villains who harmed the country and the people. The armed solidarity of young people, workers, and peasants in various places grew stronger day by day—the greatest threat. The × people deeply felt their own weakness in military strength, feared death, and feared complete annihilation, so they had to drag their pathetic tails and roll away.

(2) Convening a Mass Meeting

Tamsui, which had been devastated to the point of near death and utter ruin, convened a mass meeting on November 12th for the sake of social order and post-disaster issues. In addition to the youth engaged in salvation work and a small number of merchants and residents, the rest of those who attended were all farmers from various villages, numbering about four to five hundred people. In this meeting of great significance, new tasks for the future were proposed:

1. Establish a Provisional Administrative Committee as the local high-level political institution.

2. Broadly launch the mass salvation movement.

3. Abolish harsh taxes and improve the people's livelihood.

4. Mobilize the masses to intensify the anti-traitor movement.

(3) The Establishment of the Provisional Administrative Committee and the Appearance of New Figures

What is the driving force of this new institution? It is nine young fellows, nine leaders of the Tamsui salvation movement. They have always struggled with an indomitable spirit of attack. During the fall of Tamsui, they fought a desperate battle against the psychology of hiding in the nearby mountain villages and compromising, surrendering, and seeking temporary safety, and fear of the Japanese disease. To ignite the flames of resistance and organize guerrillas, they had to run at least fifty miles a day like fellows.

Now, in this chaotic state, how can they have strict and vigorous arrangements and strive to implement the resolutions of the mass meeting?

1. Establish a military department—responsible for mobilizing the local masses to intensify armed organization and participate in the great ranks of the guerrillas.

2. Establish an anti-traitor department—mobilize various townships and towns to intensify armed anti-traitor organizations and establish intelligence networks in various villages.

3. Education—run schools for children in distress and universally launch night schools in various townships and towns.

4. Administrative Department—abolish all harsh taxes, implement improvements in people's lives, prohibit the export of grain and the export or slaughter of ploughing cattle, and prohibit prostitution and gambling.

The existence of the Administrative Committee was only a short twenty days before the district office was to be restored. But even in just twenty days, social order gradually recovered, and the generally displaced Tamsui compatriots gradually returned to their hometowns.

From the Provisional Administrative Committee to the Restoration of the District Office

(1) The Restoration of the District Office and its New Administrative Plan

The Huiyang County Government expressed commendation for the young fellows of the Provisional Administrative Committee who were able to come out and shoulder the arduous task in this difficult and chaotic situation. In order to respect public opinion, it again had the district administration presided over by their nine committee members, designating one person from the nine as the district chief.

For the sake of the new Tamsui and the future of the entire district, they decided on an administrative plan and mobilized the people of the entire district to strive for its realization.

In terms of financial and economic planning—they will confiscate the property of traitors, abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, save on expenses, prohibit waste, severely punish corrupt village chiefs and local bullies, civil servants will not receive salaries, stipulate a minimum living allowance, protect and assist all industrial and commercial operations and development, crack down on any monopolies and manipulations by unscrupulous merchants: assist production and consumption cooperatives and restrict usury, and handle low-interest and interest-free loans.

In the plan to improve the people's livelihood—promulgate land laws and reduce rents in accordance with local conditions, protect farmers' permanent tenancy rights in accordance with the Tenant Farmer Protection Law, and handle water conservancy and disaster relief...

In the refugee relief plan—seek credit loans from overseas Chinese and wealthy merchants to help refugees, and delineate areas suitable for reclamation in the mountain areas and distribute them to refugees from the coastal areas.

In the internal affairs plan—implement measures to punish traitors and reward traitors for surrendering themselves, protect and assist all patriotic organizations and patriotic movements, universally organize mass armed forces, give preferential treatment to families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and give full play to the active role of the Baojia system...

In the education plan—implement free primary school education, establish various cultural groups, research societies, painting exhibitions, public libraries, book circulation and supply societies...

Moreover, they pointed out that in order to realize these plans, it is necessary to ensure that district administration is not divorced from salvation work, concentrate all those engaged in salvation work to strive for the realization of this plan, district office staff should increase their initiative and set a model, and establish a strict inspection and checking system.

We deeply believe that these people will definitely gain the support of the masses, because their plan is completely based on the interests of the people, and we are also convinced that they will definitely win, because their plan will gain the support of the people.

In fact, they are already in the midst of victory. They often receive material assistance from the masses, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, and even New Year cakes, peanuts, and sugarcane during the New Year... A salvation worker from Xinxu Township wrote, "Last night, many, many people were sighing that you (the district chief) only stayed in Xinxu for two or three hours and then left. I also apologized to them on your behalf, but their hearts are still concerned about you, as if you are the lover of their people."

### Today's Battle Between Two Chinese Teams at Happy Valley; Can Eastern Avenge Their Defeat? Guanghua is More Improved Than Before, So This Competition Will Be Fierce.

[Special Report from This Newspaper] This year's football league has been contested for many months, but the championship issue for both the A and B groups remains a mystery, and it is still unknown who will win.

According to the schedule, the end of this month will be a satisfactory conclusion (the finals of other championship events will be held in April). Therefore, the General Association has scheduled the two matches of South China South vs. South China China and Eastern vs. Guanghua to be held this afternoon. However, South China requested to change the match to tomorrow (Thursday), which was approved by the General Association. Therefore, only the Hong Kong Stadium will have battles today.

This football match is quite important because Eastern still has hopes for the runner-up position. If Eastern can win today and then defeat the Navy on Saturday, the runner-up seat will not be difficult to obtain.

In the first round, Eastern was defeated by Guanghua. Both teams are more improved than before, so the issue of victory or defeat this time is quite thought-provoking. It is difficult to draw a conclusion until the end of the game. Let's see if Eastern can avenge their defeat.

The match will start at 5:15 pm. The host, Eastern, has specially revised the ticket prices, dividing them into two categories: 50 cents and 20 cents. Such affordable prices and a good show should attract many fans to come and watch. The two lineups are as follows (Taishui):

### Eighteen Good Men from Singapore China Will Arrive in Hong Kong Soon.

Appendices of Each Member's Curriculum Vitae, Departing for the Philippines on the Thirteenth, Moving to Hong Kong on the Twenty-Eighth

My friend, Qi Gong, just received an airmail from the team captain, Hui Hau Kun, reporting the departure date and attaching a paper with the resumes of all the players. According to the letter, there will be several matches in the Philippines and then a move to Hong Kong. Therefore, fearing that the players may be injured and affect their strength, in order to increase the strength of the expedition, several Chinese athletes from the ports of Perak and Selangor were obtained to participate in the expedition. Xie Qingfu, who is known as the "New Li Huitang," also set off with the telegram. A group of eighteen people, led by Shen Guantou, took the Victoria Italian postal ship on the thirteenth of this month to start their journey to the Philippines. After finishing the matches in the Philippines, they will arrive in Hong Kong on the 28th. On the 1st, 2nd, and 5th of the month, there will be a total of three matches. All locations are at Jia Mountain. The team was originally invited by South China.

The eighteen good men include experienced veterans and energetic up-and-comers. Looking at each resume, except for the two reserves, the rest are all veterans. All are representatives of the Malaya Cup international competition. General... and each resume below (player... years old)

### The Chinese Sports Association Held a Meeting Yesterday and Decided to Hold a Charity Match for the British Relief Fund. It Wants to Invite the Singapore China Team to Participate in the Charity Match, But It Will Be Decided After the Team Arrives in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong Chinese Sports Advancement Association held a meeting in the Hua Yuan Conference Room at 5:30 pm yesterday. Among those present were Zhang Minquan, Chen Ziqing, Ye Guanyan, Mo Qing, Lin Shaohua, Shi Puhuan, Lin Zhonghao, Li Zijun, Zeng Jinghou, Zhou Runnian, Lu Xiafu (painter), and many others. Chairman Zhang Minquan, Mo Qing and Chen Ziqing successively reported on the process of the Governor's Cup competition, stating briefly that the Association's Chinese United team won two battles and two victories, and won the championship for two consecutive sessions. The two games earned a total of more than 4,300 yuan. After deducting expenses, it obtained more than 3,600 yuan. However, since this number must be divided equally with the Football Association, the actual amount obtained by the Association is about 1,300 yuan. The results are not weak. At the same time, the financial situation this year is also better than in previous years. After the report was completed, the following motions were discussed: [1] Publication of the annual report, [2] Date of the next election of staff members, [3] Whether there are any amendments to the constitution, [4] The British Relief China Branch requests to hold a charity football match, [5] Other matters.

[1] Regarding the issue of publishing the annual report, Chairman Zhang Minquan recounted the needs of the annual publication, and the public agreed and passed it. Zeng Jinghou was immediately elected as the director, and Li Zijun, Ye Guanyan, Lin Zhonghao, and Lin Shaohua were members of the group to handle the annual publication.

(2) The date of the next election of staff members was decided to be April 14 (Friday) in the Hua Yuan Conference Room.

(3) Regarding the amendment to the constitution, the chairman suggested that it be reserved for the new staff members to discuss when they take over, and the public agreed and passed it.

(4) Chairman Zhang Minquan said that on the day of the Governor's Cup final, Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote came to present the awards. He requested the Association to hold a charity football match for the British Relief Fund. He personally felt that it was his duty and agreed to the request. It is now heard that the Singapore Chinese football team will come to Hong Kong at the end of this month. If they compete against the strong teams in Hong Kong and persuade the entrance tickets in advance, the results will be good. If the visiting team has funding problems, 20% can be allocated back, and the remaining 80% will be used as a charity. It is not impossible. Please ask Football Minister Mo Qingjun to handle it. According to Mo Qing, he had previously received a letter from the Singapore team saying that the team would only arrive in Hong Kong on the 26th or 27th of this month, and they would have to return to the south in early April. The time issue is a big consideration, and it is not easy to be sure whether the team will agree to this proposal. Yu believes that the best way to weave it is to wait for the team to come to Hong Kong and ask for their opinions before making a decision. As a result, it was resolved to hold a charity sale, with Mo... responsible for organizing the event.

(5) The Hua Lian team won the championship in this year's Cup, but the first starting team and the second starting team were very different. In order to commemorate the meritorious service of the first starting players, the Association decided to issue awards. The names of the winners are as follows: (1) ...Jun Gan, (2) Yang Shuiyi, (3) Hua Qingcai.

### Fierce Battle Against the Lin Zhen Brothers; The Li Huitang Team Lost But Was Still Honorable; Only Four Singles Matches Will Be Held Today.

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Continuous dog days of rain interrupted the tennis matches. The weather turned cold yesterday, and the court was dry, so many doubles and singles matches were held. They were also very competitive, especially the doubles match between Li Huitang and Yao Dezhuo against the Lin Zhen brothers, which was quite spectacular. The Li Yao team first showed their power and won the first set. Therefore, in the second set, neither side would give way. However, the Lin Zhen brothers finally won the set with their skills and formed a 1-1 tie. There was a decisive battle in the third set. The Lin Zhen brothers finally won the final victory with their habitual cooperation and consistent connection.

Yesterday's Results

### Looking Back and Ahead

— Lai Duanfu

South China's victory over Eastern was a good opportunity for South China to demonstrate its skills after the heavy rain, but it was a fatal blow to Eastern. The matter is now past, so let's not dwell on it. Now, let's talk about two points that people haven't discussed. First, both Eastern and South China are national armies. Why did some people set off firecrackers in the stands near the sea after Eastern's crushing defeat? If the firecrackers were not set off by Chinese people, then Westerners would have no reason to be happy about South China's victory. If they were Chinese, why would they express schadenfreude towards a national team? What kind of heart is inside the person who set off the firecrackers? Second, why did Liu Qingcai suddenly miss an important game? This is also something worth pondering.

"Chili Boy" Guo Qi changed his style to play as a forward and was surprisingly effective. According to his performance that day, he was even better than Liu Liancai. Xu Jingcheng, who is known for his courage, sometimes couldn't handle him, and Hou Chengxian was also jointly monitored by him and Mai Shaohan and couldn't do anything. For a while, the audience was surprised. In fact, this is not surprising, because Little Guo is also often a forward in small-scale games. He is familiar with it, so it is natural for him to be proficient. It's a pity that he is too short, otherwise he could have become a perfect forward.

If Eastern doesn't adjust Xu Jingcheng and reorganize the forward line, I dare not compliment them that they will improve in the future. If the forward line can get back a Zou Wenzhi-like inside forward, and Chen Bingtu practices cutting-in and shooting skills more, then Eastern cannot be underestimated. I am now thinking for them again and feel that Luo Weiquan is a right-sided player and should be an inside defender, just like his brother Wei Min. Although Zeng Zhongyun is good, he is still better as a defender. If they cannot get back a Zou Wenzhi-like player, I think they can change their lineup as shown in the table below, and I guarantee they will have a great harvest next season.

Liu Xianhan

Miao Huaguo Luo Weiquan

Xu Jingcheng Song Lingsheng Zeng Zhongyun

Cheng Tao Wu Qixiang Li Deqi Liu Shiqin Chen Bingtu

Eastern must be careful today when they play Guanghua. Guanghua also had a very good performance when they played South China. Since Eastern has shown a spirit of not giving way when playing South China, Guanghua naturally has the psychology of striving for the top at all costs. Guanghua's inside defense is strong on the right and weak on the left, but the forward line is weak on the right and strong on the left, which compensates for each other, so it is not weak. The forward line is more even than Eastern, and the high-speed offense is even more terrifying. With Eastern's forward line without Xu Jingcheng, it is still questionable whether they can withstand Guanghua's fearless forward line. I hope that Eastern will work hard and win another game to win the runner-up title.

Eastern's game against the Navy this Saturday is a great opportunity for them to win when the Navy is in decline. I hope they will work harder. If they can score one or two goals first, victory will be guaranteed. However, Liu Xianhan must be careful of the Navy's long-range shots. Don't be careless. The Navy's close-range shots are inaccurate. Although it is difficult to guarantee that Eastern's forward line will not be attacked by the heavy and aggressive Navy East for close-range shots, I am worried about Eastern because of this.

South China will play their first game at the Boundary Street pitch this Saturday and must be careful. At that time, I also hope that the police and civil servants will remember that they are colleagues and only show their skills and not rely on brute force, because although brothers are quarreling now, South China will still have to defend against the communists in the future and strive for the top.

Kitchee should try their best in the game against the 30th Artillery Battalion. After winning, they will compete with the Air Force team for the runner-up title. Work hard, the future is bright.

The England team lacks football players and has even recruited four players from the second division. The Great China team should win by a large margin, especially since Li Huitang has agreed to play because it is a charity match, so victory is even more guaranteed. The person who set off firecrackers after the Eastern vs. South China game, why not save those firecrackers and set them off on Sunday? It would be more meaningful.

### Confessions of a Smoker

— Lv Ping

From the green velvet case of Three Castles cigarettes, I took out the last one, silently lit it, and shared one final kiss with it. The longing for a life of pleasure gradually disappeared into the light smoke, like cotton or mist. After more than ten years as companions, we parted ways in silence.

Indeed, cigarettes have been with me for more than ten years. According to general explanations, the benefits of smoking for people are that it can increase thinking and restore fatigue, while its drawbacks are that it stimulates nerves and damages the stomach. I love smoking, but not because it is beneficial to me. I am announcing a final farewell to it, not because I am afraid of the nicotine that is harmful to the body.

I met cigarettes in the social interactions of friends and fell in love with cigarettes in the enjoyment of life.

Recalling a life of wandering, in a life of indulgence, cigarettes were indeed my inseparable friend for a moment. When the lights were bright and the wine was green, it hung weakly on my drunken lips; in occasions of wild revelry, it helped my eloquent posture; when bored, watching the changing light smoke could pass half a day; when troubled, facing the flashing flames could make me forget everything. Just as the cigarette manufacturer's advertisement says: "They Satisfy," I smoked because I enjoyed life, and because I smoked, the enjoyment of life was even more satisfying.

I love cigarettes, but I have spent a lot of courage and perseverance on my passion for them. My wife was the first to object to my smoking, but I thought this was the effect of oxygen, and I didn't pay attention to her. My doctor determined that smoking was the main cause of my heart disease, and repeatedly advised me not to smoke, even comparing cigarettes to floods and fierce beasts, but I was not subdued by his intimidation. Within the principle of not considering the pros and cons, I lived sweetly with cigarettes for more than ten years.

I have always prided myself on being a confidant of cigarettes and also admitted that cigarettes are my lover. However, I finally shared one last kiss with it before saying goodbye forever.

Rather than saying that cigarettes are disappointed in me, it is better to say that I am disappointed in cigarettes, because I found that I did not really understand cigarettes and often insulted them.

When I found that there was only one cigarette left in my cigarette case, which was a symbolic sign that my spiritual food supply was almost empty, I reached into my pocket to take out a banknote to find a replenishment at a stall on the street. My fingers first touched a letter that M sent me, which suddenly reminded me of a passage in the letter.

"We traveled from ×× to ×× again on the 26th, walking for four days and four nights, and the mountain roads were very rugged, but all of us reached our destination without missing a single person. We were hungry, thirsty, and tired, but fortunately we got help from the people, who provided us with tea and meals very enthusiastically. A township office official even gave me a cigarette made of local soil. I was so grateful that I almost cried."

A deep impression was turning in my mind. I seemed to see the tears of gratitude hanging on the corners of the eyes when smoking that local cigarette. Cigarettes for M, and M for cigarettes, they both suggested the true meaning of enjoyment in the integration of life.

This made me suddenly aware of my half-life of ridiculous self-satisfaction. Do I love cigarettes? In fact, I have insulted cigarettes. Am I satisfied with a life of pleasure? What a pale and decadent life!

In the gears of the great era, everything is refined into useful things. Cigarettes, which are usually considered the possessions of hedonists, will also have such a glorious page as M encountered at a certain time.

Whoever is still obsessed with pleasure insults cigarettes, and whoever insults cigarettes is a sinner of the great era.

I took out the last cigarette and gave it a final kiss with awe, in order not to insult you anymore, and in order to cherish myself, we say goodbye forever. Goodbye, cigarettes! Goodbye, that half-life of pleasure!

### Remembering Mr. Cao Juren (Part 1)

— Wu Zijin

I. A Blue Bamboo Cloth Gown

Mr. Cao wears a blue bamboo cloth gown all year round and a pair of unpainted black leather shoes; sometimes perhaps a pair of black cloth shoes. This society originally emphasizes appearance, so he suffers in this regard.

At banquets and even when lecturing at Jinan University, old-fashioned guests and young master-like college students invariably identified him as a low-ranking servant, a waiter. He said humorously: "Sometimes I really want to put on a neat Western suit and wear a pair of old-fashioned glasses." But from beginning to end, he remained in that bamboo cloth gown, regardless of lush spring, humid summer, desolate autumn, or severe winter.

This person makes people respect him. In the overall picture, the word "plain" must be emphasized for him.

II. The "Mouse" of Scholarly Pursuit

To use a phrase from Anatole France, this person is a "mouse in the library." This not only means that he devours books extensively, but also that his scholarly pursuit is as "refined" and "detailed" as a mouse.

This person grew up in piles of old books. Naturally, he spent a lot of energy on "old paper." But he is not a submissive prisoner of this "national treasure." On the contrary, he handles it like an impartial and alert judge.

There are people in the world whose vision is like a vegetable oil lamp, holding all the ancient books as the Bible, shaking their heads and humming incessantly, unaware that they are being fooled. This person despises this kind of pedantic teacher. Carlyle said: "Readers are inferior, thinkers are average, observers are superior." Scholarly pursuit cannot do without the ability to discern. Pedantic teachers only know how to read blindly, without any spirit of questioning, spending their whole lives reading, but the whole pile of ancient books turns them into inferior Confucian scholars. "A scholar or a licentiate," he said, "are all ignorant peddlers." Isn't this comment excessive?

The second type of scholar that he despises is the "book cabinet" who "absorbs knowledge like the desert of the Gobi absorbs water, but cannot spray a single drop of clear spring onto the ground." It is said that when this person was studying in Hangzhou in his early years, he admired the old scholar Dan Bu'an very much, but the belief that "lasted for twenty years" finally collapsed completely because this Mr. Dan was a book cabinet.

"Mr. Dan Bu'an and I were together for the second time in the West Lake Provincial Library (1927). This meeting completely destroyed my faith in him. He was so knowledgeable, but he didn't have a bit of his own understanding. He read a lot of books, but never formed a system." (Literary Essays, My Reading Experience.)

The French essayist Michel de Montaigne ridiculed this kind of bookworm as someone who needs fire and goes to a neighbor's house to get it, but sees a pile of roaring flames there and stays to warm himself, forgetting to bring it home. ("Do we consider it finished when we preserve other people's opinions and knowledge?" he asked rhetorically: "Even if our stomachs are full of meat, what good does it do us if we cannot digest it, if we cannot transform it into ours, if it cannot increase our development and strength?" (See Education) The most important thing in reading is to never lock the dregs of other people's thoughts into your own mind. Montaigne was so learned and had such a thorough understanding, which made people admire him, and that is the point.

Mr. Cao is also this kind of reader. The admirable aspect of his scholarly pursuit can be summarized in his own words: (1) Always doubt other people and ancient books; (2) Have the courage to betray your own father and teacher; (3) Organize my own system of thought. (To be continued)

### On Human Desire

— Xiang Tian

The Mirror of Reading, Volume 9, quotes Yang Shen'an as saying:

"Generally speaking, people are born from emotions, how can they be without emotions, but it should not be excessive."

This explains the fundamental reason why human desires should exist. The sages' emphasis on nourishing the mind with few desires and restraining emotions is precisely a mutual illustration. Since there are human desires, there must be eating, drinking, and procreation. Talking about women's rouge, lipstick, dancing, and romance is indispensable, because this is a reasonable expression of the existence of human desires. To put it in modern terms, "the whole life," and the War of Resistance Against Japan is no exception.

Last year, I wrote an article about a young refugee from Shanghai who drowned in a swimming pool in Hong Kong, which was strongly opposed by a certain group of people. They said that the War of Resistance should not affect life, and that life during the War of Resistance should not be restricted. They gave reasons that they thought were very reasonable, saying: "The people of Madrid under the madness of bombing still sit in theaters watching movies!"

This reason, which they were very confident in, once overturned my previous views and made me confused for a long time. So I read American magazines that specialize in printing pictures of women's thighs, researched the wonderful methods of applying women's nail polish, and theories about women's socks, dancing, etc., because I thought it seemed that the people of Madrid were also doing this. The other day, I read a predecessor's notes, which said, "The wind and moon of heaven, the flowers and willows of the earth, and the songs and dances of people, without these three, the three talents cannot be formed." It seems that romance, flowers, willows, songs, and dances should all be actively studied, otherwise the "three talents" cannot be formed. So with reason added to reason, I became even more certain.

However, I still have some doubts as to what to do after talking about romance, flowers, willows, songs, dances, women's gloves, high heels, and stockings. Is it to pursue them deeply, or to talk about them idly? Or after talking about them idly, run to the battlefield to dream? These things I still do not understand.

### Ode to the Hero

— Huang Lu

The sword is broken, the gun is rusted,

The warhorse is tired,

The battle robe is torn,

Your body is also injured,

But ah, your heroic spirit is still the same,

Your eyes are like a prairie fire,

Burning our hearts brightly.

You, the hero of freedom!

May you recover soon,

Pick up brighter swords and guns again,

And return to the battlefield!

### On Storytellers

— Latte

Every evening when there is no wind or rain, in many streets and alleys, there are often middle-aged men who make a living by telling stories, each occupying their own spot, narrating stories from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Many of the working masses in the neighborhood regard these storytelling places as places to relieve their spare time and boredom, or as places to recover from their day's fatigue.

Yes, many of the working masses in the neighborhood, whether young, middle-aged, or old, all feel that listening to stories seems to be a right that they should enjoy every evening, and taking out two or two copper coins from their wallets seems to be a duty that they should fulfill. The storytellers also seem to have already possessed their audience and should fulfill their own functions and try their best to sell their voices.

We certainly believe that, for a period of time, these countless audiences in the neighborhood were once numbed in the head by absurd and bizarre magical legends, bizarre, colorful, and low-taste wild histories. In the eyes of someone who is truly educating the public and striving for the public, he would undoubtedly feel very dissatisfied, because of this. It is also difficult to avoid the fact that storytellers have been despised and scolded by people with knowledge and insight.

However, at this moment, the war is at its peak and has been attacked from all sides, and has already transformed the content told by these storytellers. What they talk about, and what we can now hear, is mostly the reality of the people's guerrilla war, interesting stories of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the situation of the Soviet Union's assistance to China, the war history of the Spanish anti-fascists, the Chinese anti-traitors, the conspiracy against the advocates of peace, etc. All kinds of news, both domestic and foreign, have been transformed by them into fresh and vivid storytelling material. The bloody warfare of the Chinese nation and the great tide of international anti-fascism make this progressive transformation undoubtedly an effective aid for the propaganda of the War of Resistance.

However, we still need to be meticulous in observation, analysis, and strict criticism.

When we listen to the entire content they are telling from beginning to end and observe it carefully, we can discover that their grasp of all parties' affairs and their understanding of the reality of the battle are still very vague, and sometimes even distort a certain part and fabricate a certain part and become harmful teachings to the War of Resistance. This will have a bad impact on countless working-class audiences, which truly cannot but make us vigilant.

Friends who are sincerely doing salvation and propaganda work, now that the second phase of War of Resistance propaganda should be intensified to reach the masses, and now that we should find more assistants for propaganda work, how should we suggest, contact, and encourage these storytellers who are undergoing transformation to correctly carry out War of Resistance storytelling? This should also be said to be our topic, and it is also a part of the propaganda work we want to complete.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Be brave, courage is the seed of all success!"

This voice was carried by a gust of wind into his ear. He woke up, as if he had just woken up from a dream, shuddered a few times, and then, he deliberately pressed his index finger tightly against the trigger of the pistol in his pocket, walked briskly to the end of the path, and entered the door.

Inside the room, a glance, it was as if it were a miniature of the Roman Pantheon, illuminated by the wall lamps as bright as day.

He compared everything he saw in the room with the pictures he had in his memory. He immediately knew where the door was; so, like a familiar family member, he knocked on the door and went in.

The house was gorgeous; all the furnishings looked like they had been done by a European home decorator. The pale green light was covered with a pale green lampshade, and the lampshade was embroidered with dark green medieval Roman patterns around it. On one side of the wall, a fireplace was burning, and the raging fire had already reddened the door of the stove, constantly scattering messy red stars. The color tone and warmth of the room made people feel like it was a season between spring and summer. However, in this small world isolated from the cold and sorrowful world, its owner was not seen, and, apart from him, there was no one else.

In an instant, the snow brought on his shoulders and under his boots completely melted into water droplets, some disappearing into the barely visible threads of the seams of his clothes, and some falling on the impermeable floor.

The moment now is as long as a year in the past.

He paced anxiously, waiting; finally, he was somewhat disappointed. But he was unwilling to leave in disappointment. Regardless of success or failure, he had to get one of the results in his heart.

When he saw the leather coat on the coat rack and the overshoes under the bed, he believed that the owner had absolutely not gone out even two steps. In his disappointment, hope gradually revived.

Almost five minutes passed, and there was no sound of footsteps coming from outside the door; the only thing he heard was the sound of a piano in another room, as if someone was practicing a piece they were playing for the first time: sometimes it was an incomplete rhythm, and sometimes it was a fragmented scale. Therefore, he thought:

"Is it her? Is she playing the piano?" (7)
