### The Question of Revising the American Neutrality Act

In his address to the 76th Congress, President Roosevelt, while advocating for democracy and criticizing dictatorship, also proposed revising the Neutrality Act. He said, "The Neutrality Act, in its current form, is sufficient to facilitate aggressor nations and disadvantage those who are being invaded, and must be revised." Indeed, the current American Neutrality Act, under the present international circumstances, is truly a redundant burden. It is insufficient to protect the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, and it passively encourages the atrocities of aggressors, causing its own legitimate interests to be repeatedly encroached upon. Recognizing this, the President has once again put forward the proposal for revision in this session of Congress. This is not only desired by those who are being invaded, but also a necessary measure to safeguard all the legitimate interests of the United States.

The current American Neutrality Act was formulated in 1935 and revised in 1937. In the autumn of 1935, when the Italian-Ethiopian War was about to break out, American isolationists, in order to prevent the United States from repeating the mistakes of 1917 and being drawn into the vortex of war, hastily passed this Neutrality Act in Congress. Its main points are: (1) When an international war breaks out, the United States should prohibit the transport of weapons and ammunition to belligerent countries; (2) Prohibit foreign ships from transporting such goods; (3) Prohibit American citizens from traveling on belligerent ships; (4) Crack down on belligerent submarines in American waters or territorial waters; (5) Restrict American ships from supplying belligerent warships from American ports. Such content has many drawbacks. In terms of the most significant ones, firstly, prohibiting the export of munitions to all belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are aggressors or being invaded, is tantamount to weakening the resistance of those who are being invaded, while passively encouraging the atrocities of aggressors. Secondly, the term "munitions" has a broad meaning, making implementation quite complicated. Thirdly, lending money to belligerent countries was the main reason why the United States was drawn into the vortex of war last time, but this is not regulated in the Neutrality Act. Therefore, this Neutrality Act cannot prevent the invasion of the United States by war.

In legal terms, an international war must go through the process of a declaration of war. Although the Italian-Ethiopian War did not go through the process of a declaration of war, it cannot be denied that it was an international war, so this law could still be applied reluctantly. However, now the world is changing, and things often happen unexpectedly. Following the Italian-Ethiopian War, there was the Spanish Civil War, which contained an international war within a civil war. Under this form of war, this law lost its effect. Therefore, the United States revised it in January 1937, prohibiting the shipment of munitions to both sides of the conflict in Spain, on the grounds that the war in Spain was sufficient to spread beyond the borders of Spain. Furthermore, the Japanese invasion of China, which began on July 7, 1937, was also an undeclared war. Although the American government did not implement the Neutrality Act because the two countries, China and Japan, had not formally declared war, Wall Street financial giants violated the wishes of the majority of the American people, undermined the traditional American policy in the Far East, and subsidized the Japanese invasion. As a result, it increased Japan's ambition to monopolize China and seized American interests in China.

American politicians with foresight have long been calling loudly, pointing out that the American government must adopt effective methods to stop the atrocities of aggressors. President Roosevelt's request to revise the Neutrality Act is a preliminary way to sanction aggressors.

The floods of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans can no longer withstand the atrocities of aggressors. It is impossible for American isolationists to want to stay out of all wars. Only by actively taking effective methods to stop aggressors can world peace be maintained and their own legitimate interests be preserved. Now that Congress has just begun, we deeply hope that both the Senate and the House of Representatives can accept the President's opinion, thoroughly revise the Neutrality Act, eliminate all elements that are unfavorable to those who are being invaded and favorable to aggressors, and more actively proceed to stop the atrocities of aggressors! (Editor's note: Regarding future Sino-American relations and the general trend of the Pacific, there is another interview in this newspaper with a well-known Chinese diplomat, see page 3 of today's newspaper, please pay attention.)

### The So-Called "Three Principles" and "New Order"

— Zhu Jiahua

On the eve of Japan's imminent launch of a large-scale war of aggression against China, its Prime Minister Hirota, in a speech to the parliament, put forward the so-called "Three Principles" toward China, namely: (1) Recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria; (2) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation; (3) Joint anti-communism. Later, Ambassador Arita came to Nanjing with these principles. No matter how much he threatened and intimidated, China remained unmoved. Because China not only had to firmly defend its own position and maintain the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, but also could not accommodate the arrogant demands of the aggressors, so as not to affect the status of friendly countries and hinder the rational progress of East Asia.

Everyone should not forget that before Hirota's speech, on April 17, 1934, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eiji Amau, issued a statement: (1) Japan has a special relationship with China, so its attitude toward China is different from that of other countries; (2) In order to maintain stability in East Asia, Japan has no choice but to take independent action toward China; (3) Japan opposes China's use of the power of other countries to resist any actions by Japan; (4) Japan resolutely opposes any foreign country that gives China technical or financial assistance and forms a "co-management situation." If we compare the "Amau Statement" with the "Three Principles," what is very striking is that Japan wants to reduce China to its protectorate, while at the same time wanting to eliminate all the rights and advantages of other countries in East Asia.

The eight months of China's heroic resistance has shouldered two missions: defending the country and safeguarding human justice. China is unswervingly committed to this. China has discerned Japan's conspiracy without any doubt, no matter how the Japanese warlords or their spokespersons try to cover it up. China is not confused by it at all. It is precisely because of this that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statement on December 22, that he wants to establish a "New Order in East Asia"—"The so-called New Order in East Asia means close contact and mutual assistance in politics, economy, and culture among Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China to prevent the Red Peril, uphold Oriental civilization, and remove economic barriers, so that China can break away from its semi-colonial status in order to achieve stability in East Asia"—this kind of self-deceiving old tune is commonplace, and the Chinese people are not surprised by it. This is nothing more than a repeated explanation of the "Three Principles" and the "Amau Statement," and is only part of the interpretation of Tanaka's Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia.

What is surprising is that after Tanaka's Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia was announced, some friendly people were even dubious, thinking that Japan's aggression plan was not so extensive. However, as the facts have gradually evolved to this day, the ferocious face of the Japanese warlords has been fully revealed. It cannot be denied that Japan wants to destroy China, and Japan especially wants to dominate East Asia.

Without any doubt, as Chu Chung-tsou said in his memorial to the throne: "To conquer the whole world, one must first conquer China." Conquering China is merely the means by which Japanese warlords launch attacks on the whole world. And now they have begun to challenge Western countries.

Japan has excluded the rights and interests obtained by friendly countries through treaties in the occupied areas of China, and at the same time has repeatedly stated that "Open Door" no longer applies and the Nine-Power Treaty should be revised. As for the protests from the United States, it deliberately equivocates and does not give a direct reply. Its contempt for everything is obvious and needs no speculation.

Aggression is rampant, and no one is spared. China has realized this, so it does not hesitate to fight alone. Friendly countries have also realized this now. Even if it is a little late, it is still not too late. Therefore, the beginning of the parallel actions of Britain and the United States has made Japan anxious. If we want to achieve the actual effect of sanctions, it will not be effective if we do not strike them in time. In the past, we have allowed Japan to grow in power. From now on, we should not have a moment of appeasement. Otherwise, everything will be destroyed, and there will be no way to repent. As China enters a new stage of intensified resistance against aggression, let us offer this intention of mutual encouragement to our friendly people.

### The Largest Salt Field in Sichuan - Zigong in the Tide of Resistance

— Wu Xue

Sichuan has twenty-six salt fields. Zigong is the largest salt producing area in the entire province. It began to prosper after the Taiping Rebellion. At first, water buffaloes were used to push brine (incubate water), but now it has progressed to using machines to push brine. The East and West fields have a total of eight or seventy machine-driven wells. When approaching Zigong, you can see the towering derricks of the Lianggao Mountain tombs in the distance, with smoke filling the sky and the sound of machines roaring. This already has the appearance of a large factory. Compared with the Wutongqiao salt field, which is still in the stage of primitive industry, it has made great progress. Here, salt is burned by using the earth's core gas. The salt wells here produce fire after the water is pushed out. Some wells produce fire (gas) at the same time as water, but the water in the wells that produce fire is less salty and has less salt content. The gas fire is extremely beautiful. It is led out of the ground through pipes, and when it is lit, it burns with a flame like alcohol. The heat is very high. A tongue of flame that looks only a foot long can burn four or five hundred catties of salt in a day and night. At most, one well can produce eight or nine hundred heads of water, which can burn eight or nine hundred pots.

I had been to Zigong three years ago. At that time, transportation was not as convenient as it is now. The roads from Jingnei (Neijiang to Zigong) and from Zigong to Weiyuan, Rongxian, and Dengjingguan were only completed in the last year or two. The salt producing area here is divided into East and West fields. In the East field (Zigong), the salt area south of the Dafengbao Lianggao is the most abundant. In the West field (Gongjing), the areas of Changtu Aiye Nanshanzizui are the most abundant. Zigong is more than ten miles away from Gongjing, and there is a highway where cars can travel at night. It is said that Zigong City will be officially established on New Year's Day next year, and a municipal preparatory office has already been established.

Since the start of the War of Resistance, the reed salt has been invaded, and the two Huai areas have fallen. Zigong's position in the salt industry has become even more important. Many industrialists from other provinces want to invest and develop here, such as Fan Xudong's Jiuda Refined Salt Company's relocation to Sichuan. A large-scale refined incubation plant has already been established in Zigong.

Currently, in order to meet the requirements of the War of Resistance and the needs of the rear, production must be greatly increased. Since September of last year, production has increased from approximately 280,158.41 dan (approximately) per month to approximately 427,717.07 dan (approximately) per month. This is indeed a small help to the country's harvest. However, after the retreat from Wuhan, the sales market on the Chu shore (Hubei) has been somewhat affected. Therefore, under the large-scale increase in production, they are now greatly feeling the distress of sales channels.

Zigong is not a very large city. There is only one bustling street. Originally, it was only a township. However, it has all the conditions of a city. There are banks, hotels, bathhouses, theaters, beautiful barbershops, and also debauchery and luxury. There is a Sichuan opera house, where tickets cost five jiao and are often sold out. New plays such as Nanhua Hall's "Legend of the White Snake" are often performed. Some ladies need to see Tian's "Spring Thoughts" and the boat scene of the White Snake Fairy in "Legend of the White Snake." The War of Resistance does not seem to have much to do with them.

### The Views of Foreign Correspondents on the Sino-Japanese War

— Translated by Chen Shengzhi

Since the second phase of our continued resistance, the Japanese have deeply felt their national power gradually declining. If they do not seek an armistice soon, they will be unable to extricate themselves. Consequently, they are running around everywhere clamoring for peace. Recently, the Japanese authorities, seeking instruction from foreign "China expert" journalists, specially convened a so-called "International Correspondents' Field Symposium" at the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai last winter. Those invited to the meeting included people from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. The Japanese originally hoped to obtain praise for their military achievements from the mouths of foreign reporters, but unexpectedly they were severely criticized by the reporters from various countries, greatly embarrassing them. Even the German reporters, their fellow sufferers, found it difficult to defend Japan's actions. This shows that justice resides in the hearts of the people, and righteousness will not be extinguished by the deception of aggressors. The original article was published in the December issue of "Chuo Koron," and is specially translated here for the enjoyment of our readers. --Translator

Japanese Reporter, Special Correspondent of Chuo Koron, Koichi Komorita (hereinafter referred to as Komorita): Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedules to come here today. Due to the fall of Wuhan, the situation of the Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage. On this occasion, I sincerely hope that foreign correspondents can express some fair opinions from an "objective perspective" on the current issues and future prospects of the Sino-Japanese Incident as much as possible. Mr. Steuck is here, having just arrived from Wuhan not long after its fall, I wonder what insights you have on the Sino-Japanese Incident?

Mr. Steuck, Hankou Special Correspondent for the German People's Observer (hereinafter referred to as Steuck): How long the fourth phase of resistance of the Chinese side can continue is another question. In fact, the resistance is still proceeding according to the established policy, and it is not impossible to continue it. At the second meeting of the National Political Council held in Chongqing shortly after the fall of Wuhan, Chiang Kai-shek stated in his report that the Chinese army should induce the Japanese army to penetrate deep into the western provinces and implement a decisive battle when it occupies geographically superior conditions. Whether this strategy is appropriate is a question. However, I believe that the Chinese army can satisfactorily achieve the goal of attrition warfare by inducing the Japanese army to penetrate deep into the interior. Although the Japanese army's heavy artillery and other modern equipment have exerted considerable power, if they penetrate deep into the mountainous areas of the interior, not only will heavy artillery and new mechanized units be useless, but also the attacks of large warships on the Chinese formations will be impossible. They (Note: referring to our authorities) believe that once the Japanese army penetrates inland, the equipment of the Chinese and Japanese armies will be largely the same, except for airplanes. Moreover, the Chinese side not only has an overwhelming abundance of human resources that can be used for combat, but also attempts to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army with a comprehensive guerrilla warfare. Currently, on the surface, China relies heavily on Soviet aid, but Chiang Kai-shek may not want 100% cooperation with the Soviet Union in his heart. As for the Communist Party, figures such as Zhou Enlai are more realistic than some of the key figures of the Kuomintang.

Komorita: Please Mr. Woodhead, comment on the whereabouts of the Chinese government after the fall of Guangdong and Wuhan.

Mr. Woodhead, Editor of the British Oriental Times (hereinafter referred to as Woodhead): The successive loss of the four major cities of Guangzhou, Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang in a matter of days is indeed a major blow to Chiang Kai-shek, but to this day, it cannot be proven to be a fatal blow. China has not doubted its strength to resist Japan; Chiang also retains the trust and support of the people. Needless to say, the scope actually covered by the "Chiang regime" has shrunk, and it is currently isolated due to the interruption of foreign transportation, and the transportation agencies are also very weak. However, this cannot be said to be a "sign of the collapse of the Chiang regime." No, he cannot tolerate unconditional peace, and there is a reason for that. We should say that in the places Chiang Kai-shek has lost, not only his prestige but also the area where his power still reaches.

What changes will happen in the near future, there is no time to elaborate now. Assuming that the National Government is truly weak, I think the first thing that must happen is signs of a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. That is, the Communist Party moves to the northwest, relying on the Soviet Union as the only supplier of military supplies and continues to resist Japan; on the one hand, Chiang and his party take Guizhou or Guangxi as their base, and maintain contact with the outside world through Yunnan, and still resist Japan to the end.

The Japanese government's decision not to take Chiang as the opponent at all, is nothing more than intending to point to Chiang's defeat, but in fact makes peace negotiations difficult. Most foreigners doubt whether this decision is a good strategy. Removing Chiang is by no means the demand of the Chinese people, but rather strengthens unity with Chiang as the center. At this time or in the near future, if Chiang resigns, the political chaos will undoubtedly be worse than it is now. It is naturally not a policy unique to Japan to propose a specific person as the target of the enemy. Kaiser during the European War was like this, and recently Hitler also adopted a similar tactic towards Czech President Benes. However, this tactic must be premised on the fact that a certain individual has more power and power than he actually has. In the event that Chiang resigns, China's anti-Japanese front may not collapse, nor will the National Government necessarily fall.

Komorita: What does Mr. Hoster think about the same issue?

Mr. Hoster, Deputy Editor of the British North China Daily News (hereinafter referred to as Hoster): Although they believe that the "Chiang regime" has become a local regime, in the eyes of independent foreign observers, this may not be the case. The "Chiang regime" is still retreating militarily, and the continuous loss of economic centers is a fact, and it is also a fact that the area where Chiang now has military power, financial resources, and general national support is shrinking, but his back is still supported by the high tide of national anti-Japanese sentiment. Financially, it is consolidated beyond expectations by donations from overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese all believe that the current Chiang regime is the only government that presents the defense of China's sovereignty and establishment. Because overseas Chinese trust government officials - such as Chiang Kai-shek - they will undoubtedly continue to provide spiritual and financial assistance. There are many rich overseas Chinese, and they certainly interpret Japan's continental movement in the worst possible way.

It is said that the Chiang regime is receiving assistance from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries, but it is more certain that the assistance from any country is not as powerful as that from overseas Chinese. It is also a fact that these facts cannot be ignored in the decision of Chiang's future policies.

But under what circumstances is it easiest to cut off the assistance of overseas Chinese? First, when Chiang yields to Japan. When he is considered a weakling; second, when he is too radically left-leaning and enters into an open alliance with the Communist Party and the Soviet Union.

Komorita: What about the Chinese national movement after the outbreak of the war?

Mr. Gu Rand, Chief Writer of the American Shanghai Evening Post (hereinafter referred to as Gould): Regarding the strengthening of Chinese nationalism, no other external force is as effective as Japan's war against China. Since the revolutionary period of 1926-27, the Chinese people have begun to unify the regime to resist warlord politics, and it has been strengthened.

As far as I know, the Japanese have made a big mistake in their view of the degree of development of the Chinese national spirit. The Japanese always think that the character of the Chinese is individualistic, not based on the interests of the country and the nation, but focusing on one family and one clan, that is, a nation that cannot regard the country as a family. Perhaps the Kuomintang has made many mistakes, but the fact that it is actually more progressive than the old warlord politics has not been recognized by most Japanese people, who think that China is still a country dominated by warlords. This misunderstanding really cannot help the mutual understanding between China and Japan.

Many people know the fact that China has been in a state of military chaos for many years, but at the same time, they ignore the fact that the Chinese themselves are working hard to improve this state and are progressing well. I believe that in the process of national rejuvenation, not only Japan, but also Britain, the United States, and other powers, have a tendency to exclude foreign oppression, and China is no exception. The majority of Chinese people have not only strengthened the national movement because of this war, but also have a strong tendency to the left. If the war continues in the future, there is no doubt that a major trend will occur in China's future.

Komorita: What position do the Chinese intellectuals take now?

Gould: What position do the Chinese intellectuals take now? This is no longer a question. (Omission) They are now in a period of national crisis, and they only have one hope. I think this is something that the Japanese rarely understand. The divergence of political understanding between China and Japan can only be resolved on the basis of justice. If Japan, as in the current military situation, wants to win everything by force, and wants to seize China with the blood of life, it can be said that the Chinese intellectuals will devote all their strength to communism. This has become an inevitable trend. If the Japanese intellectuals stood in the position of today's Chinese intellectuals, would they be able to take a different attitude?

Komorita: Isn't this a declaration of the Communist Party's ambition after the fall of Wuhan?

Mr. Cumming, Representative of the German Press: The best breeding ground for the Communist Party's thoughts and actions is a chaotic era. The current Chinese army is mostly guerrillaized. The Chinese Communist Party takes advantage of this opportunity to instill communist ideas, teach red tactics, and popularize them among the general public as much as possible. This sign has begun to develop. The Communist Party has already taken command of some of the guerrilla forces. The aspirations and determination of the guerrillas are also influenced by this Communist Party central organization. In the future, it will undoubtedly be completely subordinate to the so-called Red Army headquarters in Shaanxi. Even in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, new bases of the Chinese Communist Party have been secretly established, starting to win over the people in the rear. However, whether the strength of these Chinese Red Army and the Communist Party will expand and strengthen from now on is difficult to answer affirmatively. Whether it succeeds or not depends on the attitude of the local people on the one hand, and on the political and military capabilities of the response on the other hand. Chinese farmers, if they are not given a strong organizational force from behind, will never rise up automatically to resist the red forces.

I think the only way to prevent the spread of this chaotic state and to prevent the expansion of the Red Army and the Communist Party is to stop the hostile acts as soon as possible and seek a just solution between the two major nations of East Asia.

(A section on economic issues is omitted. Translator)

Komorita: Finally, standing in a third party position, what kind of expectations do you have for China and Japan for the restoration of "East Asian Peace"?

Mr. Ivant, Acting Editor of the British "Finance and Commerce" magazine: How to achieve lasting peace between China and Japan? This is the most important issue. I have been traveling between China and Japan since 1905, and I have very good feelings for the people of both countries. I believe that China and Japan should coexist and prosper with the most friendly attitude, and I think this is not impossible. The fault cannot be pointed to any one party alone. There is no room now to detail the Sino-Japanese relationship, nor to mention the past state and the problems that are considered in the future.

I think permanent peace can only be obtained as a gift of cooperation. This kind of cooperation is not born, not from friendly understanding, nor from force, oppression, or obedience. "Cooperation" means to work together automatically towards a common goal.

What I will never forget after living in the Far East for many years is the real cooperation between China and Japan about thirty years ago. At that time, Chinese entrepreneurs, especially tobacco manufacturers and printing operators, recruited Japanese technical consultants, allowing Japanese investment. Groups of Chinese youths with lofty aspirations went to study in Japan, and Sino-Japanese cooperation was progressing naturally and invisibly. We saw such a situation with our own eyes thirty years ago. Later, the Chinese National Revolution occurred, followed by the World War. At that time, Japan's actions, as I saw them, had reached the end of Sino-Japanese cooperation and entered the era of rule. China's so-called anti-Japanese sentiment also occurred at this time. You should know that the issue of the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, which encountered the most severe damage to Sino-Japanese relations, has not had the opportunity to be adjusted. Although the greatest efforts were made at that time, trying to use diplomatic means to improve the cracks in Sino-Japanese relations. However, the results were hindered by people who did not believe in anything but force, and tended to fail.

Konoe, Kawagoe, Arita, the late Yoshi, Honda Tai Taro, Sato Naotake, Yuki Toyoiro, Yoshida Seiji, Enda, Ozaki Yukio and other people issued warnings long before the outbreak of the current incident, emphasizing the re-understanding of China; however, "double diplomacy" brought very unfortunate results. China's anti-Japanese sentiment became more popular and激ran due to Japan's attitude. At the translation meeting in February 1937, Ozaki gave a speech saying: "If Japan really wants China's friendship, it should frankly express it."

If you ask me how to establish a permanent peace between China and Japan, my answer is to first ask Japan to implement the advice of the above-mentioned leaders. There is no reason for China and Japan to abandon each other. Neighboring comrades with many common points should of course have friendly relations. I think this must also be the hope of the majority of the people. However, who is hindering the close relationship between these two countries? Why has China's anti-Japanese sentiment been at its highest in the past few years, especially since 1931? First, we must see the cause of the friction, remove the cause of the friction, and then we can wait for the arrival of permanent peace. If the Japanese government can accommodate the advice of the enlightened people and work hard in the best direction, I believe that the Chinese side will definitely repay her with a real agreement.

Komorita: What is Mr. Hoster's opinion?

Hoster: Achieving peace in the Far East by force may be possible in these few years. Historical proof shows that peace based on the concept of terror is not permanent. After a thorough whipping, China may yield temporarily, but Japan cannot make the Chinese forget that their "rice bowl has been broken." (Omission) The ideal of Greater East Asia has been shattered by recent events. Many observers have seen: "East Asia for East Asians" This slogan can no longer be applied to the Chinese, because the Chinese are suffering from the aggression and slaughter of fellow East Asians. Standing in China's position, I am afraid that the first slogan to be shouted is "China for the Chinese!"

Komorita: You don't seem to understand the true meaning of the "holy war." What is Mr. Gould's opinion?

Gould: No matter in the Far East or anywhere else, permanent peace cannot be obtained except for the peace of justice. Of course, the idea of the word justice varies from country to country, but the facts are the same. For example, the Japanese think that they have adopted a fair attitude towards China, but the Chinese do not think it is fair. The only way to solve this correctness is to exchange positions, think from the other side's perspective, and reflect on whether "do not do to others what you do not want to be done to yourself." In my opinion, Japan imagines the challenges and attacks from China and other countries too much; on the contrary, it does not recognize that seizing the territory of other countries and destroying other countries, even if it is peace, will not be permanent peace. Although Japan has stated that it is ready for peace, it is questionable whether the power of the military can agree to and implement the covenant. Japan may think that the great powers are doing their best to support China, but the fact is not necessarily so. I think what the great powers hope for China is that China can become a free and independent country, and can open its doors and allow the great powers to trade in notice. What the great powers are uneasy about is Japan's monopoly of China's industries, resources, and markets, and excluding its trade with China and its trade in China. I have heard many responsible and high-ranking Japanese say that this is just the worry of the Chinese and foreigners, and I hope that the uneasiness of the border is a worry, so we dare to look forward to the arrival of real peace. But the matter (to be continued)

### Central Authorities Deliberate Daily on Improving Local Administrative Structures, Provincial Chairmen in War Zones to Be Appointed Special Officials, Provincial Assemblies Limited to Establishment by Early March

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 11th] The responsible parties are discussing the nationwide administrative improvement in detail, which is conducted daily. It is heard that the main points of the content are to adapt to the war of resistance as the highest principle: the chairmen of various provinces in the war zone, concurrently managing military and political affairs, will be promoted in status and changed to specially appointed officials. The salaries of county magistrates will also be increased. Among the various provincial provisional assemblies, only two or three provinces have reported the lists on schedule, and most of them are rushing to handle them. The authorities have decided to order them all to be established on March 1. It is heard that XXX will also concurrently serve as the chairman of a certain province.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The Executive Yuan held its 397th meeting the day before yesterday and passed the following appointments and removals: (1) He Lian, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, resigned from his position to take up a full-time position at the Agricultural Credit Administration, which was approved. Pan Guanzhi was appointed as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) Liu Ruming, Member and Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Committee, was removed from his positions in this meeting, and Shi Yousan was appointed as Member and Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Committee [Editor's Note: This report first appeared in this newspaper's special dispatch from Chongqing on the 8th]. Furthermore, Zhang Lisheng no longer concurrently serves as the Chairman and Acting Chairman of the Chahar Province; (3) Gu Xigu of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee has other appointments, and his vacancy will be succeeded by Leng Xin. In addition, the Executive Yuan dispatched Song Ziliang, Lu Zuofu, Qin Fen, Xu Kan, Yu Dawei, Wang Jingkan, Huang Bingwei, Zou Bingwen, and Duanmu Kai as members of the Joint Committee for Water and Land Transportation on the 10th, and designated Song Ziliang as the chairman and Lu Zuofu as the vice chairman.

### Japanese Plot in the Northwest Becomes More Urgent, Japanese Troops in Northern Shanxi Increase Sharply, Conspiring to Exploit Complex Ethnic Relations, Risking a Lone Army to Invade Shaanxi and Gansu

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 11th] The Japanese attempt to invade the Northwest is becoming more active. In the northern Shanxi area, the transport of Japanese troops is endless. Judging from the situation, they plan to invade Hequ and Pianguan, risking a lone army to invade Shaanxi and Gansu, and also plan to exploit the complex ethnic relations in the Northwest to achieve a successful gamble. We have already seen through the Japanese intentions and are making strict preparations.

[Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 10th] (Late) According to reliable information from the front, after our army withdrew from Guaji County on the same day, it relied on the new tactics and strategies of "He hits west, I hit east," and separately detoured, flanked, and surrounded the Japanese, so the Japanese were never able to settle in Guaji County. Our army took the opportunity to counterattack and indeed recaptured the county seat after a fierce street battle on the evening of the 8th. Another part of our army counterattacked Daning, responding to the counterattack on Guaji County, and also completely recaptured the county on the evening of the 7th and the morning of the 8th, and then took advantage of the situation to advance towards Xiangning and Puxian. The Japanese army abandoned the city and fled upon hearing the news, and our army is still pursuing them in victory. This is the recent victory of our army in Shanxi Province.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in a Certain Area of Shandong Province on the 11th] For days, Japanese reinforcements have been arriving from their home country and South China. Their purpose is either to conduct a large-scale "suppression" of the guerrillas in Shandong Province, or to resume the offensive to the west, in order to occupy the un-occupied part of the Longhai Railway, and then invade Xi'an to cut off the Sino-Soviet transportation line. At the same time, the Japanese also plan to invade Tongguan from southern Shanxi, and have been continuously shelling across the river from the Fenglingdu area for days, as if waiting to be ready to invade Shaanxi in two directions.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in a Certain Area of Shandong Province on the 11th] According to a telegram from Qingdao, since the 1st of this month until now, a total of fifteen transport ships have arrived in the port from Japan, carrying at least 6,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers are now stationed in the Huiquan Hotel and various public places. Recently, several trains have left for Tanxian and other important points in the interior.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shanghai on the 11th] The battle between our army and the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi is extremely fierce, forming a tug-of-war. Today, many Japanese planes went to Yangcun and Baishui, the intersection of the Nanchang Highway and the Yuehan Railway, and bombed heavily. Our side lost 200 people, but the Japanese infantry advancing after the air raid was severely attacked by our side and failed to succeed at all.

### Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Shipped to Shanghai, Taiwanese Sugar Imports Increase Tenfold

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 11th] A certain Japanese newspaper here claimed that the import of Taiwanese goods into Shanghai has been increasing continuously. Some goods are similar to those made in foreign countries. An investigation shows that Taiwan's imports in 1937 were only 5,000 tons, but last year they reached 50,000 tons, ranking first among all imports and threatening the controlled market. It is said that Taiwanese sugar has lower costs and is easier to import, making it a strong rival to Java's exports. It is also said that Taiwanese fruits and vegetables now have a large export prospect and will be able to occupy the position of Singapore's products. Osaka Shosen Kaisha is reportedly planning to increase passenger and cargo traffic between Shanghai and Taiwan to make it easier for products from both places to be imported.

### US Ambassador Discusses Construction of Chongqing-Burma Road in England

[Reuters, London, 11th] Before returning to the United States on the liner "France," US Ambassador to China, Johnson, had a frank discussion with our reporter about the Chongqing-Burma Road. He stated that it only takes twelve days to travel from [China] to Burma. The driving time is short, the road surface is excellent, and the gradient is not steep. It can accommodate two cars traveling side by side, and it is currently being widened. Some sections of the road surface were washed away by mountain floods and are being urgently repaired, making them more solid than before. All wooden bridges have now been replaced with stone bridges. According to the US Ambassador, the road can already supply the necessary transport. When this road was built, 150,000 laborers were used, making the greatest possible use of local materials and animal power. The US Ambassador and his military staff had to bring their own camp beds during their travels, but European-style guest houses are gradually being added along the way. All road signs have been installed. The US Ambassador traveled from Rangoon to Magha by Imperial Airways plane and then came to England. He did not talk much about political issues, but expressed surprise at Wang Jingwei's peace movement, because when he was in Chongqing, he did not perceive this trend at all.

He also said that although the Soviet Union has not yet been able to display its military power in the Far East, China has received much moral and material assistance from the Soviet Union in the eighteen months since the start of the war of resistance. Sino-Soviet relations are becoming closer.

### League of Nations Council to Hold Meeting Soon to Discuss Sino-Japanese Dispute; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables Instructions to Representatives; Puppet Regime Denies Anglo-American Loans to China

[Our Correspondent, Chongqing, 11th] The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on the 15th of this month. It is reported that the appeal we submitted regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute has been included in the main agenda of this session. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cabled our government's policy to Representative Gu and others, instructing them to report to the Council when the time comes.

[Reuters, Beijing, 11th] Today, the Provisional Government issued a communiqué stating that the puppet Provisional Government refuses to bear any responsibility for previous Anglo-American loans to the Nationalist Government.

Britain Takes Active Measures to Protect Interests in China

[Reuters, London, 10th] The British government is preparing to take active measures in the near future to protect British trade and aid China. British newspapers are widely reporting on this news. The "Birmingham Post" stated that "The British government will announce measures to protect British interests in the Far East after Parliament reconvenes." Informed sources believe that this move is highly likely in practice. The "Financial News" stated that the government is currently seriously considering two actions: one is to directly provide financial assistance to the Chinese government, and the other is to take various steps to directly strike at Japanese trade and finance. However, the newspaper learned that part of the difficulty in Britain's adoption of commercial retaliation lies in the opposition of certain interested parties in the autonomous regions, because they have huge interests in trading metals and wool with Japan. It has also been learned that the United States cannot take commercial retaliation against Japan because of the interests of maintaining the trade of gasoline, cotton, scrap iron, and machinery. However, the British government's attitude is becoming increasingly tough and knows that diplomatic protests will be fruitless. This is undoubtedly the case. Legally, Japan cannot prevent Britain from assisting China. However, in view of the fact that Britain wants to directly protect its interests in the Far East, it is believed that the British government will issue Japan a note identical to the one issued by the United States to Japan on December 31st of last year. This is the last protest before Britain takes truly severe measures.

US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees Discuss Economic Sanctions

[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] US Ambassador to China, Johnson, arrived here yesterday. Although he claims it is entirely a private trip, the government believes he is related to the Anglo-American economic sanctions against Japan. It is reported that before going to the United States, he will meet with business leaders involved in trade with China, and if possible, he will also exchange views with political figures. Upon his return to the United States, the US Ambassador will report on the situation in the Far East to the US President.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees are scheduled to hold separate meetings in the coming days to discuss economic sanctions and amendments to the Neutrality Act. Regarding the former, some members of Congress are now advocating economic sanctions against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman is one of them, declaring that "If there is someone who can be forced to respect your rights by means of starvation, why must you necessarily execute him?" Republican Senator Borah expressed his opposition, saying, "Economic sanctions are by no means a peaceful measure, but a preliminary step to war. If I am not prepared to fight, I do not want to implement sanctions." Which faction's position will prevail will be revealed when the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees begin their discussions.

### Military, Political, and Diplomatic Developments Before the Outbreak of the Second Stage of the War; Completion of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Scheduled Within Nine Years; Relations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Now Increasingly Harmonious

[Our Correspondent, Chongqing] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the war of resistance against Japan has entered its second stage, from the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to the fall of Huangzhou and the abandonment of Wuhan, which was the first stage of the war. Although the fighting on all fronts is currently quiet, our various military units are all engaged in replenishment and preparation, transferring troops and generals. The second stage of the war is about to begin. At this critical juncture, the situation in various aspects is recorded as follows:

Current Situation: Recently, the situation in the Sino-Japanese War has converged from all fronts into two major centers: South China and the Northwest. In South China, the Japanese army occupies Guangzhou, blocking transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, in order to cut off our foreign aid. They are also attempting to invade Guangxi along the West River and attempt to land at Beihai, going straight to Nanning and Longzhou, seizing Zhennanguan, and cutting off our border transportation to achieve their blockade purpose. In total, the Japanese army now has a strength of 240,000 troops in the Southwest. The Japanese claim to have 300,000 troops. However, due to strategic considerations, the Japanese army is eager to engage our army in a major decisive battle in South China, in order to avoid being heavily surrounded. Recently, Ando, the Japanese commander in South China, broadcast a challenge to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Our army was unmoved and continued to steadily advance along all lines according to the original strategy, avoiding a direct conflict with the Japanese army, and gradually pushing forward, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop and prolong the duration of the war to wear down the Japanese army. However, a major war in South China will be inevitable in the short term. The Japanese army will be driven out of Guangdong and Guangxi. As for the Northwest, the Japanese army's original plan was to invade with a large force during the winter when the Yellow River froze, attacking Xi'an and reaching Lanzhou to cut off the international route from China to the Soviet Union. In total, the Japanese army concentrated 160,000 troops in various strongholds in the Northwest. However, before the Japanese army launches a large-scale offensive in the Northwest, it must first eliminate the guerrilla forces in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, in order to avoid being threatened and endangering their retreat. Therefore, five divisions were surrounded by guerrilla forces in Shanxi, and their military function was almost annihilated by our army. Although the Yellow River has frozen, the Japanese army has not dared to rashly invade the Northwest due to various reasons. As for Central China, the Japanese army has found progress difficult, and their forces have been frequently transferred. The Japanese army is actively working to recover Wuhan.

Military Deployment: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek held a military conference in Nanyue, he made new decisions on the overall strategy in Chongqing. In order to facilitate the issuing of orders, the Military Affairs Commission was moved to Chongqing to oversee the military affairs of the South China and Northwest theaters of war. A Southwest Headquarters was established in Guilin, with Bai Chongxi appointed as director, responsible for all military affairs in South China. [To be continued]

### Famous Diplomat Returns Home From the United States; Discusses the Situation in the Pacific; Makes Important Revelations About Sino-US Relations; Criticizes Advocates of Peace for Betraying the Nation Based on the International Situation

(Exclusive Interview by Our Newspaper) A certain famous Chinese diplomat recently returned home from the United States. Our reporter made a special visit to his residence in Hong Kong to inquire about Sino-US relations and the situation in the Pacific. He provided the following remarks:

"Since the outbreak of the August 13th Sino-Japanese War, US government officials, from President Roosevelt downwards, have expressed sympathy for us. However, American public opinion mostly believes that while deep sympathy is permissible on a moral level, they still oppose sanctions against Japan in terms of action. The only exceptions are a segment of the intellectual class and the labor class, as they have advocated a tough stance against Japan from the beginning.

The relationship between the labor class and the capitalist class is like that between sedan carriers and the person sitting in the sedan. Even if the sedan carriers strongly want to take a certain route, they are powerless if the person in the sedan does not agree. Now, even the person in the sedan is starting to adopt a tough attitude, for two major reasons: (1) American commerce in China has been almost completely squeezed out by Japan. American merchants in China have never dared to criticize Japan, but now they have to explicitly demand government assistance in the name of the Chamber of Commerce. We must know that many of the American merchants in China are agents of large companies in their home country, and therefore have great influence domestically. (2) Since Japan began its war against China, it has drained no less than three-quarters of its cash reserves. Therefore, American merchants believe that Japan is no longer a prime customer, and they might as well be a little tougher. The reason they still have some reservations is that Japan still has some surplus gold reserves, and they cannot help but "play along."

The United States is a democratic country, not a dictatorship. Before the US President makes a major policy decision, he must first examine the support or opposition of public opinion. But while the US President does not have the power to force public opinion, he does have the power to influence it. Roosevelt's "Quarantine" speech in Chicago was a tool to test domestic public opinion. (His advocacy of convening a nine-nation conference in Beijing was a tool to test international public opinion.) He then realized that about seven out of ten people opposed it, so he did not dare to act rashly. However, he still sent two battleships, taking advantage of their trip to Australia to participate in a ceremony, to Singapore, the British naval base in the Far East, implicitly indicating the possibility of Anglo-American naval cooperation, giving Japan a significant jolt. But at that time, American opinion still largely expressed opposition, but there was no such intense reaction as after the "Quarantine" speech was delivered.

As a result of Japan's atrocities against China and its monopolization of commerce in China, American public opinion gradually supported the government, which became a fact. During this period of evolution of public opinion, if a major incident suddenly occurred in US-Japan relations, such as the bombing of the Panay, it could easily trigger a serious conflict, even war. I still remember that after the news of the bombing of the Panay reached the United States, American public sentiment was extremely high, and the government was determined to fight at all costs. If the Japanese government had not quickly apologized and acknowledged compensation, war would have been unavoidable.

Speaking of the international situation in the Pacific, there is one important key, which is Anglo-American cooperation. In my observation, the relationship between Britain and the United States will become even closer in the future. First, the Anglo-American commercial treaty has been signed, and economic relations have greatly improved. Second, the war debt problem will inevitably be resolved soon. It can be asserted that previously, Britain and the United States were unwilling to initiate anything regarding the Far East war, preferring to observe the situation and act when the opportunity arose. Now there has been a change, that is, the two countries are adopting parallel policies, working hand in hand, and will never shirk responsibility from each other. This can already be seen from the recent Anglo-American loans to China. As for naval cooperation between the two countries, it is even more believable. Generally speaking, the defense line undertaken by the British navy in the Pacific starts from Singapore, goes southeast through Australia and New Zealand, and ends at Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America, while the American defense line starts from San Pedro in California, goes southwest through Hawaii and Guam, and ends at Manila. At the same time, Britain plans to form a Pacific Fleet to be permanently stationed in Singapore, while the United States will organize an independent Pacific Fleet to prevent Japan. We must know that Britain has so far only the North Sea and Mediterranean Fleets, which are used to defend against Germany and Italy respectively, while the Far East Fleet is only in its infancy. The US Navy is stationed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, relying solely on the Panama Canal as a channel of communication. Once war breaks out, it is also difficult to take care of each other. Furthermore, in terms of the strength of the US Navy, although the tonnage of US and Japanese ships differs by a ratio of five to three, in terms of combat power, it was close to a ratio of five to six just two years ago. In other words, although the tonnage of Japanese ships is not as good as that of the US, their combat power is greater. Generally, the prime of a warship is 18 years. After that, it becomes old and worn. The United States did not have a large-scale shipbuilding plan after the Washington Naval Conference, while Japan was actively carrying it out, so its combat power was not as good as Japan's. It was not until two years ago that the United States began to actively expand its navy, spending a total of 1.5 billion yuan last year, and this year it will be doubled. In addition, with the naval power of Britain, it will be sufficient to deal with Japan.

The formation of a fleet is no easy task. Building a warship takes two years and costs tens of millions, and the organization of a formal fleet must include 125 to 136 warships of all sizes and supplementary ships (generally seven battleships, eight heavy cruisers, twelve light cruisers, and the rest destroyers, torpedo boats, and transport ships). The plans of Britain and the United States are both actively underway, and they should be completed within two or three years. At that time, Japan can be dealt with at will. It can be seen that the international situation in the Pacific today is indeed improving. Why should we be so eager to make peace with Japan, so that even if Britain and the United States want to help us, there is not enough time?" The reporter finally asked, "Since the US naval power is expanding day by day, and there is British assistance, would Japan really dare to start a war with the United States?" He replied, "That is not necessarily the case. After all, Japan is a country ruled by madmen. When madmen are in power, what is impossible?"

### Anglo-Italian Talks Begin; Chamberlain and Others Arrive in Rome Yesterday; Mussolini Hosts a Grand Banquet to Welcome Them

[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 11th] Before 8:00 this morning, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived in Turin, and transferred to a special train decorated with flowers directly to Genoa. They arrived at 10:00. The Italian government delegation and Genoa city officials all went to welcome them. Large numbers of people from Riviera came to cheer Chamberlain. The British Prime Minister got out of the car for ten minutes to review the honor guard lined up on the platform. The special train will arrive in Rome at 4:30 this afternoon.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 11th] On the eve of the arrival of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Italian capital, preparations for the welcome were rushed everywhere, and work was very busy. The central station was full of British and Italian flags and flowers. The rest of the surrounding area was also decorated with flags. A special platform was built in front of the station for British expatriates to welcome the British Prime Minister. At 4:30 this afternoon, the British Prime Minister and others will arrive and take a car to the Villa Madama for lodging. At 5:45, Chamberlain and Halifax will go to the Quirinal Palace for their first meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. At 9:00, the Italian Prime Minister will host a grand banquet in the Palazzo Venezia to welcome them. It is also noteworthy that a group of fifty British reporters arrived yesterday, and reporters from various countries have also rushed to investigate the news.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The preparations here to welcome British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are not as noisy as the previous welcome of Hitler, but the atmosphere is very harmonious and sincere. There has been no official announcement about the issues to be discussed at this meeting. Although London has said that this meeting is of a general nature, people here believe that special issues will be discussed, such as the Spanish war, Franco-Italian relations, Italian colonial demands, the administration of the Suez Canal, the Jewish question, and Anglo-Italian trade. All of these will be discussed. Chamberlain and his party will be welcomed by the Italian government for the first time tomorrow morning at Darling, and will then take a special train to Genoa, arriving at 10:00, where they will be welcomed by the local military and political authorities. Chamberlain and others will arrive in Rome at 4:20 in the afternoon. Foreign Minister Ciano, other cabinet members, and British Embassy personnel will all go to the platform to welcome them. The station will be decorated with flowers and British and Italian flags. After arriving at the station, Chamberlain and his party will travel in seven cars, led by Chamberlain and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, passing through streets lined with troops to Villa Madama, where they will stay.

British and French Governments Reach Unified Views

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and personnel from the French Embassy went to the Gare du Nord to welcome Chamberlain and his party. Flags were fluttering inside the station, and red carpets were laid. Outside the station, crowds were surging. Daladier and Chamberlain, Bonnet and Halifax, took cars to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the crowds cheered and waved to them. The two sides held political talks for seventy minutes. Chamberlain and Halifax, accompanied by the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, took a car to the Gare de Lyon. At 7:30 in the afternoon, the British Prime Minister and his party took a train to Rome. Afterwards, the two sides issued a communiqué saying, "The largely consistent views previously agreed upon by the two governments have now been finalized." It is generally believed that Daladier and Bonnet first presented France's views on Italy's demands, and the British side expressed its full agreement. The two sides then reviewed the overall situation based on previous resolutions. The British side made a general outline of the opinions it wanted to put forward in Rome. The French side also fully agreed. According to information obtained from political circles in Paris, Chamberlain's trip to Rome is not intended to make any special statements, but to listen to the Italian side's views, which are still kept strictly secret. However, if the Italian side seeks the opinions of Chamberlain and Halifax, the two will suggest that the Italian side take the following effective steps: (1) In order to ease the situation in the Mediterranean, Italy is very willing to withdraw its troops from Spain; (2) If Italy wants to resolve all disputes with France, it should negotiate directly with the French government and no longer engage in provocations and incitement in newspapers. If this can be achieved, it will be easier for Italy to achieve its goals vis-à-vis France (such as making Djibouti a free port).

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Today's French Cabinet meeting stated that French Foreign Minister Bonnet had recently sent a note to the French Ambassador to Britain, asking the British government to report exactly what its views were on Italy's demands. It is said that after Bonnet read the note, the French Cabinet unanimously agreed to this firm stance.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] Yesterday morning, all the newspapers in Paris printed the results of last night's meeting between British cabinet members and the French government in large headlines. An Anglo-French agreement was reached on the Mediterranean issue. At the same time, it was confirmed that the British government had sent a note to the French government, stating that the British position had been determined and that France's attitude was in full agreement. The French press is very conservative about Chamberlain's trip to Rome, but believes that the outcome of the meeting depends entirely on whether Mussolini can cooperate.

### Germany's Policy Towards Eastern Europe; Will Extend Political and Economic Influence to the Soviet Border Without Going Through Poland; Ribbentrop Prepares to Visit Poland

[Reuters, London, 11th] According to the Warsaw correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, after Foreign Minister Beck's talks in Berchtesgaden and Munich, he obtained Hitler's assurance that Germany's policy towards Eastern Europe will not directly attack Poland. In other words, Germany will not provoke Poland in the initial stages. If the results obtained by Chamberlain at the Rome conference do not change the current situation, Hitler will extend Germany's political and economic influence to the borders of the Soviet Union, such as Latvia, Estonia, and Romania, but all routes will not pass through Poland. In the discussions in Berchtesgaden, the means used by Germany in its policy towards Eastern Europe seem to be a combination of tough diplomacy and propaganda. [Reuters, Berlin, 10th] According to well-informed sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, plans to visit Warsaw in the near future, but Ribbentrop will be able to determine the date of the visit only after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visits Germany.

### Eden's Speech; Praises Roosevelt

[Reuters, London, 10th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in London today that "President Roosevelt's determination of the attitude he holds towards modern world problems on behalf of the United States will surely be permanently recorded in history in the future. The President's speech itself is clear and impartial and can be described as a masterpiece, but its significance does not stop there. President Roosevelt's speech is no less than a signpost, pointing out a path for freedom-loving countries in the world to follow. Therefore, I say that the speech has a 'tonic' effect on the British people and should not be lightly dismissed. I believe my British friends will agree."

### HSBC Bank; Profits Last Year; British Newspapers Unanimously Congratulate

[Reuters, London, 11th] The financial columns of British newspapers unanimously congratulated HSBC Bank today on its profits for last year. The "Times" said, "This proves the financial strength of HSBC Bank and the importance of trade with China." The "Manchester Guardian" said, "Japan has occupied every port in China. HSBC Bank has been able to profit under these circumstances, which is a real success." The "Financial Times" said, "It is not surprising that HSBC Bank's dividends decreased last year." The "Daily Telegraph" said, "This is a great success."

### Extremely Hot Weather; Forest Spontaneous Combustion; Several Factories Destroyed in Victoria, Australia

[Central News Agency, Melbourne, 11th] Due to the extremely hot weather in Victoria, the forests are spontaneously catching fire everywhere and are still burning. Several homes and factories have been destroyed. The temperature here reached 112.5 degrees yesterday, and other places reached 121 degrees. Rescue workers from all over have been mobilized, but some villages such as Erica are still at risk. Many people are missing. Fire trucks are driving through the disaster area, sounding their sirens as a warning.

### U.S. Naval and Air Force to Conduct Large-Scale Exercises; 66 Aircraft Participating; Flight Distance of 3,000 Miles

[United Press, San Diego, 10th] The U.S. Navy will begin large-scale aviation exercises. Sixty-six aircraft will participate, including 48 fighter planes that will fly non-stop to the Coco Solo airbase in the Canal Zone. Eighteen seaplanes will fly to the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, with brief stops en route. The number of aircraft participating in this exercise is greater than in previous naval exercises. The flight distance is 3,000 miles. Six warships will be stationed along the route to provide assistance if necessary. The flight of these aircraft will coincide with the southward advance of 100 warships. U.S. authorities are keeping this flight secret. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the U.S. government will issue a report on the flight's progress before this batch of aircraft arrives at the Coco Solo airbase.

### Schacht Returns to Berlin; To Negotiate with Refugee Committee

[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] The Governor of the German Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, will return here from Basel tonight and begin negotiations with the Refugee Committee tomorrow. The committee, consisting of several members led by Mr. Rublee, arrived here today. It is reported that these negotiations will be based on the plan Schacht brought to London. However, it has recently been learned that Schacht has indicated that this plan is not Germany's final word. Germany apparently believes that Jews around the world are prepared to stop the anti-German movement in order to help the Jews in Germany. The Germans have good reason to believe that the ability of foreign Jews to help German Jews has been exhausted. It is also learned that Schacht has made a firm guarantee that Germany will not take any more anti-Jewish measures if the negotiations for a resettlement loan do not break down.

### U.S. Congressional Subcommittee Reduces Relief Funds; Roosevelt Suffers First Setback; Woodrum Says It's Temporary

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] A U.S. Congressional subcommittee has decided to reduce President Roosevelt's requested relief funds of $875,000,000 to $725,000,000 and has stipulated certain restrictions. This is President Roosevelt's first setback in Congress. The subcommittee has a Democratic majority and is chaired by Republican Clifton Woodrum. Woodrum declared that the allocation of relief funds would be distributed in mid-May. However, President Roosevelt's setback may only be temporary, as the full Appropriations Committee will meet on Wednesday and has the power to reject the subcommittee's decision.

### Hungarian-Czech Negotiations Break Down Again

[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 11th] Negotiations between the Hungarian government and Czechoslovakia have broken down again due to the final decision on border demarcation. Unless Czechoslovakia apologizes to Hungary and compensates for the losses, negotiations cannot continue. It is reported that the Hungarian government has requested the British and Italian governments to discuss the Hungarian-Czech dispute at the Rome conference.

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] Hungary protested to Czechoslovakia over the "Mukachevo" incident. Czechoslovakia today issued a reply, suggesting to Hungary the establishment of a "neutral zone" along the entire border between Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. It also pointed out that the "Mukachevo" incident occurred because the Hungarian side fired first. The incident and the incident that occurred in Dusz on Sunday should be handled together by the Hungarian-Czech mixed commission, which should have the final right of judgment.

### Belgium Expresses Attitude Towards the Non-Intervention Committee; Belgium May Withdraw if Resolutions Cannot Be Implemented

[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] Today, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak issued a statement to the press after attending a meeting of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that Belgium may withdraw from the "Non-Intervention Committee" if it cannot implement its resolutions, especially the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain. "Belgium has strictly adhered to its principle of non-intervention, but if the Committee is not sufficient to guarantee the implementation of its resolutions, then Belgium, morally speaking, has the obligation to reconsider its position."

### Anglo-German Naval Negotiations; Content Revised and to Be Announced Next Week; Submarine Ratio Permitted to Increase for Germany

[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 11th] According to well-informed sources, the Anglo-German naval talks, originally scheduled to be announced this week, have been postponed to next week. It is reported that the content will increase the 45% limitation on German submarine construction stipulated in the 1935 and 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement and proceed with the fourth and fifth 10,000-ton heavy cruisers.

### Selling Naval Secrets; French Destroyer Captain; Jeannotte Sentenced to Death

[Associated Press, Toulon, France, 11th] French destroyer "Vauquelin" Captain Jeannotte was sentenced to death by the French military court for selling French naval secrets to a foreign country last year during the Czech crisis. An accomplice, a female offender, was sentenced to three years in prison.

### If Germany and Italy Become Warmongers; A Major War Will Erupt; Reports from U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France; European Situation Extremely Serious

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] According to a member of the U.S. Military Committee, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy reported to the Committee on the European situation, saying, "A world war may break out this spring." U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt also believes this to be the case. Kennedy believes that if Germany invades Ukraine or Italy seizes Tunisia, a major war will immediately begin. It is reported that Kennedy submitted to the Committee information on the strength of the German Air Force, which was compiled by Colonel Lindbergh, indicating that Germany has 10,000 first-line aircraft and a monthly aircraft production of 1,200. Therefore, the United States must actively prepare.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The Senate and House Armed Services Committees held a joint secret meeting today. U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France both attended to report on the European situation. A congressman who attended stated that the two ambassadors "described the gradual development of the European situation since the Munich Agreement and pointed out the direction of the situation" and said that this should be a "grim picture of peace." Another committee member stated that Ambassadors Kennedy and Bullitt briefly discussed the diplomatic policies of Britain and France and the opportunity for the two countries to appease Hitler and Mussolini, saying that "the two countries do not have much hope for this future of appeasement." The two ambassadors attended the committee for nearly two hours. According to reliable sources, they did not suggest to the authorities that the United States strengthen its national defense strength, but only described the chaotic situation in Europe. Senator Reynolds, who attended the meeting, stood up at the end of the meeting and said that he would report to the Senate in detail on the secret meeting in Japan in the near future, which greatly surprised the audience. According to several committee reports, the committee discussed Colonel Lindbergh's report on the strength of the German Air Force. It is said that the two ambassadors said that this statement would be welcomed by Germany. However, Colonel Lindbergh's report has largely confirmed the views of several military observers. When the committee members left the meeting, they all looked serious. Some committee members no longer concealed the serious situation revealed by the two ambassadors. One committee member said, "Britain and France are both encountering the most significant crisis." If listening to the report this time, as many people here imagine, is to facilitate President Roosevelt's plan to expand the military, then it seems to have been very successful.

### Sino-Estonian Treaty of Friendship Officially Takes Effect; Notes Exchanged in London the Day Before Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The Sino-Estonian Treaty of Friendship was signed in London on December 21, 1937, by Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, and the Estonian Minister to Britain. It was approved by the National Government on May 10, 1938, and Quo was appointed as the plenipotentiary representative for the exchange of ratification documents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today received a telegram from Quo stating that the representatives of both parties exchanged ratification documents in London on the 10th of this month. According to Article 8 of the treaty, it officially came into effect from that day.

### International Wheat Conference Held in England the Day Before Yesterday

[Haitong Agency, London, 11th] The Wheat Committee, composed of 22 wheat-producing countries in the world, held a meeting at the Ministry of Commerce yesterday. U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy has returned to the U.S., so the U.S. Minister to Bulgaria attended. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to avoid the unfortunate consequences caused by overproduction in several countries, and to use statistical indicators as a reference. At the first meeting, the U.S. representative stated that the United States does not intend to serve as chairman, but this does not mean that the U.S. disregards the rights of the meeting. Therefore, it has not yet been decided which country will chair the next meeting.

### British Cabinet; To Undergo Some Changes

[Haitong Agency, London, 11th] It is learned that after Chamberlain returns from Rome, the British Cabinet will undergo some changes. However, there is currently no reliable information on what kind of changes will occur. Since the death of Dominion Secretary Stanley in the autumn of last year, Colonial Secretary MacDonald has also served as Dominion Secretary. It is generally believed that the British government will appoint a Dominion Secretary because MacDonald is currently very busy as the head of the Colonial Office, especially regarding the Palestine issue. Therefore, this is particularly likely.

Short Commentary

### National Administrative Improvement

Our country's war of resistance this time is a war of national revolution, a war of progress. Therefore, with the persistence and development of the war, it has first promoted an unprecedented national unity, followed by the progress of national politics. Since Wang Jingwei's treasonous conspiracy was exposed, our country has once again overcome the adverse tide of peaceful compromise. Therefore, national unity and political progress have an even brighter future!

According to this newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 11th, the central authorities are currently discussing improving national administration. The main points are: (1) The chairmen of various provinces in the war zones concurrently manage military and political affairs, and their status is elevated. This is an important step to make politics and the war of resistance more closely coordinated, which is sufficient to make up for the shortcomings of the past where politics could not keep up with military affairs. (2) Increasing the salaries of county magistrates is also a manifestation that the government has accepted the lessons learned from the 18 months of war resistance, and it is an important step to improve the lower-level political structure. However, the salaries of lower-level civil servants should be further increased universally, and strict measures for punishment and reward should be established to thoroughly eliminate corruption and change social customs. (3) The establishment of temporary provincial councils in all provinces, limited to March 2, is also very noteworthy. In the past, the central government did attach great importance to the establishment of this preliminary public opinion organ, but the failure of various provinces to submit lists on time was due to difficulties in some war zone provinces, but mostly due to the local authorities and public opinion circles ignoring its importance. The government's explanation and propaganda work with various anti-Japanese parties and groups was also insufficient. In the future, all parties should understand that supporting public opinion organs and promoting democratic politics are important steps to complete the cause of the war of resistance and nation-building. If we want the war of resistance and nation-building to be realized quickly, we must first demand the universal realization of the spirit of democratic politics.

### Anglo-American Sanctions Against Japan

If the United Kingdom and the United States can jointly sanction Japan, then the economic aspect alone will be enough to quickly collapse the Japanese aggressors, or they will have to abandon their policy of aggression and jointly seek normal development. The question is whether Anglo-American joint sanctions against Japan are possible.

The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East are different. The relationships between the United Kingdom and the United States themselves and with Japan are different. The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States are also different. This is one of the important reasons why the Japanese aggressors have dared to run rampant in East Asia for several years. However, as the Japanese aggression forces have developed to this day, the contradictions they have caused with the United States have long exceeded the contradictions between the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the conditions for Anglo-American joint sanctions against Japan have already existed and are becoming increasingly mature. In particular, the Far East industrialists and merchants of the United Kingdom and the United States, who are directly threatened and harmed by the Japanese aggressors, are constantly calling on the United Kingdom and the United States to jointly sanction Japan, and with the urging of public opinion and righteous people in the two countries, the Far East policies of the British and American governments have also become increasingly active. The dispatches from Washington and London in the past few days have stated that British and American authorities are negotiating jointly against Japan, and the scope of discussion is not limited to the economic aspect. Furthermore, the remarks made by the famous diplomat who just returned from the United States, published in today's newspaper, further prove that Anglo-American sanctions against Japan are by no means an empty slogan!

However, if we want Anglo-American sanctions against Japan to be realized earlier and more thoroughly, we must not only step up all steps to improve foreign affairs work, but also do everything possible to deepen Japan's difficulties and make Japan's international status even more isolated. At the same time, we must do everything possible to ensure our country's progress and enhance the international prestige of our government. This is not only hopeful for the government's efforts, but even more hopeful for the national people's endeavors.

### A Review of the Work of the Chinese Branch of the Anti-Aggression League Over the Past Year

— Yu Mang

All work in the war of resistance against Japan is anti-aggression work. This includes military, political, economic, cultural... and other departments. If we take the "anti-aggression movement" as the theme to write an article, I am afraid that such a small space cannot handle it. What we want to report to readers today is a review of the work of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League over the past year, from beginning to end, firstly to provide the association with some suggestions for promotion, and secondly to hope that this movement will be further expanded and strengthened.

A week ago, I met Mr. Zheng Yanfen, the director of the executive department of the Chinese branch, and I am grateful to him for telling me about the future development of the association's work. At the end, he also gave me some reference materials. Therefore, I should take this opportunity to thank Mr. Zheng for his kindness!

Historical Review

The organization of the Chinese branch really only began to take shape from January last year, and it has been active for exactly one year now. Speaking of its name, it seems a bit contrived, because the original name of the Geneva General Assembly, translated, should mean "International Peace Movement." However, we changed it to "International Anti-Aggression League." Isn't that a bit contrived? But "we are firmly determined that the Japanese aggression will not stop for a day, and China's war of resistance will not stop for a day; although our ultimate goal is still peace, the peace we seek must be a permanent peace that conforms to public reason and justice." (See Organizational Guidelines.) Then, doesn't this change have its own special significance and meet the needs of the actual environment? Anyway, our war of resistance work is thoroughly an anti-aggression work.

Speaking of the nature and scope of work of the branch, undoubtedly, it is an international mass organization "dedicated to opposing aggressive wars and ensuring world peace." This "is not a military organization, not an academic organization, nor a political group." Therefore, all parties and factions, or those who are non-partisan, as long as they (or she) are not traitors and are enthusiastic about defending world peace and working hard on anti-aggression work, whether individuals or groups, the branch accepts them all.

The establishment of the branch is based on the following four principles:

1. Affirming the dignity of treaty affairs; 2. Utilizing international agreements to reduce and limit armaments, and cracking down on profiteering from the manufacture and sale of armaments; 3. Utilizing collective security and mutual assistance organizations to enhance the strength of the League of Nations to avoid and stop wars; 4. Establishing effective institutions within the League of Nations to adjust international situations that may cause wars.

We said above that as long as they are not traitors, they can be members of the Chinese branch. In this case, it goes without saying that its organization is huge and extensive. The members of the branch, analyzed, belong to individuals, including members of the Chinese Kuomintang, members of the Chinese Communist Party, liberals, anarchists...; and groups include many domestic mass organizations.

The branch and the General Assembly organization are the same, and both adopt a membership system. Mr. Song Ziwen assumed this important task. Under the representative assembly, there is a board of directors composed of 150 people, and another standing committee of 23 people is mutually elected by the board of directors to act on its behalf during the recess of the board of directors.

The branch belongs to the whole country. The first-level local organization under the branch is the sub-branch, with the province as the organizational unit. The address of the association is located in the provincial capital; the second-level local organization is the district association, with the counties and cities of each province as the organizational unit. Those places where the number of members is too small, but must have a center for mutual contact, are provided with communication offices, which are subordinate to the sub-branches or district associations in various places - perhaps directly subordinate to the branch. At present, according to statistics, there are several sub-branches in provinces across the country, including Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi (this was recently established). As for the cities where overseas Chinese are concentrated, such as Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Philippines...etc., there is no sub-branch organization yet; and the district association with the county and city as the unit is even more impossible to talk about now.

The office recently received a telegram reporting on the disaster situation after investigation. Just in the disaster area of Huizhou and Boluo, the number of compatriots directly affected by the disaster, without clothes, food, or shelter, is no less than 300,000. After the disaster, the wailing of the victims is everywhere. They have already suffered from exposure to the elements and displacement.

### Will the Guangdong-Hong Kong Route Be Restored? Jinshan Vessel Sailed to Guangzhou Yesterday: Carrying Only Forty Western Passengers; Absolutely No Chinese Passengers or Cargo

The Jinshan vessel of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company sailed to Guangzhou yesterday morning. It departed from the Triangle Wharf at 8:00 AM, carrying forty Western passengers and a batch of Singapore firewood, coal ash, and canned food for residents staying in Shamian. There were absolutely no Chinese passengers and no cargo was carried. The scene was extremely desolate and quiet. The waterway between Guangdong and Hong Kong, which had been suspended for nearly three months, was thus declared "reopened."

Negotiation Process Not Publicized

It is known that the Pearl River waterway was sealed off by the 	× after landing in Daya Bay on October 12th last year. The Humen forts declared martial law on the evening of the 14th. Subsequently, after 	× captured Guangzhou, it attempted to monopolize the Pearl River shipping rights, forcibly blockading it and preventing foreign vessels from entering. Although the British government repeatedly protested, there was no result. During the 	× blockade, only the Taikoo vessel Wuchang once carried relief supplies to the province, and British and American warships passed through unhindered several times. Commercial vessels were completely absent. Guangzhou and Hong Kong were cut off for nearly three months. Regarding the recent ability of the Jinshan vessel to sail, the negotiation process has not been officially publicized by the Hong Kong government or the shipping company. However, according to reliable sources, the British and Japanese sides had previously reached an agreement and hoped that there would be two sailings per week in the future. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Shipping Company had also reached an agreement with the Japanese side not to carry Chinese passengers, cargo, or mail during the company's resumed sailings. Therefore, only Westerners took the vessel to the province yesterday. They were returning to Shamian to manage their businesses in Guangzhou. The attached passenger seats were all Western-style dining rooms, with each passenger ticket costing HK$12. Other rear楼, large cabin and other passenger seats were not carrying passengers.

Guangdong-Macau Route Also Restored

Furthermore, in addition to the Guangdong-Hong Kong waterway traffic having its initial test voyage restored yesterday, 	×, in an attempt to restore transportation between Guangzhou and other places, sent armed vessels and transport ships to travel between Macau and Guangzhou before reaching an agreement with the British side. Therefore, one sailing per period, has been going on for several sailings. To attract overseas Chinese to return to Guangzhou, all Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese people are allowed to ride in Macau. A special flight allows 30 passengers, but Chinese people attached to 	× must submit two photos and obtain permission from the 	× Consul in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and the Guangzhou 	× military commander before they can take the ride.

### In the Past Week, Tuberculosis Has Claimed Another 112 Lives; Many Also Died from Dysentery

According to an announcement by the Hong Kong Health Authority yesterday, one case of diphtheria, four cases of typhoid fever, six cases of measles, three cases of chickenpox, two cases of meningitis, and five cases of dysentery occurred in Hong Kong in a single day this week. In the past week, there were four cases of cholera, with one death, six cases of smallpox, with five deaths, ten cases of diphtheria, with seven deaths, one case of scarlet fever, seven cases of typhoid fever, with two deaths, twenty-two cases of dysentery, with eight deaths, two cases of chickenpox, three cases of meningitis, with one death, eighteen cases of dysentery, with eight deaths, and two cases of puerperal fever. In addition, 112 people died from tuberculosis in one week.

### Li Fulin's Proposal: Another Group of Central Committee Members Remaining in Hong Kong Departed for Chongqing Yesterday; Launching Guangdong Guerrilla Forces; Li Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday from a Certain Place and Was Unable to Go to Chongqing Due to Official Business; The Proposal Was Entrusted to the Central Committee Members Going to Chongqing to Be Discussed at the Fifth Plenary Session

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been rescheduled to be held in Chongqing on the 20th of this month. Central Committee members Chen Fengyuan, You Lugang, Zhan Jusi, and Li Qian, who remained in Hong Kong, had already departed for Chongqing the day before yesterday. The remaining Chen Ce, Hu Jiaocan, Luo Yiqun, Huang Linshu, Chen Qingyun, and Ou Fangpu also took planes or ships to Hanoi yesterday to transfer to Chongqing, in order to attend the meeting on the 20th and discuss national affairs.

Li Fulin Bids Farewell to Central Committee Members Remaining in Hong Kong

Central Committee member Li Fulin rushed to Hong Kong from a certain place the day before yesterday. Reports stated that he would be going to Chongqing, but this news is not factual. According to Li's confidants, Commander Li is responsible for directing guerrilla forces in various locations to kill 	×, and is unable to leave his position for an extended period to attend the meeting in Chongqing. This trip from a certain place to Hong Kong was solely to discuss proposals with the Central Committee members remaining in Hong Kong. Commander Li has an important proposal on the Guangdong guerrilla forces issue, which he entrusted to the Central Committee members attending the meeting in Chongqing to present to the conference for discussion. Furthermore, on the 9th of this month, Commander Li hosted a banquet for the Central Committee members at the Angleterre Hotel in Hong Kong, with Chen Ce, Luo Yiqun, and Li Qian, among others, attending.

Yuan Dai Has Been Promoted to Commander of the Special Operations Unit

Li's confidants further discussed the loyalty and bravery of the people in various places to 重祋 	×. According to reports, Yuan Qi, the original counselor of the Japanese General Headquarters, gathered anti- 	× people in the Zhongshan area after Guangzhou fell, and killed 	× with weapons. In the past two months, he has repeatedly defeated 	×, and is valued by Commander Li. He had previously travelled to a certain place to report to Commander Li on the killing of 	× and to ask for instructions. Commander Li, recognizing his contributions to killing 	×, promoted him to Commander of the Special Operations Unit to inspire him.

Green Forest with Pigtails: Killing 	× Achieved Initial Success

The leader of the Self-Defense Corps, Lu Ling (Yuan Qingzhou), also known as "Pigtail Leader," was ordered by General Li Fulin to lead more than a thousand members of the Shunde Nanhai Self-Defense Corps and strong men to resist the tyrannical 	× after Guangzhou fell. He killed over a thousand 	× in the Battle of Rongqi, Shunde, and seized many war trophies. In the Battle of Longjiang 塡甲, he killed 200 	× and seized three machine guns and two small cannons. A few days ago, when 	× forces attacked Chencun again, Lu Ling led Li Yingri, Huang Chen, and others from Daliang, together with Liang Menghu's unit, to charge three times with hand grenades, eventually sinking six 	× boats, killing more than 200 	×, and seizing many guns and cannons. Later, when a large force of 	× reinforcements arrived, the numbers were too disparate, and since our side had already gained a considerable advantage, they moved to a new position to plan a counterattack. Commander Li, recognizing Lu Ling's repeated contributions to killing 	×, promoted him to Deputy Commander of the First District yesterday.

### British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China: Nobel to Visit Saigon in Mid-Month; Will Meet with French Military Authorities and Transfer to the Philippines

Due to the confrontation between the fascist and democratic camps, Britain and France demonstrate their close cooperation on the world political stage. This is true in Europe and also in the Far East without the slightest divergence. Recently, there have been frequent reports in newspapers about British and French naval cooperation to protect Far Eastern interests. As a result, the relationship between the British and French military authorities in the Far East, who are responsible for defense, has become increasingly close. Some time ago, the commander of the French Far East Fleet visited Hong Kong aboard the flagship 平傑 to visit the British naval authorities, and later went to Little Luzon for a similar visit. According to investigations by reporters, Vice Admiral Nobel, the British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, is now scheduled to visit Little Luzon and Saigon aboard the flagship Kent on the 15th of this month (Sunday). The ship 花茂 is also traveling. It is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on February 2nd. When arriving in Saigon, they will visit the French military authorities and transfer to Manila.

### Unpredictable Weather: Drastic Temperature Changes; 20 Degrees Difference Compared to Four Days Ago

Recently, the weather in Hong Kong has been quite volatile. In the past few days, the thermometer suddenly dropped, but it rose sharply again in the past two days. The highest temperature in Hong Kong yesterday reached 72 degrees Fahrenheit, a difference of 16 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the lowest temperature of the previous day, and a difference of 22 degrees compared to the lowest temperature four days ago.

### At Bai Shi Tou Zhou Waters: Pirates Rob Another Cargo Boat; Crew Refuses to Surrender and Is Shot and Injured; Stolen Potatoes, Rice, etc. Valued at $170

In the British-controlled waters of Bai Shi Tou Zhou, another case of a cargo boat being intercepted by three pirates and a crew member being shot occurred at 7:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The victim was the boat 臬號實, owned by Zheng Guicheng, 31 years old. Along with three crew members, he was transporting 30 bags of potatoes and 20 bags of red rice from Shantou to Hong Kong on the 7th of this month. At 7:00 AM on the 10th, when sailing near Bai Shi Tou in Wu territory, a pirate boat carrying three pirates, two of whom were armed with guns, suddenly appeared and chased after them, shouting to stop. However, Zheng, knowing it was a pirate boat, did not answer and continued sailing forward. The pirates, seeing that the boat was still moving forward, fired three shots as a warning. The boat owner, Zheng, fearing that the pirates would become more violent and cause an accident, had no choice but to stop. Shortly after, the pirate boat approached the cargo boat, and the three pirates came to the cargo boat, with the two armed pirates pointing their weapons at everyone. On the cargo boat side, one crew member, Zheng Rongji, 35 years old, refused to surrender and struggled with the pirates. The pirates then fired a gun at Zheng, hitting his right side, causing severe injuries. He immediately fainted in the boat. The others, seeing this, surrendered. The pirates, after subduing everyone, moved the aforementioned cargo to the pirate boat and fled. Afterwards, Zheng Guicheng and the others dared to come out on deck, and seeing that the pirates had fled far away, they set sail towards Hong Kong. They arrived at Shau Kei Wan yesterday morning. The boat owner went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station to report the incident. The officer on duty, upon hearing the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the boat and called a Red Cross vehicle to the scene to send the injured man to the Mary Hospital for treatment. He also contacted the Marine Police Station to send police boats to search for the pirates in the waters. It is known that the 30 bags of potatoes were worth $120, and the 20 bags of red rice were worth $50, for a total loss of $170.

### Guerrilla Warfare Will Have a New Development: A Letter from Mr. Zhao Dong

— Qi Zhuo

Committee Has Firm Faith in the War of Resistance, Wang's Departure is a Good Phenomenon

Mr. Zhao Dong is the son of the mother of the guerrilla隊, Ms. Zhao, and also a strong general leading the North China guerrilla隊. He is one of the two practical youths admired by patriotic compatriots. Here, there is no need for reporters to introduce him in detail.

Mr. Zhao Dong only recently left Hong Kong. When he passed through Hong Kong, it attracted attention and welcome from all sides. He once gave a public speech at the Youth Association and also filmed a current affairs film for the Central Film Studio. These, these, readers will surely not forget in their impressions. Where did he go after leaving Hong Kong? What are his recent impressions? How will he develop his work? These, these, must be what patriotic overseas Chinese care about. The following letter is from Mr. Zhao Dong to Mr. ×× in Hong Kong from Chongqing. The content of the original letter is as follows:

Brother ××: We arrived in Chongqing on the 27th. That night, we were discovered by newspaper reporters. Visitors came and went to the residence, making it difficult to cope with. My purpose here is to promote the war of resistance and strengthen the confidence of the Chinese people in the war of resistance. Open action is necessary. I have decided to host the press tomorrow (1st) afternoon. After giving a public lecture, I will pay a visit to the central authorities.

Whether we return to North China or participate in the development of guerrilla warfare in South China must be decided after visiting the highest authorities.

Committee Has extraordinary firm confidence in the war of resistance. Recently, it has decided on several important slogans: "Politics is more important than military affairs; the people are more important than soldiers; the rear is more important than the front; ××××××: Guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare." This is based on the current needs of the war of resistance. It is of great importance to the military adjustment and improvement of political institutions. "Wang's departure will not only not hinder the war of resistance, but will also strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. This makes us extremely excited! (Omitted below) Sincerely, The Ceremony of Victory in the War of Resistance

Your younger brother, Zhao Dong Wang Mingxuan, together

After reading this letter, we have the following feelings and hopes:

First, after Mr. Zhao visits the highest authorities, there must be a more appropriate arrangement for the mobilization of the guerrilla隊. The development of the guerrilla隊 in the future will definitely have new achievements that can be predicted. This is enough to make us infinitely excited.

The current guerrilla隊 has many shrewd and capable ones, but due to various relationships, there are quite a few drawbacks. Imperfection is unavoidable. However, if shortcomings are not overcome and abuses are not clarified as soon as possible, it is very easy for 	× people and traitors to use it as an excuse to attack the true value of the guerrilla隊 and fall into their tricks of instigating dissension. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Zhao will be able to convey the situation to the top as much as possible when he first visits the highest authorities, so that the measures and arrangements of the highest authorities can be relevant to the current abuses.

Second, "Politics is more important than military affairs, the people are more important than soldiers, the rear is more important than the front, guerrilla隊 is more important than regular warfare." This was originally the general new national policy decided at the Hengshan Military Conference. Mr. Tao Xingzhi once reported this intention to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who clapped his hands and shouted that China was saved. Now that we have received the same report from Mr. Zhao, it is enough to prove that the national policy passed by the Hengshan Military Conference has been widely valued by all parties. This is indeed a progress gained from bloody lessons. However, readers must not harm the meaning of the words and think that military affairs, soldiers, the front, and regular warfare can be neglected and are not important. A great danger will arise from this misunderstanding. We must understand: In theory, politics should be as important as military affairs; the people should be as important as soldiers; the rear should be as important as the front; guerrilla warfare should be as important as regular warfare. Because the past war of resistance was biased towards these issues, only one aspect was considered while neglecting the other, so the current rectification is "for the current needs." "Rectification" is necessary, but it must not be "overcorrected". Therefore, I hope that readers will pay special attention to the seven words in the letter, "针对目前的需要".

Third, "Wang's departure makes us extremely happy" is the truth, because Wang Jingwei's betrayal is inevitable. He cannot keep up with the progress of the times, and insists on maintaining his political status. Therefore, he has no choice but to disregard the interests of the nation, and pat himself with his personality, in order to "struggle" before the illusion disappears. There is no doubt that this small wave will be submerged by the great tide. Eliminating corrupt elements and clarifying politics is a good sign of progress.

### Tuberculosis! Tuberculosis!

— A Talented Writer

A Special Product of Hong Kong

Tuberculosis, the terrifying tuberculosis—the moment I hear the sound of coughing from people suffering from colds in winter, it immediately reminds me of that dreadful, deadly tuberculosis. To this day, the world still lacks an effective cure for tuberculosis, and so many Chinese people suffer from it; especially in Hong Kong, according to the Health Bureau's reports, the number of deaths from tuberculosis every week is always over a hundred. Every time I see this statistical table, it sends chills down my spine; Hong Kong seems to be a place that specially produces tuberculosis!

The causes of tuberculosis, besides heredity or contagion, are (1) overwork; (2) insufficient nutrition; (3) poor air quality. The Chinese people living in Hong Kong happen to fulfill these three conditions, so it is natural that tuberculosis is particularly prevalent among them. The impoverished Chinese masses, as long as they have food to eat, do not care about whether they are overworked or not. Every day they work twelve or even sixteen hours, exhausting all their mental and physical strength. Overwork is not the only concern, they must also guard against the boss's dissatisfaction and losing their jobs. Work efficiency is at its highest, while pay efficiency is at its lowest. Think about it, in Hong Kong, where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and the cost of living is so high, the meager pay they receive is barely enough to fill their stomachs. Expensive foods like a pound of beef, eggs, or even chicken for every meal are unimaginable for those with sallow complexions. As a result, they become people who lack all the essential nutrients simultaneously.

When it comes to air quality, there's no need to even mention it. I remember a professor from a French university once analyzed a cubic meter of air in a city and found that at 7 a.m. there were 600 microbes, which increased to 1,800 by 11 a.m., 23,000 by 12 p.m., 72,000 by 2 p.m., and 88,000 by 8 p.m. Based on this, the air in the city is practically teeming with microbes, making it uninhabitable. Moreover, the population density of Hong Kong surpasses that of any other prosperous city. Fortunately, no one has analyzed the air here, otherwise, the number of microbes would surely be even more alarming. But even though it is uninhabitable, countless people live in this environment of poor air quality. It's not that they aren't afraid of microbes, it's not that they aren't afraid of tuberculosis, but for the sake of survival, they have no choice but to take the risk. The more people who take the risk, the wider the spread of tuberculosis, and the statistics of deaths from tuberculosis only increase every week.

Not long ago, someone discovered that the severity of tuberculosis in Hong Kong was due to overpopulation. Indeed, a narrow and cramped apartment, usually housing thirty or forty people, has a significant impact on hygiene. The cause has been discovered, so they want to design improvements. The most direct method would be to limit the number of residents, but this is an impractical idea for the wealthy, while the tenants wish they could squeeze in even more people!

I often consult a doctor about the problem of tuberculosis, and he said: "If you were to carefully examine them, more than half of the people in Hong Kong have tuberculosis. Those who have it often don't even know it themselves, and by the time it manifests, it's beyond cure. I recently treated a young girl who used to be very lively and innocent, not like someone who was sick. Later, because she coughed for several weeks and cough syrup didn't help, an X-ray revealed that she already had three cavities in her lungs, and tuberculosis had reached the third stage. There is no effective medicine for treating tuberculosis. The most reliable method at present is still injecting air. 'Air injection' is a common term; in reality, it is called artificial pneumothorax. After the lungs have been eroded by tuberculosis bacteria and become cavities, taking medicine will not be effective. Even prolonged rest can only increase body weight, but it won't help the cavities in the lungs heal. Artificial pneumothorax involves injecting gas into the pleural cavity to cause the lungs suspended in the pleural cavity to shrink due to the pressure of the injected air. The cavities in the lungs close up as the lungs shrink, and after a long time, they heal. Because the gas injected into the pleural cavity disappears, many injections are needed, starting with once every two or three days, then gradually extending to once a week. This method can cure 80 percent of cases, but it is not suitable for many tuberculosis patients. However, we still believe that prevention is better than cure when it comes to tuberculosis."

After this doctor finished speaking, he offered to give me a free examination, to take an X-ray to see if I had tuberculosis. But I ultimately didn't have the courage to be examined. I thought to myself: "If I were to find out that I have a severe case of tuberculosis, that would be terrible. I need to eat, I can't afford to rest for a long time, and I am penniless, I don't have the money to treat it. Knowing it would only cause me pain. Right now, I don't know whether I have tuberculosis or not, but I am working as usual, and I am much happier. Anyway, Hong Kong is known for producing tuberculosis, so having it wouldn't make me a special person!"

Transportation and Implementation

### Gushan in Fuzhou (2)

— Shao Yanqing

After walking through this corridor, we were greeted by a large reception hall called "Xingju Hall." Here, we met a monk in charge, who went to great lengths to help us find a monk's room on the left side of the hall. Originally, on the right side of the hall, there was a newly built building called "Mingyue Building." This building was donated by patrons of the temple to provide accommodation for visitors. However, on this particular day, three or four hundred students from a certain school had arrived, occupying the entire building. We had no choice but to settle in the monk's room, experiencing the flavor of monastic life. This room was quite spacious, with three beds arranged in it. However, there wasn't a single window that allowed sunlight to enter. Fortunately, there was a small skylight in the ceiling, which at least provided some light. Of course, there was no mention of fresh air. When we first entered, we were greeted by a foul odor, but after sitting for a while, we didn't notice it anymore.

After arranging our belongings in the room, we hurriedly went out to visit the temple's "kitchen." What surprised me most were the four large woks installed on the stove, each with a diameter of seven or eight feet. Because the pot lids were too heavy, they were suspended by ropes. When needed, one only had to push a handle, and the rope would slowly move the pot. When we entered, the woks were full of millet porridge, steaming hot. Behind the stove, the ground was slightly lower, and a fire-tender was diligently stuffing the firewood gathered from the mountain into the stove. It is said that these fire-tenders were mostly farmers from Lianjiang and Xinghua counties in Fujian. Due to rural bankruptcy, they left their hometowns to seek a living. Their annual wages in the temple were only fifty or sixty yuan, but the temple provided food and lodging, so it was better than toiling in the fields all year round without getting enough to eat.

After dinner, we strolled to Mingyue Building. The building was built like a student dormitory, with two rows of rooms connected together, one row facing south and the other facing north. Each row had a long corridor in front of it. I casually walked along the northbound corridor, looking into each room through the window. Small students and middle school students were chatting in twos and threes. Some were playing the harmonica, while others were gathered around listening to the teacher tell stories. In another corner of the corridor, a group of boys and girls were surrounding a young man in a Zhongshan suit—probably their teacher—singing patriotic songs. The young man was holding a ruler-long bamboo stick, waving it up and down, left and right, and the singing followed the rising and falling rhythm. In this environment of despondency and decadence, there was actually a trace of positive energy, which could not help but make one feel quite gratified.

Back in the dark and damp "monk's room," we talked for a while, and everyone felt tired. We went into our quilts and fell asleep. The next morning, at dawn, we got up to wash and prepare to climb the highest peak (that is, the highest peak of Gushan). It turned out that the Yongquan Temple where we were staying was located halfway up the mountain. Looking up from the square in front of the temple, this peak was behind the temple, and the top of the peak was directly above the main hall of the Daxiong Palace.

At about seven o'clock, we started from the back door of the temple and hired sedan chairs for taking turns and carrying our belongings. In the beginning, we meandered up the yellow soil slopes, passing through many low pine forests. The higher we went, the soil slopes gradually disappeared, leaving only smooth mountain rocks. Shallow steps were carved on the rocks. Fortunately, everyone was wearing rubber-soled or cloth-soled shoes, so we didn't slip. As the sun gradually rose higher, the heat increased accordingly, and I took off my clothes one by one. By the time we reached the Buddha's Hand Rock, I was only wearing an undershirt and a shirt. At this time, we had already walked more than half of the journey. Looking up at the highest peak, it seemed to be right in front of us. The peak looked a bit like a bald head, so bare that not even a single tree could be seen. When we were about to reach the top of the mountain, there was a stone pavilion. In the pavilion, there were incense burners to the bodhisattva. There was nothing else. To the right of the pavilion, there were broken walls and ruins, weeds and rocks, full of desolate antiquity.

After passing the stone pavilion and moving forward, we began to circle around the top of the mountain. Near the peak, there was a stone stele inscribed with "Tongxiao Road." Attached to the stele was a fork in the road that led to Guling (a summer resort for the people of Fujian). After passing this stele, the mountain path twisted and the wind gradually increased, indicating that the peak was right in front of us. At this time, I was extremely excited. I held my hat and ran to the top of the mountain in one breath. The top of the mountain was still flat, about one acre in size. Near the center, there was a stone bench five or six feet long. The stone bench was covered with dry yellow weeds. The wind was constantly blowing, causing every blade of grass to dance wildly. Almost nothing on top of the mountain was still. Our hair, scarves—everything danced with the rhythm of the strong wind.

Looking north from the peak, one mountain after another rose and fell silently around us. The morning sunlight shone obliquely on the mountain ranges on the opposite side, illuminating the undulating peaks with light and shadow. The revelation of this magnificent nature could not help but fill one's heart with a pleasant feeling. The most interesting thing was the famous Guling of Fujian, which looked like a small hill from here. One could only see exquisite Western-style houses sparsely dotted on the mountainside.

Many inscriptions from previous people were carved on the rocks on the peak, mostly dating from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Among them, those related to the mountain peaks included "No Mountain Can Compare," "Half-Sky Mountain," "Climbing the Peak to the Utmost," "Shaking Out Clothes," and "Drum Top." Because the wind was too strong, I didn't feel like looking closely. Just as I was about to descend the mountain, I suddenly heard the sedan chair carriers say that there was another stone pavilion over there. So everyone walked to the south slope of the mountain peak. Strangely enough, the climate here was completely opposite to that on the other side. Everything seemed gentle and peaceful. Near the southeast corner, there was a dilapidated stone pavilion, perched on a large rock. The roof of the pavilion was gone, leaving only two pillars. One pillar was standing, and the other was almost toppled over. From this, one could also see the power of the mountain wind. Near the stone pavilion, there was a stone about six feet high, with the four characters "A Panoramic View of the Mountains" engraved on it, as well as "Sea and Sky View Pavilion" and "Heavenly Peak Sea Wave Pavilion," presumably the names of the pavilions. From here, after a few more steps, one reached the end of the highest peak. Below were grotesque rocks. From here, looking around the Five Tiger Mountains, one could only see a vast sea of clouds and the mountains looming. The vastness of the ocean was breathtaking. Looking down at the Min River, the waterway was winding like a rainbow. The west end was connected to the upper reaches, dividing Fuzhou City and Nantai, and the east end was connected to Weiba and Luoxing Pagoda. On this silver ribbon-like Min River, only patches of sails were dotted on it, with a few small steamships slowly crawling on the river surface. Unless one stared intently, one would hardly notice them moving. The Fuma Highway built along the river looked like a long, narrow golden belt under the autumn sun. Unfortunately, there were too few vehicles coming and going, so it was inevitable that there was a sense of desolation. In addition, there was an endless expanse of fields. A seaplane, lightly taking off from Jiangxi, circled a few times over the rice fields on the opposite bank, like a small dragonfly. The sound of the plane gradually faded, and the body of the plane gradually disappeared in the blur—all of this was simply a beautiful autumn picture, making people reluctant to leave. I took several photos of the mountain scenery. It was almost noon when everyone followed the original path down the peak, wanting to rush to Baiyun Cave for lunch. (To be continued)

### Returning from Changsha (2)

— Lu Dongren

We thought that after arriving in Changsha, we would definitely be able to go to Hankou. We were always hoping for it, but as soon as we arrived in Changsha, the train conductor told us, "The section of the road from Changsha to Hankou has been destroyed by × airplanes and cannot be reopened." When we heard this, we felt a pain in our hearts. The ruthless × airplanes had blocked our progress like this. This was indeed a great blow to us. Our progress was blocked here. Since the train could not run, we had no choice but to go to the station to refund the ticket the next day. That night, when we got off the train in Changsha at nine o'clock, we saw that the area around the station was a scene of smoke and fire that made people sad to see. This was the gift given by the × airplanes. After getting off the train, the two of us only hired a rickshaw. We slowly walked through several street intersections on the dimly lit street before finding a hotel. The service in this hotel was not very good, and the facilities inside were also not very complete. The staff were all from Hunan. We spoke Mandarin to them, and we could understand each other. Because we were tired from two days and nights of traveling, we were able to recover our spirits in the sleep of that night. The next morning, after eating breakfast, × airplanes came to bomb us. The owner of the hotel was very kind. His name was You Jinhai. He personally took us to a village to hide. As soon as we stepped out of the hotel door, we saw that many buildings had become rubble and flesh and blood were everywhere. The scene was so tragic that it was unbearable to look at. This kind of tragedy only increased the people's determination to resist ×. Although Changsha was harassed by × airplanes every day, the market was still prosperous and the roads were quite wide. Mr. You took us to sit in the home of a farmer, but during emergency alerts, we still had to go to the forest to hide. This continued until four o'clock in the afternoon when the alert was lifted. Changsha can be said to be attacked by enemy planes every day. Because of this situation, we had no choice but to return to Hengyang and take the road to Guilin, Guangxi, intending to find some work to save the country or find something to learn. After the alarm was lifted, we also asked the gentlemen to take us to the station to refund Cai, and purchased tickets to Hengyang. At the station, the most eye-catching thing was the train loaded with wounded soldiers transported back from the front. Some of them had injured their feet, and some had injured their hands and heads. The plight of hobbling along after getting off the train was truly admirable and pity. There were also those who were more seriously injured, lying on the station. A company commander was seriously injured, and his wound was not covered with medicine. In the cold night, he groaned and screamed in pain. Listening to the tragic sound, it was almost impossible not to shed tears. Think about it, he was both frozen and in pain, but how great he was. He had fulfilled his duty as a citizen. But I don't know what the young masters and young ladies who linger in the cities would feel when they heard this. The wounded company commander was like this, and the lower-ranking soldiers go without saying. It can be seen that in this war of resistance, the level of care and protection requires our efforts and assistance in the rear. The weather was very cold that night, and I was almost frozen to the point of jumping up. We waited for several hours until late at night before a train finally departed. During the journey, × airplanes came to attack several times, but we safely arrived in Hengyang on the afternoon of the 21st.

When coming to Hengyang from Changsha, there were two Cantonese people with the surname Li in the same car. They were rice merchants from Hengyang whom we met while waiting for the train at the station. Upon arrival, they introduced us to a Cantonese hotel to stay. The air defense facilities in Hengyang were relatively complete, so we felt much calmer. The commerce in Hengyang was quite prosperous, but one thing that was a bit special was the barber shop business. It was almost entirely in the hands of women. For the convenience of taking the train, even our two leather suitcases were all sold. We packed all our clothes into a large package and carried it on our backs, looking like travelers. We stayed here for one day. The next day, we took the train to Guilin in the afternoon. The fare from Heng to Guizhou was only five and a half dollars. There was a car at the ticket office to send us to the West Station to get on the train.

This was in Guilin on the afternoon of the 23rd. We were very excited because this was the provincial capital we had admired for a long time. After getting off the train, there was a car to pick us up into the city. When we were about to enter the city, we registered our names and checked our luggage at a luggage inspection office. We passed through many city gates before entering the city. After getting off the car, we hired two rickshaws to stay at the Xiang E Hotel. "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world" truly lives up to its name. The majesty of the mountains has never been seen before. They are scattered, pointed peaks, rising into the clouds. At a glance, they give people a different feeling. The young men and women students in Guangxi wear simple military uniforms and are full of energy. They are truly soldiers who will defend the country and kill × in the future. There are also farmers, workers, and merchants who have generally received considerable military training. There are air defense exercises in the city from time to time, and the people are orderly and not chaotic. They are doing practical work step by step in accordance with the government's regulations. Guangxi University was originally in Liuzhou. Guilin only has primary and secondary schools. Secondary schools pay great attention to car training. We fully thought that we would be able to join a certain organization to save Guangxi there, but it did not meet our wishes because we are ashamed that we have not received rigorous military training, nor do we have rescue knowledge. We only have a passion, but our strength is not enough. Since we cannot go to the front to fight, it is better to run back to the rear and work hard. At the same time, in Guilin, where white goods are expensive, living will also become a problem because our remaining travel expenses are about to run out. We stayed in Guilin for two days and wanted to go to Nanning again. At that time, all the cars were used for military purposes, and only one or two cars could reach Liuzhou. This was really a coincidence. When buying tickets at the car company, we wanted to send a telegram to Annam asking for remittance, but we didn't know what banks in the area could remit money. We asked a Henan person, who also came to the station to buy tickets to Liuzhou. He was going to take the road to Annan Hanoi and then transfer to Yunnan United University to study. We thought that staying here was not a good strategy, and it would be best to go to Annam. This Henan man was very sincere. During our conversation, we learned that his surname was Yang. So we wrote a sincere letter to him, asking him to help with the travel expenses to Hanoi. After receiving our letter, he agreed to our request. We were really grateful and felt lucky to have Mr. Yang's help. So the three of us set off on the 29th, taking a public bus to Liuzhou. The fare from Gui to Liu was seven and a half dollars. The seats were very good, but on the car, if you don't wear glasses and tie a handkerchief on your nose and mouth, you will be blinded by the mud and sand that the car kicks up in your face and your mouth and nose will be filled. We quickly arrived in Liuzhou at four o'clock that foot.

As soon as we arrived in Liuzhou, we heard the bombing of × airplanes all the time. The most eye-catching thing there was "Guangxi University". We only stayed for one night. The next morning, because there were no passenger cars, we had to find two more people and hire a small car to move forward. This road to Nanning was very flat and rarely bombed by × airplanes. Along the way, there were sharp peaks that towered high above the clouds. We crossed two small rivers and passed through many small market towns. The journey of a whole day sent us to this new place again - Nanning.

### Local Market Conditions for Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Native Paper: Supply from Guangdong and Guangxi Severed, Prices Rise by Half

Native paper produced in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi in our country is a major commodity. Exports account for a significant proportion annually. However, due to the dumping of foreign paper, the native paper market has been greatly affected. Hong Kong was originally a distribution center for native paper, but recently the market has become even more depressed due to the impact of the war. The market conditions for products from various provinces in Hong Kong are described below:

Guangdong Products: (1) Changjiang Yu Kou Paper, produced in Shixing, Beijiang, is usually shipped to Hong Kong via Shaoguan and Guangzhou. Annual imports are approximately 30,000 bundles (50 catties per bundle). Previously, each bundle was valued at six yuan, but the current market price is nine yuan per bundle. Superficially, the price is lower than before, but in terms of the Hong Kong-Guangdong exchange rate, the difference is significant. Therefore, the current price is virtually much higher than before. (2) Dongzhuang Yu Kou Paper, produced in Nanxiong and the surrounding areas of southern Jiangxi, with annual imports of approximately 50,000 bundles. The former price was five yuan per bundle, and the current price is six yuan per bundle. The above two types of native paper are mainly sold to the South Seas Islands, accounting for more than 60% of the total, while 40% is consumed locally in Hong Kong. (3) Scripture Paper, used by students for writing exercises, is 75 knives per bundle. (4) Heavy Barrel Paper, used for making firecrackers, is 50 knives per bundle. Both types are produced in Fuhan, Baishun, and other places, with annual shipments to Hong Kong estimated at 20,000 bundles each, valued at two and a half yuan per bundle. It is estimated that the annual trade volume of Guangdong native paper in Hong Kong reaches 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.

Fujian Products: Yu Kou paper is the largest product of the province, used as raw material for manufacturing ledgers and stationery. It is of excellent quality and more expensive. The domestic and foreign sales markets are not weak, with export routes usually shipping through Shantou to Hong Kong. Since the fall of Xiamen last year, the new production areas in the interior have also become tense, and paper mills have produced very little. Therefore, the supply to the Hong Kong market has dried up. Fujian Yu Kou paper is divided into Four-Knife Zhuang, Four-and-a-Half-Knife Zhuang, Five-Knife Zhuang, and Six-Knife Zhuang. The first two types are most suitable for the Hong Kong market, with a total of 50,000 to 60,000 bundles imported to Macau and Hong Kong annually. The best quality is five yuan per knife (approximately ten catties), medium quality is four yuan, and low quality is three yuan. The annual trade volume is approximately 200,000 yuan.

Guangxi Products: (1) Wan Jin Paper, produced in Guilin, is used as raw material for firecrackers. The largest amount is transshipped to Macau because many firecracker factories are established there. Annual imports are approximately 100,000 bundles, valued at one yuan and seven to eight jiao per bundle. (2) Yu Kou Paper, a very coarse paper, commonly known as grass paper, with annual imports of approximately 18,000 bundles, valued at two yuan per bundle. Local consumption accounts for 80%. (3) Gauze Paper, the most common paper produced in Guangxi, with annual imports estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 bundles, valued at two to three yuan per bundle. The annual trade volume of Guangxi paper in Hong Kong (including shipments to Macau) reaches more than 600,000 yuan. It is estimated that the supply of Guangdong and Guangxi native paper to Hong Kong is almost non-existent, and the supply from Fujian is also low. Therefore, the price of paper has risen by 50% compared to before.

### British Relief Fund Hong Kong Branch Plans to Hold Charity Football Match; Football Association Pre-Determines Li Huitang as Center Forward for Hong Kong Interport Team; Shanghai Footballer Bei Lu Comes to Hong Kong to Play for Kowloon Club

[Special Report from this newspaper] Out of sympathy for the British Relief Fund Hong Kong Branch, it plans to hold a charity football match in the near future to raise funds for the relief of Chinese refugees. It is heard that the Chairman of the Fund, Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote, has sent a letter to the Football Association proposing this idea, requesting the Association to find a way to make the event successful. After receiving the letter, the Association, considering that the matter concerns a charitable cause, should assist and decided to accept Sir Northcote's good intentions, but the date of the event is still under discussion.

A member of the Football Association's representative selection committee for the Hong Kong Interport team, visited Li Huitang yesterday to inquire about his opinion on whether he would be willing to be a representative, because all the selection committee members believe that he is also the ideal center forward for the Hong Kong team. If he agrees to be selected, then the inland area should be one of the representatives of central China. However, because he has been invited by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and may go to Shanghai at that time, he has not yet given a definite answer to the committee member.

Bei Lu is a footballer from Shanghai, but the team he played for in Shanghai has not yet been verified. After arriving in Hong Kong, he was recruited by the Kowloon Club. It is heard that his defensive midfielder skills are very good. This Saturday and Sunday, Kowloon Club will play against Eastern in the First Division League. He can play and how this newcomer will perform at that time.

### Women's Basketball Last Night: Each Game Was Quite Competitive; Pui To, Overseas Chinese, and South China Win

[Special Report from this newspaper] Last night, three women's basketball games were held. Because it was not a clash between strong teams, the atmosphere was not very heated. Speaking of the battles, it was okay for Hong Kong University and Southwest to win, and the game between Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong University was also quite tense, with a good atmosphere.

At half past six, the god of war arrived at the gym. Pui To played against Southwest. After the tip-off, Southwest first scored two points directly from a free throw, opening the scoring. After a while of chaotic play, Southwest scored another point, taking a 3-0 lead. The Southwest players, seeing that the loss was still small, calmly responded. After a long time, Ruixin finally won a point back for their team, ending the first quarter at 4-2.

After the restart, Yiyin took advantage of the continuous fouls to add one point. At this time, Southwest assigned Zhi to replace Cui Rong, greatly boosting morale. However, Yiyin's shooting was divinely assisted, and she frequently scored points. The Southwest players could only sigh helplessly. When the score reached 11-6, the break time arrived again.

In the second half, under the control of Pui To, Southwest could only score three points thanks to the efforts of Ruixin and Zhi, and then gained nothing. However, Chan Hing and Wan Zhen played very hard. Therefore, although Pui To was able to end this quarter with a 20-11 victory, they sought to avoid being too strenuous.

In the final quarter, Southwest still hoped to gradually recover their lost ground, but the Pui To players did not dare to underestimate the enemy. Therefore, the score continued to rise until the end of the whole game. Pui To finally defeated Southwest with a score of 28-16.

With the first game over, the next match began. This game was between Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong University. Originally, the strength of Overseas Chinese was much better than that of Hong Kong University. However, due to the absence of Rongtang and the loss of an old partner by Shougong, the impact was great. In addition, since Hong Kong University got Wenhua to direct them again, and after adjusting Li Zongru to Siam to guard, they were able to implement a man-to-man defense policy, greatly improving their strength. Therefore, at the end of the first quarter, Hong Kong University, with their efforts, was able to take the lead with a score of 7-4.

In the second quarter, Overseas Chinese performed more vigorously than in the previous quarter, but because they lost three points, it took time to recover. Moreover, Wenhua also scored several times, so at the end of the first half, Overseas Chinese only took the lead by two points with a score of 16-14.

In the third quarter, the morale of Overseas Chinese was even higher. Shougong weaved through the defense, making him very difficult to catch. He was truly skilled. Hong Kong University only scored three free throws in this quarter. Therefore, their score gradually fell behind, and they were no longer as majestic as at the beginning.

In the final quarter, Hong Kong University once connected through Wenhua, and the score gradually caught up. Unexpectedly, after five minutes, the momentum was gone. Moreover, the end of the game was not far away. Just as Wenhua scored two penalty shots, the whistle blew, and Overseas Chinese returned triumphantly with a score of 32-27.

In the last game, South China played against Huai Za. Paulo was mostly new material, and their strength was weak. South China should have won by a large margin, but because Ruomei and Yu divided the opportunities repeatedly, the scores were not too far apart. Speaking of the battle, it was very interesting. However, due to space limitations, I will not say more. The final score is as follows. (Man Under the Basket)

### Inter-School Table Tennis Tournament: Kowloon Wins

The table tennis school team league match between Ren and Kowloon was held at the Eastern Club last night. Kowloon was one step ahead and defeated Queen's College with a score of 5-0.

### Movies and Theatre

Entertainment... The Little Lord Fauntleroy

Lord Jelf

It is a film with educational significance, and will be of great interest to every parent and general child and youth.

Freddie Bartholomew, the child star who moved every audience in "David Copperfield," here plays an orphaned boy who has been spoiled by education, exploited by a pair of cunning con men, and trained to claim to be the son of a certain nobleman, traveling around to swindle people. He is later arrested and sent to a criminal school, where he is forced to learn some nautical skills. The story tells of his life and that of his classmates of his type. One of his classmates is played by the boisterous and lively child star Mickey Rooney, who has already become a junior officer at the school. The counterfeit little aristocrat is captured after escaping once, but later becomes a friend.

We still remember that these two child stars once worked together in "Captains Courageous." Although the personalities they portrayed were very different, they had a very complementary effect and were a very good pair of partners. Now their ages have grown slightly, and their acting skills have become more mature, especially with regard to the nature of young people. Adding an interesting story, and the children's sincere, enthusiastic and courageous performances, enriches the content of this film.

Empress... Give Me a Sailor

Give Me A Saflor

The previous collaborations between Huan Sharei and Bob Hope have all been extremely successful. In this film, there is a more outstanding performance, proving that they are still a very suitable partner. The film is full of endless jokes, and is an ideal work for audiences who watch movies for entertainment.

The story depicts the crazy and dissolute lives of some American sailors on vacation. Among them, a pair of brothers on the same ship made a lot of jokes because they pursued the wrong love object.

Marais is the central figure of the film. She plays a girl who is lonely and infatuated. From beginning to end, she maintains an excellent performance. Bob's embarrassing facial expressions and his humorous and witty lines can be called unparalleled.

Also starring Betty Grable, a beautiful and lively star, she also has a clear and melodious singing voice. The film has a total of four new songs, all recent works by famous musicians, sung by the two of them, adding a lot of entertainment value to the film.

Ping An... The Spy Ring

The Spy Rfng

A spy color film with nothing commendable. The director failed to give full play to the activities and adventurous plots of the spies. In addition, he forced the insertion of polo matches and some humorous scenes, piecing together this mismatched film.

The story tells how a group of international spies operate in the United States, trying to steal the drawings of a newly invented air defense weapon, but because of the inventor's heroic and cleverness, their cunning scheme is finally shattered. The acting skills of all the actors are also very mediocre.

Eastern... I Cover The War

I Cover The War

An early war film depicting the rebellion in Mesopotamia, while inserting a romance. If you look at it with today's eyes, then the few war scenes inside are no longer successful. The protagonist is John.

Dahua... You're Only Young Once

You’re Only Youug Once

It is a very beneficial social film for young people, giving young men and women a powerful inspiration in the area of love.

The story tells of a happy family. The master is a fair and wise judge. He has one son and one daughter. When his whole family travels in California, his children each embark on the wrong path of complex love. He painstakingly rescued his children.

Although it is a very ordinary story, because the director's technique is not weak, it develops very clearly and lively. In terms of actors, because they are properly allocated, there are good performances, especially Louis Dayton, who plays the judge, portrays the performance of understanding the psychology of young people in love.

Jing Xing... To Mary - With Love

To Mary Wfth Love

A social romance film starring Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy.

Central... Galloping Ghost

Galloping Ghost

A product of a small American company, Republic, is a film with no artistic value. It is all about slapstick fights and thrilling scenes in order to please the audience. As the advertisement says, it is a great contribution after "Undersea Kingdom."

New World... Good Girl Marries Eighteen Times

Sequel

Cantonese Film

Starring Yuet-er

North River... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Troupe

St. Paul's is also willing to participate, but the venue and date of the match have not yet been determined and will be announced once preparations are complete.

### Training Methods for Track and Field

— Wang Xuezheng

In conclusion, we should not take those photos as our sole basis, nor should we overemphasize one or a few movements. We should conduct a precise and systematic study of the various movements involved in a sport. We should follow in the footsteps of famous athletes, but merely copying their superficial aspects will not only lead to no progress but often to regression.

For track and field athletes, the most important thing is the coordination of all body movements. To achieve coordination, exercises to develop muscles must be performed simultaneously. The training of track and field athletes should be step-by-step, establishing a solid foundation first. To have correct methods and beautiful posture, one should start with the most basic training. Muscle development also varies according to the different needs of each sport. For example, in shot put, special attention should be paid to the shoulders, back, arms, chest, legs, and buttocks. When practicing this sport, we should start with the most basic methods and develop the muscles of the shoulders and back to the strongest possible level.

The most important thing in developing a track and field athlete is basic training. Training a beginner is already difficult because the beginner's movements are not coordinated, and their body is not balanced. However, training an athlete who has received incorrect training is even more difficult. Such an athlete naturally has no hope of reaching the peak. Therefore, an athlete who wants to become famous must receive proper training from the beginning.

In fact, as long as the movements are coordinated and the body is balanced, track and field is not a difficult thing. But to have coordinated movements and a balanced body, one must first have a healthy physique.

In addition to developing the muscles that are most needed during exercise to the strongest possible degree, other parts of the body should not be completely neglected. For example, many long-distance or short-distance runners only focus on training their legs and neglect other parts. In fact, the most important part is the torso, as the body's center of gravity is within the torso. Our strength and various movements are closely related to the torso.

For example, long-distance or short-distance runners rely entirely on the foundation of their body for their leg movements, that is, the lower abdomen and buttocks. Also, when hurdling or high jumping, the muscles that control the extension and contraction of the legs are the lower abdominal muscles, waist muscles, and erector spinae muscles. When throwing or pushing, if the serratus anterior (located under the pectoralis major) and latissimus dorsi (located under the armpit) are used simultaneously to twist the body, the results will be far better than just using the biceps and triceps of the upper arm. However, many long-distance or short-distance runners waste a lot of time on exercises such as alternately swinging their legs forward and backward as far as possible. They think that this will give them a wide stride. Even worse, they overemphasize the muscles of the lower leg and do not fully utilize the quadriceps femoris on the front of the thigh, and almost completely neglect the muscles of the buttocks and back. These muscles control the movement of the legs when running, such as ensuring that the feet and legs are not raised too high when lifted backward. All of these points must be carefully considered when running. Short-distance runners who focus on training the lower leg can increase their running speed, but they cannot reach the highest speed, and progress almost completely stops after a certain point. This is because they only focus on training the lower leg, and as a result, the lower leg muscles are very developed, but other necessary muscles are too far behind.

Many field event athletes are also like this. When throwing, they only rely on the strength of their arms and do not use the power of body extension and twisting. As a result, when they throw, their body retracts, and their feet change position too early. Some coaches also think that the most important component for throwing power is the legs. While the legs are indeed a very important component in this sport, they are not the most important component. In fact, when throwing a shot put or discus with the left hand, most of the power comes from the body's twisting motion to the left.

Therefore, not only athletes but even coaches must have a deep and systematic understanding of this sport. The most important thing in training track and field athletes is basic training. The so-called basic refers to muscle development, body balance, and coordinated movements. Regarding muscle development, one should focus on the necessary muscles and also ensure the body's average development. To establish a solid foundation, one must proceed step-by-step and not be impatient. It also requires perseverance and a strong will. Many athletes try to break their existing records every time they practice, believing that this is the only way to make rapid progress. At present, their views may not seem to have any flaws, but the result of practicing this way will be no hope of reaching the peak.

Due to limited space, I cannot introduce to all readers various exercises designed specifically to train the physique of track and field athletes. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will discuss them one by one. The effects of these exercises are threefold: (1) to develop muscles, adapting to the different needs of various sports; (2) to coordinate movements and balance the body; (3) to enable us to truly understand the principles of throwing, running, jumping, and other actions.

### Is Studying Useful?

— Fang Yu Yan

One

"As long as young people study, studying is saving the country," is the saying of those who advocate studying above all else.

"As long as young people save the country, there is no need to study," is the saying of those who generally believe that studying is useless.

In fact, both of these statements are biased and incorrect. Those who advocate studying above all else and say "studying is saving the country" are actually advocating national subjugation by encouraging young people to sit idly by and wait for the country to be conquered. We must take on the responsibility of eliminating the poison of this kind of national subjugation theory. Those who believe that studying is useless and say "saving the country requires no studying" are actually leading young people down the path of blind action and reckless behavior, which would harm the country. We must rise up as a group and correct this erroneous argument.

Our argument is to USE books, not to read books to death, to die while reading books, or to read dead books. Books are a useful tool—they enable people to receive the cultural experience of humanity, making people's minds clear and their thinking correct. They are a tool for guiding oneself forward and for guiding the masses forward. We must use whatever books are needed for whatever tasks we are doing. We use books to solve problems, and we use books to create undertakings. In the current stage, we must use books to resist the war and build the country. In other words, books are our great assistants and guides. They can help and guide us to see every problem more clearly, to know more correctly, and to arrive at a more correct solution. They can help and guide us to obtain more and better methods for every undertaking, and to be able to improve the things we are doing and the undertakings we are creating to be even better, with a more progressive future and a more promising future. They can help and guide us to know more details about the grand plan of resisting the war and building the country, to grasp it more firmly and correctly, and to make our belief in the final victory more firm, so that the final victory can come sooner. Therefore, what we use are: books that guide the advancement of life, books that guide the creation of undertakings, books that guide the resistance war and the building of the country, and books that guide the solution of problems. The more we use them in a practical way, the more progress our lives will make, the more confident we will be in solving problems, the more progress our undertakings will make, and the more powerful the resistance war and the building of the country will be able to generate in order to achieve the goal of resisting the war and winning for sure, and of building the country for sure. Come, let's all use books, let's use useful books, and let's oppose reading dead books. Let's oppose reading useless books. Let's all become active in using useful books!

Therefore, libraries are the treasure house of modern knowledge, the lighthouse that guides modern youth in establishing themselves, cultivating themselves, and conducting themselves in the world. They are the great source that drives the progress of modern social culture. We must use the strength of all the men and women of society to enrich this treasure house, illuminate this lighthouse, and increase and expand this source, so that it becomes increasingly rich, increasingly bright, and increasingly increased and expanded, and becomes a great driving force for social evolution. This is of course a great driving force that charitable people in society are willing to increase and cultivate.

If you can buy us a two-cent or five-cent ticket, or a one-yuan, two-yuan, or five-yuan ticket, it will be a contribution to our library, and we will welcome and thank you. If you can donate books worth more than one, twenty, fifty, or one hundred yuan to us, we will be even more grateful and welcome you, and will respectfully present you with a "Honorary Ticket" for a seat. Donors of books worth more than one hundred yuan will have their names inscribed in the library to leave a permanent memorial.

The enthusiasm and loyalty of our teachers and students in doing things, and our honesty, will be seen by the people of society. However, our ability to do things and our experience are very limited, and we sincerely hope that advanced people in society will not hesitate to give us guidance and give us more and better guidance and support, then we will be extremely honored.

### Random Thoughts on Reading History

— Xiangfei

There are many precedents in history of borrowing foreign force to quell internal strife. The most famous is probably Wu Sangui's leading the Qing troops into the pass. Although his motive was nothing more than "angering over a beauty with a simple crown," later generations did not hesitate to give him the label of "traitor."

When Li Zicheng invaded Beijing and forced Emperor Chongzhen to his death, it was a time of national chaos. The Qing people took advantage of the opportunity to hold a funeral for the Ming emperor and empress, ordering officials and civilians to mourn for three days, which at the time was quite "grateful and virtuous" for some people, right? Later, Ma Shiying, the governor of Fengyang, supported Prince Fu Zhu Yujian to ascend the throne in Nanjing, and Shi Kefa even received a reprimand from a Qing general: something like "The law of the Spring and Autumn Annals: If there are bandits who are not punished, then the new emperor cannot be written as having ascended the throne." This led Shi Kefa to dig out historical facts of revival from history to resolve the suspicion of establishing himself; and he also skillfully explained: "We respectfully treated the troops in August, and sent envoys to reward the army; and also wanted to ask for orders, and join forces to attack the west: therefore, the royal army has already set out, and then proceeded to the Jianghuai area." At that time, Shi Kefa did not want to propose a "peace plan," but only blamed him with righteousness: "Your country drove out the rebellious bandits, and the army moved with righteousness; if you plan this territory, it would be an incomplete virtue: therefore, if righteousness begins and ends with profit, it will be laughed at by the bandits!"

In fact, saying that the Qing soldiers were a "righteous army" was originally a helpless act: the ultimate goal of the Qing soldiers was to seize the "national treasures." The so-called righteous army punishing bandits was just a facade. How could Shi Kefa not understand?

Is history really cyclical? Now, there are still people who want to be Wu Sangui, "stationing troops in Inner Mongolia," "jointly preventing communism," again using the old trick of the Manchus destroying the Ming.

Now there is no "rebellious banditry" of Li Zicheng in the country at all—randomly grabbing a party and taking it as "rebellious banditry" is either blind or has ulterior motives. The × people are quite familiar with Chinese history, and know that to deceive modern "Wu Sanguis," it is necessary to first create an atmosphere of "rebellious banditry." "Jointly preventing communism" is just the deceptive rhetoric of the × people. What is strange is that there are actually fools who take the bait!

Wu Sangui's plea for Qing soldiers was "angering over a beauty with a simple crown." Although it is killable to be a traitor for such a trivial matter, tracing his motive, it was only a temporary confusion. What about the modern "Wu Sangui"? Even the yellow-faced woman by the bedside came out to plan for him. The reason for such a trivial matter is untenable, so it is only for "official addiction."

Wasn't Wu Sangui also the Prince of Pingxi? As a result, there was a rebellion of the Three Feudatories, and he did not die well—the modern "Wu Sangui" should learn from others not to repeat history!

### Words That Make Sense

— Ziyou

Everyone can say this reasoning, as long as your eloquence is a bit better, the reasoning will become an article. When I was taking composition class in childhood, the teacher said, "Everyone's opinions are different, as long as the writing is fluent and can make sense, it is a good work."; Later, when I was studying in university, the professors also said, "Learning is nothing else, as long as you can justify yourself, you can become an independent thinker." Thinking about it carefully, it is indeed reasonable. Otherwise, strange and bizarre theories and arguments would not exist.

Ilich once said, "In the extremely complex phenomena of social life, we can always find any number of examples or facts to prove any point of view." Proof of the defeatist theory, quick victory theory, compromise theory, and all the books and publications of national traitors since the War of Resistance are the best examples.

Wang's betrayal of the party and the country, absurd statements, and begging for surrender through × have become a foregone conclusion. But he wears colored glasses himself, and looks at Wang's private newspaper as someone with color. But today a "our serious protest," tomorrow a "our position," repeatedly defending Wang, such a great reasoning, perhaps some people in Hong Kong think they "make sense!" Traitor theory is often "words that make sense," like poison coated with sugar. We must raise our vigilance against traitor theories; constantly, extensively, refute incorrect theories.

The reason why words can make sense is of course related to the lack of understanding of those who are confused, but the main thing is that the "words" are creating trouble. Because only "words" are required to be "reasonable," facts are disregarded; only one side of the issue is mentioned, and not its entirety. This is the root cause of incorrect theories. But in any case, it cannot escape the palm of Mr. Reality. As long as you use facts to verify, Wang's "loyalty to the country, bright and upright, openly building a building to the government" turns out to be secretly betraying the country and openly begging for mercy from our nation's × people. The so-called "taking the independent survival of the country and nation and the independent integrity of territorial sovereignty as the principle of conducting peace talks" is to allow × people to live and station troops freely in our country, to give the four northeastern provinces to the × people, to put the lifeblood of the nation - economic power in the hands of the × people; to put it bluntly, it is to surrender under the conditions of national subjugation. Leaving aside the many guerrilla teams that are attacking back and forth, only talking about a small part of the "bandits" who are wandering around (most of whom were bought by the × people), of course, can only get the absurd theory that the guerrillas are useless. Not talking about the progress of the War of Resistance, first circling around the bad things, the War of Resistance is of course one benefit with a hundred harms. But the eloquent Mr., if you act according to your wishes, the fact is that you are handing over China to Japan with both hands. What we want is not beautiful words and writing!

I think, if we don't talk about reasoning, then that's it, but if we want to talk about it, we have to find out the development and key points of the entire objective situation, and seize the facts to speak.

### The Distance Between Two Eras

— Mengqi

Until I graduated from school and went to work, I asked my father about this matter once. Father said:

"Children have things they should do, and things they cannot do. If things you cannot do make you aware and worry, it will delay the things you should do."

At the time, I didn't understand the benefits of these words. It wasn't until I became a father myself that I deeply realized that these words accurately explained the basic attitude of being a father.

I don't need to hide it. Father has many shortcomings. In thought and action, Father Gui is a figure from the old world. His individualism is very strong, and his personality is also very strong. In the training of his son, he always had the idea of "like me, like me." Due to the different education and sense of the times, many cracks gradually appeared in my thoughts and those of my father. Not insignificant conflicts occurred. For a time, my father simply ignored me, and my heart was also filled with contempt and resentment towards my father. If it hadn't been for my mother's tears moistening everyone's feelings, a break-up would have been very possible for a time. Coincidentally, under the low pressure in the family, I had something to do in a very remote place. Parting and forgetting eased the dispute between us. First, the old man couldn't stand the loneliness and wrote a long letter full of emotion, which turned my resentment against my father into self-blame. After that, we never mentioned the past again, until I had been away for several years and returned to my hometown. At this time, everyone was calm, and one day, we just talked about the past as if it were "research" data. Father said earnestly:

"I was wrong that time. I only saw my own world and didn't see your world. My world is already old. Although I don't understand what your world is like, I think it should be to replace the old with the new..."

Father's cheerfulness and joy forced out my remorseful tears.

Last year, I had something to do in Guangdong. Father helped me pack my luggage with great excitement. It was very hot at that time. Father's body was fat and his movements were really difficult. Mother advised him not to do it, and he almost got angry, saying that as long as it was something he liked to do, it wouldn't matter if it was hot. Mother had no choice but to follow him and fan him. Father wiped off the soybean-sized sweat beads and folded my clothes one by one according to the time of year, telling me which clothes were on the bottom layer and which clothes were on the top layer, and which suits were suitable for wearing in the south at what time of year. At that time, I was only staring at the sweat beads on his forehead in a daze, and I didn't pay much attention to what he said. After everything was arranged, Father insisted on taking me to the boat, saying that I was not careful in doing things and that he had to take care of it himself—in fact, I had already "gone out" several times before. When I arrived in Shanghai, because the ship was delayed, after my repeated persuasion, Father agreed to go home first. It's really strange. I've been running around and rarely at home, but only this time, before I left, my father was very reluctant to leave, and he repeatedly told me about trivial matters such as diet and daily life. At the moment when I was about to get on the car, he was simply crying and couldn't look up; if it hadn't been for "self-restraint," I would have wanted to hug the old man warmly at that time.

### The Division Between Civilization and Savagery

— Bai Ying

According to a boast by a Japanese soldier, the level of knowledge of Japanese soldiers is far higher than that of Chinese soldiers when comparing the soldiers of the two countries, China and Japan. Thereupon, a "rear-area" writer immediately wrote an article, asserting that China is a barbaric country with low culture and citing the words of a celebrity, saying that famous generals have never come from among barbarians, but from among cultured people.

Next, in order to show his "writer's" "fair" attitude, he also said that we cannot deny the robustness of wildness while proving the strength of civilized people. Because ancient history often shows that many civilized countries have been conquered or threatened by barbarians. For example, ancient Persia, with its high degree of civilization, was often invaded by barbarians. The central plains cultural area of China was often harassed by the Yi and Di tribes, and was even conquered several times. Moreover, he determined that the proletariat's attempt to "conquer" the bourgeoisie is nothing more than a delusional hope for victory from a lower level of culture.

However, the final victory in the battle between barbarism and civilization will inevitably still belong to civilization, even this "rear-area" writer admits. It is said that the struggle between ancient Sparta and Athens is the best example. Although Sparta's military power was strong for a time, in the end, Sparta was destroyed, while the civilization of Athens still exists in the world today.

If today's Japan is the "civilized" Athens, and China is the "barbaric" Sparta, I wonder if this "writer" has the courage to admit it? When he picks up his pen, he wants to slap others in the face, but every time he slaps his own!

Aggression is a barbaric act, even Hitler and Mussolini said so. Our "rear-area" writer is a supporter of the Berlin-Rome Axis. Naturally, he does not dare to be innovative. In fact, a truth that has long been universally recognized, no matter how cunning you are, is inconvenient to deny. However, the ambition of the aggressor will never stop his aggressive actions simply because such a truth exists. Therefore, he can only make a misattribution and play a trick, insisting that the aggressor is the aggressed, and that the aggressed is the aggressor. Although this strategy of inverting right and wrong is a passive strategy, after all, because of its "barbarism," it can no longer think of a "civilized" strategy.

To argue today about who is the aggressor between China and Japan is simply idiotic nonsense. The League of Nations, which brings together the world's civilized countries, has already determined who is the aggressor for us, and world opinion has long unanimously exposed the true face of the aggressor without any concealment. However, because the "barbaric" weapons are still in the hands of the aggressor, although the theorem of right and wrong has been separated, we still have to use our own blood and flesh to prove the truth of this theorem.

In terms of common-sense knowledge, perhaps the military technical knowledge of Japanese soldiers is stronger than that of Chinese soldiers. This is because Japan has this kind of military technical equipment. If China also had this kind of highly technical equipment, then the knowledge of Chinese soldiers in this area would certainly not be inferior to that of Japan. As for knowledge from the perspective of truth, the "cultural nature" of Japanese soldiers is most clearly expressed in the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities. Take a look at Amejels Veapa, a spy, to see how much difference there is between the "cultural nature" in the mouths of Japanese soldiers and the "tacit nature" of barbarians.

It is true that famous generals come from among cultured people, such as the current supreme commander of China and his subordinates. As for the fact that the commanders of Japan have been changed and transferred during the sixteen months of the Sino-Japanese War (and are now undergoing major changes), this is enough to show their fluster. The ugly state of so-called "famous generals" has been completely exposed. A schemer like Doihara is the epitome of a Japanese "famous general," cruel and tyrannical, greedy, lacking rationality, all of which is the nature of Japanese soldiers!

The division between the civilization and savagery of a nation is determined by its sense of justice and its practice. This interpretation also applies to the division between the civilization and wildness of the Sino-Japanese War. All distortions and concealments will never escape the demon-revealing mirror of truth.
