### The Great Unity of Democratic Nations: An Important Task for Our Country Today

Following the German aggressors' annexation of the Czech Republic, the European situation has become increasingly tense, serious, and critical. Observers familiar with the international situation have unanimously pointed out that Hitler will take advantage of this invincible momentum to actively prepare for further aggression. According to yesterday's telegram, the Fascist troops that "conquered" the Czech Republic have already left Prague and are heading east, threatening Romania and Yugoslavia as targets of plunder. At the same time, they have firmly rejected the protests of the former British and French governments regarding the Czech events, and have presented Romania with an economic plunder "ultimatum." As a result, the situation has become increasingly dangerous, with the cloud of war spreading across Europe. Newspapers in various countries have published news about Hitler's further conspiracies to invade. Even the London newspapers, including The Times, which usually sang praises under Chamberlain's policy that "the European situation is much clearer than last year," have unanimously pointed out that the desires of Fascist aggressors led by Hitler and Mussolini are insatiable. Once they succeed in one step, they immediately take a second step of aggression. It is particularly noteworthy that the German aggressors' target today is not the Soviet Union, a bulwark of peace with strong defenses, but Southeast Europe, attempting to create a Third Reich in the Mediterranean and Central Europe! This shows that the aggressors' ambitions are no longer limited to redistributing colonies, but to re-dividing Europe and re-dividing the world. After conquering several intermediary countries and small nations one after another, their sharp blades will be directed at the capitalist democracies that have indulged or assisted the aggressors through appeasement policies! At the same time, what we cannot ignore is that those rampant in Europe today are not naturally ambitious despots and villains, but there is the existence of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo "triangle" alliance. Although there are still many contradictions between them, they are closely linked and act in unison on the entire path of aggression! Today, as German aggressors advance east and south from the Czech Republic, Italian aggressors are also coveting the region between Europe and Africa, especially encircling France step by step, eager to dissect it. Meanwhile, Japanese aggressors are dramatically launching new offensives in the Far East, feigning preparations for war against the Soviet Union but actually advancing southwest. This kind of collaboration among international Fascist aggressors to prevent democratic countries from attending to both the East and West while engaging in plunder and division is now an accomplished fact. We have repeatedly exposed the new conspiracies and new offensives of Fascist aggressors. What should be pointed out today is that the active development of these conspiracies and offensives has made democratic and peaceful countries painfully aware of the seriousness of the threat they face, and naturally also poses a considerable threat to our cause of resistance and national construction.

Under this serious threat, the question of the great unity of democratic and peaceful countries, and the question of the consolidation and expansion of the peace front, have been solemnly and urgently raised. Therefore, in the past few days, in the midst of dark clouds on the international stage, there have surprisingly been sparks illuminating the future of light and victory. Particularly noteworthy is, firstly, the tendency of Britain and France to abandon appeasement diplomacy and adopt active steps to resist Fascist aggressors. This is concretely manifested in the British and French governments' protest to Germany regarding the Czech events, the recall of the British and French ambassadors to Germany, the simultaneous declaration by the British and French governments that they will never recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, the preparations of the British and French governments for cooperation in resisting Fascist aggressors, especially the British Cabinet's decision on the 18th to immediately maintain close contact with all peace-loving countries around the world, the British government's preparation to move from economic cooperation to political cooperation with the Soviet Union, and the French President's scheduled visit to the United States to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the issue of uniting democratic countries. Secondly, the United States' policy of uniting with democratic countries to oppose Fascist aggression and defend world peace has become more resolute and progressive. This is concretely manifested in President Roosevelt's severe condemnation of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic and his loud call for cooperation among democratic countries, the U.S. government's formal delivery of a diplomatic note condemning Germany's illegal atrocities, the U.S. Treasury Department's abolition of the U.S.-Czech agreement and implementation of economic sanctions against Germany, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's proposal to abolish the Neutrality Act, the decline in the momentum of all opposition factions, and the rise of the people's anti-Fascist united front. Thirdly, Romania, which is about to be invaded, has followed Spain and our country in deciding to offer the aggressors a death-defying and sustained resistance to defend its national sovereignty and territory. This is concretely manifested in the Romanian government's rejection of the German ultimatum, the Romanian government's adoption of defensive measures, ordering the mobilization of 500,000 people to prepare for the crisis, especially the Romanian King's expression to the British government that if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are willing to provide assistance, he can unite Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and other countries to resolutely confront the aggressors. In addition, the Soviet Union, which is holding the 18th Congress of the Communist Party to prepare for defending the socialist motherland and safeguarding the independence of all nations and world peace, issued a note to the German government on the 19th by Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov, declaring that the Soviet Union will never recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. At the same time, the Soviet ambassador to Britain has been consulting with the French and American envoys and British diplomatic authorities for several days, preparing to deal with the aggressors' adventurous attacks.

When we see this news, we can first see that the Fascist aggressors' mad adventures are irreversible, and there is no possibility of compromise with them. This proves that all pro-peace arguments that attempt to compromise with Fascist aggressors in the name of "anti-communism" and "anti-Sovietism" are baseless. In fact, they are still criminal acts of helping the aggressors and robbers to commit evil, betraying the nation, and destroying democracy! Secondly, the fact that democratic and peaceful countries have begun to actively move towards the road of unity proves that all pessimists about the peace front are baseless, proves that all malicious slanders against the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy are baseless, and at the same time proves that all shameless arguments that denigrate our country's national policy of uniting democratic and peaceful countries to jointly resist aggression are also baseless! However, we must still pay attention here, and we must guard against frivolous, pointless, and irresponsible optimistic tendencies! We must more deeply recognize the growing maturity of the possibility of a great alliance of democratic countries and the inevitable trend of consolidating and expanding the peace front. However, at the same time, we should also note that the contradictions between democratic countries are still developing, and the obstacles to the future of the peace front and external attacks are still extremely serious. All erroneous concepts about the union of democratic countries and the peace front are still seriously present. Therefore, on the one hand, we must accelerate the great unity of democratic countries and intensify the consolidation and expansion of the peace front in order to increase the momentum of the struggle for resistance and national construction. However, to complete this task, we urgently need not only the general mobilization of national diplomacy, the general mobilization of international propaganda, and the general mobilization of the anti-Fascist struggle of the peoples of democratic countries, aggressive countries, and all oppressed countries, but also the strengthening of the unity of all ethnic groups, all parties, and all classes in our country, resolutely supporting the protracted war of resistance, and accelerating progress in military, economic, and political affairs, especially by quickly establishing people's organizations across the country and provincial and county councils, and using the facts of our implementation of democratic politics in the war of resistance to welcome the great unity of democratic countries around the world.

### Jiangnan is Mobilizing: The Three People's Principles Youth League is Forming Branches, and Farmers' Organizations are Calling for General Mobilization of Farmers

(Shanghai Correspondence) The Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League recently issued a declaration stating that the Three People's Principles Youth League is the only emerging revolutionary organization and has been unanimously recognized by the whole country. This is the inevitable result of the development of Chinese history and the requirements of the current stage of the Chinese revolution: First, it is necessary to concentrate revolutionary forces and strive for the final victory in the War of Resistance. Second, it is necessary to mobilize revolutionary forces and build a new foundation for a new China based on the Three People's Principles. Third, it is necessary to cultivate new and continuously revolutionary new forces. The Three People's Principles Youth League was born to meet this need, and its significance and mission are indescribable. The Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League intends to launch new revolutionary work in the Jiangnan area, and has specially established the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch to accelerate the organization of lower-level teams in order to lay a new revolutionary foundation.

After three months of active preparation by the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Branch, lower-level teams from the Beijing-Shanghai area to the anti-Japanese area have been established one after another. Especially in Shanghai, in an extremely bad environment and under the darkness of dark forces, the revolutionary forces have successfully shown a thriving atmosphere and have invisibly become the main force of resistance and national construction.

However, the Jiangnan area, under the oppression of the × people, has formed an entire dark world, and all reactionary forces have taken the opportunity to extend themselves. Not only are the remnants of feudalism using the name of revolutionary forces to spread rumors and rob, but also Japanese imperialism is cleverly using the name of revolutionary forces to mix fish eyes with pearls and destroy the Chinese revolution. This is something we hate very much. Now, in addition to actively stepping up our work to suppress all reactionary attempts through work, we hope that the authorities from all walks of life will strictly guard against and severely crack down on them, unite under the banner of the Three People's Principles, and jointly recognize the development of revolutionary forces.

Although the Jiangnan Branch has only had a short three months of preparation time, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, giving us many conveniences in our work. This is something we are very excited and grateful for. We should redouble our efforts with a spirit of arduous revolution in order to quickly develop the league's affairs and spread the new life of the revolution throughout Jiangnan.

The 14th was the morning publicity day for the second phase of the Shanghai War of Resistance First Publicity Week. Shanghai farmers' organizations issued a letter to all compatriots in the agricultural sector, which is copied as follows: Dear friends in the city, Chinese farmers are the most revolutionary. In history, most of those who resisted oppression and raised the banner of rebellion were farmers. In China's War of Resistance against Japan, farmers are of course a main force. Just look at the soldiers currently fighting on the front lines, most of them come from the fields, and those who are constantly replenishing them are also the people. In terms of supplementing the army in the later stage of the War of Resistance, since farmers are the main body, then in the occupied areas, farmers are the only basic force for recovering old land. The bloody battle of Songhu for four months the year before last aroused the enthusiasm of farmers in the city to resist Japan and save the country. Everyone abandoned their hoes and either joined the army to splash the × people with hot blood, or organized wartime service teams to transport weapons, military rations, intelligence, and build fortifications. Even ordinary women have automatically shouldered the task of cooking and comforting the army. The artillery fire of × can destroy our fields, but it cannot destroy our determination to resist the war. On the contrary, the more intense the artillery fire of × people's invasion, the higher our enthusiasm for resisting ×. Even though Shanghai has fallen, our farmer friends have always guarded every inch of land left by our ancestors and waged the most arduous and heroic struggle. However, after carefully reviewing our past efforts, although we have made considerable achievements, we still feel that it is not enough. We must know that at this critical moment of national life and death, the people of the whole country should show a performance that transcends all historical precedents in their contributions to the country. On the negative side, we should endure all the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure. On the positive side, we should give full play to our highest potential strength and negotiate with ×× to the end. Now, I list five things as the common goals of our agricultural compatriots: First, participate in guerrilla warfare. From one village to one village, to one township to one town, and even to one district to one county, all those in their prime should gather together to form guerrilla teams. The tasks of the guerrilla team are approximately: First, attack the × people by surprise. Second, eradicate traitors. Third, protect production and its circulation. Fourth, strengthen political training. Second, engage in production. Farmers in areas within the guerrilla zone that are not controlled by the × people must not give up farming in addition to engaging in guerrilla work in order to maintain the supply of long-term operations. Third, non-cooperation movement with × people and traitors. In terms of economics, we should adopt a non-cooperation doctrine. One, refuse to use counterfeit currency. Second, refuse to pay taxes. Third, never use manpower or material resources to support ×. Fourth, refuse the infiltration of × goods into the guerrilla zone. Fourth, follow government orders. Farmers should absolutely follow the orders of the administrative organs established by the government in the guerrilla zone in order to consolidate the power of resistance and national construction. Fifth, vigorously implement the general mobilization of the national spirit. The general mobilization program of the national spirit and its implementation measures recently promulgated by Chairman Chiang should be earnestly followed in order to achieve the highest goal of national construction based on the Three People's Principles. The above five points are all urgent tasks for our farmer friends today. In order to defend our homeland, in order to strive for the independence, freedom, equality, and peace of our nation, we must follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and swear to fight the × people to the death. Shanghai is the general station in the rear. We not only will not allow them to take the system, but also want to fundamentally take it back.

### The Roar of the Ancient City

Chengdu, this ancient city without running water, no public buses, with roads that are narrow streets and alleys, and shops that are all wooden bungalows, except for "citizens must obey the orders of the air defense headquarters and the guidance of air defense personnel", "everyone should contribute money and effort to quickly complete the city's air defense construction", "without air defense equipment, everyone's life and property cannot be guaranteed", "families should prepare more sandbags to prevent incendiary bombs", "each family should set up more water tanks to store water for firefighting", and other air defense slogans, and sandbags piled up at various important intersections, with a military policeman stationed there, is just like many other rear cities. Not tense enough, the wartime atmosphere is not strong enough. The impact of the War of Resistance on Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan Province, only began a few months ago.

However, this ancient city is now beginning to roar.

The Chengdu cultural circles launched a "Military Building Movement Propaganda Week". This propaganda week started on the 5th and ended on the 11th.

On the first day, March 5th, from morning, every big and small shop in the city raised the national flag. Seeing this solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere, one cannot help but be moved. At one o'clock in the afternoon, a singing assembly was first held in Shaocheng Park. At the entrance of the assembly site, a large horizontal banner with white characters on a black background was hung, reading "Sichuan has a vast land and a large population. The army must be a national model." Beside the entrance, a statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, twelve feet high, made of bamboo strips and paper, raised an iron hand, with the words "Rise up, those who do not want to be slaves!" written on the arm. Inside was a large square that was crowded with plain male and female students and common people wearing blue cloth clothes. First, the Central Military Academy Military Rong team performed Qin's "Turkish March", followed by the Tianming, Amateur, Telecommunications, Youth Association and other four singing groups singing the "Military Building Song" in four parts, the Political Department of the Aviation Committee, the Divine Eagle Troupe singing "The Divine Eagle Song", "Building a Large Air Force", the Military Academy New Students singing "Triumphal Song", the Telecommunications Singing Troupe singing "We Want War", and the War Zone Children's Border Propaganda Troupe singing "Wandering Children" and "Refugee March", "Youth March". When they sang "We grew up in artillery fire... The Japanese warlords' artillery fire has forged us into revolutionaries. We are not afraid of lacking anything, we will take it from Japanese imperialism. One day, one day, we will fight back to our old home", tens of thousands of people were simply moved and excited to tears. Finally, tens of thousands of people in the entire assembly sang together "Sacrifice Has Reached the Final Moment", "National Salvation Army Song", "Volunteer Army March" and other songs. The magnificent and impassioned singing shook the clouds in the sky, and the Japanese warlords hiding in Tokyo also felt chilled and exclaimed: "Chinese people's spirit cannot be insulted!"

After the singing assembly ended, from three o'clock, there was an aviation performance. Two teams of planes flew in from the east, roaring wildly in the city sky for a while, and then began to practice throwing bombs, sometimes flying up, sometimes descending, and sometimes somersaulting. The citizens heard the strange cry of "Gu Gu" and stood on the street with their hands covering their eyes and looking up, knowing that it was their own plane performing. Thunderous applause rose from the streets and alleys, and everyone felt the great victory of the Lanzhou air battle in their hearts. After a while, the plane dropped countless leaflets, flying red and green all over the sky, like falling flowers, which was extremely beautiful. After a while, the leaflets fell to the ground, and the citizens scrambled to pick them up and read them. They were "Building a National Army to Overthrow Japanese Warlords", "Building a National Army to Protect the People", "Everyone Should Enlist in the Army, Victory in the War of Resistance is Certain", "Everyone Should Contribute to Building the Country is Certain", "A Good Soldier is a Model for a Good Citizen, and a Good Citizen is the Foundation for a Good Soldier", "A Great Man Joins the Army to Serve the Country, and a Good Man Dedicates His Life to the Battlefield", "Good Iron Can Be Used to Make Nails, and Good Men Should Be Soldiers", "A Brave Man Should Learn from Yue Wu Mu's Loyalty to the Country, and a Daughter Must Know That Qin Liangyu Joined the Army to Kill ×", "Qi Jiguang's Meritorious Service in Defending Against Bandits Will Last for Generations, and Hua Mulan's Name Will Be Known Throughout the Ages" and other slogans that most encouraged people to enthusiastically serve in the military.

At five o'clock in the evening, the third program - the beginning of the lantern parade - began. Before five o'clock, various agencies and groups arrived at the venue one after another, with a total of nearly one hundred units and more than 40,000 people. The meeting started at five o'clock, presided over by Huang Lilu, director of the provincial party headquarters, who said briefly: "In order to resist aggression and uphold world peace, our country must build a great national defense army in order to win the final victory in the War of Resistance against Japan. We Chinese have people, and for every Chinese, at least one Japanese can be beaten, but if we are a pile of loose sand, one Japanese can enslave seven Chinese. Therefore, our country must be militarized throughout the country, and everyone must be a national defense army, and Japan will have no choice but to fail..." These words pricked the hearts of the audience word by word, and everyone responded to him with thunderous applause. Afterwards, Dr. Yao Le, a leader of the Xinjiang Hui people, gave a speech on the meaning of "China is a whole nation, the Han people are working hard to build an army, smash the × people, and revive China", which won the crowd's cheers and thunderous applause. Immediately afterwards, six proposals were passed, and the lantern parade began. The fire was lit on the rostrum, and the people below followed suit and lit the lanterns in their hands. The lanterns were not ordinary paper lanterns, but War of Resistance lanterns that had been conceived with imagery. There were planes, warships, tanks, artillery, etc., all kinds of ladders, everything that should be there. Among them, the ones that won the most smiles from the citizens and made them deeply reflect were several symbolic lanterns such as "Turtle Lantern", "Snake Eating an Elephant", and "Japanese Emperor Revolving Pot". The "Turtle Lantern" was written with "Those who don't join the army are this", meaning to encourage people to enthusiastically serve in the military. "Snake Eating an Elephant" was a small snake crawling on the body of an elephant, but the snake had no ability to swallow the elephant at all, but was in danger of being trampled to death by the elephant. This symbolized that Japan could not annex China and would eventually be trampled to death by China. The "Japanese Emperor Revolving Pot" was to tie up a urinal, tie up a human body, and consider it the Japanese Emperor, with the upper body thrown into the pot and the lower body left outside. This symbolized that in the first phase of the War of Resistance, Japan had reached the end of its rope and would inevitably fail.

The team started from the Shaocheng Park venue, passed through Xiyu Street, Dongyu Street, Zhongdong Street, Chunxi Road, and Zongfu Street, and disbanded at the Zhongshan Public Group. The citizens knew early on that there would be a lantern parade that night, and most of them ate dinner earlier and squatted at the street to watch the excitement. The crowds were like mountains and seas, and water could not leak through, especially in the prosperous Chunxi Road. The reporter followed the team from the venue to Chunxi Road and was forced to stand at a multi-lens corner of the road and could not pass. Many people stood on the side of the road, unable to see the fire in the center of the road, so they took out bamboo chairs and benches from the store and rode on their feet to watch. Everyone saw the Flying Generals of the Air Force Sergeant School, the cannons and tanks of the Central Military Academy, and the national flag, the Prime Minister's portrait, and Chairman Chiang's portrait, and applauded and cheered enthusiastically. From time to time, the team sang the impassioned "Rise up, those who do not want to be slaves!..." The citizens on the street also sang along loudly. After the singing, they followed and shouted slogans: "Military-Civilian Cooperation, Resist the War to the End!", "Build a National Army and Overthrow Japanese Warlords!", "Long Live the Liberation of the Republic of China!"... After one person in the team shouted, the entire team and the citizens on the side of the road followed along. A Chen's singing and a Chen's slogan shook the northern suburbs in the sky to the point of silence...

It is said that Chengdu has never been so lively.

Now this ancient city, the metropolis of West China, has been awakened by the artillery fire of the War of Resistance and has begun to roar!

### Rapid Progress in Jinhua Lanxi (Part 2)

Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang

One is the Center of Resistance, One is a Commercial Hub

Women's Mobilization

The local people's enthusiastic spirit is no less than that of other places. In terms of society, the County Party Department and People's Education Center have established national salvation organizations in various towns, encouraging residents of various towns to actively donate money to save the country. The reporter went to the People's Education Center to inquire. According to them, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, they have actively organized local people, starting in the urban area, to guide residents on methods of air defense, anti-poisoning, and first aid. Currently, they are still carrying out plans to organize the people, hoping that every person in Lanxi can have sufficient wartime knowledge and the idea of saving the country. At the same time, women's organizations are also quite active. In addition to women's first aid classes, they also plan to train the flower boat girls of Lanxi. Because on the banks of the Lanxi River, there are many flower boats. According to the recent investigation by the county government, there are twenty-one flower boats in the urban area, with ninety boat girls, mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. However, among these nineteen boat girls, only five can read, eight have some embroidery skills, and the rest are illiterate and have no skills. Moreover, these boat girls are mostly idle, so there are plans to actively train them so that they can also serve the country. Secondly, in the Northwest Chenglong area of Lanxi (including Shangxi Xiajie Zouqian Beijin Street Xiachang Street, etc.), there are eighty-nine teahouses, all of which employ tea girls to entertain tea guests, totaling one hundred and thirty-two tea girls. Most of these tea girls are between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, so they are also taught first aid knowledge so that they can serve the country. At the same time, most of the boat girls and tea girls are willing to receive this training. This spirit is truly admirable.

Visiting Yongchang

Lanxi has night markets, which are very lively in West Street and other places. Several newly opened foreign goods shops have neon signs. Although it is night, the streets are still very crowded. When the reporter passed the city gate tower, there was a public library set up. He went up to visit, and there were many people reading. There was a large collection of newspapers from various places. On the bookshelf, there were several newly published magazines. There were also newspapers published locally in Lanxi, which were similar in content and format to the Jinsheng Daily in Jinhua. The total population of Lanxi County is 52,225. In the county's 993 townships, training is organized by district. "Yongchang is a military town in Lanxi. The reporter took a bus across the river to visit once. The journey took about sixty minutes. After getting off the bus, there was a winding rural road, and further in was a lively cross street. The town looked quite neat, with large shops on both sides. The town hall was found on the street, and the reporter went in to interview. According to the local mayor, "The rules for recruiting able-bodied men in this town are very strict. Regardless of rich or poor households, all those of able-bodied age must be sent for training, and no substitutes can be hired or deliberately delayed. In this time of national crisis, our cadres absolutely should not be careless. Otherwise, we would be letting the country down. A large number of able-bodied men in this town have already received training. As for the people's national salvation ideas, they are very high, so they are willing to donate money to subscribe to public bonds." In a town in the interior, it is admirable that they can have such a spirit.

Impressions of this Trip

In summary, this simple outline is enough to show that today's Eastern Zhejiang, although in the rear of the military, its entire organization still maintains a very sound structure. The economy, politics, and people's organizations in various places are all on the road to progress. We know that to achieve final victory, we need a solid front line, but also a stable rear. Today, the soundness of social organizations and the intensity of public sentiment in various parts of the Chinese rear are a clear symbol of achieving final victory. (End)

### Voice of Shanxi

— Yan You

A Letter from Shanxi

××: The letter you sent was received today, after five months. I wonder what changes have taken place in your life and work during these five months? I have been very busy these days organizing the internal affairs of the school, and there are many things waiting to be done. Even so, I still have to take the time to write this letter to you in the evening.

Since you returned to China, I have written very few letters to you. One reason is that I am at home, and many things cannot be said, for fear that your family will see them. The second reason is that you live in Shanghai, in the occupied area of Shanghai, and the situation there cannot be said, for fear of being censored, causing trouble for you. Now that I know letters can be forwarded in Hong Kong, I will of course write more letters to you in the future. Now I will briefly tell you about the situation here, my work, and my aspirations.

I am now in the Fifth Administrative District of Southeastern Shanxi. The situation in this area was not very good before June last year. Since Rong Wusheng, the political commissar of the Third Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps, took office as the administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, the work here has made rapid progress. In terms of people's movement work, self-defense forces, women's teams, stretcher teams, children's corps, etc. in various counties (a total of twelve counties), districts, and villages have been widely organized. Each time a large meeting is held (such as the Jiang Memorial Meeting and various anniversaries), each county can gather three or four thousand organized masses to attend the meeting. Women with feet as small as earlobes (smaller than three-inch lotuses) have been mobilized from their homes, traveling in groups of three to five in oxcarts to attend the meetings. The leaders of the children's corps are all children over ten years old, shouting clear slogans and waving small fists, leading the singing of national salvation songs. Anyone who sees this situation cannot believe that China will perish. In terms of culture and education, there are more than forty kinds of war newspapers in the entire Fifth District, and the North China edition of the New China Daily has also been published here. Book publishing houses, news agencies, etc. have been established for several months, and quite a few books have been published and reprinted. In terms of schools, the First Branch School of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (formerly reorganized from the Red Army University) has opened here, with more than 7,000 students. This belongs to the Eighth Route Army. The Third Branch School of the Military and Political Cadre School (now renamed the Seventeenth Branch School) belongs to the Third Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps. The National Revolutionary Middle School of the Fifth Administrative District (abbreviated as the Fifth District Middle School) belongs to the Fifth District. The Taihang Mountain Art School belongs to the Third and Fifth Administrative Districts. In addition, each county has a National Revolutionary Senior Elementary School, and each village has a National Revolutionary elementary school. In addition to this, there are also various short-term training classes, literacy classes, etc. The General Labor Union for National Salvation, the General Peasant Union for National Salvation, the General Women's Union for National Salvation, the General Youth Union for National Salvation, the General Cultural and Educational Circles Union for National Salvation, the General Merchants Union for National Salvation, etc. have all been organized in the entire Fifth District and various counties.

In terms of the military, there are the Central Army, the Eighth Route Army, and the Dare-to-Die Corps here. The one with the closest relationship to the government is, of course, the Dare-to-Die Corps. Commissioner Rong concurrently serves as the commissioner and is also the leader of the Shanxi League (the general organ leading the people's movement in Shanxi), so the military, government, and people in the Fifth District have already been united into one.

When I first arrived in Shanxi, I originally wanted to work in the Eighth Route Army. The work had already been assigned, and I was just waiting for the car to depart. Unexpectedly, the Third Column was ordered to run the Third Branch School of the Accompanied-by-Troops School. Because no one was running it, I was forcibly pulled into the Dare-to-Die Corps. The Accompanied-by-Troops Third Branch School opened in December of the year before last. By February of last year, because the school was running quite well, it was ordered to be renamed the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University. By the end of July last year, because all branch schools were canceled, it was renamed the Third Branch School of the Military and Political Cadre School again. I was the director of school affairs at the Accompanied-by-Troops School, managing all school affairs, and the director of academic affairs at the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University. The principals of both the Cadre School and the Fifth District Middle School are Commander Yan, and the deputy principals are both Commissioner Rong. I am currently the political director of the Cadre School, and because both Principal Yan and Principal Rong cannot actually come to the school to work, I also concurrently serve as the acting deputy principal of both the Cadre School and the Middle School.

The Accompanied-by-Troops School was originally located in Quwo. After being renamed the Fourth Branch School of the National Revolutionary University, it moved to Caogong Village in Yicheng (at the end of February last year) because the [Japanese] were advancing on southern Shanxi. At that time, the other branch schools of the National Revolutionary University all crossed the Yellow River to Shaanxi. Only our school vowed not to cross the Yellow River and resolutely stayed in the rear of the [Japanese] to train political cadres. After staying in Caogong for more than a month, because it was too far from the headquarters of the Third Column and there were too many miscellaneous troops passing through, the school's self-defense capabilities were insufficient, so it moved to Shanjiao Village in Fushan County. We lived there until October of last year. Because there had been no [Japanese] activity in Southeastern Shanxi for a long time, Changzhi was the only large city in Southeastern Shanxi (it could almost be said to be in North China). For the sake of the school's development, we moved to Changzhi again. At the end of January of this year, because the [Japanese] first besieged Qin County, then attacked the Wutai area, then attacked Northwestern Shanxi, then attacked Jixian in Western Shanxi, and then attacked Central Hebei and Southern Hebei, seeing that the situation would lead to an attack on Southeastern Shanxi, we moved into the mountains again. Now both the Cadre School and the Middle School are in these mountains.

When the Cadre School was in Changzhi, it had more than 1,200 students. Now, due to the difficulty of obtaining food in the mountains, the scale has been reduced, and there are still more than 700 students and 170-180 faculty, staff, and cooks. When the Middle School was in Changzhi, it had 800 students. Now there are 600 students in the mountains, and more than 100 faculty and staff.

During the Accompanied-by-Troops School era, we formed a guerrilla detachment. We formed another one during the National Revolutionary University era. Each one had fewer than 100 people when it was formed. Now, after a year of fighting, it has grown into a regiment. The regiment often cooperates with the Central Army in Southeastern Shanxi. The Central [authorities] call us a divine army, calling us lively tigers. When we arrived at the Second Column, the Third Column only had one regiment. In a little over a year, it had developed into six regiments, in addition to two regiments of security guerrillas.

In the six months after the establishment of the Cadre School, the number of students trained has reached more than 1,300. The Middle School also has 300 students. The students who have come out of the two schools are now all over Southeastern Shanxi and the Second Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps. Several of the Cadre School's instructors have served as county magistrates, regimental commanders, and political directors in various counties.

We eat two meals a day. I was very unaccustomed to it when I first came. Eating too much made my stomach bulge, and eating too little made me hungry. It took me a month or two to get used to it. Life was hardest in Cao Village, where we ate millet and peach tree leaves. In Shanjiao, we could eat some white flour. Life was most luxurious in Changzhi, because the school had a lot of contact with the outside, so we often ate banquets. The banquets were not much different from those in the south, and there was also rice. Now that we have gone to the mountains, because both economics and transportation are difficult, we have switched to eating millet. The vegetables are also low-quality, such as turnips, tofu, and bean sprouts. The [Japanese] have not yet come, but it may be even more difficult in the future when the [Japanese] come.

We are determined to persevere in the long-term war of resistance and in the war of resistance in North China. We are determined to stay in the occupied areas and resolutely stay in the rear of the [Japanese]. This task is a great task, but this work is a difficult work. We are determined not to be afraid of hardship. We want to shed the last drop of blood to defend the Chinese nation and defend world peace.

I have abandoned my home. I have forgotten my family. I rarely write to my family. The war has changed everything. Everyone is doing their own thing, and no one can take care of anyone. If I am lucky enough to survive after driving out Japanese imperialism, we can talk about it then. If I am unfortunately sacrificed before the end of the war, then everything is over.

### De Wang's Secretary Flees to Chongqing to Discuss the Recent Situation in Inner Mongolia, × Deeply Fears the Desertion of Puppet Troops, De Wang Indignant, Awaiting an Opportunity to Revolt

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Associated Press, 20th] This reporter interviewed Qi Baizhang, a [Mongolian] youth from Inner Mongolia who recently arrived in Chongqing after escaping, to report on the situation in Inner Mongolia. Qi, 28 years old, was sent to Japan by De Wang to study. At the end of last year, he was summoned back to Mongolia to serve as De Wang's secretary. Qi's thinking is correct, and he has insight into the general trend of Eastern return. He is fully aware of Japan's ambition to annex Mongolia. He recounted his escape and the current situation in Inner Mongolia to this reporter as follows:

After being summoned back to Mongolia at the end of last year, he was transferred to serve in the puppet Mongolian Federation Autonomous Government. He only served there for twenty-eight days before taking the opportunity to escape at risk. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, the dangers he encountered when secretly crossing the Sui West Front were beyond words.

At present, × is stepping up its efforts to enslave Mongolia. The Japanese are using the fallacies of the so-called "Greater East Asia" and slogans such as "The Japanese and Mongolian nations were originally brothers thousands of years ago," "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia are of the same race," and "Asia for Asians" and are using the so-called "warrior spirit" to anesthetize and train Mongolian youth.

The × established a Mongolian Academy in Guihua and also established many schools in Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and He [area name] to change the Inner Mongolian children's consistent thinking about the Republic of China and instill pro-Japanese education. In other words, this policy is another vicious weapon of Japanese aggression in Asia.

In addition, the Japanese are implementing two major despicable and insidious means in Inner Mongolia: encouraging smoking and prostitution. The toxicity of their intentions is truly immeasurable. They entice the ignorant people in every possible way to fall into their trap and also confuse child soldiers, so that they are inclined to the path of depravity. It can be seen that the Japanese really want to destroy our race.

According to [Qi], De Wang is currently under constant surveillance by ×. It is difficult for him to act on his own. Given his tough and unyielding personality, it is conceivable how painful he must be to be treated as a puppet. At present, De Wang still serves as the chairman of the puppet Inner Mongolia Federation government, with the traitor Li Shouxin as his deputy. De Wang "presides" over government affairs, while military power is "in" Li's hands. At present, there is only one division of the Japanese army in Inner Mongolia. The Mongolian army under De Wang's command has a total of nine divisions. The troops' salaries and weapons are all supplied by the Japanese Kwantung Army and the puppet Manchukuo, which are no different from the Kwantung Army's appendages. However, this Mongolian army has no artillery units in the army at all. The Japanese army is deeply afraid of their rebellion, so it has specially taken the sharp artillery fire as its own to suppress it. It is said that De Wang's Japanese adviser is Tangshan, and Li's adviser is Ichikawa. In fact, all military and political power is in the hands of these two Japanese people. Therefore, under such circumstances, De Wang himself is extremely dissatisfied. He has never forgotten that he is Han, and it is hoped that he will revolt and return to the Central Government soon.

Qi continued, he is a member of the Khoshuud banner of Yichimu League, which is still in our hands. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to use him to subdue the banner. He has repeatedly refused firmly. It was also heard that when he left De Wang at the end of January, he learned that the Japanese army was stepping up construction on the Outer Mongolian border at that time to prevent the advance of the Outer Mongolian army.

### Seizing Public Concessions, Old Shanghai × Events Repeated, Japanese Newspapers Make False Claims, Murder of Rickshaw Pullers was ×'s Doing

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] According to Shanghai news, given the seriousness of the European situation, the Japanese have now proposed the cancellation of the Shanghai Public Concession and advocate that the Public Concession be regarded as other Japanese-occupied areas. When the political situation was serious last autumn, the Japanese made this request, but it was temporarily shelved after the Munich Agreement was signed. Now they have raised the same request again. This morning, Japanese newspapers claimed that the existence of the Public Concession was illegal.

[Dispatch from Shanghai by the Associated Press, 20th] Since two Chinese rickshaw pullers were assassinated in Hongkou last week, automobile companies in the concessions have refused to send their cars to Hongkou. The "North-China Daily News" stated that the police authorities believe that these assassinations were committed by Japanese and Korean thugs in order to eliminate competition for rental cars and public cars run by Japanese in the Hongkou area.

### × Izumo Battleship Collides with British Ship, × Tries to Shirk Responsibility

[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 20th] On the afternoon of the 18th, the British Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Suiwo Wheel was struck by the × Tianyun Battleship while entering the Huangpu River in Shanghai. The shipping company immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese, but the Japanese shirked responsibility, saying that the Suiwo Wheel should be responsible for compensation. The shipowner has reported to the consulate for handling.

### The Soviet-Japanese Dispute Intensifies: Arita Consults with Elder Statesmen on Orders; Tokyo Rumors of a Tripartite Military Alliance

[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that Foreign Minister Arita, acting on the Prime Minister's instructions, visited Prince Saionji's villa outside Shizuoka yesterday morning to report on important diplomatic events and solicit his opinion. After returning to Tokyo, the Foreign Minister immediately reported to the War Ministry. This consultation with Prince Saionji is extremely rare, and observers believe it is of utmost importance, believing that the Cabinet attaches great importance to Prince Saionji's decisions on certain issues, possibly related to the Soviet-Japanese fisheries dispute and strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] According to Tokyo foreign news, foreign correspondents today asked a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson about rumors that Japan, Germany, and Italy were concluding a military alliance. The spokesperson replied that he could not comment on rumors, but the need to strengthen the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact has indeed been frequently discussed in the Diet. When asked whether the Japanese people supported transforming the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance and whether the Japanese spokesperson could formally deny or confirm the rumored military alliance, the Japanese spokesperson stated that it was neither a matter of denial nor confirmation, and he could not comment on rumors. However, Japan's attitude towards the Anti-Comintern Pact has not changed.

### American Public Demands Revision of the Neutrality Act; Thirty-One Organizations Jointly Appeal

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received news from America regarding the American public's attitude towards revising the Neutrality Act. It stated that religious groups, such as the World Council of Churches, and seven other organizations; women's groups, such as the Out-of-School Women's Association, and seven other organizations; labor groups, such as the Workers' Committee, and twelve other organizations; and peace groups, such as the Committee to Promote Peace, a total of thirty-one organizations, have all resolved to appeal for a revision of the Neutrality Act, requiring a distinction between aggressor and victim, and applying the embargo on arms and raw materials to the aggressor nation. Dr. Shotwell, a history professor at Columbia University, criticized the Neutrality Act during a speech at Carnegie Hall in New York, stating, "This act not only fails to distinguish between aggressor and victim, but often aids the aggressor and harms friends." Bishop Channing Aldrich acknowledged at a lecture convened by the Committee to Promote Peace that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the nervous confusion of former leaders of the American government. In a world where everyone is increasingly interconnected, speaking of isolation is tantamount to insincere suspicion."

### America to Implement Economic Sanctions Against Japan and Consider Cooperative Steps with Other Nations to Negotiate a Solution to the Far East Problem

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] According to government sources speaking to the Associated Press, the United States may soon implement commercial sanctions against Japan, similar in nature to those recently decided upon for Germany. This measure will be implemented in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether the European crisis ends or how domestic opinion views the policy of sanctioning Germany. According to commercial experts, commercial sanctions against Japan will be based on revising broader customs tariffs, as Japan's unfair commercial treatment of the United States is more indirect than Germany's. They pointed out that Germany directly restricts trade with the United States, while Japan does not directly restrict trade with the United States. At the same time, American trade in Japan is still considered normal, but in Manchuria and North China, Japan severely restricts American goods. The Commerce Department has already accurately compiled statistics on these affected goods, planning to revise and increase customs tariffs in retaliation. Everything is now awaiting presidential approval.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Members of the International Relations Committee of the United States Congress told the Associated Press that Germany's aggression against Czechoslovakia will cause the United States to change its Far East policy. The US authorities are now considering cooperative steps with democratic countries regarding Far East events in order to resist aggressors. As for the change in America's Far East policy, whether America's policy towards the Philippines will also change accordingly, the committee members declined to comment specifically. However, they declared that the US will negotiate with democratic countries to resolve the Far East problem. Most notably, Britain, France, and the Netherlands hope that the United States will not abandon the Philippines and will maintain its power in the Far East.

### A Trip to Suizao

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Geng Ya

Guangxi Student Soldiers at the Front Lines

Recently, the fighting in the Suixian area has been relatively quiet. The Guangxi student soldiers took the opportunity to go to the front lines and perform a new play in ××, ostensibly to comfort the soldiers, but actually to stimulate them and fuel the spirit of resistance. The Guangxi student soldier troupe has three hundred members, with university graduates accounting for 60 percent and secondary school graduates accounting for 40 percent, making them highly qualified. They have undergone rigorous military training, so since coming north to serve in the war zone, not only are their work skills outstanding, but their actions, especially the armed spirit of the female students, often serve as a contrasting stimulus to the local resistance support associations and women's groups that are only nominally active, prompting them to take real action. According to the troupe leader, He Kui, and male students Liang Shanxun, Lu Ruding, and female student Li Suzhen, their experiences are worth recounting:

The Guangxi student soldiers departed from Guilin on December 1st of the previous year. Along the way, they passed through Quanzhou, Hengyang, Changsha, Wuhan, Liu'an, Huoshan, and other places, where they were warmly welcomed by the people. They took the opportunity to do some propaganda work. In Lihuang County, western Anhui, which was then a base for the Fifth Route Army and is now the center for mobilizing guerrilla forces in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, they used concise leaflets to invite the leaders of the bandits who had been entrenched in the mountains for many years to negotiate. They persuaded them with righteousness, gathered their four or five thousand men, and reorganized them, placing them all under the command of General Liao Lei for combat.

When the inner defensive circle of Wuhan narrowed, a squadron of the student soldiers was assigned to work in Xishui. They saw that the buildings in the city had been bombed beyond recognition, the people had either died or fled, and the city was in a state of "emptiness." They then went to the surrounding villages to carry out their work. In their practical experience, they discovered a bad phenomenon: performing plays attracted everyone to watch, but lectures caused people to disperse. Later, they went door-to-door to make individual propaganda speeches, making everyone thoroughly aware of the meaning of resistance. Or, they started by teaching children to sing songs to serve as a medium for connecting with the adults. As a result, they finally organized them to do their best to help the army fight.

During the planned retreat from Wuhan, they marched at night through ×× Lake and were scattered by × artillery fire. When they regrouped in Jingmen, only one person was missing. Later, they learned that he had taken another route with the covering force. On this occasion, they walked for two nights and most of a day, with only one meal. Recalling it, they still said it was quite interesting—just as they were doing propaganda for the people in Jingmen, they were suddenly attacked by × aircraft, and unfortunately, two female students were killed and one was injured, which was extremely regrettable.

According to Ms. Li Suzhen, the difficulties of doing women's work in large cities are sometimes even greater than in rural areas. Last year, when Wuhan held an anti-aggression conference, they first went to various homes to promote it, asking women to participate enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, many delicate ladies and misses felt that it was a bit beneath them to have them (the student soldiers), with the status of "big soldier brothers" (actually, they should be called "big soldier sisters"), come to talk to them (the ladies and misses). Especially when they were happily playing mahjong, they pretended to grab a handful of tin coins and give them, telling them to go visit other people—however, the female student soldiers were not angry. They still painstakingly awakened them, urging them to magnify the generosity of grabbing a handful of copper coins, so that they could also go to the donation table and show their skills in saving the country. By the date of the conference, all the ladies and misses and poor women who had been canvassed participated enthusiastically. When the meeting ended, it was already dark, and they took torches to escort them home separately. Some were deeply moved and even requested to work with them.

Currently, the student soldiers are working in the Suizao area, and they are also very good at adapting to the environment. If they need to perform plays at night but cannot find kerosene, they use diesel; if they cannot find a ready-made stage, they open the show on the spot. In short, as long as they can achieve the purpose of propaganda and make the people understand the meaning of resistance and the nature of military discipline. Once they understand, they will unite and push the great ship of "national resistance" forward. Some farmers, seeing them packing up their props and going to work in other villages, even came to ask them shyly, "Compatriots—when are you coming back? We will prepare 'da tang' for you to eat—" (In northern Hubei, "da tang," or catching fish in a pond, is a way to treat honored guests), which shows that the inland villagers are, after all, Chinese people with genuine hatred for the enemy, and who cannot easily be mobilized?

Troupe leader He concluded the conversation by saying: From their experience in serving in the war zone for more than a year, they deeply understand that to win the victory of the counteroffensive in the future, the first is political work in the army, and the second is mass movement work in various places. It is also necessary to extensively and deeply promote it as a whole. If there are not so many political workers trained for a while, the groups with current work experience should also be carefully dispersed and sent to various places to lead the work, so as to reap the effect of a few people being able to mobilize many people.

### A Review of China's Unity and Recent Developments

— By Mao Na, Representative of the International Anti-Aggression League

The first year of the Sino-Japanese War has definitely produced the result it should have produced, namely, the realization of a true unity in China that has never existed before. As for how many years there were before of nominal unity and actual division, only Heaven knows. Since the beginning of the war, the only person who has disobeyed the orders of the Central Government is Shanxi Chairman Yan Xifuqu, who has been shot by the military court. Apart from that, no important individual has thrown himself into the arms of the × people or has been disrespectful to Chairman Chiang. Very few Chinese are willing to be puppets of yesterday's × people, participate in the provisional governments established in Beiping and Nanjing, or shamelessly serve them. They are willing to spread poison in China, so that Japan can use this as a resource to aid its invasion of China. This small number of traitors has been reviled by the general public and has a bad reputation, so they cannot get the slightest support. Several members of the Communist Party have been assassinated by patriotic Chinese with swift hands; the others, not only recognize the enemy as their father and receive the support of the Japanese, but also have to be protected by the foreign police of the Shanghai Concession, which is very pitiful. According to the opinions of Europeans and Americans that I have heard in China, the effect of this Sino-Japanese War in promoting China's unity is far greater than the painful experience gained in the previous twenty-five years of civil strife.

The loss of a portion of the rich coastal provinces along the Yangtze River and the departure from the newly built and magnificent capital, Nanjing, and the solemn mausoleum of Mr. Sun Yat-sen have further strengthened China's will to resist Japanese aggression. Needless to say, to resist Japan, it is necessary to unite national strength and support Chairman Chiang. This is the opinion of the public, and everyone is openly saying this, willing to pledge one hundred percent loyalty. Even those who previously did not agree with too much centralization are doing so. Of course, we don't know what some people are really thinking in their hearts, but at least on the surface, they have formed a united front against Japan. This is something that is personally witnessed and deserves to be celebrated.

In addition, what should not be forgotten is that the needs brought about by the war have gradually increased the number of specialized talents who have studied in Europe and the United States, and have also gradually strengthened the forces that oppose the traditional ideas, customs, and habits of embracing the old and stubbornly refusing to change. These people constitute the center of the national independence and liberation movement, and they are increasingly seen as occupying a leading position.

In 1932, Sikorski concluded his book by saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is almost the only one who understands the most important internal conflicts in China. This so-called conflict refers to the conflict between nationalism and communism." At that time, the author thought that the two sides would continue to play out the tragedy and could not reconcile. Obviously, he did not foresee that in 1935, Stalin and Dimitrov would simply let the Third International cooperate with the movements of democratic countries; he did not foresee that in the winter of 1936, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Chiang would make peace and become a gift dedicated to Christmas; and he did not foresee that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang would work together with one heart and one mind, fighting side by side against ×, and that there would be no major friction as a result. In August 1938, the reporter saw Mr. Zhou Enlai, the Communist Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, in Hankou. He solemnly told me that not only the Communist Party was fighting Japan with all its strength——this is something that even children in primary schools in China know——but also the highest authorities themselves were absolutely cooperating with them in accordance with the agreements of Xi'an to jointly resist foreign aggression.

In the cities that the reporter has traveled to in China, everywhere I have seen some people who previously did not agree with the realization of China's unification under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, but now they have come to me and said: He fully supports everyone's recognition of the figure who symbolizes China's resistance to Japan. In other words, it is different now than it was in the past; China has truly achieved internal unification because of Japan's invasion.

In such an atmosphere, whoever has the slightest intention of undermining national unity, whoever has the slightest suspicion of wanting to negotiate peace with the invaders, is the greatest disgrace. Applying this to soldiers, the soldiers cannot stand it. Applying this to officials, the officials cannot stand it; applying this to other political figures, other political personnel cannot stand it either. Let me give an example to illustrate this.

Mr. Zhang Bosen was the guide who accompanied me in Chengdu. He was the former model governor of Shanxi and is currently the secretary and interpreter for General Yan, the Pacification Director of the Northwest Region. Mr. Zhang once told me that he is a Christian and does not lie, so we can believe what he said about the following. What is it? It is said that a Chinese person went from Shanxi to Beiping and broadcast a message by radio, saying that the authorities had secretly negotiated peace with the Japanese. When General Yan learned of such slander, he was very sad. This rumor was relayed by foreign newspapers. The reporter then sought Mr. Zhang's opinion and asked if he could deny it on his behalf. At that time, I personally drafted a denial, trying to make it as precise as possible, and handed it to Mr. Zhang, saying to him: If the General agrees, I will be very happy to have it published. When I returned to Paris, soon after I arrived, I received a telegram with the content "Agreed," signed by Bosen.

### Democratic Nations Negotiate to Form an Allied Front to Jointly Guarantee the Borders of Southeastern Europe and Prevent Germany's Expansionist Policies

[Associated Press, London, 20th] After a day of intense diplomatic activity, people here are now awaiting the views of France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Balkan states. Whether or not they will unwavering follow Britain's lead and emerge to stop Germany's atrocities. Officials are confident that France and the Soviet Union will have no problem. The focus is on Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. They and Romania all have treaty obligations, but it is not known whether they are willing to fulfill them and join the anti-German front.

[Reuters, London, 20th] After the Cabinet meeting this morning, people across Britain are awaiting the speeches to be delivered by ministers in the Upper and Lower Houses this afternoon. It is generally expected that these speeches will be about changing British foreign policy to adapt to changes in the European situation. The views of those responsible in Britain can be seen in today's "The Times." The newspaper stated, "Europe has been driven back to the use of force, and nothing else matters. Britain has always opposed the policy of encircling Germany, but Germany's policies and methods are precisely taking this encircling action." "The Daily Telegraph" also stated, "King Carol of Romania has urged Britain to pay attention. We have not yet raised the question of where to draw the line against German aggression."

[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] It has just been learned that the special cabinet meeting held today will discuss the speeches to be delivered by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in the Upper and Lower Houses. Diplomatic activities in the capitals of various countries are extremely busy, and they are all in close contact with Britain. It is expected that Foreign Secretary Halifax will report to the Cabinet the results of the exchange of views with France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Balkan states. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of jointly guaranteeing the Romanian border is under consideration. Some observers have indicated that this guarantee will be extended to all countries in Southeastern Europe. Although the economic ultimatum from Germany to Romania has been repeatedly denied, the British government has learned that this ultimatum has actually been delivered. Also, yesterday's editorial in the German "People's Observer" stated, "The German government, in view of the attitude taken by Britain towards this Czech incident, believes that the Anglo-German naval agreement has been shaken." This statement has caused some surprise, but there is currently no official information on this matter. [Reuters, London, 19th] It is reported that the cabinet agreed yesterday that, in view of the recent changes in Europe, Britain needs to maintain close ties with all peace-loving countries in the world immediately.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Although today is Sunday, political activities are very busy. The afternoon situation is as follows: (1) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned here from Berlin at 3:30 PM and immediately visited Foreign Secretary Halifax for a 45-minute meeting. It is reported that he made an objective report on the German situation and the intentions of the German government authorities. (2) The cabinet held a small group meeting at the Prime Minister's residence. Those present included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The most important topics discussed were reportedly accelerating the expansion of armaments and collectively resisting Germany's expansionist policies. A conference was also considered to be held by the UK, US, France, Soviet Union, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to formulate a common policy to deal with the new aggression. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax also conducted a thorough study with Commerce Secretary Stanley on whether economic sanctions could be imposed on Germany. (3) Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax before the cabinet held a small group meeting, personally delivering a copy of the Soviet note to Germany (stating that the Soviet government refuses to recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia) and informing him that after the Munich Agreement was concluded, although the Soviet Union felt disappointed, it was still prepared to participate in collective action to prevent Germany's expansionist efforts. Regarding this, London political figures said that the British government has now decided to approach the Soviet Union and wants to unite the countries of Northeastern and Southeastern Europe to form a defensive line to resist Germany.

Chamberlain Receives the King and Accelerates the Completion of Military Expansion

[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain was extremely busy today. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Air Minister Wood, and Commerce Secretary Stanley visited the Prime Minister this morning. In the afternoon, Dominion Secretary Inskip and Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield also met with the Prime Minister. Chamberlain left Downing Street at 5:50 PM and drove to Buckingham Palace. At 6:00 PM, he met with the King to report on the latest changes in the European situation. When the Prime Minister's car passed through Downing Street, about two to three hundred people cheered him. Chamberlain talked with the King for more than an hour and then returned to Downing Street. British Ambassador to Berlin Henderson arrived in London this afternoon and went straight to the Foreign Office to meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax, lasting 45 minutes.

[Reuters, London, 20th] According to a diplomatic observer, although Germany's economic demands on Romania have been repeatedly denied by both Berlin and Bucharest, the possibility of Germany threatening Romania cannot be considered to have been eliminated. Since the weekend, the British government has been constantly consulting with foreign envoys, and major news outlets have also held discussions several times. What the final decision is will only be known for sure when the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary report to the Upper and Lower Houses today. The Prime Minister had an audience with the King yesterday, talking for an hour, and also met with Chatfield and other defense personnel. It is said that the results of the Cabinet meeting on Saturday determined that the process of military expansion will be accelerated immediately, and it was decided to hold another Cabinet meeting this morning. From this, it can be seen that Britain and France will never let go of further actions by Germany. Also, according to non-official opinions, it is advocated to form a conference of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to decide on a general policy, and then invite the Balkan countries to participate. Yesterday, when Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with Halifax, he also discussed the UK, France,

[Reuters, Sydney, 20th] Australian Prime Minister Lyons, after speaking with Prime Minister Chamberlain this weekend, has announced that the cabinet will hold an emergency cabinet meeting on March 21 to discuss the overall European situation.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 20th] The local authorities have just issued a notice in the name of the "Gibraltar Defense Force" ordering all people to join the air defense force.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The German Ambassador to Britain has been ordered to return home to report on recent developments and has departed for Berlin this afternoon.

### Hitler Returns to Berlin; Goering Delivers Welcome Speech; Will Not Abandon Acquired Rights

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] Hitler arrived in Berlin by train at 6:30 this morning to thunderous cheers. All members of the Cabinet went to the station to greet him, led by Goering. In addition, there were various ministers, party leaders, and army representatives. The station was full of Nazi party flags. Outside the station and along the route the leader was sure to pass through, the crowds were unusually packed. In his welcome speech, Goering stated emphatically that Hitler had not only restored Germany's former glory, but had also ensured Germany's security. Today is a day for the leader to be proud of. We do not know how to thank him, but we must adhere to the sacred oath, "For the sake of the German nation, we will never abandon the rights we have acquired." How can such a heroic warrior not have a heroic nation as his backing? You have made the Germans great and courageous. We are willing to make "victory and soundness" the oath of the entire German nation. The sounds of church bells have been ordered to be rung from 6:45 until 7:00. Fifty teams of soldiers were stationed along the route to welcome him, directly to the Linden City, where searchlights created an arched shape. Hitler's car slowly moved forward in the cheers of the crowd, directly to the Chancellery. When it reached Wilhelm Street, the crowd was ecstatic and uncontrollable, breaking through the police cordon three times. The crowd shouted, demanding that the leader appear on the Chancellery grandstand. The leader responded three times and then announced that he could not come out again because there was important business to discuss.

### Benes Broadcasts: Continuing the Struggle; America Refuses to Aid Germany; Accepts Czech Envoy and Consulate

[Reuters, Chicago, 20th] Former Czech President Dr. Edvard Beneš, in a broadcast to the American people today, stated, "The independence of Czechoslovakia is not yet destroyed. I will continue to fight for my people and their rights to the very end." He also denied rumors of forming a Czech provisional government in America.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Authoritative sources say that the U.S. Department of State will refuse to assist the German government in taking over the Czech embassy and consulates in the United States. Czech diplomatic personnel in the U.S. are determined to prevent the Germans from occupying their embassy. The U.S. government will provide moral support for this action.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 19th] The Czech Consul-General here, Mr. Fašíp, recently received instructions from Nanjing to hand over the Czech consulate to the German diplomatic authorities here.

### Romania Reinforces Borders; Hungarian Regent to Visit Ruthenia; Polish Public Opinion Condemns German Excesses

[Reuters, Bucharest, 20th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking in Birmingham, declared that Britain is not indifferent to events in Southeastern Europe. He has reportedly invited Southern European countries to maintain close contact with the British Foreign Office. As a result, the atmosphere here has improved slightly, less tense than before. Authoritative sources here believe that Romania's recent actions are entirely legitimate, and if a serious situation arises, it has the moral right to receive assistance from Western powers.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 19th] Roads in northwestern Romania are congested with troops heading towards the Hungarian border in Ruthenia. Officials insist that no general mobilization has been implemented, but a large number of young men have been conscripted into the army. It is generally speculated that Romania is deploying approximately 90,000 to 100,000 additional troops to the border. It is said that this step is not only to cope with the international situation but also because the government increasingly believes that the German army's advance into Ruthenia will inevitably approach the Romanian border, necessitating prior preparations. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Romania has eased somewhat. German-Romanian trade negotiations are expected to yield results on Tuesday, with more limited demands from the German side than previously proposed.

[Reuters, Szeged, 19th] The Romanian frontier has been reinforced, and all outposts have been adequately manned. Hungarian regular troops have occupied multiple outposts along the Ruthenian border. Romanian military authorities are properly sending refugees fleeing from Ruthenia into the interior. Refugees of Ukrainian, Galician, and Russian origin are temporarily housed in refugee camps. Yesterday, Ukrainian border guards who crossed the Tisza River into Romania were driven back into Ukrainian territory.

[Reuters, Budapest, 19th] Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy left last night for Ruthenia to inspect the Hungarian troops currently occupying the area.

[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky will formally visit Rome from April 13th to 15th.

[Havas, Budapest, 19th] Ruthenia's new Prime Minister, Zoltan Brody, met with Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki today. Both sides agreed to determine Ruthenia's autonomy and decided to designate Mukachevo as the new capital of Ruthenia.

[Havas, Warsaw, 19th] According to reports from several special correspondents, Hungarian troops and the Ruthenian National Defense Organization military corps continue to engage in fierce fighting today.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] According to reports from Budapest, some people have been drafted into the army, some of whom remain in the city barracks, while others are heading east and southwest.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 20th] It has been learned that Polish Foreign Minister Beck is currently making great efforts to reconcile the interests of Poland with its traditional friend Hungary and its ally Romania. Public opinion unanimously condemns Germany's actions against Czechoslovakia and is determined to resist any attempts to infringe upon the Hungarian border. It is reported that Hungarian border troops have been greatly reinforced.

### French Cabinet Holds Meeting; Implements Full Powers Decree; Reinforcements for the Maginot Line; Bonnet Proposes Anglo-French Military Cooperation

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The French cabinet meeting was held today from 6:50 PM to 8:45 PM. According to a communique, Daladier reported in detail on the first decree of the full powers act. This decree will be submitted to the Council of Ministers at 5:00 PM on Sunday and will be implemented immediately. It is reported that half of the troops scheduled to be discharged in April will remain in service. There are rumors that France is currently conscripting third-level military technicians. Although this has not been officially confirmed, some personnel are currently being ordered to assemble.

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] After the Senate passed the bill granting special powers, French Premier Daladier is preparing to issue a large number of decrees promoting the economy and industry. To strengthen border defenses, troops may be increased on the Maginot Line. Although there will be no general mobilization at present, a large number of reservists, including machine gun units, anti-aircraft gun units, and gas defense unit members, will be called up. Foreign Minister Bonnet will soon travel to London to discuss the following matters with Britain: (1) Anglo-French military cooperation, (2) diplomatic measures after the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, (3) how Britain and France should respond to Poland and Franco signing a non-aggression pact, (4) how Britain and France should respond if Germany obtains Memel, Danzig, or the Polish Corridor, (5) how France should fulfill its Franco-Romanian military mutual assistance agreement in the face of Swedish threats to Romania, (6) expediting the conclusion of the Eastern War, (7) the Mediterranean and Red Sea issue, (8) the relationship between democratic countries and the United States, with a particular focus on purchasing aircraft.

Daladier's Speech in the Senate

[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The government's proposed full powers bill was passed by the Senate this afternoon by a vote of 286 to 17 (fifteen Socialist senators and two Communist senators voted against). The government will enjoy broad powers to strengthen national defense until November 30th of this year. At the Senate meeting today, the finance committee reporter, Garde, first presented a review report, advocating that the original bill be approved. He stated that Premier Daladier had assured the committee that no expenses would be increased other than national defense expenditures. Premier Daladier then delivered a speech, recounting the events of the Czech crisis. When he solemnly declared that the French people were deeply shaken by the destruction of Czechoslovakia, all senators stood up in agreement. The Premier then said that as the Munich Agreement had been abandoned and the Franco-German peace declaration had been violated, the serious international situation could quickly lead to tragedy. We may encounter unexpected changes in a short period of time, which is why the government is forced to request special powers from Congress to prepare for any eventuality. The cabinet has scheduled a meeting for tonight to decide on the first batch of measures based on the full powers act and submit them to the State Council for approval tomorrow. The Premier then added that workers in factories nationalized by the government have had their weekly working hours increased from forty to forty-five or even fifty hours. Working hours for workers in private factories should also be increased to increase production volume. He expressed his belief in the republican system, stating that he would not hesitate to extend the terms of members of parliament if necessary in the future to avoid the trouble of re-election, but the institutions of the republic should not be changed. After the Premier finished speaking, Socialist members proposed an amendment to prevent the government from infringing upon public liberties, such as extending the term of parliament members, but after discussion, the Senate rejected this amendment by a vote of 280 to 23 and passed the government's original bill by a vote of 286 to 17.

France to Provide Aid to Romania

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] French Premier Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and external experts are currently studying and drafting a response to Romania's note, which was sent to Britain and France for assistance after the Romanian government received demands from Germany. Although Germany's demands are not an ultimatum, their content could cause Romania to lose its economic independence. France has been close to Romania in recent years due to its friendly relations with the Little Entente countries, and as a result of its connection with Poland, it may allow Romania to receive aid this time. However, experts at the Foreign Ministry believe that the full opinions of the Soviet Union on this issue should be sought first before discussions take place. Britain has decided to wait until France's attitude is fully determined before taking joint action. Leaving aside diplomatic attitudes, both Britain and France are determined not to allow Romania's abundant oil production, forests, and agricultural products to fall into the hands of Germany, because if these resources are taken away by Germany, its power will be able to advance westward. Moreover, France currently relies heavily on Romanian oil, and the economic agreements in place cannot be abandoned.

French Newspapers Advocate Firm Steps

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French ambassador to Germany arrived here this morning to meet with Foreign Minister Bonnet. French newspapers advocate taking firm and drastic steps to deal with the international crisis. Newspapers of different political views unanimously pledge to support Premier Daladier. There is satisfaction here with the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia.

### Japan Secretly Building Ships; Various Vessels Reach Seventy-Five; Completion Expected in 1943

[Reuters, London, 20th] According to the naval correspondent of the "Daily Mail", "Japan's six-year naval construction plan, although only recently announced in Tokyo, actually began as early as 1937." He also stated that although the plan is strictly confidential, it is now known to include five battleships, eight 10,000-ton cruisers, sixteen light cruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirty-two destroyers, and twelve submarines. Two of the 42,000-ton battleships have already begun construction, and eight more were started last year. The entire plan is scheduled to be completed in 1943. Finally, the correspondent detailed Britain's naval plans and position, indicating that by 1943, it would be sufficient to counter Japan.

### Memel Germans March

[Reuters, Memel, 20th] The "leader" of the Memel Germans, Neumann, inspected a parade of former soldiers today. The crowd shouted, "We want to return to Germany."

### National Humiliation; Czech Sorrow Has Not Diminished; Unwilling to Witness German Patrols

[Reuters, Prague, 20th] The sorrow of the Czech people over the occupation of their homeland has not diminished in the slightest. Every face expresses sadness and depression. Crowds continue to gather at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier.

[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Today, Czech people are escaping into the countryside for walks, unwilling to see German troops patrolling Wenceslas Square (in Bohemia). Others are staying away or refusing to raise the Czech flag. Key members of the Czech government were forced to sit alongside German military authorities to watch the parade. Led by General Gablenz, the parade lasted two hours and included infantry, artillery, and tank units, as well as several squadrons of aircraft flying low in the sky. Only the flags of the National Socialist Party were visible in the city center.

[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Reports of arrests and suicides are increasing daily. It is reported that several thousand people have been detained, mostly German refugees who fled from the Sudetenland and Austria. Most are politicians and journalists. It is reported that no Jews have been arrested. This mass arrest is carried out by Czech police under the orders of the German secret police. The director of the Polish news agency here has also been detained and has not yet been released (according to the Polish ambassador to Germany, a request has been made to the German side). According to the Czech news agency, a bomb was discovered in the home of a German leader in a district of Teplice-Šanov, about 35 miles north of the capital of Slovakia. Fortunately, no one was injured. Another person threw a bomb at a German in the street, but it missed.

### Mussolini to Deliver Speech; Demanding Land from France

[Associated Press, Rome, 20th] The Fascist Grand Council is scheduled to meet on the 26th, at which time Mussolini will deliver a speech, making clear land demands from France. Mussolini's demands should be decided by Tuesday. General opinion favors formally raising the issue, as Italy should take the opportunity to act when Britain and France are revealing their weaknesses.

Short Commentary

### The Czech National Humiliation

Czechoslovakia is lost, but the Czech people are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, and most Czech social leaders are unwilling to be submissive citizens of a conquered nation. Therefore, the Czech national salvation movement has evolved into a national restoration movement, unfolding in a lurking struggle. It is not only underground but also at crossroads and in public gatherings, holding anti-fascist and anti-aggression demonstrations. The sound of the national anthem resonates, and anti-German riots are everywhere. Former Czech President Beneš has also delivered a broadcast speech in the United States, preparing to call on the Czech people to fight for national restoration.

However, the oppression of fascist aggressors will naturally be doubled in severity and cruelty. A report from Prague on the 19th states that the number of arrests and suicides is increasing daily, with dozens of people reportedly arrested. These arrests are carried out by the German secret police. This simple report alone is enough to imagine how difficult and dangerous the Czech people's national restoration movement is today.

We firmly believe that the Czech people's national restoration movement has a future because as long as groups of people unwilling to be slaves unite and fight bravely and resolutely, they will surely achieve final victory. However, our Chinese compatriots should be more vigilant about the Czech people's national humiliation. The Czech Republic was lost because it abandoned resistance, sought peace in humiliation, and compromised midway. As a result, after the aggressors' half-year preparation, it could not avoid final destruction. Therefore, today we should firmly oppose the talk and actions of "stopping resistance" and "seeking peace midway." Our resistance has already achieved results. Do not wait to compromise and lose the country before trying to restore it!

### Mongols Do Not Forget Han

An Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 20th states that Qi Baizhang, a young Mongolian noble who recently escaped from Inner Mongolia to Chongqing, said that he was a trusted secretary of Prince De. Now, most of the people in Inner Mongolia have realized that the Japanese aggressors are using them to attack their motherland, because they are suffering the insufferable treatment of slaves of a conquered nation under the rule of Japanese military police. The vast majority of the Inner Mongolian people oppose Japan, and Prince De, who is being used by Japan, also has a heart that does not forget Han and is preparing to resist. We cannot lightly dismiss this news.

However, at the same time, we must know that in order to complete its plan to conquer all of China, Japan is now stepping up its insidious steps, implementing a deceptive appeasement policy on the one hand and a vicious poisoning policy on the other. As for its pretext of independence and freedom to divide the unity of our country's various ethnic groups, its poisonous schemes are countless, and it uses them to the extreme.

In order to strive for the complete and thorough liberation of the Chinese nation, today we must intensify the steps to smash Japan's poisonous schemes. The main thing is to implement Sun Yat-sen's ethnic policy of "equality for all ethnic groups within the country" and democratic politics during the war of resistance, starting with the Mongolian ethnic group, strengthening the unity of various ethnic groups in the country, mobilizing the latent forces of all ethnic groups, and adhering to the war of resistance and national construction to strive for common freedom and happiness.

### Democracy? Dictatorship? The President of the United States

— Translated by Dong Ping

"Let me remind you, I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy—" So it was, not long ago, that President Roosevelt said.

Recently, there have also been rumors that President Roosevelt said, "The borders of the United States are now in France." This sentence, although derived from what Prime Minister Baldwin said when he was Prime Minister: "The borders of Britain are now in the Rhineland." But, its meaning today is far deeper than it was then.

Just by looking at the tone expressed by President Roosevelt, we know that the United States is preparing to cope with an overseas war, or an emergency domestic dispute. President Roosevelt, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, has concentrated military and political power in himself. Naturally, in the future war or dispute, he will be able to bear full responsibility and faithfully perform all his tasks.

Therefore, such a President of the United States cannot find an equal in the governments of European countries. In some places, he is like a king; in some places, he is like a dictator; but, in some places, his power does not even reach the British Prime Minister.

That is truly a great work, but also a truly painstaking work. For many years, although it can often be seen that four or five presidential wives are all alive and well in the world, many of those retired presidents themselves rarely enjoy longevity and sit and watch the rule of their successors.

In peacetime, the power of the American President is often limited. President Roosevelt, because he said a word, was questioned by the Senate Military Committee, and then said: "Let me remind you, I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy"—Indeed, in ordinary times, the power of the American President can also be said to be about the same as the French President.

But, in times of crisis, he will concentrate all power in himself and handle it freely. At that time, democracy is lost, and he is a dictator.

Everyone should still remember President Wilson during the Great War—his words were law: his dignity was superhuman; his power was unlimited. When the war ended, he crossed the Atlantic to lead the peace talks, he was truly like an American ruler with supreme talent.

But, what was the result? Democracy took revenge, bringing down the supreme figure it had created with one hand. The great Wilson finally stepped down in an atmosphere of ridicule and contempt.

The American people give their President a lot of power, almost equal to what Hitler and Mussolini themselves seized from the people. But, there is a huge difference inside. No matter how "dictatorial" the American President becomes, in the end, he must step down in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.

The President's annual salary is 15,000 pounds. His work is divided into three parts: diplomacy, legislation, and judiciary.

First, the President is responsible for appointing ambassadors and ministers to foreign countries, and like the King of England, he is also responsible for receiving foreign envoys. This is the simplest task in his diplomatic work. He obtains information on various foreign meetings and discussions from the State Department—the American Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He can actively take the initiative on the diplomatic stage.

He can advocate what kind of foreign policy his country should adopt, and his advocacy has a lot of power—like a king in a democratic country. But, he cannot ultimately decide foreign policy alone; because, if he wants to negotiate with that country or sign a treaty, he must obtain the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The Senate is composed of two representatives from each state. Therefore, this is why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee often circulates in the newspapers, and the President's every diplomatic move must be honestly reported to it.

In principle, the President does not have the power to declare war. That power belongs to Congress; Congress includes both the Senate and the House of Representatives; the House of Representatives has 435 representatives. But, the President can naturally guide the situation to a point where war is inevitable when negotiating diplomacy. The American war with Mexico in 1845 is an example. President Wilson also led the United States to participate in the last war amidst opposition from all sides.

Now we can talk about legislation. In England, bills are submitted to Parliament for discussion and passage by the King's ministers. In theory, it is also considered to be following the King's instructions. The American President cannot do this. Neither he himself, nor through his ministers, can propose a bill. The Constitution only allows him to report on national affairs in Congress, or at most, to recommend a bill due to the needs of the situation.

So, how can he do whatever he wants? Very simply, he can find a member of parliament to propose the bill on his behalf. Naturally, the purpose of the President's proposal is to express it clearly.

If the President disagrees with Congress, he can use the veto power. It goes like this: For example, if President Roosevelt does not approve of a bill passed by Congress, he can return the bill to Congress within ten days after its passage and request the Senate to reconsider it. Unless both houses can pass it again by a two-thirds majority; otherwise, it cannot become law.

This veto power is equally dangerous in democratic countries. Many presidents have fallen because of using this power. Only two, Jefferson and Cleveland, worked hard to use it successfully.

Only in a recession, like President Roosevelt's current situation, is the President's domestic power not very great. Many judicial and administrative powers in the United States are related to state or city governments. Today, unemployment, trade difficulties, and other issues are good opportunities for President Roosevelt to exercise domestic power.

American cabinet members are appointed by the President, but many other officials are appointed by senators; however, their work is still under the command of the President and paid by the government. Therefore, many tasks are still often done by the President himself. This is the contradiction of the American administrative system. (Translated from the Hong Kong "Shi Mian Xi Bao")

### Hong Kong University Requests Increased Appropriation from the Boxer Indemnity Fund to Promote Sino-British Cultural Cooperation. Professor Hsu Ti-shan Expresses Three Expectations to the Special Committee: More Chinese Teaching Materials Should Be Adopted for Schools Run for China

Hang Liwu did not arrive in Hong Kong yesterday; the special committee meeting is postponed.

The University of Hong Kong, the only institution of higher learning in Hong Kong, recently established a special committee to study cooperation between the University of Hong Kong and universities in mainland China. After the announcement, Chongqing expressed a warm welcome. At the same time, Minister of Education Chen also made a public statement, as reported in the newspapers.

HKU Requests Increased Boxer Indemnity Fund Allocation

According to a reporter's investigation, the special committee recently established by the University of Hong Kong holds great expectations for the future of the university and cooperation with the central government. Sir Mark Young, the Governor of Hong Kong, deeply believes in the necessity of Sino-British cultural cooperation and that the University of Hong Kong bears a significant responsibility in promoting such cooperation. Therefore, he pays close attention to the composition of the committee. However, due to limited funding in the past, the University of Hong Kong has not been able to fully develop, especially in engineering, which requires further expansion. Therefore, it is planned to allocate a portion of the Boxer Indemnity Fund to subsidize the university. Among the Chinese members of the committee, Hang Liwu is the Director-General of the Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee, which shows the high expectations for the committee.

Three Expectations: Professor Hsu Ti-shan of the Chinese Department of the University of Hong Kong was interviewed yesterday afternoon regarding the issue of promoting Sino-British educational and cultural cooperation. Professor Hsu expressed three expectations for the committee: First, since most of the students at the University of Hong Kong are Chinese and the authorities are Chinese, and the purpose of running the school is to cultivate talent for China, Chinese teaching materials should be adopted as much as possible, and more Chinese teachers should be hired to impart Chinese culture. Second, students at the University of Hong Kong, regardless of their major, whether medicine or liberal arts, should have a sufficient foundation in Chinese national studies. Third, he hopes that the government will pay more attention to the curriculum of the University of Hong Kong and send personnel to inspect the school annually within the possible scope, or ask the university to send school affairs reports regularly. In 1931, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee allocated £265,000 to the university, but did not inquire about the use of this fund. In the future...

The University of Hong Kong Has Close Ties with Us

Professor Hsu believes that since our country subsidizes the University of Hong Kong with such a large amount of money, the relationship between the University of Hong Kong and our country is no different from the relationship between foreign churches and the universities they establish in our country. Our country's educational conferences should actively invite the University of Hong Kong to participate, giving it the opportunity to report on school affairs and discuss various close cooperations. Now that the University of Hong Kong's special committee has been established, with the goal of promoting Sino-British educational and cultural cooperation, our country should seize this opportunity to discuss the curriculum with the University of Hong Kong to promote our country's cultural level.

Special Committee Meeting Postponed

Furthermore, the first official meeting of the University of Hong Kong's special committee was originally scheduled for yesterday. The agenda was also drafted by the committee's secretary, Finnegan. Our member, Hang Liwu, was supposed to fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong yesterday, but Mr. Hang was ill in Chongqing and could not travel as scheduled. He telegraphed to Hong Kong to inform the committee. The first meeting of the committee has now been postponed. It is also reported that the University of Hong Kong Management Committee held a routine meeting last night to discuss the progress of school affairs.

### Giving Flags and Donating Money on Children's Day to Be Used for Refugee Children's Education; The Hong Kong and Kowloon Teachers' Association Intensifies Preparations Yesterday

### Hong Kong's Rubber Shoe Industry is Flourishing, with Sales Spreading Worldwide; Exports Were Worth Over Ten Million Dollars Last Year; There are Over Five Thousand Workers in Hong Kong Now

Hong Kong's rubber manufacturing industry has gradually flourished in recent years. Among its products, rubber shoes are the most common and are exported in large quantities from Hong Kong every year. This trend has become even more pronounced since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday, a reporter visited a Hong Kong rubber manufacturer and asked about the recent situation of the industry.

Exports Worth Ten Million Last Year

According to him, Hong Kong's rubber manufacturing industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, with rubber shoes being the most important product. In previous years, sales were mainly in Hong Kong, the mainland, and Southeast Asia. In recent years, however, sales have spread all over the world, with sales to London being the largest, accounting for almost 50% of Hong Kong's exports. The next largest markets are various parts of Southeast Asia and the West Indies. Exports from Hong Kong last year were worth approximately HK$11 million, more than double the amount five years ago. Unfortunately, due to the impact of the war in mainland China and traffic congestion, Hong Kong goods cannot be imported. Otherwise, the value of exports would be even higher.

Compatriots Love It, Foreigners Enjoy Using It

Many years ago, Japanese rubber shoes were sold in large quantities in Hong Kong and British territories, and because of their low prices, it was extremely difficult for Hong Kong goods to compete. However, after the British government implemented a policy of rewarding colonial products by exempting rubber shoe imports from tariffs, Hong Kong's rubber shoe industry saw a major turnaround. Furthermore, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, merchants, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, changed their trade policies. At the same time, the psychology of the Chinese people changed, and they preferred to use domestic products. As a result, the sales of Japanese rubber shoes in British and Southeast Asian territories plummeted. At the same time, domestic rubber shoes took the opportunity to rise, which is why they are so prosperous today. Currently, the products are not only loved by Chinese people but also enjoyed by foreigners, as can be seen from the sales in London and the West Indies.

There are Currently About Five Thousand Workers

Most of the raw materials for Hong Kong's rubber shoes come from the United Kingdom, such as rubber from British Southeast Asia and canvas from London. Although some are ordered from Hong Kong weaving factories, this is only a small number, and their products are only sold in Hong Kong. There are only three to five large rubber factories in Hong Kong, and three to five small ones. There are about 5,000 workers, mostly women. The main product is rubber shoes. In recent years, some have also been manufacturing gas masks, raincoats, and rubber boats, which are supplied to our country's military.

Representatives included He Yuzhen from the慰勞會, Cao Heyuying from the女青年會, Shan Dexin, Xiong Maozhao from the 新運會, and Liu Qingxuan from the 兵災會. During the meeting, they discussed the proposal from the慰勞會 to expand and form a "Hong Kong Women's Federation" and invite women's groups to join and expand the organization.

It has long enjoyed a high degree of faith among the Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the station has shouldered the great task of "propaganda warfare" and confronted the Japanese invaders.

### Guangzhou Foreign Vessels Released Indefinitely; Shipping Companies Suffer Great Losses; Shengchang and Jiya Cargo Ships Released and Returned to Macau Yesterday; Other Vessels Such as Dali Are Still Detained and Not Yet Released

After the fall of Guangzhou, more than ten ships operating on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Macau routes were detained by the Japanese in Guangzhou and the West River. Except for the Foshan and Jiangsu ships in Guangzhou and the West River, which returned to Hong Kong a few days ago, there has been no news of the other ships for several months. Although the British have negotiated with the Japanese, there has been no result. During the Luohu incident a few days ago, when Japanese representatives came to Hong Kong to negotiate with the central authorities, it was rumored that the release of foreign vessels detained in Guangzhou would be discussed, but it is now known that this is not true. A reporter investigated the shipping companies yesterday.

Except for the Shengchang, which was released the day before yesterday, there is still no news of the release of the other detained ships. It is not yet known when the matter can be resolved. The ships have been detained for several months, causing great losses to the companies. Recently, many of the staff of the detained ships have been summoned back to Hong Kong by the Hong Kong companies. In order to make up for the losses, the companies are mostly negotiating with the staff to reduce their salaries during the suspension of operations to maintain operations. It is learned that the Shengchang was released at 8:45 AM on the 19th and departed from Guangzhou for Macau. It arrived in Macau at 7:00 PM that afternoon. According to a crew member, after the fall of Guangzhou, the ship was detained in Guangzhou along with the Jinshan and other ships. It was initially anchored on the White Swan Pool, but later the Jinshan and several other ships were released, while many others remained in the province. The Shengchang then moved to the Shamian embankment to await release. It was not until the 17th that it received a notice from the Japanese, and on the morning of the 19th, it was released to return to Macau, but was not allowed to take passengers or load cargo. On the morning of the 19th, before departure, the Japanese sent personnel to search the ship, causing various disturbances. A batch of fir planks that had been loaded on the ship a few days ago was also moved back ashore. After all the crew members were checked one by one, the Japanese sent a Japanese warship to guide them out of the port. At the same time, the Jiya, a cargo ship flying the Portuguese flag, a cargo barge, and the Wuchang, a Taikoo Line cargo ship flying the British flag, and a cargo barge were also released, all towed by the Shengchang. After reaching Humen, they started their own engines and sailed away. When the ship was docked in Shamian, all crew members had to obtain "good citizen certificates" and wear them on their chests before they could go ashore. Most of the goods sold in the market were Japanese goods, and purchases were limited to military tickets. Therefore, the military tickets issued by the Japanese military department now amount to several million yuan. It is also said that the Japanese are now seeking to restore the prosperity of Guangzhou. There is now a ferry service to Foshan and Pingzhou, both flying the Japanese flag. The ship may operate once every two weeks between Guangzhou and Macau, like the Jinshan's Hong Kong route, in an effort to restore transportation between Guangzhou and Macau.

### With the Hong Kong Government's Active Development, Agricultural Production in the New Territories Has Increased Significantly; Production Accounts for One-Fifth of Hong Kong's Total Consumption

In order to solve its own food problem, the Hong Kong government is actively developing agriculture in the New Territories. This work, with the encouragement of the Hong Kong government and the efforts of the Agricultural Association, has achieved considerable results. In recent years, various types of agriculture in the New Territories have made rapid progress. The Agricultural Association is responsible for leading farmers to promote production.

Agricultural Association Encourages Farmers to Plant

At a recent meeting, the association discussed this in detail. All directors believed that in this extraordinary period, the association should urgently encourage and guide all New Territories members and general farmers to plant vegetables and grains on a large scale to supplement the needs of Hong Kong residents, as this directly affects Hong Kong's food and vegetables. The association has now entrusted this plan to the members of the Technical Committee, who are in close contact with farmers in various villages in the New Territories. Improving farming techniques and increasing production are constantly being studied and refined, and the results have been exceptionally good. At the same time, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many compatriots who fled to Hong Kong from the mainland also moved to the New Territories to buy land and cultivate it. Therefore, the number of farmers in the New Territories has increased significantly in the past year, and the production of various grains has also increased considerably. According to official statistics from Hong Kong last month, Hong Kong residents need approximately 270 tons of vegetables per day, and the New Territories and various islands can only supply 30 tons, accounting for approximately one-eighth of total consumption.

Production in the New Territories Has Increased Significantly Compared to Before

According to agricultural merchants' estimates, production in the New Territories has now increased compared to before. Although it has not been able to completely solve Hong Kong's food problem, it is sufficient to supply one-fifth of the total. In the current situation, it has provided considerable assistance to Hong Kong's food supply. For example, last month, when the supply of vegetables from the mainland was short due to the impact of the war, it was also thanks to the production of the New Territories that it was possible to supplement the supply and prevent a serious panic over vegetables and grains. The Hong Kong government authorities are still constantly working hard to develop agriculture in the New Territories. The government, in view of the large amount of cultivated land in the New Territories, if rice fields are converted into vegetable fields, even if the goal of self-sufficiency cannot be achieved immediately, it will be able to provide a considerable supply. Recently, the Hong Kong government has ordered the Department of Agriculture and Forestry to send experts to study and investigate its development possibilities. In the future, it will definitely formulate a concrete plan based on the investigation report to promote its development through incentives and supervision, so that the land in the New Territories can be fully utilized, and Hong Kong's food supply can also benefit greatly.

### Hong Kong Czechs Ordered to Transfer to German Nationality; German Consul Has No Comment

National Regret

Since Hitler's forceful invasion of Czechoslovakia, it has caused unrest in the general situation in Europe. Whether the current Czechs will be the successors of the Jews is even more noteworthy. It is learned that there are a considerable number of Czech expatriates in Hong Kong, and it is said that several have received instructions from their country's consulate general in Hong Kong to change their passports to German passports. However, according to the German Consul in Hong Kong, Paletz, yesterday, he has not received instructions from Europe regarding the current status of Czech expatriates and is unable to comment.

### National Education Conference Decides to Increase Funding for Overseas Chinese Education; Three School Principals Attending the Conference Returned to School Yesterday; Subsidy Methods to Be Handled by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission

The Third National Education Conference was held in Chongqing and closed yesterday, the 9th. Personnel attending from various places left Chongqing one after another. Wu Dingxin, Chen Bingquan, and Li Yinglin, the principals of the National University, Guangzhou University, and Lingnan University, respectively, who went to attend from Hong Kong, also returned to Hong Kong yesterday, the 19th, at 8:30 PM, taking China Aviation and Eurasia aircraft separately. Yesterday, reporters visited Wu and others and learned that the conference emphasized adapting to wartime.

Adapting to Wartime Education, i.e., vigorously implementing military education to meet the needs of the great era. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave an important speech on this point, but it is not convenient to publish it. In addition, there are some proposals that are not convenient to publish, such as how to implement or restore education in guerrilla areas, and the implementation of peacetime and wartime military training. The general impression is that the spirit of the conference was good and unanimous. In order to facilitate the proceedings of the conference, in addition to the plenary session, group sessions were held, namely, primary, secondary, higher, social, normal, overseas Chinese, and border groups. Wu Dingxin, principal of National University, told reporters that he focused on the two issues of overseas Chinese and border education, saying that he was one of the examination committee members of the Overseas Chinese Education Group. The Ministry of Education submitted several proposals on overseas Chinese education to the conference for discussion. Previously, the government allocated 140,000 yuan annually from the Boxer Indemnity and the national treasury to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to assist overseas Chinese schools for the purchase of books and instruments. Based on this established method of the Ministry of Education, he proposed to increase this subsidy as much as possible, which was approved by the conference. It was also resolved that the Ministry of Education should jointly handle all matters with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in the future.

### ×Another Attempted Offense in Siyi Region ×Qing Garrison in Jiujiang River Frequently Moving ×Guan Shan ×Artillery Remotely Shelling Our Gaoming Estuary ×Our Self-Defense Forces Wounding ×Two Ships in Jiujiang River

[Jiangmen Express News] The Jiujiang River × Qing soldiers have been inactive and lurking in one corner. Since the 17th, the Jiujiang River × army has increased again, with about five to six hundred people, and is attempting to attack Heshan and Xinhui. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Heshan County, regarding the frequent movement of the Jiujiang River × bandits, has requested General Deng Longguang, who is in charge of protecting the West River, to dispatch troops to defend. The recent × situation in the Jiujiang River is as follows:

×Also Bombarding Gulao Estuary

The Jiujiang River × army suddenly increased to more than 300 people on the 17th, and set up artillery positions in the area of ​​Zhewei and Honglou Xuexian Palace on the opposite bank of Gulao. On the morning of the 17th, dozens of cannons were fired continuously, bombing Gulao. Our self-defense team responded calmly, and our new artillery defending the area returned fire and fiercely attacked the × artillery position. After a fierce battle lasting about ten minutes, the × artillery fire on the river × side ceased, and we stopped. On the morning of the 18th, Guan Shan × artillery positions fired again, remotely shelling our Gaoming estuary area, reaching more than ten rounds, but most of the shells fell into the river, and we suffered no losses.

Jiujiang River South ×Gunboats Gathering

According to a phone call from Heshan, more than ten × gunboats were suddenly discovered in the south of the Jiujiang River on the evening of the 16th, cruising back and forth, and seemingly planning to cross the river and attack Gulao in Heshan. Our army and the guards were on alert. On the morning of the 17th, four × gunboats attempted to attack Gulao. Our self-defense force waited until the × gunboats approached and then bombarded them. Two × gunboats were injured and fled in embarrassment to Sanshui, Hekou, Makou, and other places.

Ba Jia and Liang Long ×Gunboats Gathering

According to our intelligence, the × has been intensifying the construction of fortifications in Ba Jia, Longshan, Longjiang and other places along the Jiujiang River in recent days, and forcibly capturing our strong men to serve as coolies. The ×'s conspiracy is to strengthen the Jiujiang defense forces on one hand, fearing attacks by our guerrillas. In addition, it has been found that rumors have been rampant in the Siyi region recently, claiming that the × will invade the Siyi region again. However, according to the investigation, the restlessness of the Li Jiang River × is just a bluff, and it is unable to invade in the short term. Currently, all parts of the Siyi region are as peaceful as usual, and the people's hearts are extremely stable.

However, some ferries were destroyed by × aircraft or stopped sailing voluntarily, resulting in a large number of unemployed sailors. In addition, after all highways were destroyed, traffic was interrupted, and many employees were unemployed. Everyone was living a hard life on the West River, and it was difficult to guarantee that the violent × would not take the opportunity to incite them and induce them to return to Guangzhou to be used by the ×. The County Government Party Department, in order to strictly prevent this, specially organized and established a Water and Land Transport Service Corps to assist the government in military transport and try to provide relief to them. Those with specialized skills will first be introduced to various agencies to serve.

### ×Central China Is Trying to Suppress ×Anti-War Sentiment Is Growing ×War-Weary Military Morale Is Shaking, We Seize the Opportunity to Counterattack ×Sanshui ×Attempts to Establish a Puppet Organization and Fabricate Public Opinion

Central China Secretly Discusses Suppressing Anti-War

[West River Express News] It has been found that the × army's West River Commander Zhongyuan Shaojiang, who recently arrived in Sanshui, believes that internal anti-war sentiment is growing and our army's counterattack is becoming more acute. On the 15th and 16th, he specially convened a military meeting of all officers in the Hekou Customs Headquarters to discuss how to defend and how to suppress the anti-war thoughts and actions of the × soldiers. It was decided to strengthen the defensive strength of the West River front line in order to advance and invade or retreat and defend. In recent days, × chief Zhongyuan personally inspected defenses in the southwest, Hekou, as well as Hanggang, Yangmei, Ganghen, and even Jiujiang, and convened lower-level cadres to give speeches in order to suppress anti-war actions. The situation is panic-stricken, which shows the tension of the anti-war atmosphere within the × army.

Our Army Teams Seize the Opportunity to Counterattack

Our guerrilla teams lurking in the central and southern districts of Sanshui believe that the internal morale of the × army is wavering, and it is appropriate to seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack and deal a blow to the ×. They are now uniting with the Southwest, Hekou, Ganggen and other places to advance. At the same time, they are requesting Deng Guang, a military general of the West River Electric Army, to immediately dispatch a strong force to assist in the attack to annihilate the stubborn ×. On the evening of the 18th, a certain unit of our guerrilla team launched a night attack on the × camp in Ganghen. A fierce battle broke out for a time. For about 30 minutes, our team secretly and gracefully withdrew to preserve its strength. Two hours later, it continued to send a small unit to attack the × camp. The × army was unaware of the plan and responded in a panic. However, our army advanced and retreated suddenly, appearing and disappearing mysteriously. As a result, the × army was restless and panicked. At the same time, another team, taking advantage of the darkness of the moonlit night, destroyed the two highways newly built by the × army from Sanshui City to Hanggang and from Ganggen to Dalu Market. The section from Ganggen via Zhennan and Zhaobian was particularly severely damaged. Currently, the two highways have not been completed and the × is at a loss.

Organizing Puppets and Implementing Puppet Regime

In addition, it has been found that after the × chief Zhongyuan appeared in Sanshui, in addition to sending out large troops of infantry and cavalry to actively force each township to investigate household registration, compile Baojia, elect district and township chiefs, and establish a puppet maintenance committee, he also instigated Han Hao to persuade Chen to serve as the chief of the Sanshui puppet maintenance committee, attempting to use political power to rule the entire Sanshui County. It has been found that the Sanshui puppet organized by the × this time is different from other counties. It is preparing to wait for the puppet maintenance committees of each township to be established before producing an administrative commissioner and a chief of the puppet maintenance committee. Its meaning is to fabricate "public opinion" as its base. Its cunning conspiracy is outrageous.

### Yuebei's February Bloody Relief ×Aircraft Air Raid Loss Statistics ×More Than 300 Innocent Villagers Killed and Injured ×386 Civilian Houses Destroyed

[Shaoguan Correspondent] The reporter received a message yesterday from an air defense observation post on the Northern Route, saying that × aircraft have frequently flown to various places on the Northern Route to invade for several months. Last month, there were 29 attacks, with more than 400 bombs dropped. Eight schools were destroyed. Detailed statistics of the attacks in various places are as follows: Qingyuan, attacked 5 times, 147 bombs dropped, 150 civilians injured, 132 civilians killed, 366 civilian houses destroyed, and 1 school destroyed. Fogang was attacked twice, 56 bombs dropped, 15 civilians injured, 6 civilians killed, and 65 ships destroyed. Wengyuan was attacked once, 18 bombs dropped, 5 civilians injured, 11 civilians killed, 24 ships destroyed, and 1 school destroyed. Yingde was attacked once, 18 bombs dropped. Qujiang was attacked 650 times, 14 civilians injured, 14 civilians killed, 37 ships destroyed, and 4 schools destroyed.

### Crew Members of the Pinli Ship Talk About Their Return to Hong Kong ×A Glimpse of Guangzhou Under Occupation ×Nine Out of Ten Houses Empty, Like a Dead City ×Local Thugs Act as Accomplices

Guangzhou was occupied by the ×, and the Pearl River channel was suddenly closed. At that time, the ships that remained in the province were trapped by the ×. Although the companies concerned had negotiated several times, it was still ineffective. This matter was silent and delayed. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, a small British cargo ship Pinli, which had previously been trapped in the provincial river by the ×, arrived safely in Hong Kong and is now moored on the Mong Kok sea. The reporter also met with the ship's staff yesterday. According to reports, the reason why the ship was able to return to Hong Kong safely this time was sudden. Hours before we left the province, there was still no news of release. After obtaining the special permission of the ×, we hurriedly started and hung up. Today, it is fortunate to escape the tiger's mouth and return unharmed. The reporter then inquired about whether there was news of the release of the Dong'an, Dali, Quanyu, Daming, Guangxi and other ships still remaining in the province, and the various situations after the fall of Guangzhou. It is said that the ships remaining in the province have not yet received the release signal from the ×. As for Guangzhou after the fall, it is now like a dead city, with nine out of ten houses empty, petty thieves everywhere, and local thugs, the × are using them as accomplices. Therefore, in the months after the fall, we (referring to the crew) could only stay in the cabin. Although we were able to go ashore to inspect occasionally, we felt that the most prosperous areas in the past have now become rubble fields, which is shocking and makes people feel sad and angry. But what makes people even more indignant is the brutality of the × people. After occupying the city, they immediately announced martial law, and passers-by were often humiliated innocently. Therefore, those who currently live in the city are mostly the poor, helpless, old and weak, and a group of thugs and hooligans. In short, Guangzhou is now like a dead city, with extreme shortages of food, fuel, and all daily necessities.

In addition, the Wuchang ship, which was the first to travel from Hong Kong to the province after the fall of Guangzhou, also departed from the province and arrived in Hong Kong on the previous (19th) day.

### Hugh Herbert's Experiment: Test If You Are Popular

[Humor is truly an ethereal thing], said Hugh Herbert, "Take myself, for example. When my father gave me ten dollars and told me to make a living in the world, I chose to sell 'vacuum cleaners' as my profession. After six weeks, the manager said, 'Hey, what's going on? You haven't made a single sale in all this time.'

'No, but I've certainly collected a lot of garbage.'

That wisecrack cost me my job. I packed my bags. Later, one rainy day, I joined a guerrilla acting troupe. The manager looked at me and immediately decided I was a comedic character. Then he went to Hollywood, originally to work as a director. But by chance, he changed his mind and returned to being a comedian."

According to him, "humor" in life is like salt on the dining table, an indispensable thing. Recently, he put some effort into creating a rather interesting test, comprising thirty-four questions, divided into four parts. The first part is specifically about personal character, with ten questions. The second part concerns social life, with nine questions. The third part examines whether your targets of laughter are appropriate, with eight questions. The fourth part has seven questions and tests your storytelling skills. The questions can be answered with "yes" or "no". They may seem easy, but this old fox might have put in some traps for you.

Each correct answer is worth ten points; each wrong answer is zero points. There are no deductions for wrong answers. Therefore, the highest possible score is 330 points. (One question is specifically for women, and another is specifically for men.) Naturally, not everyone can get a perfect score. If your score is above 225, great! That's excellent, and you'll be popular wherever you go. 150 to 225 is average. Anything lower is below average. If your score is only below 50, I'm sorry to say, but you seem little different from a robot.

Part One

1. Do you like to play practical jokes on people—like putting a feather duster on someone's bed, etc.?

2. If one of the following situations occurred, would you still be in the mood for some fun?

   1. Your car breaks down and you're helpless, and you're still six miles from home.

   3. Your roof is leaking, and you're getting soaked.

3. If someone offends you, will you be unhappy all day because of it?

4. (Specifically for women) If you're infatuated with someone praising your beauty, do you smile and use a witty remark to change the subject?

6. At home, do you get angry before breakfast?

7. Do your family members find you to be an interesting person and laugh at the jokes you tell?

8. Are three or more of the following five things that you like?

   The Marx Brothers,

   Watching the movements of the orchestra conductor.

9. Can you point out the humorous aspects of a situation?

10. If people make fun of "you," can you take it?

Part Two

1. When dining in public, if you accidentally drop an oyster out of your plate or a fork onto your lap, can you cover it up with a witty remark without looking embarrassed?

2. Can you quickly find the punchline in a joke or story someone is telling?

3. If a new game is introduced in a group, which seems a bit strange, are you willing to be the first to try it?

4. Do you hold a grudge when you lose at "bridge"?

5. Do your friends often think you are a lively and talkative person?

6. After a gathering, has anyone ever told you, "You really made this gathering much more lively"?

7. Do your witty remarks come in a stream?

8. In a social gathering, do you laugh loudly or talk loudly to show your joy?

9. Are you personally interested in making people happy?

Part Three

2. Do you find it funny to see a very fat woman and a very skinny man walking together?

3. Do you laugh at people who slip on banana peels and fall?

4. Do you find it interesting to watch a child playing with a dog?

5. Do you think it's worth laughing at when an elderly couple falls in love?

6. Is it funny when someone almost misses the bus?

7. A fat man frantically chasing after his hat blown away by the wind?

8. If you were walking slowly in a solemn and sacred ceremony and suddenly tripped, would you laugh at yourself?

Part Four

1. When you start telling a story, do you often say things like, "Have you heard this one before?" or "Of course, I can't tell it as well as he did, but this story is really funny, ha ha ha"?

2. Do you always "try" to add humorous color to the story?

3. Do you use vigorous hand gestures to enhance the force of your words?

4. Before getting to the main point, do you start with a long, irrelevant introduction?

5. Do you tell the story as if it happened to someone in your family?

6. Can you tell a joke with a straight face?

### The Inauguration of the Fumin Theater, Operated by Japanese Interests in Shanghai: An All-Encompassing Anesthetic for Our Country

The Japanese are using cinematic arts to anesthetize the people of our country. This is a predetermined plan within their policy of military aggression. We only need to look at what happened after the fall of the Northeast: cinemas were placed under Japanese control, and the films shown were almost entirely supplied by Japanese film companies, invariably showing politically-charged films that promoted "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Friendship," "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Economic Cooperation," and "Joint Anti-Communism," insidiously anesthetizing the Chinese people. After the August 13th Incident, in all occupied areas, cinema was either controlled or subjected to strict censorship. The intention was self-evident.

In Shanghai, the Japanese are adopting their consistent policy of preparing to open a cinema in the Hongkou area. This news has been circulating for a while, but recently it has materialized. Its name is the Fumin Grand Theater, and it is scheduled to officially open on the 13th. It is located on the original site of the Guangdong Grand Theater, with only slight internal renovations. On the opening day, Japanese singers will perform various songs and dances, and Japanese waitresses from Hongkou will sing on stage. It is said that about a thousand people, including Japanese and Chinese residents, will attend the opening ceremony and be seated for free, which of course is aimed at attracting a large number of ruffians.

The Fumin Grand Theater is affiliated with the Fumin Film Company, which was established by the Japanese. Therefore, in the future, the films shown in this theater will largely consist of films controlled by the Fumin Film Company in China. In addition to films, various performances such as Japanese dramas will be staged from time to time. According to Japanese film promoters, many Chinese stage performers, singers, and dancers have signed contracts with the Fumin Grand Theater and will soon appear on stage. However, whether this is true remains to be seen. Even if it is true, it will merely attract some degenerate members of the entertainment industry.

### Singapore Chinese Football Team Victorious on Philippine Tour, Defeats St. Thomas University Team 3-1

Eastern vs. Scots League Match Rescheduled to Thursday

[Special Dispatch] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, a group of eighteen people led by Shen Guandou, departed from Singapore on the 12th of this month and headed for Manila to compete in the Philippines.

Yesterday's English evening newspaper contained a Manila telegram stating that after the Singapore Chinese team arrived there, they first played against the strong St. Thomas University team on the 18th (Saturday). The competition was fierce, and the Singapore Chinese team won 3-1.

The Singapore Chinese team's victory on this Philippine tour, and especially their defeat of the notoriously strong St. Thomas team, shows the strength of the Singapore Chinese team.

The Eastern Athletic Association football team has been actively preparing for its expedition to Hanoi and Haiphong. Star reporter Chen Fuyu has been elected as the team leader. To enhance their strength, they have invited St. Joseph's player Li Anna Sousa and Shanghai players Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to join the team. It is said that Xu and Cao will arrive in Hong Kong before the 25th of this month and may be able to join the team for this Saturday and Sunday's league match against Middlesbrough. The team still has hopes for the championship. If Xu and Cao can join the team in time, they will surely have the confidence to defeat the American team.

Furthermore, the second-round match between the team and Scots, originally scheduled by the Association for 5 pm on the 22nd (tomorrow) at the Hong Kong Football Club ground, has been rescheduled to the 23rd (Thursday) with the consent of the Association and Scots, according to team captain Li Deqi.

### Chiu Lai Basketball Team Defeats Heroic Sing Tao with Deliberate Slow-Paced Strategy: Chiu Lai Performs Well, Winning 38-33; Second Division Ling Ying and Police Win Victories

Three Open Men's Basketball matches were held last night, including First and Second Division games. In the first match, Second Division Reporter vs. Ling Dream, the Reporter team was weakened because players Mao Ziming, Ma Zhaohua, Cheng Baoqi, and others were suspended and unable to participate. They were behind 8-32 at halftime. They worked hard to counterattack in the second half, with Xiao Dianlian making repeated outstanding contributions, but because they were too far behind in the first half, they ultimately lost 29-43. In the second match, First Division Sing Tao vs. Chiu Lai, the former was the reincarnation of the Youth Association team, which has won the championship for several years in a row and has not been defeated for many years. The latter is also a strong team in the First Division, with famous players Chen Ruzheng, Zhang Rensheng, Su Bohui, Guo Nan Hong, Li Yuanfen, Shen Ruiqing, etc., and their strength is also very strong. Although the team lost their first match 45-49 to South China the day before, they rallied last night and defeated Sing Tao. The team's victory was not accidental. In terms of merit, main player Chen Ruzheng deserves the most credit. His shots from the side were accurate, which can be called an amazing technique. Shen Ruiqing's interceptions and passes have mastered the essence of the game, but his shooting is still not calm enough and has not yet reached perfection. Zhang Renfa, although old, has not lost all his skills. As for Guo Zhihong's offense and Li Yuanfen and Su Bohui's defense, each had their own strengths. For Sing Tao, Dai Fucheng's strong attacks and Liang Guoduo and Pan Yaojun's resistance to the enemy were all excellent performances, but famous player Zhong Zhiqiang performed poorly, failing to win when he should have and missing many good opportunities. In short, the biggest reason for Chiu Lai's victory was the adoption of a deliberate slow-paced strategy, which was well-executed, and the defeat of Sing Tao's high-speed five-player offensive and defensive method, which created this victory.

After the two sides faced off, Sing Tao immediately took the offensive, and Dai Fucheng's shots and free throws were all successful, giving them a 7-0 lead. Chiu Lai counterattacked, and Chen Ruzheng and Guo Zhihong broke through, tying the score at 8-8. Soon after, Zhong Zhiqiang joined the battle, and Chiu Lai's offense became stronger. Guo Zhihong and Chen Ruzheng were unstoppable, taking the lead with scores of 14-10 and 20-10. At the end of the first half, Chiu Lai led 24-15. After the start of the second half, Sing Tao's Pan Yaojun joined the game, and their momentum was boosted. He and Dai Fucheng cooperated, and the score was 21-28 and 30-23. When Chiu Lai's Guo Zhi Ming was fouled out four times, the situation became extremely tense. Afterwards, Chen Ruzheng and Shen Ruiqing became active again. Although Sing Tao won several free throws, it was to no avail and could not reverse the situation. At the end of the match, Chiu Lai defeated them 38-33.

In the last Second Division match, Police played against Youth Force, and the Police team won with superior skills, winning 42-35. The scores for each team are listed below:

### Effectiveness of Morning Exercises (1)

— Zhuoyue

[Special Report] In last month's issue, everyone gained a general understanding of the "effectiveness of morning exercises." I believe that after reading this article, everyone will have questions about the scope of the effectiveness of morning exercises, whether they can help with development, increase lifespan, etc. Please be patient and let me provide a detailed introduction so that everyone can gain a thorough understanding and a central belief, and then put it into practice. This is my sincere hope. Now, I will discuss the main points in detail below.

(1) Develop the Habit of Getting Up Early

An ancient proverb says, "The plan for a lifetime lies in diligence when young, and the plan for a day lies in the morning." Getting up early is certainly a good habit. If we can consistently do morning exercises, we can naturally develop the habit of getting up early. Because morning exercises must have a time limit—they must be done in the early morning. If they don't have a time limit and are done arbitrarily, they shouldn't be called morning exercises; they should simply be called regular exercises. Therefore, people who consistently do morning exercises have all cultivated the good habit of getting up early.

(2) Have the Effectiveness of Restoring Fatigue

Gentle exercise can restore fatigue, which is acknowledged by every physical education expert. However, the effectiveness in morning exercises is even more noticeable. After a whole day of work or excessive exercise, our body and mind are very tired. Even after eight hours of rest at night, the fatigue in the body and mind cannot be completely restored. Or, if we sleep for too long, we still feel more tired. If we can use the morning time to exercise, we will feel refreshed and happy after the exercise. This is my personal experience, and it has been tested by many people and is the most reliable effect. The reason is very simple. It is probably because after exercise, the body temperature increases, and breathing and blood circulation accelerate, which causes the fatigue elements in various parts of the body to be discharged.

### 申報 Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament to be Held in Mid-April with Six Teams Selected for a Single-Elimination Competition

The Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament, decided upon some time ago by the association conference, has yet to materialize. This is because the men's open competition has begun, causing issues with court time. Therefore, the matter has been delayed. It is now determined that preparations can only begin in mid-April after the first week of the open men's tournament. As for the participating teams, the association will select the six strongest women's teams from Hong Kong and China, and the competition will be a single-elimination format.

### The Tasks That Instructors Should Undertake During Basketball Training

— Luo Xia

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] An excellent basketball team cannot be trained overnight. It requires countless sweat and tears, enduring hardships and expending time and effort, before satisfactory results can be achieved. A large part of this success comes from the instruction of a wise coach. The instructor's immediate tasks include allocating appropriate training time and selecting standard, legitimate materials for implementation.

During training, instructors should pay attention to understanding each player's moral character and their technical strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, they should use a recording method to track each player's progress and level in each practice session. This is the most important task for instructors during training. The sample recording table is copied below.

By carefully examining this chart, we can distinguish the differences between each player, which may not be apparent in regular practice. Therefore, instructors can use this chart to examine the detailed statistics of their players' progress and skills, and then implement special guidance based on a standard assessment to help them achieve rapid success and cultivate outstanding talent. This is of great value.

According to the results on the table, Zhang Zonghou shoots more accurately from the left side of the court than from the right, especially in front of the basket. Conversely, Li Youwen shoots more accurately from the right side of the basket than from the left. Chen Mingsheng has weaknesses in all aspects of long-range shooting, but shoots reasonably well when close to the basket on the right side.

Based on these results, it would be a mistake to assign Zhang Zonghou to the right wing and Li Youwen to the left wing. Similarly, it would be a mistake to have Chen Mingsheng play as a running guard and attempt long-range shots. Chen is best suited as a follow-up man, and he is most reliable when receiving rebounds and shooting within the free-throw line.

From these aspects, we understand the importance of this record table. The strengths and weaknesses of the players themselves can be clearly seen on this table. Furthermore, with the guidance and criticism of a wise instructor, considerable success can be achieved. Therefore, during the training period, the instructor's only task is to use this table to clearly record each player's skills. Each time a review is obtained, progress is felt with each session.

As for the prices of various stocks, they were generally lower than last week, but investors did not seem eager to sell off their holdings, so the market can be described as stable.

### World's Sympathy and Encouragement

— Translated by Lü Jueliang

——Several Postcards from Esperantists Around the World

Foreword

The full-scale War of Resistance has removed the pressure that the Esperanto movement in China has always suffered. Most Esperantists immediately stood on the international propaganda front, participating in the work of the full-scale War of Resistance.

Before the War of Resistance, all Chinese Esperanto publications concentrated in Shanghai were suspended due to the retreat from Shanghai. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, "New Stage" (jointly published by Esperantists in Hong Kong and Guangzhou), "Far Eastern Messenger" (run by Esperantists from Shanghai and Nanjing in Hong Kong), and "Oriental Voice" (Hankou) emerged one after another. They contributed greatly to the liberation struggle of the motherland in terms of calling for support and reporting news. Later, "Justice" (the successor of "New Stage") stopped publication after the abandonment of Guangzhou. "Oriental Voice" moved to Hong Kong before Wuhan fell and is still working hard with "Far Eastern Messenger" towards the same grand goal.

Every Chinese Esperantist knows that propaganda work is not limited to passively reporting on the war situation and exposing enemy atrocities in publications. It also involves actively working with Esperantists from other countries – establishing close contact. Therefore, all Esperanto publications maintain extensive communication, and also receive many letters from Esperantists and groups from various countries expressing great admiration and comfort to our supreme leader and brave soldiers.

What follows are a few short postcards from the hundreds of consolation letters sent by Esperantists from various countries to the editor of "Far Eastern Messenger" for forwarding to Chinese soldiers. These short notes are filled with the infinite sympathy and encouragement from progressives around the world for our War of Resistance.

Dear Editor of the Esperanto magazine "Far Eastern Messenger":

We, the small people of Norway, send you our deepest respects. Our entire nation truly admires your Chinese nation's self-defense war against the hateful Japanese militarists. We also express our utmost respect for Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, as they are the best of people.

Please send me a copy of your magazine! I plan to translate some texts from your publication to help the poor Chinese with propaganda. The dearest greetings from Norwegian comrades –

We must defeat the despicable Japanese – G.L. Johnson (Norway)

To the soldiers defending the soil of China. Dear Comrades:

We view your resistance war against the Japanese fascists for the liberation of the nation with admiration and sympathy. We clearly know that by doing so, you are not only serving your motherland, but also benefiting other countries that are either openly or secretly threatened by brutal fascists.

Therefore, we owe you a debt, which should be presented to you with sincere sympathy. Because you will bring a richer future to your nation and all mankind.

With comrade greetings!

G.P. Bruun

(Dutch representative in the Bancy People's Front)

Chinese Soldiers:

In the September issue of 'Far Eastern Messenger', I read the articles about encouraging Chinese soldiers.

Like true Zamenhof believers, peace warriors, I hope you, be your righteous guardians. God will bless you, to fulfill your wishes in all respects. You serve the whole of mankind and the true democratic countries in the world, bravely defend your independence and justice, and drive away the beasts who are dedicated to destroying culture!

Long live peace and justice!

Zamenhof's peace warrior, A. Obierlman (Poland)

To the Chinese soldiers fighting bravely:

In my school and home, most of my friends admire your brave struggle against the Japanese bandits, especially me. In my country, Argentina, everyone feels that it is necessary to cooperate with your brave Chinese soldiers to be anti-fascist boxers who maintain peace and freedom, and for us, this is necessary. Who is the real winner? We are all convinced that it belongs to your side. To the brave Chinese soldiers in the front! We salute you!

Your Argentinian friend, Sun Yuegen

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

Yes, she was finally dragged back from school by her father. Placed under surveillance at home. Therefore, hadn't he also had negative feelings towards his father? She said:

"What father? A traitor!" She was young, she was weak—determined by her physique, her gender, her habits of life—a weak person who found it difficult to express her resistance through action—beyond the blind impulse of emotion; in the end, it was nothing more than complaints, even curses. However, she still tried to donate as much as possible within her means. Her friends knew and praised her:

"You are truly a good daughter of China!" When the maid came with green tea, she felt a little calmer; her heart, as if it had been suspended, was falling back to its original place. However, he was afraid of the talkative maid; even if she didn't cause any accidents, she would inevitably waste unlimited time because of her talkativeness; so he forced her to refuse the maid's tea, so that the maid had no chance to come in and talk. She didn't make a sound; and the maid outside the door refused to leave, as if she were saying: "Let me in, I have so many things to say, I must say them." Therefore, he was a little angry, and he said in a low voice: "Speak quickly, no tea!"

A clever person, in a sudden change, is often not clever, and sometimes even foolish. Only when he saw her pointing to her throat with trembling fingers did he remember that the handkerchief was stuffed in her mouth. He thought:

"Why are you so afraid of me! I won't kill you." But this was not a correct understanding, and she did not understand herself either, what she was expressing. It was not so much driven by grasping some revolutionary viewpoint—but half driven by the concept of loving one's motherland—because people are not allowed to let their motherland perish, this has already become an instinct, and half driven by her own weak personality—because the emotions of the weak are fragile, sadness and joy are equally easy to be moved, plus she still retains her natural goodness, making her feel closer to the suffering of others—unconsciously sympathizing. However, she cast a doubtful gaze on this newly acquainted envoy of the volunteers, and wrote:

"Are you a volunteer?"

### Records of Jiangyin City Defense and Others

— Zou Xiao

——Folk Novel Anecdotes

According to "Anecdotes on Novels," "Records of Jiangyin City Defense is a type of "Jing Tuo's Lost History," but adapted into a popular novel." Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels" includes it but notes "Unseen." Note that the word "Lost" should be an error for "Escaped/Lost." "Anecdotes on Novels" also says: "The four kings and eight generals in the book all have surnames, but after checking other detailed records, it seems almost as if they are non-existent. Moreover, among those who died in battle during the early Qing Dynasty, there were only Nikan and Kong Youde, and their events took place in Yunnan and Guangdong, not in Jiangyin. Presumably, the so-called kings were military nicknames. The riots in Suzhou had what were called the Eight Great Kings, which are similar to this."

The author of "Anecdotes on Novels" had seen "Feng Yi Bian," because the fifteenth chapter of that book was "Incited Rebellion in Suzhou over Shaving Hair, Pretending to Offer Incense to Assassinate the Eight Great Kings," so they cited the "Eight Great Kings" as an example. However, they were unaware that the "City Defense Records" (written by Han Yan of the Qing Dynasty in local dialect), on which the popular novel was based, had the following records: "Lost Three Kings and Eighteen Generals," "(August) 11th, the Qing soldiers attacked the North Gate, and Seven Kings died." ""12th, the Qing soldiers still attacked the North Gate, and Two Commanders-in-chief died."" "14th, Jiangyin feigned surrender, and King Xue died." "29th, the Qing attacked the South City, and the Tenth King died." According to "Records of Loyalists on the River," there were also the so-called Eight Kings who died on August 12th after being hit by gunfire. The deaths of the other kings are the same as recorded in the "Jiangyin City Defense Records." It seems that the author of "Anecdotes on Novels" was a little negligent here.

The "Double Loyalty Records" (with Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui resisting the Yuan as the protagonists), "Snow Cellar Ice Heaven Records" (an adaptation of Aji's River Crossing Records), and "Battle of Caishi Records" (with Yu Yunwen's military achievements as the focus), mentioned separately in "Anecdotes on Novels," are like "Jiangyin City Defense Records," all novels that I have longed for and eagerly wanted to read, but unfortunately, they all seem to have been lost.

Because we are talking about the fall of Jiangyin City, it reminds me of "Another Biography of the Righteous People of Jiangyin." A friend of mine said after reading the biography:

"As long as the people are willing to resist, the country will never be conquered by foreign races—if everyone is willing to resist, political corruption will not occur, any heresy will not be heard, of course there will be no traitors, and it will especially arouse international sympathy and gain assistance. The strength of the people is great, far surpassing any other force. If you don't believe it, we can look at the resistance of the people of Jiangyin at the end of the Ming Dynasty against the Manchus, with their small area, a motley crowd, resisting hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers for as long as eighty-three days, and inflicting heavy damage on them. If you don't believe it, we can also look at the achievements of the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi and Hebei today, and see what kind of blows they have given to the Japanese army.

"I hope that those who read this book will have such an imagination: the Qing soldiers and Tatars are what today? Liu Liangzuo is a traitor in the puppet government, and the Seven Kings and Two Commanders-in-chief are Jiangyin of what, any county or city in the country, perhaps the students in our modern schools, Gao Rui and Xu Yuyang are our old men, and the Cheng Sheng and He brothers are ordinary merchants in our cities. All the wars written here are modern wars. The cruelty of the invaders, our struggles, are all present realities. I hope that our compatriots, everyone, will have the determination to act as Xu Yong to Chen Erlang and Huang Yuqi. And our wise officials will all have the wisdom, courage, and loyalty of Chen Er, and the eventual failure of Jiangyin in the past is not surprising, because at that time there was no second Jiangyin, and now we are Jiangyin everywhere, we will never fail, therefore, we don't have to be discouraged by the failure of Jiangyin in the past, but instead use its failure to inspire our shared hatred, so that we will surely succeed and avenge our national hatred."

Because his words are very insightful, I copied them here for readers to refer to.

### Rebirth

— Wang Lao

Stroking the scarred wounds

From humiliation

From anger

We stand up straight!

Look!

In the motherland

Now countless sons and daughters

Have become strong! —

A wounded beast

Unwilling to endure its own pain!

Holding a gun

Riding a horse

Galloping

On the mountain, on the plain

Guarding, watching

Its own land

Every inch of it

Is left by our ancestors!

Use struggle

To settle the accounts of blood.

Use blood

To wash away the shameful scars of blood.

To seize a piece of land

To hold tight to a battleground

Rather fight to the end

Fight to the last man!

These stories

Touching stories

Have begun

In the reborn, struggling China

Heard!

### The Old Master, the Idiot, and Lei Yuan

— Xiao Wen

This is a sketch of characters, fragments of a story, a true account of neighbors from my childhood. I've lived in unfamiliar places for several years, and three more years from now, it will have been twenty years. My childhood memories are a bit faded and vague, which is a regret. I never finished watching a legend at the appropriate moment.

In the story, we should first mention three characters who appear: the first is "Old Master," the second is "the Idiot," and the third is "Lei Yuan." They are related, all surnamed "Hang." If calculated by age, the Old Master is in his fifties or older, while the Idiot and Lei Yuan are both in their twenties or thirties. Some say the Idiot is much older than Lei Yuan. It's said that in terms of seniority, the Idiot should be the most senior. The property they live off is all under his name. The local people are generally unclear about the Hang family's background. They were originally from another place and moved here to live for a long time. In any case, the Hangs themselves understand the situation; no one cares about idle matters or the truth of the matter.

The Old Master once held a minor official position; he was a proper person who wore an official hat. The Idiot is just an idiot, from childhood to now, and into the future. Lei Yuan is a prodigal son, a spendthrift, a rascal. Three different types of characters mixed together, thus unfolding a legendary story.

Lei Yuan eats, drinks, and doesn't work, acting carelessly. Fortunately, the family can still support an idle person. He has some pocket money to spend on the streets, which doesn't interfere with the family's affairs. His life consists of gambling, making trouble, and engaging in lewd activities. His talent: he once ate seven bowls of plain noodles in a row without his stomach complaining. He started a fire himself and tried to frame the neighbors. He has a lot of crude strength, making people afraid of his rascality. But he doesn't dare to challenge the Idiot. That would be risky because he is not a match. Not a word, not a dose of medicine, and even in terms of strength, he is no match for the Idiot. The Idiot has a kind of idiotic stubbornness, somewhat numb to blood and death.

"A poisonous mosquito bites a poisonous snake, using poison to fight poison." The general saying is not wrong at all.

The Idiot eats and stays put, like a clay Bodhisattva standing at the mountain gate, watching people, the sky, and the door, like a guard dog. He is quite serious with strangers. He has no life, no story, sometimes with a touch of comical innocence, always blank, neither smiling nor crying. He is already an adult, but every night he still wets the bed, like a child, big or small. This happens quite often, so no one pays attention to him. A small room is prepared for him to lie down in, with a urine-soaked pillow, urine-soaked bedding, urine-soaked bricks, and urine-soaked bed frame, like a piglet. Occasionally, a kind-hearted old woman puts the urine-soaked bedding in the sun, and the small courtyard is filled with the smell of urine. If someone offends him, even if it is his own family, he won't recognize them. It's as if he's a wild horse; no one dares to confront him. Only the Old Master can be asked to show his face and scold him loudly. He will be like a child being punished by his mother, not daring to make a sound, quietly slipping away.

"The official, with the fire of samadhi on his head, can rectify what is crooked." The general saying is not wrong at all.

The Old Master, many people would introduce him to you as an experienced and worldly person. Perhaps he once had a golden age of rich experience, and now he is retiring at home. He lives upstairs in a small building, reads dull books, dabbles in herbs, and lives a life of leisure as an elderly man. He is quite carefree. His samadhi frightens the Idiot, but he is no match for Lei Yuan. When Lei Yuan exerts his strength, he dares not touch a hair on his head. A rascal doesn't care about anything; he doesn't care about old or young, just acts recklessly and ruthlessly. The elderly are always cautious, and even if they are seniors, it's best not to suffer immediate losses.

"This is the feng shui of the Hang family's ancestral grave." The general saying is not wrong at all.

These three prominent figures, with their indelible and different personalities, mixed together, restraining each other, creating a cycle, often putting on good shows for the neighbors to watch. After getting used to it, it becomes a bit bland, but the children are still very happy. I was one of them, a little afraid, a little curious, secretly watching. "Although the Hang family produced a prodigal son, it is still a good family, all thanks to the Idiot's good fortune. If the Idiot dies, if the Idiot dies..." The general saying is not wrong at all.

When I left this place, the Old Master did not die, the Idiot did not die, and Lei Yuan did not die. They were all quiet, without any storms, in their old ways, a picture of unchanging cycles.

Therefore, my story has no tail.
