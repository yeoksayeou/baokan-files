### Resistance War, Economic Construction, and Land Problems: Full Text of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society and Its Resolutions

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper)

The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society was held at the Chuandong Normal School Auditorium on April 23rd and 24th.

This annual meeting coincided with the period when the war of resistance was about to enter a new stage. It had been a full two years since the Fourth Annual Meeting held in Qingdao in April of the 26th year of the Republic. In these two years, China had made new progress and was absolutely different compared to then. An obvious fact is that the meeting address today is in the wartime capital – Chongqing!

Due to the separation of the war zones and the interruption of transportation, the participation of the members was affected, but in fact, the number of people attending this time reached more than eighty, exceeding the Fourth Annual Meeting. This shows the attention of land administration scholars to land issues. Naturally, the concentration of most members in Chongqing is also a reason.

Outline of the Venue

The conference opened on the 23rd morning with 82 attendees. There were personnel actually handling land administration, from the Land Committee of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, the Land Department of the Ministry of the Interior, to the land administration bureaus of various provinces and cities, and reclamation zone personnel. Most of them participated. Another part was the president, professors, and scholars studying land administration issues from the Land Administration College of the Central Political School of the Kuomintang. Guests included representatives from the Land Administration Academy of the Ministry of the Interior, the Survey Bureau of the Ordnance General Headquarters, the Shandong Provincial Land Administration Bureau, the Guizhou Finance Department, the Shaanxi Civil Affairs Department, and the Sichuan Land Bureau, as well as all 20+ students of the eighth class of the Land Administration College.

The seats in the venue were arranged in rows, and members were seated according to their numbers. Each person carefully read the mimeographed proposal summary, the agenda, and documents such as local land administration implementation reports and reclamation zone status. The front rows were occupied by figures such as the council of the association and the annual meeting organizing committee. Two points from Chairman Chiang's instructions, "The solution of the land problem is the primary urgent task of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood" and "The day of victory in the War of Resistance will be a good opportunity to thoroughly promote land policy," were written into a couplet-style quotation and hung in the center of the auditorium.

A Heated Debate

The most heated scene of this meeting was the debate on land administration issues during and after the war at the first general meeting on the 23rd afternoon, chaired by Zheng Zhen, Director of the Land Department of the Ministry of the Interior. The topic of discussion was "China's Post-War Land Policy," which was formulated by the council before the meeting. According to the Secretary-General's report, the number of attendees was 59.

After the chairman announced the topic, he invited everyone to speak freely. Originally, it was planned that the council would decide on the discussion items to give the members a scope for discussion. But due to time constraints, only Mr. Huang Tong explained, "The proposal of the post-war land policy may be questioned by the public; why not discuss the wartime but discuss the post-war?" Then Mr. Huang explained, "The victory of the War of Resistance is predictable, and the state will undergo such a major change. The future social situation and system will inevitably be chaotic, so we discuss the post-war land policy in preparation for the government's adoption in the future."

The proposal of this question immediately aroused a discussion on "timing." Everyone stood up to speak, arguing about the topic. "How long will the war last?" "What will the situation be after the war?" "The situation after the war is unclear, how can we determine the post-war policy?" "Moreover, we cannot compare the post-war with the pre-war." Those who disagreed with discussing "post-war" repeatedly raised these questions. Their active advocacy was that "wartime" land problems are practical problems, and we cannot avoid reality to discuss the idealistic "post-war," and today's land problems are urgently awaiting solutions. Some interpreted "post-war" as "after the War of Resistance," and some proposed that at the very least, "wartime" and "post-war" should be discussed together. Those who advocated discussing "post-war" used "preparing for post-war" as a reason, and could also make "estimated" discussions on "post-war." The chairman's opinion was that because the topic was decided by the council, it should be discussed accordingly, and the discussion could also link "wartime" and "post-war" together to avoid only arguing about the topic without getting to the point. Finally, as the time was almost past 2 o'clock, and more than twenty people had expressed their opinions on this issue, they had to continue the discussion. However, in everyone's subsequent speeches, they repeatedly mentioned the topic first, and the discussion did not reach a conclusion.

Land Problems in Southwest Construction

At the second general meeting on the 24th morning, the attendees were still 59 people. What was discussed was "Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems." This is a newly emerging problem in the rear of the War of Resistance. The most important issues were "requisition" and "compensation." How to solve the requisition of land for roads and the like? How to compensate for the requisition of land? The other issues were land use, labor, taxation, land price speculation, and lack of social stability.

However, when each person expressed their opinions, they mostly talked about Southwest construction, and there was less precise discussion about land problems. Therefore, when the time was almost up, Mr. Luo Xingjian gave a general summary, which mainly meant that in addition to the government having a unified plan for Southwest construction and land problems, a central land administration agency should be set up immediately to promote and solve the problems that have already occurred and will occur in accordance with land laws and regulations.

At the third general meeting, important proposals and resolutions, as well as telegrams, were passed.

In summary, in this annual meeting, apart from the heated debate on "wartime" and "post-war" at the first general meeting, there was little concrete and in-depth discussion, only a general outline was discussed, and it was largely concluded.

The Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society was held at 8:00 AM on April 24th after the Premier's Memorial Week, and continued to hold the second meeting. First, President Kong's congratulatory speech to the General Assembly was read out, and then the Western Economic Construction and Land Issues were discussed until 12:00. At 2:00 p.m., the third meeting continued to be held, and the Proposals Committee first reported the results of the review, and five proposals were put forward for discussion: (1) Suggest that the government actively implement the "land to the tiller" policy to increase production, stabilize agriculture, and enrich national strength; (2) Land reclamation during extraordinary periods should be organized by land administration agencies; (3) Propose that the central government promptly establish land administration agencies in order to promote wartime and post-war land policies; (4) Propose that the central government delineate the second district of northern Shaanxi as the experimental zone for the Party's equalization of land rights; (5) Draft temporary measures for reducing and exempting land rent in war zones and remedying land abandonment and land abandonment, etc. All five proposals were passed in accordance with the results of the review. The Committee on Membership Review reported that they were extremely satisfied with the past work of the Association, and then discussed the revision of the Constitution. A temporary motion was passed by the General Assembly to send a telegram to the Kuomintang President Chiang and the front-line soldiers to pay tribute. Finally, Su Gan, Zeng Ji-kuan, Zheng Zhen-yu, Wan Guoding, Zhu Ban, Huai Fansun, Huang Tong, Li Ailing, Zhang Tingxiu Baode, Gao Xin, Tang Qiyu, Liu Xiuqing, Guan Jiyu, Guo Hanming and other fifteen people were elected as council members, Zhou Zhizuo, Luo Xiatian, Lin Qinchen, Wang Xianqiang, Zhu Zongliang, Jiang Lian, Feng Zigang, Luo Meixing, Li Ruhan and nine others were elected as alternate directors. The meeting closed at about 7:00, and the two resolutions passed by the association on "China's Post-War Land Policy" and "Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems" are recorded as follows:

### China's Post-War Land Policy

Regarding the guiding principles and program guidelines of our country's land policy, the Premier's legacy has long been proclaimed, and the past annual meetings of this association have also had considerable concrete resolutions to follow. Now, in order to complete national freedom and national independence, we are fighting the war, and the construction of a Three People's Principles country should be accelerated, and the essence of equalizing land rights lies in implementing a peaceful social revolution at the time of the new construction after the great destruction. When the national government was established in the 16th year of the Republic, because the advance planning was not solid, we missed the opportunity, so on the day of victory in the war, we should immediately implement the policies proclaimed in the Premier's legacy in accordance with the pre-determined plan to establish a new land system based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and its essentials are as follows:

1. After the war, the country should immediately promulgate emergency laws to reorganize land rights. In areas destroyed by the war, in particular, effective methods should be used to adjust the distribution of people and land and restore the prosperity of rural areas. Therefore, (1) in areas where the tenant farming system is prevalent, land financial institutions should be used after the war to adjust land rights in order to realize that the tiller owns the land. (2) In places where people have been displaced due to the war and the land is barren, all ownerless land should be used to transfer it to the tiller. (3) In coastal and riverside provinces and counties with dense populations and fragmented land rights, a land needs registry should be established after the war to determine the amount of people and land and adjust the distribution of width and narrowness. (4) In provinces and counties in border areas with a sparse population, large-scale relocation work should be carried out after the war, and large-scale farming should be tried. (5) Before active construction, progressive land value tax and value-added tax should be implemented immediately to prevent monopoly and to make the benefits of construction public. (6) Land requisitioned from the people due to the war should be fully compensated after the war, or compensated with other land. (7) For people who have been displaced by the war and have returned to their homeland, all land taxes not paid during the war and land not paid by tenant farmers shall be exempted.

2. At the beginning of post-war economic construction, land consolidation work should be actively promoted in industrial areas, transportation centers, and seaports and cities. In particular, land prices should be determined first and laws on the return of price increases to the public should be promulgated. Therefore, (1) If the original state of land and its fixed objects has changed due to the war, arbitrarily restoring the original state should be prohibited in accordance with construction plans. (2) In major construction areas, the land required in the plan should be requisitioned in advance before the plan is announced. (3) For war-torn and emerging cities, urban plans and zoning methods should be predetermined, and land price declarations should be held before land surveying and registration are completed.

3. Post-war land use should seek to suit the trend of modern economic development, and pay attention to rational agricultural management. Especially in areas where the destruction by the invaders is more serious, the cultivated land should be rebuilt at the beginning of the recovery, and standard self-cultivating farmers should be established to ensure that the displaced and suffering farmers have sufficient livelihood guarantees. Therefore, (1) in areas where land management is too subdivided, reorganization should be carried out quickly and cooperative management should be promoted. (2) If there are too few self-cultivating farms, they should be quickly adjusted after the war to give them an appropriate amount of land and allow them to meet ideal standards. (3) Natural resources and land with unique properties should be developed by national capital after the war, and attention should be paid to local preservation.

4. At the time of post-war demobilization, the state should give preferential compensation to all officers and soldiers who have contributed to the country and participated in the war, and grant them land for self-cultivation. Families of the wounded and killed and displaced victims should also be given an appropriate amount of land to show condolences. Therefore, (1) requisition the land of absentee landlords, or give priority to allocating public land to soldiers who are willing to return to agriculture. (2) Families of those killed or injured in the war and displaced victims, even if they have no farming ability, should also be given land, especially allowing them to rent it out or hire workers for a certain period of time. (3) In important border defense areas, elite troops and their families should be relocated to carry out military reclamation.

5. In order to implement the above four items, the improvement and establishment of post-war land administration institutions, the widespread promotion of land registration, and the training of land administration personnel are all urgent matters that should be prepared in advance. Therefore, (1) the central government and the provinces and counties should quickly expand the functions of land administration agencies, enrich their content, and establish land administration agencies in the occupied provinces at the beginning of the recovery to implement land management. (2) If there are no maps or the maps have been lost in the occupied areas, they should be reorganized at the beginning of the recovery, and land registration should be carried out in the rear provinces before economic construction begins. (3) Land administration personnel should be divided into three levels: high, middle, and junior, and separate and large-scale training should be carried out immediately.

### Southwest Economic Construction and Land Problems

At this time when the War of Resistance is proceeding smoothly, in order to increase the strength of the War of Resistance and establish a foundation for national construction, the central government should first determine the entire plan for economic construction. Southwest economic construction is the initial stage of the entire construction, and its construction plan should occupy an extremely important position in the national economic construction plan. Land is the basic element of all economic construction. Therefore, when implementing South Economic Construction, we should have a meticulous plan and concrete methods for land issues in advance to establish the foundation of economic construction, so that the construction work can proceed smoothly and the national economy can develop in a healthy manner. The following are the land issues that should be paid attention to and the solutions in the progress of South Economic Construction:

1. Land requisitioned for economic construction should be carefully considered and compensated separately according to the actual situation.

2. In the central area of economic construction and the new cities and towns along the land and water transportation lines, land prices should be determined first. All land price increases due to the implementation of economic construction should be used to replenish the funds for economic construction.

3. In the wasteland in the southwestern economic construction area, those suitable for large-scale reclamation should be operated by public farms organized by the government; other wasteland should be encouraged to be reclaimed separately by private individuals or groups in order to increase the material resources for the War of Resistance and enrich the strength of the War of Resistance.

4. The agricultural, forestry, pastoral, and mining lands in this area should be zoned according to the natural environment and social conditions, and used separately in order to seek the adjustment of land use and avoid the loss of land fertility; as for the emerging cities and towns of economic construction. Detailed estimates should be made in advance so that the land can be used appropriately and the deformed development can be avoided.

5. In the land system in the reclamation area, efforts should be made to improve it in accordance with the principles of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and self-cultivating farms should be actively established at the same time.

6. In order to enrich the economic construction resources and activate the financial resources of economic construction, land and agricultural financial institutions should be established so that the construction work can be easily developed

7. All economic construction is based on land surveying. The government should plan and continue to manage all construction land surveying work in this area.

8. In order to unify the progress of land administration work in the southwestern economic construction area, a special management department should be established first to be responsible for planning and implementing it effectively.

### Balancing Commodity Prices

— Bao Leti

Although everyone feels that prices are terribly high, everyone thinks this is a normal phenomenon of war. Indeed, this is the case, and it is the same both in China and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this as a normal phenomenon of wartime. This is sufficient to reflect the firm and unyielding spirit of sacrifice of the entire nation, which is worthy of pride to the world.

However, we must not let it go unchecked simply because it is an inevitable trend, because many people are using this reason to manipulate prices and deliberately raise them. For the overall benefit of the nation and the people, everyone should have the spirit of sacrificing everything. However, in fact, we cannot deny that there is a limit to the endurance of material life. At the same time, it should be considered that when the people's lives are oppressed by high prices to the point where they cannot sustain themselves, it will not help the war of resistance.

Moreover, regarding this issue, rather than saying that "there is an urgent need for a practical solution at present," it is better to say that "for the sake of future safety, it is necessary to plan ahead to prevent problems before they arise." Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war, then in the future when there is no hope of ending the war, and when all the causes that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited boiling. However, there is no doubt that:

(2) Analysis of the Reasons for High Prices

Why does the existence of war sufficiently stimulate soaring prices? The reason is very simple. Let's take the current situation as an example.

(1) Before the war, the country's expenses were at most about 800 to 900 million yuan. Even the total budget for the 26th year of the Republic of China, which set an unprecedented high record, was only a little over 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military spending, it is said to have exceeded 1.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods has almost more than doubled compared to peacetime. When demand increases, prices will naturally increase. Shanghai, for example, has also seen a sharp increase in population, which has greatly increased demand. However, this is not the main factor, because:

(2) If production can increase at the same rate as the increase in demand, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a gentle curve, and will not rise higher and higher. However, our production industry was already so backward in peacetime, and it has been damaged beyond recognition during the war. Not only is the industrial equipment dilapidated, but also the vast number of farmers in the war zones have stopped farming. In addition, the looting by the Japanese army everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and expanded the imbalance between supply and demand.

(3) With the drastic reduction in domestic production, plus the looting by the Japanese, our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. A decrease in exports affects the balance of international payments. In addition, most of our military and civilian supplies rely on overseas, so the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese are doing their best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange market, the value of the currency has fallen by about 60-70%. When the value of the currency falls, the price of imported goods will inevitably rise even more sharply. Therefore, the monetary burden on the government and the people to purchase foreign goods is even greater. The amount of currency in circulation domestically must naturally increase.

(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the circulation of goods is smooth, then the extent to which the currency stimulates prices can still be reduced through the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese, and even if freight relies on foreign merchants, it cannot be handled with ease. Therefore, the situation of supply and demand imbalance is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.

(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transport, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort money along the way in the war zone, and now they are promoting their so-called "trade system." In addition, increases in freight, insurance, and domestic remittance rates are all strengthening the extent of the supply and demand imbalance and price increases.

These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of war. As long as the war exists for one day, there will be the possibility of rising for one day. We can offset the suffering of these high prices caused by the war with the harvest of ultimate victory. However, in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, hoarding, monopolies, and cornering the market. Moreover, these phenomena have a more fierce impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the proportion of speculative prices in the prices of various goods. However, we can just give an example to prove the extent to which they occupy the current price level.

(3) Speculative Prices at Price Levels

For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year. However, this time it was contrary to the usual practice, and it suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices was said to be that the Japanese army was buying up rice, so there was a risk of rice shortage in Shanghai, and everyone competed to hoard and purchase rice. It is certainly permissible to purchase rice to prevent shortages, but it is questionable why the rice price stopped rising after reaching the limit of 14 yuan. If there is really a risk of rice shortage, even under strong control, there will be a black market, just like the black market that occurred during the rice shortage last spring. Moreover, after the rice price rose to 14 yuan, why did the Japanese army no longer continue to buy it? If they said it was too expensive and would be at a loss to buy it, the Japanese army does not pay market prices when buying anything. Whether it is expensive or not is not related to whether or not they buy it. Later, it was heard that this rice price boom can be regarded as a grievance of the Shanghai rice merchants. Because now, except for the price of rice, which is still the same as before the war, other commodities have risen sharply.

One of the internal factors of the current high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. The price of rice is not affected by this, because it is a local product. However, cotton is also a local product. Why can't it be as stable as the price of rice? If it is said that it is for need, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than that for rice. If it is said that it is because of the control and harsh taxes of the Japanese puppets, rice has also been treated the same way. However, the current market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the six months before the war. The main reason for the rise in cotton prices, in addition to the actual reasons such as supply and demand, is that it is actually driven by the soaring yarn prices. Looking at January to April last year, yarn prices were constantly rising, while cotton prices showed alternating ups and downs. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year increased by 32.3% compared to January to August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January of this year, the yarn price increased by 52.9% compared to the average of the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44%. (See Table 6 of the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)

Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to the many reasons mentioned above, but the speculative component is even more relevant. Although many figures can be presented to prove the reduction in production and the destruction of production equipment, Shanghai is, after all, the place of origin of cotton yarn, and the supply is always easier than in other places. There is no reason in circulation for yarn prices to rise sharply. Moreover, it is a domestic product, and there is no currency impact. Shanghai yarn prices have a dominant position in national yarn prices. If its prices are indeed reasonable, then it cannot arbitrarily set high prices for sale by taking advantage of the needs of the interior. But it is because yarn prices in the interior are surprisingly high, that yarn prices in Shanghai are also raised as much as possible, so that the situation of getting more and more expensive has been created today. It should be known that taking advantage of needs to set high prices for sale is precisely one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.

We may as well compare it from other places. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. Due to material limitations, let's compare July of the 26th year of the Republic of China and August of the 27th year of the Republic of China.

Comparison of Price Indices between Shanghai and the Interior (Average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period)

(Note) The base period for Shanghai and Guangzhou was originally 1926. It has been recalculated to use the average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so that it can be compared with the Chongqing index, which is based on 1937. For materials, see the China and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.

Shanghai had already experienced war in the 26th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base period, the increase rate in Shanghai should theoretically be lower than that in the interior when comparing it with subsequent prices, but it is actually the opposite. The price of Shanghai in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, when it had changed from the front line to the rear, rose more sharply than that in the interior. The reason that Shanghai prices are based on the high prices in the interior is obviously untenable, and it proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more harmful than in other places.

(4) High Prices and Wartime Economy

Generally speaking, prices and the people's purchasing power are mutually causal. When prices rise, the people's income increases, and therefore the people's purchasing power also increases. If prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, the people's consumption will naturally decrease, and therefore prices will inevitably fall accordingly until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. However, this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and in fact it cannot be fully realized, because wages will never rise in the same proportion as prices. Therefore, high prices only weaken the people's purchasing power, and there is very little possibility of enhancing the people's purchasing power. Looking at the table below, the average wage of factory workers in Shanghai increased by only 1.8% in the 27th year compared to the 26th year. However, the living expenses of workers at this time had already increased by 29.4%. This is an obvious fact.

Comparison Table of Living Expenses and Wage Indices of Shanghai Workers

26th Year

27th Year

Living Expenses Index of Workers (3) 124.11 160.60

Wage Index of Factory Workers (2) 100.00 101.80

Purchasing Power of Currency (1) 80.57 62.27

(Note 1) Figures are based on the figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office.

(2) The wage index is calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" in the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Economic Statistics Research Institute, January issue of this year. Moreover, our country's production is extremely backward, and now it is in a period of war that is destroying all production equipment. Therefore, the rise in prices on the one hand reflects the sharp decline in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand strengthens the power of foreign goods to exploit our national wealth. In other words, it is sufficient to promote the collapse of our country's finances, currency system, and the entire national economy.

On the surface, the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in selling foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign raw materials and their product distributors, etc.) may also increase to some extent. From this, it creates a superficial prosperity in bank loan accounts. However, it can neither compensate for the loss of the monetary value of wealth and capital, nor can it compensate for the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.

In fact, the rise in domestic prices has now made the entire nation feel the harsh threat to their lives. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands, the result will be a danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the British loan to China to help balance foreign exchange, if we do not talk about political significance and analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its commodity market for exports to China." In other words, it is only because China's prices have already exceeded the purchasing power level of the general public, making their commodity market in China face another major obstacle in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in import prices in China. Moreover, the reason why we attach importance to this issue is not so much because of the current necessity, but rather because of the future, and we must plan ahead to prevent problems before they arise. Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is the impact of the war. Then, in the future when there is no hope of ending the war, that is, in the future when all the causes that stimulate soaring prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited boiling.

(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Prices

The National Government has long had the determination to control wartime prices. However, such control has not yet been successfully tested in European countries with highly organized economies. Germany's "appropriate price system," although praised by the world, has no room for imitation in China, whose economic organization is like a plate of loose sand. However, in fact, it is no longer allowed to let it go on like this for a long time, and if the speculative factors in prices can be eliminated, it can balance a lot. As long as all industries can have a clear conscience, the problem can be solved easily. Therefore, recently, it finally ordered the provincial and municipal governments to organize price-balancing committees in cooperation with provincial banks and local banks to implement balancing the prices of daily necessities for the people, and stipulated three standards for fair prices:

(1) For goods whose production and transportation costs have not been affected by the war or have been affected very little, the average price of one year or one year before the war shall be used as the standard.

(2) For goods whose production and transportation costs have been affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be used as the standard.

(3) For goods whose costs cannot be calculated, the total amount of capital required for their operation, plus a considerable profit, shall be used as the standard. It is also stipulated that the goods for balancing prices shall be limited to daily necessities.

The price-balancing committee is organized jointly by the local government, the provincial bank or local bank, and the commercial associations and guilds. Any factory, merchant, or private individual may report it to the court in accordance with the regulations on the administration of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce.

(1) The quantity of mutual buying and selling between the same industry shall not exceed the current quantity of inventory.

(2) Industries that do not operate daily necessities shall not buy and sell futures on the market with each other.

(3) The buying and selling of daily necessities shall not attempt to establish an exchange market.

However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the national economy and is the place where speculation is the most rampant and prices are rising the fastest, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area. Political power cannot play an active role. It is simply impossible to proceed if the people come out for self-government. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be relieved of undue exploitation and harsh oppression in prices depends only on whether the leaders of all industries can use their efforts to support this point.

Editorial

### Poland's Precarious Situation and England

Recent changes in Eastern Europe have brought us back to the situation before the fall of Czechoslovakia. The "Daily Mail" recently reported that Hitler had made several demands on Poland, with a deadline of fourteen days for a response. The main points of his demands are (1) ceding Danzig to Germany, (2) allowing Germany to build a military road from the German border through the Polish Corridor to reach East Prussia; (3) designating the area along the way as a special zone where Germans can enjoy extraterritoriality. This is tantamount to preparing to dismember Poland on the one hand, and stabbing Poland's heart with a sharp knife on the other. At the same time, in the past few days, Germany has also launched a propaganda campaign to desperately attack Poland, and falsely accused Poland of conspiring to annex East Prussia (a certain newspaper in Hamburg). Major cities on the German-Polish border have also mobilized large numbers of troops, preparing for action. When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, it used this tactic. No one dares to believe that Hitler will not relive his old dream, his sweet old dream.

People in Europe and the United States are very worried about Hitler's active advance into Eastern Europe. The speculations about his past atrocities have unfortunately been confirmed. Recently, the American "Intelligence Magazine" also speculated that the Axis countries will have a series of actions in mid-May. Democratic countries are also forced to respond with a tough attitude. The result is either the Axis countries retreat, or a world war breaks out. This prediction of a major turmoil in mid-May may refer to Hitler's attack on Poland. The situation Poland is in now is exactly the same as that of Czechoslovakia before it was dismembered and even annexed.

This situation is certainly tense and dangerous in Poland, but the democratic countries of England and France cannot take it lightly, because the beginning of this turmoil will not be able to achieve a temporary stability as it did after the fall of Czechoslovakia; or it will lead to even bigger incidents one after another. As revealed in an essay by William, a writer for "Greenwich Times": "The German General Staff has prepared a plan to send troops to land on the south coast of England and Wales Island unexpectedly." "Hitler also believes that if German troops can land on these two islands, they can conquer England in no more than four months of combat." Hitler's artillery is now aimed at England's chest. At the same time, Poland has learned from the pain of the fall of Czechoslovakia and is prepared to resist. Poland is also different from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia only had the guarantees of England and France at the time, while Poland today has close relations with the Soviet Union. The peace front in Eastern Europe has also taken the lead in developing a fairly sound foundation. If Hitler does not act, it is fine, but if he acts, the development of the situation will not be limited to a local solution.

Here, the attitude and determination of England and France are extremely important. England and France have always sought compromise with Germany and Italy, coveting a shaky peace. As we have speculated and pointed out in our daily editorials, it has completely failed. The question now is how to use effective methods to stop the aggressor. England's own military preparations and mobilization are very active, but its efforts to create a collective anti-aggression effort are still insufficient. Not only are the steps slow, but the attitude is also extremely ambiguous. England is also facing a stern warning from Japan, a henchman of Germany and Italy, in the Far East. England's position really requires a resolute and swift measure. The United States, also in view of the turbulence of the world situation and the deepening crisis, is preparing to revise its mobilization plan so that it can mobilize one million people within three months to deal with sudden changes in the situation. This is a favorable condition for England to deal with the situation in the Far East. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's guarantee of assistance to small countries in Eastern Europe is also gradually becoming a reality, which is a powerful help for England to deal with the problems in Europe. It is reported that Europe will prioritize the formation of a joint front of thirteen countries in the near future. We hope that England will actively promote this favorable situation!

### Aftermath of Bombing: Chongqing Devastated, Chiang Kai-shek Inspects Disaster Area, Public and Private Vehicles Requisitioned for Urgent Evacuation, Rescue Efforts Remain Intense

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The city has been subjected to relentless bombing by enemy aircraft in recent days, resulting in casualties and displacement of citizens. The President [Chiang Kai-shek] has expressed deep concern and took the opportunity of yesterday's (5th) Fifth-Fifth Anniversary Commemoration to encourage all Party, government, and military personnel to diligently engage in the evacuation and relief of refugees. After the commemoration, he convened a meeting with leaders of Party, government, and military organs to discuss mobilizing manpower and resources to implement emergency measures. It was decided that: (1) firebreaks should be opened and implemented promptly; (2) all public and private vehicles and ships should be concentrated to transport refugees; (3) the government should quickly allocate substantial funds to handle all rescue and relief matters; (4) all staff members of Party, government, and military organs above the rank of recommendation and appointment, and military officers above the rank of school officer, should donate at least one month's salary to aid refugees; (5) all city personnel, members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, civil servants, and various soldiers should be mobilized to assist in protection and relief work. The President designated Chief of Staff He Yingqin to be fully responsible for directing all matters. Chief of Staff He then conferred with relevant heads of organs and decided on multiple measures, with particular urgency placed on transporting the elderly, weak, women, and children out of the city. It was decided to control all public and private ships and vehicles for free transport. All related cars were mobilized. Personnel were dispatched to take care of refugee gathering points.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] After yesterday's intense bombing by Japanese aircraft, densely populated areas were reduced to ashes. Two hundred thousand city residents fled the urban area overnight, seeking refuge in the countryside. The city, which had been vibrant just days ago, has now become a wasteland of rubble, sparsely populated and filled with desolation. Water, electricity, lights, and telephones in the city have been cut off. This morning, newspapers only managed to publish small-sized extras twice. The Central News Agency headquarters was completely destroyed. Director Li Heyuan suffered serious injuries and Business Director Li Yaoqing was also severely injured and in critical condition. President of Central News Agency, Xiao Tongzi, and Editor-in-Chief, Chen Bosheng, were working in the office during the bombing but fortunately escaped unharmed. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife inspected the bombed areas twice last night and this morning. After his inspection last night, Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the requisition of public and private cars and trucks to quickly transport people to the countryside. All city vehicles were gathered at designated locations this morning. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally supervised the evacuation of child refugees. The evacuation of women and children from the city continued throughout the day and will continue until everyone is safely relocated. Those carrying out relief efforts were extremely busy today, distributing water and food along the evacuation routes to the countryside and making arrangements for housing. The Generalissimo ordered all city newspapers to cease publication last night, concentrating efforts on publishing a joint publication. A Reuters reporter personally inspected the bombed areas last night. Most streets were congested with evacuees, corpse carriers, firefighters, and civil defense volunteers, making passage difficult. The German Embassy was threatened by fire twice, but was fortunately extinguished and escaped damage. German Embassy officials told reporters that they witnessed over a hundred women and children being burned to death. The fire spread, forcing these women and children against the high walls of the German Embassy. As the fire approached, they were terrified but unable to escape and were eventually engulfed by the flames. The fires in the main streets of Chongqing, which started last night, were still burning this afternoon. The Central News Agency headquarters was in great danger. Due to the extensive fires and inconvenient water supply, firefighters faced extreme difficulties. It is reported that the British diplomatic mission and the British Consulate are considering relocating to the south bank of the Yangtze River because the consulate has been severely damaged. Semi-official sources have not confirmed this information. At the same time, unconfirmed reports indicate that the French Consulate was also bombed.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Thirty-six Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing yesterday, causing approximately 800 to 1,000 casualties. One Japanese aircraft was shot down. The Japanese planes attacked in two groups of eighteen each, focusing their bombing on military organs. However, the military organs had already been relocated, and the bombs hit surrounding civilian residences, causing hundreds of casualties. Half of Chongqing's urban area has lost its electricity supply, and telephone services are also disrupted. Thousands of homeless refugees are sleeping on the streets. The other half of the city still has lights and is living normally. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, witnessed the air raid yesterday.

British Ambassador's Remarks

Expresses Deep Sympathy for Our Civilian Casualties, Greatly Surprised by Bombing of British Consulate

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] It has been learned that Chongqing's only radio station has been destroyed, and the Central News Agency has also been hit and suffered significant damage. It is generally estimated that 25 Chinese sheltering in the grounds of the British Consulate were killed and 50 were injured. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's secretary, Hatherly, was slightly injured by falling debris while assisting in the rescue of the injured. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr told a "New York Times" reporter in Chongqing that he was shocked by the bombing of the British Consulate grounds and said, "The Chinese who died on the Consulate's lawn as a result of the bombing will forever remain in my heart. Yesterday afternoon, they requested refuge on the grounds, and I ordered the gates to be opened to accommodate them."

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] According to reliable sources in Chongqing, British Ambassador’s Secretary Hatherly was injured by falling debris during yesterday's Japanese air raid and has been sent to the British warship "Eagle" for treatment. The situation in Chongqing is chaotic after yesterday's bombing. This information has not yet been confirmed.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] The British Embassy here has just received a message from Chongqing stating that the British Consulate in Chongqing and the nearby residence of the British Vice-Consul were bombed by Japanese aircraft yesterday, causing significant damage. British Ambassador's Secretary Hatherly was also slightly injured.

Preposterous Statement

Attempts to Shirk Responsibility for Bombing British and French Consulates, Foreign Properties Will No Longer Be Respected in the Future

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] A Japanese spokesperson announced today that from now on, Japan will not be responsible for any damage to foreign properties and embassies during bombings in various parts of China. They stated that Japanese pilots have been ordered to bomb any location in China without regard for foreign properties and therefore hope that foreigners will stay away from Chinese territory. They expressed regret for the damage to various consulates during the bombing of Chongqing yesterday but claimed that the pilots had seen anti-aircraft guns near the consulates.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Japanese officials issued a statement regarding yesterday's air raid on Chongqing, stating that "During the Japanese bombing, fifty anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns near the British, French, and German consulates in western Chongqing fiercely attacked, causing the Japanese aircraft to change their original targets and bomb the locations where anti-aircraft guns were installed. These locations were very close to the foreign consulates, so some bombs may have fallen near the consulates." A Japanese spokesperson met with reporters this afternoon and, in response to questions, said that Japanese air force pilots had been ordered to avoid "unnecessary" damage to foreign property, but in necessary situations, pilots could independently decide to act. For self-defense, the risk of damaging foreign property was unavoidable. For example, foreign property was damaged during yesterday's air raid on Chongqing, and the Japanese pilots were unaware of it, which is deeply regrettable. However, given that Japanese aircraft were attacked near foreign consulates, this was unavoidable.

### Chongqing After the Bombing: Black Smoke Fills the Sky, Flames Everywhere, Corpses Litter the Ground, a Grim Sight - Eyewitness Account by Associated Press Reporter

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 5th] China's wartime capital has now become a slaughterhouse for three thousand innocent people. The ferocity of yesterday's brutal Japanese bombing was unprecedented. The city's wooden buildings were engulfed in seven major fires, mostly reduced to ashes. Compared to the fires in Guangzhou and Wuhan, this is far more severe. Although Chinese warplanes densely intercepted in the sky, and the mountains around the city were filled with anti-aircraft gun positions, with intense artillery fire, thirty-two of the thirty-eight Japanese aircraft that attacked from Hankou still managed to penetrate the city's airspace and carry out a second major massacre within forty-eight hours. Within a short time, the enemy aircraft dropped more than a hundred bombs, with light and heavy incendiary bombs raining down on densely populated areas. Roads and buildings throughout the city immediately caught fire and spread. Cluster bombs, five hundred times the weight of incendiary bombs, were then dropped in rapid succession. The sound of explosions was continuous, shaking the earth. The dead, wounded, and buried alive numbered in the hundreds and thousands. After the Japanese planes left, the remaining survivors rose up and made every effort to assist in rescue efforts. There were seven major fires in the city, with black smoke rising into the sky and flames spreading in all directions. There was no running water here, and no pumps to draw water from the Yangtze River for rescue. Fortunately, the people were able to volunteer, each carrying buckets of water and passing them along to carry out the extinguishing. Although it was a drop in the bucket, it was still a great help. The American Church Hospital, Canadian Church, and schools were all destroyed by the fire. Fortunately, foreign missionaries escaped safely. As the reporter walked through the streets, he saw the fire blazing in the sky, and the cries shaking the wilderness. Among them, the fire in the central district was the most intense, spreading and expanding day and night, and it still hadn't been extinguished by this morning. Unofficial estimates put the number of victims at three thousand, which is the highest casualty toll in the history of bombing. The deaths and injuries of children were particularly tragic. The reporter saw one family with eight children, all of whom had died. Fortunately, all foreigners were safe, with only the representative of China National Aviation Corporation, Mr. Fan Qu, slightly injured. Mr. Fan lived in a Chinese hotel, which was hit by a bomb and then burned down. Foreign pilots of CNAC also lived there, but had been evacuated in advance. The reporter visited the hospital at night and saw bloodstains everywhere. Chinese and foreign doctors were competing to carry out rescue work, not stopping all night, but the dead were still carried out one after another, incalculable. The number of deaths in the commercial area was even more horrific. In an area one and a half miles long and five hundred yards wide, corpses were laid out, a sight too tragic to bear. Thanks to the heroic rescue efforts of firefighters and volunteers, most of the fires were contained, with only two fires remaining, still posing a threat, but they were also gradually being brought under control. Thousands of coolies were demolishing houses around the fires to prevent them from spreading. The Chinese side announced that one Japanese aircraft had been shot down. Part of the Central News Agency's headquarters was also bombed. The British and French consulates were both bombed. The British Ambassador was in the consulate and was fortunately safe. The German Embassy was once threatened by fire, but was rescued by firefighters and not affected.

### The Japanese Scheme Encompasses Resources in Central China, Disregarding British Railway Investment, Issuing Counterfeit Currency to Disrupt Our Finances

Railway Company

[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the "China Press," the two major transportation and financial enterprises jointly operated by "China and Japan," namely the Central China Railway Company and the Huaxing Commercial Bank, are scheduled to be established in Shanghai on the 30th and 1st of this month. Each has a capital of 50 million yuan. The Railway Company is an affiliated organ of the Central China Development Company, which will manage 800 kilometers of railways in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River on behalf of the "Reformed Government," including the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Beijing-Wuhu, and Songhu lines. These Chinese state-owned railways have now been handed over to the "Reformed Government." The company will also manage public car lines between various cities. Regarding the foreign debt problem of the various railway lines in which Britain has made significant investments, it will not be involved with the company because it is only an agent for managing the railways. The Central China Development Company will invest 25 million yuan in kind, with the first payment of 7.64 million yuan. Of the 25 million yuan in cash, the "Reformed Government" will contribute 10 million yuan, the Central China Development Company 6.5 million yuan, and the public 8.5 million yuan. A quarter of the cash will be paid when the company is established. The manager of the various railway lines is currently the Japanese Army Railway Department, but the company will take over management from tomorrow. The current fee rates will not be changed.

Huaxing Bank

The Huaxing Bank, initiated by the Japanese side, has been brewing for some time and is reportedly about to be established. The authorized capital is said to be 50 million yuan. The puppet "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks jointly invest in the bank, with the puppet "Reformed Government" contributing 25 million yuan and six Japanese banks (Industrial Bank of Japan, Bank of Chosen, Mitsubishi, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui, and Sumitomo) contributing 25 million yuan. The founding meeting is scheduled for 11:00 AM on May 1st at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. It is internally decided that Chen Jintao will concurrently serve as chairman of the board, and there will be an equal number of Japanese and Chinese standing directors. It is said that Shen Erchang, Zhou Wenrui, and others will be Chinese standing directors. The position of general manager is still being contested. The head office will be located in Shanghai, north of Suzhou Creek. It is said that No. 2 Baole'an Road has been selected. The collection and disbursement south of Suzhou Creek will be handled by Yokohama Specie Bank. The bank's goal is to disrupt Chinese finances, so it will also issue counterfeit currency, reportedly in denominations of ten yuan, five yuan, two jiao, and one jiao, and actively promote it within its controlled areas. On the one hand, it will set the price for exchanging the counterfeit currency for foreign exchange in an attempt to compete with legal tender, but in fact, because of the strong belief in legal tender by the Chinese and foreign people, this counterfeit currency will only become worthless paper after the "North China Joint Reserve Bank notes."

### Johnson's Broadcast Speech in America

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] The American Ambassador to China, Nelson T. Johnson, is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech at 10:00 PM (Shanghai time) tonight at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco.

### Shanghai International Settlement Inspects News, Our Press Faces Increasingly Difficult Environment Under Enemy Military Pressure

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] The Shanghai International Settlement Police Department has informed all Chinese newspapers that certain types of news must be submitted for inspection and can only be published after approval. If this is not followed, the newspaper's registration will be revoked, and its publication will be suspended. The news that must be inspected includes any speeches or declarations regarding the current war.

### Modern Mulan - Tang Guilin

By Cao Juren

[Jiangshan Correspondence] The story of Tang Guilin, a woman from Hunan who disguised herself as a man to join the army and spent eight years on the battlefield, has been widely circulated. Many people want to know the details. When I sent a telegram from southern Anhui last time, Tang was still in Yushan, eastern Zhejiang, and I missed the opportunity to interview her. I came to Jiangshan from southern Anhui specifically to interview her, but she had already left Zhejiang and gone to Anhui to work with the army. The person was far away, and I was very disappointed. So I visited former subordinates of the ×× Division and ×× Regiment and collected some side materials to make a brief description first.

"Ms. Tang's speech has a Xiangxi accent. We are not very clear about her family background. She was only in the ×× Division for one year. When our division was being reorganized in Hunan ××, she and some other soldiers belonging to the ×× Division were transferred together. Most of her military life was in the predecessor of the ×× Division - the ×××× Regiment. She is very tall, and her skin is not very fair, which may be because she has been on the battlefield for too long, and the wind and dust have blown her."

The above fragments of answers gave the reporter a rough outline of a female soldier. The reporter also formulated several simple questions for further search.

Reporter: "Did anyone suspect her behavior?"

Mr. Chen: "Who would have thought that a woman would dress as a man? That's something in novels. War is not a joke. She walks so big strides, so fast. Who would have had any other thoughts?"

Mr. Xu: "Her eyes are very beautiful."

Mr. Chen: "You know she is a woman, so naturally you think she is beautiful. But it's also strange, since she was discovered to be a woman, she has become shy. She no longer serves as a soldier but has gone to be a nurse."

Reporter: "How was she discovered this time?"

Mr. Chen: "The squad leader in her platoon insisted on inviting her to take a bath. She always refused and quarreled with the squad leader. With a quarrel, she revealed her secret."

Reporter: "I heard that she was wounded in the battle of Dongguling. How could even the doctors and nurses not see it?"

Mr. Chen: "She was injured in the ankle. I heard that she was dressed as a boy since she was a child. Her parents only raised her alone and treated her as a boy. She said that she herself had long forgotten that she was a woman."

Reporter: "She is really brave!"

Mr. Xu: "They say that she is very calm when fighting and is a very good machine gun shooter. In the battle of Dongguling, the enemy's artillery fire was really fierce. Those hills were fought over and over again, I don't know how many times. Ms. Tang charged several times until she was wounded and came down. If she hadn't revealed her true identity this time, she would have been promoted to squad leader."

These are just indirect materials. A more detailed description will have to wait for the reporter to visit directly. (Central News Agency)

### Tongpu Railway Intercepted by Our Forces, Our Army Achieves Repeated Victories in Southern Shanxi

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] The enemy is rushing to repair the highway from Heshun to Xiren Village (southwest of the city). On the 28th, about 300 enemies harassed Dongxiya near Heshun. Our forces divided and repelled them.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] Many people returned from northeastern Shanxi at the end of the month. Linfen is heavily guarded. After the Tongpu Railway was cut off by our forces, the enemy transported by road along the Fen River. On the 1st and 2nd, more than ten enemy cars went south, carrying supplies and ammunition, and more than ten cars went north, carrying corpses and damaged aircraft.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] Our army is still continuing to expand the destruction work on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. At 8:00 PM on the 1st, more than ten miles of railway were destroyed in Nanpojien, south of Zhaocheng. At noon on the 2nd, a unit of our army went directly from Nanyidian near Beizhaocheng to Culuqian, and another unit destroyed more than three miles of railway near Zhanglichegu, east of Gucheng (north of Fencheng).

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 4th] At dawn on the 2nd, the enemy artillery in Houwang Duancun (east of Anyi) fiercely bombarded our positions. Then the enemy in Duancun advanced with infantry of four or five hundred in force from Guanzhuang, Podiyao, Zhangguodian, and other places. About 200 enemies in Houwang attacked Junjialing from Liyaotou. Our army is meeting them on separate roads. At the same time, more than a hundred enemies, covering more than twenty carts and seventy or eighty pack horses, transported food and ammunition from Shangchao Village (east of Anyi) to Houwang. They were intercepted by our army. The enemy fired many poison gas bombs. Twenty or thirty of our troops were poisoned.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] On the morning of the 2nd, our army launched a three-pronged attack on more than 300 enemies in Heilongguan, Jiegouli, and Dongangouli. Another part attacked Songjiafen, north of Zhougouyu, west of Heilongguan. The battles were fierce on all roads. The enemy near Angouli fired a large number of gas bombs. After our officers and soldiers fought bravely, the enemy fled back to Heilongguan in the afternoon.

[Minge News Agency, Hequ, 25th] The remnants of the enemy in the Bajiaobao area, northwest of Shenchi City, have been cleared by our army. Our army is now advancing towards Shenchi City. Since the beginning of the month, there have been no fierce battles near Pian Pass. Our army and the enemy are facing each other. It is also said that our two units advanced to the south gate of Pian Pass last month and rushed into the city. The enemy retreated to the east and west hills and stubbornly resisted. The two sides fought hand-to-hand several times. In this battle, more than 200 enemies were killed, and we only suffered dozens of casualties.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 5th] On the 30th of last month, a unit of our guerrilla team, taking advantage of the strong wind, cooperated with the local self-defense team to thoroughly excavate more than ten miles of the Chelu Road between Sengnian Baiyinmen in Fenxi and Sengnian in Fenxi. The telephone poles along the road were also knocked down. Our armed scouts rushed into Sengnian Village, destroyed the puppet maintenance committee, and seized many enemy puppet documents.

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] Enemy aircraft have been wantonly wreaking havoc in various counties in southeastern Shanxi in recent days. On the 30th, three enemy aircraft dropped a bomb in Chengxin Village, with no losses. More than ten bombs were dropped near Chengguan, destroying more than twenty civilian houses and injuring three people. At 9:00 AM on the same morning, seven enemy aircraft dropped twenty-seven bombs in the villages south of Changzhi, killing and injuring seven people and destroying more than thirty houses. Also, at 9:00 AM one day, two enemy aircraft dropped more than twenty bombs in Lingchuan County, injuring six or seven people and destroying more than ten houses.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 5th] The enemy in Yicheng continued to reinforce, but was intercepted by our army from time to time. The fighting was fierce. At the moment, most of the enemy in that area is fleeing back to Quwo, and our army is pursuing them.

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] In the previous battle of Zikou in central Shanxi, the residents within a radius of tens of miles of the town all strictly implemented clearing the fields, practiced thrift, hid all utensils, filled all the wells, and the old and young, men and women, all moved far away. The enemy arrived as if entering a desert wasteland, and food and lodging were extremely difficult. The enemy who invaded southeastern Shanxi was defeated by our army in one fell swoop. At the moment, the remnant enemies entrenched in Zikou are also wavering. Our various units are stepping up their siege and can be completely eliminated in the short term.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 5th] On the 18th and 19th of last month, our unit killed 100 enemies in the battle of Luohan Wangmu in Fenxi. After hearing the news, the nearby residents sent food and tea to comfort them dozens of times a day. The unit specifically held a victory celebration and memorial meeting, with a total of a thousand people attending, including the families of martyrs and the people of the enemy-occupied area. Women, children, and representatives of the martyrs' families competed to give speeches on the spot. The mood at the meeting was extremely sad. After four hours, it ended satisfactorily. That night, the play "The Great Battle of Luohan" was performed to inspire morale.

### 波外長演說表明談判原則　正式答覆德備忘錄　但澤地位不容改易

[Reuters, Warsaw, 5th] Polish Foreign Minister Beck delivered a speech to the parliament this morning that the world had been eagerly awaiting, in response to Hitler's speech. He stated, "The weakening of international organizations has, in recent months, affected Poland's borders, leading to extremely serious events. First, regarding the agreement between Poland and Britain, neither country has any intention of aggression, but is determined to uphold certain fundamental international principles. Hitler has used the British-Polish agreement as an excuse to abolish the German-Polish non-aggression pact. Germany did not consult with Britain or Poland beforehand and arbitrarily abandoned the treaty. Since my return from London, I have invited the German ambassador to meet, but he has not yet accepted the invitation. If Germany interprets the German-Polish pact as a means to isolate Poland, then Poland must reject such an interpretation. As for Danzig, although there is a large German population, its prosperity relies on Poland. We are determined to protect our rights and Danzig's overseas trade and tariff policies. Regarding the Polish Corridor, we have proposed expanding existing road transport facilities, but we have no reason to restrict our sovereignty within our own territory. Hitler's recent speech regarding a fifteen-year non-aggression treaty was not submitted to Poland in any concrete way. True peace must have two conditions: (1) the intention for peace, and (2) methods for peaceful action. If Germany adheres to these two principles, then the issues I have raised can be negotiated. Once negotiations begin, Poland will not lack sincerity. As for peace at any price, we do not know it. Politicians in London are familiar with European political issues and have shown a good attitude towards Poland, enabling me to present various important issues for frank discussion. I hope the public understands this point. Poland's response to the German memorandum will be delivered to Germany today. I would like to further clarify the status of the Free City of Danzig. It was not invented by the Treaty of Versailles. German merchants in Danzig are guaranteed to develop and prosper in the city. Poland's overseas trade allows Danzig to thrive. Danzig is located at the mouth of Poland's only major river. Its current position is a key waterway and railway line connecting Poland to the Baltic Sea. This is a definite fact that cannot be changed by any agreement. Poland has never attempted to implement any liberal, idealistic, or cultural development to influence the Germans in the Free City of Danzig. We want to ask whether the current issue is about the freedom of the Germans in Danzig or about isolating Poland from the Baltic Sea. We will never allow ourselves to be isolated."

[Reuters, Warsaw, 4th] The Polish Parliament will convene tomorrow at 11:00 AM to hear Foreign Minister Beck's response to Hitler's speech. Beck is scheduled to begin his speech at 11:15 AM, which will be broadcast nationwide in Poland and re-broadcast to the United States. It will also be broadcast in English, French, and German.

France Decides to Act Consistently with Poland, German Troops Head North

[Reuters, London, 4th] Europe awaits Beck's speech tomorrow with the same eagerness as they usually await speeches from Chamberlain or Hitler. Authoritative sources in Paris and Berlin have commented on it in advance. France has emphasized that it has decided to act consistently with Poland, and Poland will be the sole judge of whether its major interests have been affected. The French cabinet will meet on the morning of the 6th. Berlin's "People's Observer" published an article by Goebbels, stating that Poland's demands are intolerable and criticizing Britain's support for Poland. It is believed that Ribbentrop will discuss Beck's speech with Hitler before visiting Ciano tomorrow evening.

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Official sources say that there is no concrete resolution or development resulting from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy, but discussions between Germany and Italy on the status of Danzig, Poland, and Yugoslavia are of great importance.

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] German stormtroopers, army units, assault tank units, and several heavy artillery units are all departing from Munich and heading north. Only a very small number of troops remain in the town. Officials claim that this military action has no special significance.

### 美擴充海軍　李海要求加速完成建主力艦對抗日本

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] U.S. Navy tactical director Admiral Leahy solemnly declared before the House Appropriations Committee today that, given the possibility of an imminent international turmoil, the U.S. Navy's expansion program must be completed at an accelerated pace. He paid particular attention to the future plans of Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is said that Japan has already begun building three 42,000 to 46,000-ton battleships, so the United States, to maintain balance, must immediately begin building the proposed 45,000-ton battleships this year. The construction costs of the U.S. battleships are included in the Navy's budget of $770 million, which includes the construction of two 45,000-ton battleships and 21 other warships, as well as 500 aircraft. The new battleships are scheduled to be launched in 1943, costing $93 million each, and will be equipped with 16-inch heavy guns. The Appropriations Committee passed the budget, but decided to reject the request for funds to begin building U.S. naval air bases on Pacific islands (Wake, Midway, Palmyra, Johnston), but approved funds for building air and naval bases in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Florida, and Oregon.

### 日本缺鋼　造艦受阻礙

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The Department of Commerce recently announced that Japan is currently lacking steel and other metals, greatly hindering its shipbuilding plans. Kobe U.S. Vice Consul Affeld stated that, according to general estimates, Japan needs 7.5 million tons of iron ore this year, while its domestic production is only 2.6 million tons.

### 英向日抗議　要求釋放英輪

[Reuters, London, 4th] Regarding the case of the British "Saygel" being detained by the Japanese on April 8, British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Britain has protested to the Japanese naval authorities in China and the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, demanding the release of the ship.

### 德意日締結　軍事同盟說　德万巳予否認　日本拒絕批評

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th] Rumors are circulating that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently negotiating a military alliance treaty. Responsible officials here have denied this. According to sources in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita did meet with the German and Italian ambassadors to discuss the European situation, intending to obtain accurate information from the most reliable sources. Japan's concern about the European situation is natural.

Japanese Cabinet Discusses European Situation

[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita reported on the European situation at the cabinet meeting this morning. When a Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked by Japanese reporters this morning to explain the policies Japan is adopting regarding the European situation, the spokesman refused to comment on the rumors of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and stated that Japan has its own independent foreign policy. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have repeatedly stated that this policy is not hostile to democratic countries or totalitarian groups, and its sole purpose is to maintain and promote friendly relations with all foreign countries.

### 直布羅陀總督　訪法屬摩洛哥司令

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 4th] The Governor of Gibraltar, General Arun Se, is currently visiting the commander of French Morocco. The commander-in-chief of the British forces in Gibraltar has been appointed as the acting governor.

### 蘇聯將回復　孤立政策　以自力迎擊打擊者　易外長係對英警告

[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] Officials here still refuse to comment on Litvinov's resignation. Foreign officials are also tight-lipped. The announcement of Litvinov's resignation was only published in a very small space on the back page of the newspaper, while Molotov's succession was published prominently on the front page as a government order.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] The sudden resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister has caused shock in diplomatic circles here. Their first impression is that this is a victory for Soviet isolationists, who have always opposed Litvinov's policy of cooperation with Western European countries. When reporters asked the Soviet Ambassador to Britain about this news at a dinner hosted by the China Association, he refused to comment. Other Soviet sources also declined to explain. However, it was speculated by Soviet sources a few days ago that if Britain and France refused to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would suspend these negotiations. Therefore, it is generally believed that these Soviet isolationists, including military commissioners, believe that if Britain and France do not support anti-aggression actions in Europe, the Soviet Union should retreat within the Soviet borders to prepare to strike directly at those who attack the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Newspapers here are still constantly speculating on the reasons for Litvinov's resignation, but "The Times," "News Chronicle," and "Daily Herald" all stated that British-Soviet negotiations and Soviet foreign policy will not be affected.

[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] Observers in political circles here believe that Litvinov's resignation is due to his constant compromising attitude with Britain. They believe that since the military mutual assistance agreement between France, Poland, and the Soviet Union failed to materialize, the Soviet authorities have decided to change their diplomatic stance and return to their original isolation policy.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] The "Times" here announced today that Litvinov was pro-British. This time, the Soviet government dismissed him as a warning to Britain for its hesitation to sign a British-Soviet alliance. This move can be seen as a diplomatic strategy, not necessarily a change in policy. "News" stated that Molotov's replacement of Litvinov indicates that Stalin will personally take charge of foreign policy.

### 德與拉達維亞　同意訂不侵約　與愛沙尼亞談判中

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It was officially announced that Germany and Latvia have agreed to conclude a non-aggression treaty. Germany and Estonia are also conducting negotiations of the same nature.

### 歐局發展　美密切注意

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] There are widespread rumors that President Roosevelt may have new diplomatic initiatives after Hitler rejected his peace telegram, and may make another speech. However, according to people close to the President, the President believes that the current international situation has become slightly more stable, so he does not intend to take further action. However, the U.S. government is closely monitoring the development of the situation.

### 英徵兵法案　提出下院二讀　張伯倫聲明政府決心　艾登演說贊成新兵制

[Reuters, London, 4th] Chamberlain presented the Military Training Bill for its second reading in the House of Commons today and gave a general explanation, stating that, according to the bill, 200,000 people can be obtained this year, and approximately 800,000 people within three years. After reviewing the evidence presented throughout the country, the government's carefully considered proposal to eliminate the public's fear and suspicion of conscription has been successful. There is no doubt that the British people's resolute determination to fulfill their responsibilities has gained great admiration from European countries. Even for those who oppose it, this measure is very different from the previous Great War. This conscription method does not involve sending recruits to serve abroad or dig trenches for combat, but is limited to a short period of compulsory military training. The government is willing to respect the doubts expressed by individual consciences and will not punish them even if such psychology exists. During the initial six-month period of service, each person will receive a salary of one shilling per day, regardless of position or team type, which will be the same across the board, without increase or decrease, and will be paid on time. Their salary will be determined separately after entering the supplementary service. As for those who are absolutely responsible for their families, they will receive seventeen shillings per week; those who are partially responsible will receive twelve shillings per week; their wives will receive seventeen shillings per week, and children will receive additional grants. The government has specifically reduced the minimum age for receiving this treatment to 20 years old. The bill does not apply to Northern Ireland, and the government will amend it before implementation. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has entrusted the right of decision to the British government to avoid misunderstandings. To show appreciation for Northern Ireland's patriotism, a light tank team of armored vehicles will be established as a supplementary reserve system. Chamberlain concluded by saying, "The sooner this bill is passed, the sooner the country's security can be guaranteed, and the greater the impact it will have on European countries." Opposition Labor Party member Smith proposed an amendment, the main reason being "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut," meaning that there is no need to carry out such a major action. Opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair also expressed support for the voluntary conscription system. Eden also stood up and spoke, stating amid applause from the entire house that although the voluntary conscription system has not been completely abandoned, the government has now adopted another new principle, which is a matter of fact, but no one dares to deprive the freedom of national service. It is absurd to say that the implementation of the conscription system is the first step towards Britain's slide into totalitarianism. Even if the government has such a tendency, the House of Commons can immediately stop it. In short, without the strong support of the people, Britain will never have any form of compulsory military service. Labor Minister Brown stated that it is incorrect to say that voluntary registration for service will end after the conscription bill is introduced. He cited statistics to show that the number of people voluntarily registering for service in the weeks since the conscription bill was introduced has not decreased, and said that the impact of the bill on the European situation is more profound than any other event in recent weeks.

### 國際現勢縱橫談

— 廖崇聖

The author, Mr. Liao Chongsheng, is a former professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University's College of Agriculture and the Lingnan University's College of Commerce, and a specialist member of the Guangxi Provincial Government's Economic Commission. The purpose of writing this article is to reflect the optimism of our country's prospects for the War of Resistance through a comprehensive analysis of the recent international situation. The content is substantial, and the exploration of the United States' economic resources, foreign diplomatic trends, and presidential powers is particularly detailed. It is specially introduced here for reference by those who study international relations.

I. Introduction

Czechoslovakia is gone, and international order and treaty dignity have been swept away. Is this only the misfortune of small and weak nations? Or is it a strange shame of modern civilization! However, the evolution of human groups always comes from painful experiences. The sacrifice of Czechoslovakia is not without considerable cost. The director of this tragedy, and the key to the European situation, the British authorities, have suffered this blow and have painfully realized their past mistakes. They are determined to work together with democratic countries to curb the further spread of the tide of aggression. Now, the independence of Poland, Romania, and Greece has been guaranteed by declarations from Britain and France, and cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is under active negotiation. For a time, the situation in Western Europe, especially in the Mediterranean, has become more urgent. Is this the eve of a great war? Or is it the dying light of dictators? What are the reactions of the Soviet Union and the United States, which are of paramount importance? How should our country make use of this opportunity? I would like to offer my humble opinion.

II. A General Review of the United States' Strength and Diplomatic Trends

When interviewing Mr. Sinclair, a member of the British Labor Party, about questions regarding war against Japan and the implementation of economic sanctions, Mr. Sinclair repeatedly answered "it depends on the attitude of the United States." In fact, the sudden shift in Britain's anti-aggression attitude is also strongly influenced by the encouragement of American public opinion and substance. Its impact is not limited to a corner of the Far East. How can the United States, far across the ocean, be a factor of paramount importance in world politics? Let us examine its strength and diplomatic trends to get to the bottom of it.

From the standpoint of national defense, the strength of a country is always judged by the degree of development of its heavy industries and the abundance of its economic resources. The scale of the United States' heavy industry is huge, the equipment is reasonable, and the production capacity is high. Not only can European powers not hope to reach its level, but its economic resources are also unmatched by other countries. According to a comparison of the production status of various countries in 1937, the production capacity of American pig iron can reach 72 million tons per year, and if the environment requires it, it can be expanded to more than 100 million tons per year within two years. Although other powers have actively expanded their military in recent years, their total annual production is only 76 million tons. The difference in the manufacture of motorcycles is even more astonishing. Although American automobile factories were closed due to labor unrest this year, their output was still no less than 5 million vehicles; while the combined output of all other countries in the world was only 1.3 million vehicles. As for the production of kerosene, the powers have no comparison. The United States and South America combined account for 77% of global production. In addition, it is estimated that 60% of the world's gold coins are controlled by the country. Steel is the foundation of industry and military construction; automobiles are the backbone of mechanized infantry; kerosene is the blood of modern weapons; spot goods are the most effective weapon to control the financial market. Now, with the power of one country, either equal to the world, or even superior to it, its role as the key to world peace is obvious.

What's more, the aggressive countries of today rely more and more on the United States as they strive for military and economic self-sufficiency. In recent years, the export of American agricultural products has decreased by 60% compared with the average export volume from 1926 to 1930 (the golden age of American commerce). However, the export of mechanical raw materials related to military expansion has increased dramatically. For example, in 1937, the export of its trucks was three times that of the golden age of commerce in the past (that is, the average from 1926 to 1930); aircraft were more than eight times; raw oil was three times, scrap iron was sixteen times; and steel products also exceeded the golden age by 77%. In addition, electrical equipment, chemical industrial products, and all other industrial machinery have increased sharply compared to before. The main customers are Britain, the Soviet Union, and the three major aggressive countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan. From this, we can see that the United States, with its economic weapons alone, is enough to control the fate of the aggressors with ease.

American public opinion on the fascist group has always been opposed to it due to the fundamental divergence in political ideology, and the constant encouragement and cultivation of President Roosevelt's far-sighted vision. Not only has it always been opposed to it, but its aversion has grown deeper. However, the executive authorities are hindered by the obstruction of the isolationist faction, and also suffer from the many constraints of the legislative branch. In addition to verbal attacks, there is a lack of positive or actionable achievements. What is gratifying is that this dull situation has recently shown signs of gradually breaking down. President Roosevelt, who is both wise and intelligent, has resolutely decided, within the scope of the powers conferred on him by the Constitution, to give the aggressors a de facto blow.

### The Problem of Women's Pathways

Starting from a Perplexed Woman

Today, our newspaper's Hong Kong news section published an article by Qi Zhuo titled "She Donated Blood, and Fainted!" This record contains a current issue regarding women's pathways. We believe this is a serious social problem, and it is very important to the future of resistance and nation-building.

Ms. Cen is the daughter of a wealthy family with six mothers. She has always been confined within the feudal cage. However, the tide of the times and the call for national liberation have finally stirred her up. She serves the country and society at the wartime children's school of the Guangzhou YMCA. However, since the iron hooves of the invaders trampled on our sacred revolutionary city, she lost the opportunity to serve. Government agencies and national salvation organizations did not pay attention to her, so she became a lost lamb, looking around blankly, unable to find a job, seeing only the darkness and sin that made her feel painful and angry! Her enthusiasm had nowhere to go, and she fainted in front of the public during an impassioned speech.

In fact, looking around, there are countless women who are filled with enthusiasm but cannot serve the country and society or fight for their own freedom. It's not just Ms. Cen alone! If knowledgeable women are like this, how many other housewives and working women who are not as aware as Ms. Cen are there? If women with a sense of national society and full of enthusiasm for liberation are like this, what about the hundreds of millions of other women who are struggling in misery? This is a problem that people who are working hard on mass mobilization and the cause of resistance and nation-building today cannot ignore.

Everyone already knows that women can only truly solve the problem of their pathways by participating in the resistance and nation-building, and striving for national liberation. To participate in the cause of resistance and nation-building, the first thing to do is to bravely and resolutely participate in collective life, work hard to study, pay attention to self-cultivation, increase the strength of women's unity, strive for opportunities for women to serve in the resistance and nation-building, and enhance women's social and political status. At present, many groups, although unable to fully satisfy everyone, and even still have many sad and angry phenomena, but seeking liberation is originally a kind of struggle. If all good people retreat cleanly, then the social groups will never have hope of progress. This is what we ask Ms. Cen and the thousands of women who cannot find a way out to deeply recognize, control their emotions, and strive forward.

Secondly, the current cause of resistance and nation-building needs talents everywhere; women's organizations are even more in need of enriching their strength and expanding their front lines. However, on the other hand, there are still many people who cannot find work and are reduced to sadness and fainting. This is a responsibility that social leaders cannot shirk! We earnestly hope that various groups can eliminate prejudices, help each other, work practically, pay attention to and promote truly talented people from all sides, enrich their strength, and increase their effectiveness. At the same time, it is also necessary to launch women's mobilization work among housewives and working women, which can not only invigorate the vast and scattered powerless women and make them a majestic new force in the resistance and nation-building, but also can promote many new cadres to serve as the backbone of the women's liberation movement, preparing to fundamentally solve the problem of women's pathways. This is also what we sincerely hope that women's organizations and leaders from all walks of life will strive for!

### Philippine Customs Strictly Crack Down on Hong Kong Repackaged Bolts of Cloth Sold in the Philippines; Philippine Industrialists Form a Large-Scale Rayon Factory; Hong Kong Textile Sales to the Philippines Will Face a Major Blow in the Future

For several years, it has been extremely active for bolts of cloth of * origin that are repackaged in Hong Kong and shipped to the Philippines for sale. Every year, regardless of winter or summer, there are huge numbers of these bolts of cloth. Since the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan began, this kind of repackaged bolts of cloth shipped from Hong Kong to the Philippines has become even more prevalent. This is because our overseas Chinese compatriots in the Philippines and local American and Filipino people all unanimously refuse to buy * goods. * merchants have no choice but to resort to various tricks, transporting a large number of wool, cotton textiles, and rayon to Hong Kong, and then repackaging them as products from Chinese factories and European and American factories, before attaching them to ships from Hong Kong to the Philippines, in order to pass fish eyes for pearls and carry out their conspiracy of selling at low prices to seize the market. However, the Philippine authorities have long since begun to pay special attention to this. Two commissioners were dispatched by the Customs from Hong Kong some months ago, to investigate the truth of the matter. After returning to the Philippines, they have submitted a detailed report on their findings.

Strict Inspection to Prevent Imports

According to sources from the Hong Kong-Philippines Merchants' Bank yesterday, the Philippine government, after receiving the report from the two commissioners who investigated in Hong Kong, determined that this kind of repackaged * goods shipped from Hong Kong to the Philippines not only directly dealt a considerable blow to the American and Filipino textile industries, but also had a significant impact on the sales of bolts of cloth produced by other countries in the Philippines, invisibly creating a major obstacle to the Philippine market economy. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly crack down on and prevent it. The government is now carefully considering countermeasures, strictly instructing Philippine customs officials to earnestly implement the various steps that have been decided upon. Since the beginning of the month or so, it has been quite effective. During this period, many cases of this kind of repackaged bolts of cloth have been discovered and all have been refused entry, being returned to Hong Kong on the original ship. Because of this strict inspection, the number of * bolts of cloth that are repackaged in Hong Kong and shipped to the Philippines is now decreasing day by day. At the same time, the sales of Hong Kong-made textiles to the Philippines are increasing day by day, which is of great benefit to the Hong Kong weaving industry.

The Philippines Will Establish a Rayon Factory

However, the Philippine government and industrialists, in view of the huge amount of * rayon and Chinese silk that have been sold to the Philippines in recent years, especially * rayon, which accounts for nearly 70 percent, and because the climate of the Philippine Islands is mild and the hot season is long, and the people of the island prefer to use silk bolts of cloth to make clothes, which is a great loss to the Philippines' own interests, are striving to reverse this huge drain. Recently, the National Enterprises Corporation, which is operated by the Philippine government, has planned to organize a large-scale rayon factory to engage in the production of rayon. The estimated capital is about US$2 million, and it can produce 3.5 tons of rayon per day. The hemp, bamboo, grass, and cork in the Philippines can be used as raw materials. The establishment of this factory will certainly completely reject * rayon from the Philippine market, and at the same time, the sales of textile products produced by Hong Kong factories in the Philippines will also face a major blow in the future. It is reported that the Hong Kong factory products that are sold to the Philippines are mainly cotton silk undershirts, cotton silk socks, and summer local cloth.

### The Joint Relief Association's Research Committee Begins Investigating Mistreated Refugees; Will Appeal to Representatives to Convey to the Hong Kong Government; First Committee Meeting to Be Held Next Week to Discuss Implementation

The recent incidents of refugees being mistreated in the New Territories refugee camps have aroused attention from all parties and have been reported in the newspapers. The Hong Kong Joint Relief Association has also received a letter from the Yikeng Jinka refugees in Fanling, stating that in addition to being mistreated, they also requested that the association follow the previous method and ask to set up sheds in Shenzhen to accommodate them. The person in charge of the association paid great attention to this matter. After passing the standing committee meeting, the Women's War Disaster Association, the Journalists' Association, the Manufacturers' Association, and the Kwongtung Chamber of Commerce were selected to form a committee to study the mistreatment of refugees, and to investigate the whole story of the mistreatment of refugees. The investigation committee has scheduled its first meeting within this week to jointly discuss the implementation. However, before the meeting is held, it is necessary to obtain considerable evidence. At present, the investigation team has dispatched personnel to various refugee camps in the New Territories to investigate. If evidence is obtained, it will definitely appeal to the representatives to convey it to the Hong Kong government for effective improvement, in order to conform to the purpose of relief.

### Youth Journalists Association Held National Covenant Oath Movement Yesterday; More Than 200 Participants, Simple and Solemn; Xu Shiying and Wang Xiaolai Attended as Witnesses

The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association held the Hong Kong News Reporter Spiritual Mobilization and National Covenant Oath Movement at Kong Saint Hall on Carlow Lane yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, Wang Xiaolai, a member of the Central Committee, and more than 200 reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and local newspapers in Hong Kong, attended. The oath ceremony was simple and solemn. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:

News Reporters Are in a Leading Position

After the ceremony, Chairman Guo Butao gave an opening speech, saying that the National Covenant promulgated by the highest leader, all citizens should take an oath to abide by it without fail. News reporters are in a leading position in the society and should do their best to promote it. On the active side, it can enhance the strength of the war of resistance, and in terms of news, it can also eliminate the activities of traitors.

Oath Ceremony is Simple and Solemn

After the chairman's speech, the oath was taken, with Xu Shiying, the Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, and Wang Xiaolai, a member of the Central Committee, as witnesses. All the reporters present who participated in the oath raised their right hands, stood solemnly, and silently read the 16 articles of the covenant (plus four additional articles). Then, under the leadership of the chairman, they recited the oath, saying, "We swear in good conscience to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely support the National Government, obey the leadership of the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, do our best, and serve the country. If there is any breach of oath, we are willing to be punished by the government. We solemnly swear." Thus, this simple and solemn oath ceremony was completed.

Xu Shiying's Heartfelt Words

Then, Xu Shiying, the witness, delivered a speech, roughly saying, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of everyone. The national crisis has reached the most serious stage. All the people of the country should actively take on their due responsibilities, step up our spiritual mobilization, and win the victory of the war of resistance. Therefore, the promotion of the National Covenant and oath is of great significance. However, the oath of this covenant can be divided into two types: formal and spiritual. If you don't swear in good conscience, but only do superficial formal work, it is useless. However, many people are unwilling to even hold this kind of form. Today, the Hong Kong Branch of the Youth Journalists Association is holding the Hong Kong News Reporter Signature Oath Ceremony. Although the ceremony is simple, the significance is very significant. I hope that everyone will work harder in the future to win the victory of the war of resistance and the success of nation-building." Finally, Wang Xiaolai and other members of the Central Committee gave speeches respectively, and then the Chinese Chorus sang patriotic songs, the singing was majestic and resounded through the sky, receiving no small amount of praise. After taking pictures, the meeting adjourned.

### Phoenix City: China Travel Troupe Re-performs; 12th Night at the Queen's Theatre

The new famous play "Phoenix City" by the "China Travel Troupe" was performed for the Women's Federation last time at the Queen's Theatre. That night, it rained heavily, but there were still many viewers. However, there were also many people who were turned away. Because the play has attracted the attention of people in Hong Kong, it has been specially decided to perform one more show at the Queen's Theatre on the 12th of this month. The ticket price is lower than the charity performance, in order to provide a universal contribution to the appreciation of all sectors. The members of the "China Travel Troupe" not only have skilled acting skills for this play, but also are putting in their greatest efforts for the troupe's first performance after its reconstruction, hoping to lay its foundation in the theatrical world, and the results are more impressive than before.

### Ending of Huanghuagang Charity Performance; China Arts Troupe Schedules Another Performance; 9th to 14th for Six Consecutive Days at the Popular Celebration Theatre; The Program Includes Seven Famous Plays Such As "In the Green Gauze Tent"

The grand alliance of the Hong Kong theatrical community is raising funds for the Joint Relief Association for all sectors to relieve the refugees in South China and comfort the families of the soldiers who died in front, and performed the historical drama of the Civil Revolution, "Huanghuagang", at the Taiping Theatre on the memorial days of May 3, May 4, and May 5. The results were very good. The Huanghuagang Performance Committee has scheduled a closing meeting at the China Children's College on Shandong Street, Mong Kok, at 1:00 PM tomorrow. Because the ticket price was too high this time, the Joint Relief Association specifically requested the performance committee to perform again, with the ticket price being popular in order to be universal. The most sound drama group in Hong Kong, the China Art Troupe, has fully participated in the performance work of Huanghuagang. Because of the language relationship, the actors of China Art Troupe have not been able to fully exert their talents, and the pillars of China Art Troupe, such as Jiang Ming, Qiu Xinghai, etc., Dong Yue and others also joined in to play non-speaking roles, while others participated in backstage work. Since its establishment, in addition to cooperating with the Wu Huan Chorus, performing charity performances at the Entertainment Theatre, and raising funds for the Hong Kong Youth Relief Association at the Gaosheng Theatre, and also holding巡迴charity performances in various community schools, the China Art Troupe itself has performed three times at the Central Theatre and once at the Puqing Theatre. The work situation is extremely tense and strenuous. Now that the Huanghuagang charity performance is over, it has been decided to perform at the Kowloon Puqing Theatre for six consecutive days from the 9th to the 14th of this month. The plays include In the Green Gauze Tent, Dawn, Chinese Men, Losing Your Head, The Song of Righteousness, Di Si Niang, The Hypocrite, etc. The content is very rich, starting at 8:00 PM every night, and on Saturdays and Sundays, there will also be a day show.

Chen Lanfang then reported on the financial situation, saying that the average number of people staying in the hospital every day last year reached more than 200, so the expenditure was huge.

### Evidence of the Inevitable Victory of the War of Resistance

— Kang Zhi

After Watching the Sixth Collection of Special Editions on the War of Resistance

Special Feature: "The Sixth Collection of Special Editions on the War of Resistance" was test-screened yesterday, undoubtedly. This is the bloody truth, a record of the rebirth of the Chinese nation. The brave and bloody soldiers on the front lines are using their hot blood to open the flowers of national freedom. The great victory of De'an and the bitter struggle of the lone army on the Lushan Mountain fully demonstrate the fearless spirit of every soldier who regards death as home in order to win the victory. Each shot reflecting the dynamics of the rear is a full expression of coordination and response with the front line. The enthusiastic donations of compatriots, regardless of old or young, and the warm farewells to the soldiers going to war, show that the unity of the army and the people is an unprecedented miracle. And the enthusiastic consolation of wounded soldiers and the clothing donation movement are all symbols of the harbinger of the Chinese nation's victory in the war of resistance!

The fact that the audience stood up to pay tribute to the leader's portrait being shown on the screen cannot help but remind people of a certain occupied area, where the * people forcibly occupied the movie theater that was not completely destroyed and used it as a propaganda tool to poison our compatriots in the occupied area. The * people relied on fabricated rumors to alienate our unity and injure our leaders, but the performance of those films made the vast audience more deeply aware of the greatness of the leaders, and they also stood up to pay tribute and applaud, and the * pseudo-police were also at a loss and unable to interfere. The unity of the will to resist is possessed by every compatriot with blood, whether in the war zone or in the rear, except for a group of traitors with ulterior motives and no blood. Finally, we hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will see this film of special editions on the war of resistance, and that even compatriots in the mainland and even in the occupied areas can see this film of special editions on the war. Let us strengthen our self-confidence and more actively meet the victorious tomorrow with struggle!

### A Million Anguished Women: She Donated Money and Fainted

— Qi Zhuo

Control emotions with reason and participate in progressive collective life!

The day before yesterday, at midnight, when the "Yellow Flower Mound" performance reached its 'finale,' under an extremely tense atmosphere, a young woman suddenly went on stage and gave a generous speech, startling everyone. She began speaking calmly, "Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me for saying a few words. I am too excited, too moved! We women, who make up half of the population, should be thoroughly awakened. I now donate these five dollars, according to my ability, to comfort the families of the fallen soldiers. I hope that all of you present will encourage your husbands, encourage your sons, to defend our country. Only then can we live up to the spirits of the Premier and the seventy-two martyrs in heaven..." However, because she was too excited, her wording became repetitive and chaotic! She walked back and forth, repeatedly saluting the Premier and the portraits of the Yellow Flower Mound martyrs, repeatedly saying sorry and being very "impolite."

Was this a pre-arranged audience hinted at by the director, or a truly spontaneous audience? The audience present was confused.

The chairman on stage, taking advantage of a slight pause in her speech, very cleverly continued, shouting slogans. Only then did the curtain close successfully.

Many people rushed forward to ask what was going on. They learned that she was a genuine audience member who was moved by the scene, a refugee from Guangzhou named Cen ××, living at ×× Prince Road. Because she was too excited, she finally fainted. After first aid, her spirit gradually recovered. When the reporter rushed back to the newspaper office, it was already one o'clock in the morning, too late for typesetting. Only a small special report was published yesterday to meet the readers. This is not a simple matter, so the reporter went to interview Ms. Cen in detail yesterday.

Upon meeting her, he first expressed his respect for her courage and enthusiasm and inquired about her mental well-being. Ms. Cen said very sincerely, "Thank you, my spirit has recovered! I am very sorry. Last night, reason could not control emotion. The more I spoke on the stage, the more unnatural I became. I knew that some of the audience were laughing at my abnormality. Alas! There was just too much I wanted to say!" She then continued to speak enthusiastically.

Her family background was petit-bourgeois and feudal. She lived in Xiguan, Guangzhou. Because her father was a businessman and his thinking was very outdated, she was forced to drop out of Guangzhou Union Women's Normal School midway. A year later, even the family tutor was gone. She liked movies, dramas, and music, but she was not allowed to develop her interests. From then on, she studied classical Chinese at home and worked hard for six years. In the meantime, because of her mother's death, and because she was not allowed to study or have freedom, the stimulation of being cooped up at home was too unbearable, and she showed a state of negative pessimism.

Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, her passion to dedicate herself to serving the war effort burned like fire. Fortunately, through the introduction of the executive director of the Guangzhou Youth Association, she took on the role of head teacher at the Youth Association's wartime children's school. She had studied education and loved children very much. No matter how naughty the students were, she was interested in making them better, and she felt it was very meaningful. Although she could only receive a few dollars of living expenses as a stipend, she was proud that her spirit was entrusted to work, children, the organization, and the country.

However, the ruthless artillery fire of the × people destroyed their school. For a while, they couldn't find a new school site, which was a serious blow to her work, and she began to feel empty and lost again.

On October 21, Guangzhou fell. On the 20th, she and her family left Guangzhou for their old home in Jiujiang in extreme danger. The experience in the countryside of Jiujiang was very unpleasant. Out of desperation, they came to Hong Kong with great difficulty forty days ago. She felt very painful inside that the motherland was struggling while she was relying on the favor of others here. However, her strength was limited, so she had no choice but to temporarily stay here and look for work.

However, the impression of ×× was too bad for her! The licentious and shameless indulgence simply ignored the national crisis! She wanted to join the film industry, but the corrupt and outdated environment made her afraid to accept. Educating children was her duty, and she was very interested in it, but the commercialized education industry also made her heartbroken. Her enthusiasm could not be developed, and she had no opportunity to serve. Darkness surrounded her, and she could not see a bright side. Without the encouragement of progressive and serious friends, she could not withstand the bad stimulation. Less than ten days after she arrived in Hong Kong, she suddenly wanted to risk returning to the mainland, but her relatives stopped her again. She had money to live on, but without work, her spirit had nowhere to rest, which was very painful. This time, she was deeply moved by "Yellow Flower Mound." Mr. Zhong Qinan, who gave the speech on stage, was also her director four years ago. With mixed feelings, she could not help but go on stage to speak and donate money, and finally fainted from excessive excitement.

From this typical situation, we gain a lot of inspiration:

How many awakened women are threatened by feudal families, not just her alone?

How many women are depressed and anguished because their spirits cannot be developed, not just her alone? How many people see the dark side but not the bright side, are stimulated by bad friends but not comforted by good friends, not just her alone?

How many people cannot control their emotions with reason, not just her alone?

How many people have such encounters in the Anti-Japanese War, not just her alone?

How many people are moved by the vivid content of Anti-Japanese war dramas, not just her alone?

### The Situation in Eastern Guangdong is Tense Again: × Aircraft Bomb Shantou City Madly for Days, More Than a Hundred Houses Destroyed in the Wubridge Area, a Terrible Disaster, Yesterday Morning the City Center Was Madly Bombed Again, Many Dead and Wounded

[Reuters, Shantou, 5th] Japanese planes attacked Shantou again this morning, bombing the city center wildly and strafing with machine guns, causing many civilian casualties.

[Reuters, Shantou, 5th] Many Japanese planes continued to bomb Shantou today. Shrapnel flew in front of the British and French churches, causing many civilian casualties. The people of Shantou are now evacuating in large numbers every day.

[Special Dispatch from Shantou] At 8:00 a.m. on the 4th, eight × planes flying from Minxia passed over Chenghai North and South Ports and invaded Shantou City at 8:30. First, they strafed the city center with dense machine gun fire, and then they threw large bombs randomly at Wubridge. The rumbling sounds, coupled with the gunfire, plunged the city into a state of terror. Rescue teams and ambulances bravely ventured into the rain of bombs to carry out rescue operations. The reporter also went to the disaster area to inspect amidst the air raid alarm. He witnessed 27 bombs falling on Wubridge. Imposing buildings instantly became ruined walls and broken tiles, and the shacks of the poor were also reduced to ashes, leaving them nowhere to turn. Among them, many wives died and children were killed. The scene was so tragic that it was heartbreaking. The × planes did not leave Shantou until after 11:00 a.m., and they spied on Chaoan, Jieyang, and Chaoyang in batches, and strafed the Ancheung Electric Ship at Longdu, Raoping, killing and injuring more than 20 passengers. In Jieyang, they strafed the Jie Shantou Electric Ship, injuring one crew member. As for the disaster sites in Shantou, it is estimated that more than a hundred buildings, including Wubridge Tongji Straight Road Lower Section, Tongji Third Road Upper Section, Beiti Road Tongji Second Heng Lane entire lane, machine storage houses, and civilian houses, were destroyed. More than 20 civilians were killed and injured. After the × planes bombed wildly, Shantou and Chaoan, Jieyang, Chaoyang and other counties stepped up the evacuation of the population and set up refugee reception stations in various places to urge the people to evacuate. Shantou's various circles also established shelters for poor children and female workers to accommodate those who are unable to escape and the homeless, providing food and lodging. When a considerable number of people are accommodated, they will be escorted to the Shaosheng Women's Production Work Group and the Provincial Children's Training Corps for upbringing. At 12:30 p.m., the batch of × planes, consisting of several planes, came again in formation to attack, flying low and strafing wantonly. Our air defense forces met them head-on with a heavy blow. Until after 1:00 p.m., they threw more than ten bombs in the Island Bridge area again, destroying dozens of houses and killing and injuring more than 20 civilians again. A bomb was also dropped at the intersection of Shengping Road, but it fell into the sea. After wreaking havoc, they turned to attack Chaoyang Chenghai. At the same time, two × warships, one destroyer, and several motorboats suddenly appeared in Linghai. We are closely monitoring them.

### Xinhe × Changed from Attack to Defense, Our Army Advanced and Forced the Meeting City, Peeking at Danshuikou × Has Been Repelled, The Situation Has Eased, The Four Districts Blockhouses Decided to Demolish and Prepare for Resolute Resistance

[Express News from Zhongshan] In the Xin (Hui) He (Shan) battle, our army has been fighting fiercely in recent days in the areas of Jinggen Nanzhuang Road on the Xinhe Road, Pingdiling, and Fenshui River, Da Xiaomei on the Xinkai Road. Our army's teams are advancing very quickly. × Attempted to launch a pincer attack on Kaiping Danshuikou from He City and Hui City, but the treacherous plot has been foiled. The various situations are as follows:

Our Army Launches Three-Pronged Attack

After our army launched a counterattack on He Shan × from Kaiping and Gaoming, × retreated to the areas of Shapogubu and Haikou. One route of our army is now advancing towards Shaping from Yangmei Jinggangxu. The Xinhe Road our army is advancing from Ziwu. The fighting at Nanzhuang Station and Pingdiling has been very fierce in recent days, and our army has made considerable progress, killing many. The Xinkai Road our army has also advanced to Fenshui River, approaching Hui City, and the fighting is quite fierce. × Has a look of abandoning Da Xiaomei. × In Hui City is extremely panicked because our Guifeng Mountain team is in control.

Danshuikou Has Been Lifted from Martial Law

× Boats once harassed Xinkai border roads a few days ago and landed once in Danshuikou, but were repelled by our garrison team. Recently, they still peek at the same time and use small-caliber cannons and machine guns to strafe the shore. Danshuikou was extremely tense. After He City was lost, × There was a trend of invading along Kaihe. Now, because the teams from all directions are effectively blocking ×, the tense situation in Danshuikou has eased. On the 3rd of this month, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First District, ordered the Danshuikou team to lift martial law.

The First District Supervises the Demolition of Blockhouses

Gu Dinghua, the administrative inspector of the First District, was ordered by Zhang Fakui, the commander of the ×th war zone, and Li Hanhun, the chairman of the provincial government, to strictly supervise the demolition of blockhouses in various villages in the Four Districts and to step up war preparations. It was found that the public in the Four Districts had previously petitioned to exempt them from demolition, but after Bai Chongxi, the director of the Southwest Headquarters, telegraphed an explanation of the intention of the demolition, the authorities specifically ordered the First District to supervise the demolition to show their determination to resist the war and not to be used by the enemy.

Xinhe × Changed to Defensive Stance

According to the electric report from the Guerrilla Headquarters of the ×th District of Xin Hui, the × at the strongholds of Shaping Jiangmen He City in Xin Zeng He Shan were afraid of our counterattack and actively built defensive fortifications on the foreign line. According to the electric telephone report from the Guerrilla Headquarters of the ×th District of Xin Hui, the × in Hui City erected artillery positions in the Dongmen Shizi Market Shatiqiao area. More than 300 × in Shaping also have a look of preparing to retreat.

### The Provincial Party Headquarters Adjusted the Organization, and the Organizational Content of Each Department Was Revised

(Special Dispatch from Shaoguan) Since the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, Chairman Li Hanhun has been actively engaged in rectification. In addition to telegraphing the Central Committee to urge the new members who have not yet reported to the department and those who have not yet taken office to report to the department as soon as possible, he also revised the previous rules of procedure and followed the regulations of the Central Committee, abolishing the original inspection system to avoid duplication of work with the district supervision. The departments under the Organization, Civil Training, Propaganda, and General Affairs Departments were divided into groups. Under the General Affairs Department, there are four groups: Documents, Affairs, Accounting, and Cashier. Under the Organization Department, there are three groups: Guidance, Investigation, and Party Membership. Under the Propaganda Department, there are three groups: Guidance, Compilation, and Review. Under the Civil Training Department, there are three groups: Review, Guidance, and Social Affairs. In addition, because the original personnel were insufficient for distribution, personnel are being adjusted and enriched to increase work efficiency.

### The National Production Conference Opened, Guangdong Province's Wartime Agricultural Plan (Continued from Yesterday)

(5) Thoroughly Reform Rural Cooperatives

The establishment of rural cooperatives was originally intended to help farmers and run rural undertakings to avoid being manipulated by others and suffering losses. Cooperatives aim to manage one or more related businesses, so there are certain restrictions. According to their nature, they can be divided into credit, supply, production, transportation and sales, consumption, public utilities, insurance, and other types. Rural cooperatives have long been established in this province, but in reality, the masters are indeed others, not the farmers themselves. The crux of the problem is obvious. If it is not thoroughly reformed, what benefits the farmers may actually harm them, and only give another class an opportunity to exploit them.

(6) Rapidly Establish Rural Warehouses

Grain regulation is extremely important in peacetime, and even more urgent in wartime. In order to coordinate production and sales and ensure proper supply, it is urgent to build warehouses and promote warehouse operations. The Guangdong authorities should immediately select suitable locations that are farther from the war zone and have convenient transportation. The provincial government or county government should establish warehouses to handle transportation, sales, storage, and mortgage business, in order to regulate production and sales and store grain. With preparations, the farmer economy can be compensated. The Ministry of Economic Affairs formulated the "Emergency Period Feed and Grain Storage Implementation Measures" on September 24 last year, and promulgated them by ministerial order on September 20 last year for local governments to follow. In order to implement storage, mortgage loans, Guangdong should be established quickly, so that not only can the problem of grain panic be partially solved, but also the farmer's life can be gradually improved.

(7) Develop Immigration and Reclamation Undertakings

Reclamation is the best way to support the long-term war of resistance, increase production, and provide relief to refugees. According to the draft outline of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association's plan for refugee relief, the provincial authorities plan to select Nanshan in the Eastern District, Lianshan in the Northern District, and Xinyu in the Western District as immigration and reclamation areas. Based on 12,000 households, with five people per household, approximately 640,000 mu of land can be reclaimed. The management method will adopt a collective farm system in order to make the work reasonable, etc. I believe that in this urgent situation, when it comes to reclamation, the principles of time, economy, and cost savings should be followed. Being too idealistic will make it difficult to implement. The first thing to pay attention to in immigration and reclamation is the location and the fertility of the land. The location should be closer to the refugee area and belong to a safe zone. The soil should be hot wasteland, otherwise it is necessary to select the more fertile soil to avoid futile efforts. In order to accelerate the development of immigration and reclamation undertakings, the provincial government must supervise the county governments to be responsible for handling them to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.

(8) Promote Short-Term Crops

The province's food supply is insufficient. In peacetime, it can still rely on imported goods, but in wartime, the seaports are blocked, transportation is difficult, and foreign rice is difficult to supply. Moreover, the Guangzhou Pearl River Delta area has become a war zone, and the area for planting rice has been greatly reduced. All crops that can provide food should be expanded. In wartime, the gains and losses of a place or a city are inevitable. All long-term crops that require a long period of cultivation before harvest are unlikely to be planted. Therefore, in order to adapt to environmental needs, short-term crops should be actively promoted. Not only can it reduce the worry of being ravaged and destroyed by the × people, but also it can be harvested in a short period of time for supply. Guangdong mostly relies on foreign rice, but the output is insufficient. Therefore, it should use mature and sloping land to widely plant beans and other miscellaneous grains according to the local climate and soil to reduce the consumption of rice. As for excellent dry rice, it can also be planted in moderation according to the local environment. If the supply and demand can be equal, it is desirable. Otherwise, the amount of difference can be improved again, and it can be hoped to be offset.

(9) Promote Wartime Rural Education

The development of rural areas depends on the popularization of rural education. The second phase of the war of resistance is the prelude to completing the building of a national defense. All rural education facilities should be aimed at wartime needs, using the natural environment to concentrate forces and train the people, so that every citizen is a sound production element. We should also universally set up lower-level agricultural vocational schools, short-term wartime peasant schools, and organize wartime agricultural extension service groups, wartime rural education service groups, etc., to train talents and provide mobile services to seek popularization, and use all production plans as their concrete teaching materials to ensure that production and education are integrated. At any time, use the effectively managed public and private farms as the base for implementing education.

(10) The Contribution of the National Production Conference to the Province

Modern warfare is a final between countries' human, material and financial resources. Its economic and material capabilities can provide lasting supply and ultimately win the victory. President Kong of the Executive Yuan attaches great importance to and strives to promote national production work and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. In addition to establishing the China Industrial Cooperative Association and the Agricultural Products Promotion Committee to assist the provinces and promote production undertakings in a blitzkrieg manner, he is also afraid that this kind of work is limited to the local area and has not been developed evenly. In order to conduct a general review of the national production undertaking, in order to establish a whole plan and facilitate progress, the National Production Conference was convened. Regarding the preparations for the conference, President Kong sent Mr. Mu Ouchu, a well-experienced and prestigious agricultural and industrial expert, to serve as the secretary of the conference and preside over everything. The province should follow the regulations of the Central Committee and send more representatives to attend and make practical suggestions so that, with the technical and economic assistance of the Central Committee, the province's agricultural plan can be completed. The above ten items are the main points, and they are listed to be the guidelines for reform. As for the implementation plan details, it is still necessary to carefully stipulate that all regions of Guangdong Province are suitable for the planting of tea and sugarcane. If the environment can be used to the full extent, the prospects for the tea and sugar industries are infinitely promising. For example, sloping mountains can also be afforested on a large scale, and tung oil can be planted extensively in the areas bordering Hunan Province. During this time of war of resistance, nurseries should be set up first to avoid wasting human and material resources. After the victory of the war of resistance, planting them widely can save time and money. All of these should be given special attention. Attached is an imperial and to wake up the attention of the general public. (End)

### Acting Commander Zhang Returned to Northern Guangdong Yesterday, Summoned Party, Government, and Military Commanders for Instructions

### Guangdong Provincial Relief Association Handles Ping Tiao in Xijiang, Allocates 20,000 Yuan to Be Supervised by the Commissioner

(Express News from Qujiang) Since the × Kou invaded the south, the rice-producing areas of this province, such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zengcheng, have been successively ravaged, resulting in extreme shortages of food in the mainland, extremely high prices, and great suffering for the people, especially in the counties of Xijiang. The Guangdong Provincial Relief Association has successively received telegrams from Director Bai of the Gui Xingying and Acting Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee, instructing them to quickly find ways to provide relief. The relief association believes that the shortage of food in the counties of Xijiang during this time of shortage is a serious problem, and the method of relief should be to immediately organize Ping Tiao to stabilize rice prices and enrich the people's livelihood. It has already prepared several measures and submitted them to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday, the 27th, it allocated 20,000 yuan to Commissioner Li of the Third District to supervise the implementation of Ping Tiao in the food-deficient counties together with Commander Deng, and ordered them to report the amount of food shortage in each county, the current rice prices, and the methods of organizing Ping Tiao for review. As for the method of allocating and transporting food, it will be ordered after proper consultation.

### The Political Department of the Twelfth Group Army Held a Political Work Conference, All Directors of Divisions and Brigades Attended

[Express News from Wengyuan] Li Xu, director of the Political Department of the 12th Group Army, said that with our various military operations actively progressing, it is urgent to strengthen the political work of the troops, strengthen the officers and soldiers' determination to resist the war, and mobilize the people in the war zone.

The directors of the political departments of the 153rd, 154th, 157th, 160th, and 186th divisions, and the independent 1st brigade, all attended. In addition to reporting on the general situation of the political work of each unit, multiple resolutions were made separately on improving wartime political training work and mobilizing the people to resist ×. The results of the conference were extremely satisfactory. It was also learned that the directors of the political departments of the 155th and 156th divisions did not make it in time to attend due to transportation and time reasons.

### Guangdong Senators Arrived in Shaoguan One After Another, A Preliminary Meeting Will Be Held First to Review Proposals, The Provincial Government Will Compile the Implementation Process

Movies and Drama

### Hollywood's New Trend: Biographies are Very Popular, New Films are Being Made One After Another

Recently, biographical films have become very popular, probably due to the outstanding success of films such as "The Life of Emile Zola," "Juarez," "Victoria the Great," and "The Great Waltz." The following eleven films have been statistically compiled:

Tyrone Power's "Jesse James," an American outlaw, has already been filmed, co-starring Henry Fonda and Nancy Kelly, in full color. The Castles, a couple, Frayre Stan and Qin Shulojis, were the most popular dance partners in the United States twenty years ago. Irene Castle (the wife) is forty-five years old this year and serves as the storyline consultant for the film. Her husband died in a plane crash during the European War. This is Astan Rogis' first historical film, and it has already been filmed.

Paul Muni's "Juarez," a Mexican hero, is a historical war film, co-starring Bette Davis, handsome young man Byron Anaheim, character actor John Garfield, Claude Rains, and others. The cast is very strong and is currently in production.

"Stanley and Livingstone," two people's African adventures, triggered the great powers' invasion of Africa. Stanley on the screen is played by Spencer Tracy, and Livingstone is played by Sir Hardwick. Richard Greene and Nancy Kelly play a fictional couple. Mrs. Martin Johnson went to Africa to film on location.

Deanna Durbin will shoot a five-color film "Jenny Lind," which is also a biography of a beautiful queen of song.

Joan Bennett, one of the top ten beauties, will also shoot "Empress Maria Theresa" under the banner of United Artists giant Edward Small. The queen is the mother of the peerless Mary Antoinette. Her youth must have been a moving story. The film is titled "Man of Iron Mask," based on the famous novel by Alexandre Dumas.

Also in production is "The Life of Alexander Graham Bell," with Don Ameche playing Bell, the inventor of the telephone. Co-starring are the Young sisters: Loretta Young, Polly Ann Young, Sally Blane, and fourteen-year-old Georgiana Young. Lord Errol will also bring the life of British Army General Lord Kitchener during the European War to the screen. He was killed by a submarine.

As for Garbo's "Madame Curie" and Spencer Tracy's "Edison," a great scientist, both are artistic masterpieces that movie fans are looking forward to.

Clark Gable has a film planned called "The Great Canadian," which is also a famous historical figure.

From this, it can be seen that the artistic level of Hollywood has obviously improved recently. In addition, although "Beau Geste," "Knights of the Round Table," "Union Pacific," and "Gone With the Wind" are not biographical in nature, they are all historical war and literary epics. Movie fans, look forward to them!

### Constance Bennett Sued for Injury

### Husband, Wife, Friend (4)

Leopold hoped he could get people to sign business contracts as easily as he could sell tickets. Business was not good. In fact, there was no business at all. He didn't tell Doris. They could only live off the savings in the bank. Of course, this couldn't last long.

The next afternoon, his apartment was like a madhouse. The concert was scheduled to begin at two o'clock. Doris was putting on makeup in her room. The room was crowded with girls and friends. There was also Mrs. White. Leopold himself was holding a pair of tuxedo pants and spinning around, trying to find a place to change. Outside the room, Xu Guo was sitting on a small piano waiting for Doris's reply, occasionally playing a note or two on the piano.

"Mi Mi Mi…!" Doris was earnestly applying makeup.

People made a lot of noise for a while. Doris said, "That's terrible! He has to come! I need him more than anyone in the world! Leopold! Louise Bronson got Rudolf Hertz to agree to give me a review! But she told him the wrong date."

"Who is Rudolf Hertz?" Leopold asked in celebration. He finally put on his pants.

Miss White replied, "The most famous music critic in the national newspapers."

Doris said, "Getting a good review from him is more valuable than anything! His phone is private, we don't know the number, so we can't call him. Leopold, can you go see him in person? We heard he's not at the office, he's at his own home. Leopold, I beg you!"

"Okay, okay, okay," Leopold replied quickly. He didn't agree with this suggestion at all. But of course he hoped the concert would be a success.

He arrived at Hertz's house and found the stubborn Hertz having lunch with his wife and a beautiful Miss Carver. He learned from the conversation that she was a singer. Hertz declined, saying that he had another appointment and couldn't come. But Miss Carver looked at Leopold with sympathy for his difficulties and said that she might be able to come to the concert in a while.

Leopold returned dejectedly to the Town Hall. When he entered the concert hall, the music had already begun. Doris was standing on stage, clenching her fists in fear. There wasn't an empty seat in the audience. She sang a section from "Carmen" reasonably well. Well, let her succeed, and she'll be satisfied. He patiently waited for her to sing the last note, for the last basket of flowers to be sent to the stage, and for the last applause to gradually stop. Then he went to her dressing room backstage.

The backstage was full of talk, laughter, and praise. Leopold squeezed through and embraced Doris when he saw her. She asked happily, "How was it?"

He said, "Honey, you won, it was great. How about we leave here and celebrate?"

### Public Baseball Opening Game Today, Friends Beer vs. Portuguese Army, Held at Caroline Hill at 2:30 PM

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Recently, in all kinds of ball games on the island, the Chinese have been winning and reporting great news. Fans are happy to spend money.

Five of the six major football championships have been won. The name has been obtained, but it is unknown how the benefits are. In the lawn tennis singles and doubles matches, it looks like it will be our world again.

Football has waned, and tennis is at the final stage. The baseball game, which was born in this environment, will "open grandly" today.

If there is something to say, it is long; if there is nothing to say, it is short. Speaking of baseball in Hong Kong, although it is not as popular as football, there are still many people who promote it. However, the reason why baseball is not very developed in Hong Kong is that baseball is an American product. Some people with ulterior motives say, "Sports also look at color."

Tired of watching football, today baseball is newly launched, just right to change the taste.

The opening game, the Chinese team has not yet shown its face, but it is the Westerners playing the Friends Beer team. As far as I know, these two teams are also evenly matched.

The Portuguese army was the runner-up in the last session and has many famous players, such as Da Gaoshanu, Biludu, Palala, A Luwiki, etc., who are good materials for football and good baseball players. However, Da Gao and Biludu are currently on a southern expedition and have not returned. Since the team is incomplete, they must be careful to maintain the runner-up prestige when playing the first battle.

The Friends Beer team is a mixed army, that is, the incarnation of the Volunteer Army of the previous session, with good players such as the Li Anna brothers and Shi Yun. The strength is quite good, so don't underestimate them.

The battle location is at the Caroline Hill Naval Ground (ie, the place below the South China Association Ground). The stands have been built and can accommodate five or six hundred people. There are now many idle classes in Hong Kong. It is believed that the baseball market will also be booming.

Don't forget that the opening game time today is at 2:30 PM. Tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM, the defending champion Chinese team will play the US ship Mindanao. This big battle will definitely have more to watch. Tell the general baseball fans not to miss the time tomorrow morning. (The Ground God of Baseball) has learned that the lineups of the two teams playing today are as follows:

Western Association

(Pitcher) Palala, (Catcher) A Aluchengshi, (First Base) Balos, (Second Base) Mentusha, (Shortstop) Bright, (Third Base) Aluvic, (Left Field) L Aluvic, (Center Field) Ma Kishi, (Right Field) Fiba Lido, (Reserves) Budiro, Gavilo,

Friends Beer Team

(Pitcher) Xia Gaoli, (Catcher) Rongli, (First Base) — Li Annana, (Second Base) Susha, (Shortstop) Li Anna, (Third Base) Bonio, (Left Field) Xia Xian, (Center Field) Ao Xia Gaoli, (Right Field) Bao Yun, (Reserves) Ali, Duck Abbas, A Linzhen,

### Hong Kong Football Team's Victory in the Philippines, Defeated YGO Team 4-1

[Associated Press, 4th] The Hong Kong team played against the local VGO team last night. There were 8,000 spectators. Liang Rongzhao scored a goal within ten minutes of the start of the game. Since then, both sides have gained nothing. Hong Kong won 1-0 in the first half.

Not long after the start of the second half, Gao Shanu scored a goal. Then YCO returned a goal. Fifteen minutes later, Gao Shanu scored again. In the end, Da Gao scored again five minutes later. As a result, the Hong Kong team won 4-1. Li Huitang did not play. (Note: This telegram was sent at 2:30 AM the night before, but this newspaper was unable to publish it due to rushing to print. It is supplemented today.)

### Good Show at Happy Valley Tomorrow, Eastern vs. Australian League, Australian Team Arrives by Ship Tomorrow Morning

At this time, when the ball game is dwindling and the inter-port team has not returned from the expedition, there will be a football game worth watching at the Hong Kong venue tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM. That is the Eastern Association, the runner-up of the First Division League, will face the All-Australian League team.

Tickets are divided into three types: one yuan, five jiao, and three jiao. The door will open at 3:00 PM to avoid crowding.

The lineups of the two teams have been announced before, and the strengths are equal. It will definitely be a fierce battle. The All-Australian League team is personally led by Mr. Miro, the secretary of the Macau Football Association. They will arrive at 11:15 AM tomorrow morning. The Eastern Association will treat them courteously. The lineup on the field is:

Jia Hualu, Luo Bardo, He Zuosheng, Ke Tuohua, Ya Luoshi, Susha, Xiao Luobishi, Ya Mailang, Gao Lasu, Li Gu

Reserves: Liu Diqing, Ba Dalaigo,

Jia Hualu is known as the Iron Hand of Macau. His skills in saving and kneeling are unique. He Zuosheng is well-built, has strong headers, and is fast on his feet. Luo Bardo is a famous inter-port player. He has shown his skills when he came to Hong Kong last year. Center-back Ya Luoshi is also a famous player with the style of "Ga Xu" in Shanghai. He plays smoothly. The two full-backs are known for their bravery. The forward line, Gao Lasu, is the most dangerous. The left winger Luo Bishi is cunning and lively, and the right winger is agile. The left and right centers have always had contact. This team can use triangular short passes and long passes to the two wings when attacking. They are fast and beautiful to watch. They have been practicing hard recently, and the Eastern team may not be able to cope with them easily.

After several days of consultation, the Eastern Association has arranged the lineup as follows:

Xu Heng, Liu Xianhan, Zeng Zhongyun, Jiang Shanjing, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizan, Yu Qiaxing, Zou Wenzhi, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtujian

Reserves: Xu Buyun, Miao Huaguo, Li Bingzhu

Jiang Shanjing has returned this time, and the connection with Brother Heng and Ah Niu (Zhongyun) will definitely be further improved. The three midfielders are seamless. They can attack and defend. Jingcheng's seemingly attacking but not attacking, and suddenly shooting fiercely, will definitely show more color on this field. The right side of the forward line has been matched and is familiar with each other. They know themselves and their opponents. Zou Wenzhi is serving the Eastern Association again, and he is familiar with the road. Yu Qiaxing has improved recently and can also assist in building attacks. If he is brave enough, he will be looked at with new eyes.

I believe that the Eastern attack should be assisted by the midfielders, assisting the forward. When defending, the two inside axles should also be organized to defend. Suddenly, a surprise soldier suddenly appeared (this is what the Eastern team is good at), and the great work will be accomplished.

Macau's football skills have improved rapidly in recent years. The inter-port competition has advanced from Group B to Group A, and tomorrow's competition is also one of the balances of Macau's football skills.

### Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Competition Registration Deadline Tomorrow Afternoon

The Federation held a meeting a few days ago on the Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Competition, and it was decided to hold it as soon as possible. Registration has begun, and the participants have been very enthusiastic recently. Now the Federation has set the registration deadline for 6:00 PM tomorrow (7th). Teams that have not registered can go to the business department of Sing Tao Newspaper in Central to fill out the registration form.

### Basketball Tonight, Group A Zhong Sheng vs. Police, Group B Ling Ying vs. Chen Guang, Hua Nan vs. Kang Yuan

The schedule for the Public Men's Basketball Tournament tonight has been slightly changed. The first game is at 6:30 PM, Group B, Ling Ying vs. Chen Guang. The second game is at 7:30 PM, Group A, Zhong Sheng vs. Police. The third game is at 8:30 PM, Group B, Hua Nan vs. Kang Yuan. In the Group A match, Zhong Sheng is a strong team in this tournament and is unusually strong. The police are slightly inferior and should not be their opponent. In Group B, Ling Ying has stronger combat power than Chen Guang and may win. South China should beat Kang Yuan.

### Philippine Travel Notes

— —Huitang—

April 28, Rough Waves

I was awakened by the bell for breakfast on the boat in the early morning. I looked at my watch and it was already 8:00. Although I hadn't slept enough, I勉力 to get up. I asked Mr. Liang to get up and have breakfast together. When I entered the dining room, I learned that the boat was unloading cargo and had actually been delayed until 6:00 this morning before setting sail. Looking at the sea from the small window, dark clouds were everywhere, and small waves were raging. The waves were splashing, and the boat was pitching up and down. Rongxi, Jun Gan, Er Hou, Kenny, and Biludu all fell ill and couldn't get up. By noon, the tremors were even worse, and even the Zhaorong, Da Gao, and Shi Han, who had been eating peacefully, couldn't resist and disappeared one after another. Only I, Zao Ru, Jing Xiang, Tiansheng, A Chi, and Jian Jin were seen eating both lunch and dinner. Everyone else was hiding in their cabins, unable to move. Rongzhao and Rongsheng even clutched their chests and vomited, suffering from seasickness more than a major illness. In fact, the waves were not big at all. I have traveled back and forth across the South China Sea fourteen times, and this time was actually quieter. It is a pity that my friends still could not avoid the pain of vomiting and groaning. Sailing is a blessing, and I consider myself to be blessed and lucky. During dinner, an American clerk told me in great detail about the Chinese situation, which surprised me with his deep and outstanding knowledge. He said that since the beginning of China's resistance against Japan, it has gained the sympathy of the labor community in his country. He himself admires General Zhu De the most, in addition to President Chiang and his wife, and said that if we can persevere to the end, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. Even foreigners have this kind of belief, so how can we be willing to give up? Justice has not been extinguished, and those cruel invaders can also be alerted! At 9:00 PM, the boat entertained the public with sound movies. Less than half of our team was able to enjoy the visual feast, which is also a regrettable thing.

April 29, Destination

Yesterday, most people were troubled by the waves, their spirits were sluggish, and they did not have enough sleep. I thought to myself, if we still suffer this misfortune today, then we can hardly escape a defeat in tomorrow night's competition. I was anxiously thinking about it, and it lingered in my dreams. Even I tossed and turned, keeping my eyes open all night. Fortunately, the sun shone brightly this morning, and the sea was as flat as a mirror. When I got up early, I saw my friends leaving their cabins one after another. Even Er Hou and Rongzhao, who were not well, also tidied up their clothes and went to the dining room to eat ravenously, hoping to make up for their previous losses. Team leader A Chi had a happy expression on his face and announced that he would go to the deck for a drink after breakfast to celebrate the reunion of the entire team. The laughter was mixed and no longer as boring as yesterday. The boat was raising its sails to cross the strait. The original plan to arrive at the destination in the morning had to be postponed to 4:00 PM. The Philippine Federation sent a telegram saying that they had contacted the customs and would inspect the luggage when the boat entered the port to save time at the customs. At around 5:00 PM, Little Luzon was already faintly visible. Two small boats, the doctor and the customs, successively approached the boat and went through the entry inspection procedures as usual. By the time we docked, it was already evening. There were many people welcoming us at the pier. Dr. Yilan Neng, the secretary of the Philippine Federation, Philippine team leader Jia Lianghe, Hong Kong referee Omar, my friend Mr. Lin Guang, a sports enthusiast, Philippine football players, and many Chinese and Western newspaper reporters. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings and taking many flash photos, we went ashore together. I thought to myself, after five years of separation, the peach blossoms are still the same, and I feel sad that white hair is urging people on. I have been to 岷 before and after eight times since the 12th year of the Republic of China. I took a car to the Hatol Luneta Hotel and hurriedly changed my clothes. Then I went to the football field to try the taste of electric lights. The field is located in the Rizal Staluim, the venue for the 10th Far Eastern Games. Its magnificent structure is comparable only to our former city center field in the Far East. There are 41 electric lights on the left side of the field and only 12 on the right side, so the left side is bright and the right side is dark, and the light is not evenly distributed. However, if you are not short-sighted, you can follow the ball as you wish. After practicing for an hour, I went to the Ai Qiu Hotel for food. I hadn't had Chinese food for a long time, so my stomach was wide open. When I took a bath and went to bed, I unconsciously reported midnight. (To be continued)

### Popularize School Physical Education - Popular Classes Should Be Added

— Zhuoyue

(I) Encouraging students' efforts in physical education classes, addressing the past bad habits of general students, viewing physical education as a casual and leisurely course, and the time spent in physical education classes as opportunities for laziness. Because regular classes are too restrictive, everyone wants to find opportunities for laughter and free activities during physical education. Therefore, physical education teachers who casually let students do as they please in class are the most popular among students. If a teacher is too serious, students will dislike them, and in schools with student unrest, it will incite student movements and lead to teachers being expelled. When I first left student life and took a teaching position, I was unaware of the school's atmosphere. Relying on a passionate desire for physical education reform, I implemented strict and forceful physical education methods, not allowing students any freedom. This turned me into an adversary of the students. No matter how I encouraged them, the students' resentment never subsided and worsened daily, until they petitioned the headmaster to dismiss me. Fortunately, the principal convened a school assembly (the principal gathered all the students on the playground for instruction and invited me to speak) where, with unwavering spirit, forceful tactics, and righteous arguments, I persuaded the students, and the matter was immediately resolved. Afterward, classes proceeded smoothly. After this incident, I gained a lot of experience and my resolve strengthened. From this, I learned that the general tendency of students towards casualness and laziness is not fixed, but can be changed and corrected. It depends on whether the teacher can firmly uphold their rational views. Therefore, in general schools, adding physical education popular classes can reduce a lot of trouble. On the one hand, it can eliminate students' disregard for physical education, and on the other hand, it can encourage their efforts in physical education classes—because if they don't work hard in regular classes, they can be assigned to popular classes for training. This will elicit a response from them, making them realize that their physique is inferior to others, and prompting them to think about working harder in the future. Therefore, popular classes can indeed encourage students to work hard in class and eliminate all past bad habits and correct past negative attitudes.

(II) Enhancing the willingness of students' parents to provide physical training for their children. The traditional Chinese emphasis on literature and disdain for martial arts, the weak literary atmosphere, have deeply influenced people's minds. Despite decades of promoting physical education, many still look down on it, believing that scholars should be quiet and studious, not jumping and running around. They often quote "not peeking into the garden for three years" to admonish their children. This situation is even more pronounced in Hong Kong. How do I know this? It's not a lie. Since arriving in Hong Kong, I have often received leave requests from students' parents. Even though their children are capable of physical training, they make up trivial excuses to avoid it, to ensure their children don't get tanned or injured, which is needless worrying and a short-sighted approach. This is a major reason why China's physical education has lagged behind. To correct their thinking, guide them, and increase their willingness to provide physical training for their children, besides other methods, the most effective is popular classes. Because popular classes are specialized training for their children's health, a direct demonstration that is most suitable for their children's needs. Indirectly, it shows that their children lack physical training and are physically weak, so they need to join the class. Therefore, all of this will catch their attention, give them a big stimulus and a profound response. After the training, their children's physique will be better than before, giving them a thorough understanding. Gradually, this can change their disregard for physical training. (End of Part Two)

### The Troubles of the Aggressor

— Written by Ze Lieqing, Translated by Cai Yunteng

The Twofold Difficulties Recognized by the Japanese

Since the Sino-Japanese War has fallen into a prolonged state, two anxieties have been hanging over our (Japanese) hearts. The first is the domestic economic problem, and the second is international relations. Currently, the joint pressure exerted on Japan by Britain, the United States, and France has become an obvious fact.

First, let us discuss the domestic economic problem. This problem is more important than any other. We can understand how much money the war requires simply by observing the huge national budget!

Normally, Japan is already very short of raw materials. The large quantities of materials used in the war must rely even more on foreign countries. Gasoline, cotton, and iron almost all depend on foreign imports. Moreover, foreign imports must be paid for in cash. However, Japan's national treasury funds are limited, and of course, it must rely on export earnings to pay for imports. Although this method is correct in principle for the national economy and personal economy, the income from Japanese exports is entirely the blood and sweat of the people.

In this war, we have no choice but to buy all kinds of goods from foreign countries, but the number of Japanese goods exported is very small. The reason for this is that Japanese goods are expensive, the prices of exports are too high, and foreigners mostly hate Japan and do not buy Japanese goods. If we rely solely on the cash earned from exporting Japanese goods to buy foreign goods, it goes without saying that it is a drop in the bucket. As the war drags on, we must buy all kinds of things from abroad. What will happen then? Will we continue to pay in cash? Will we borrow from abroad? Or will we not buy foreign goods at all? In past wars, Japan could still borrow from foreign countries, but this time that path is blocked. We only have the option of continuing to pay in cash, but paying in cash, given Japan's economic strength today, has already reached a point of exhaustion.

Once outside, one can see the lack of goods everywhere. Buses and jitney cars are restricted, which is due to the shortage of gasoline. Because of the iron shortage, even the street mailboxes have been replaced with smaller ones. Cotton products and absorbent cotton are also insufficient due to the interruption of imports. As the war continues, materials will become increasingly depleted.

Secondly—regarding international problems, it is extremely difficult to be optimistic. Currently, Japan is paying attention to six countries: Germany, Italy, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Among these six countries, Germany and Italy are Japan's fellow sufferers, which everyone knows. However, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have taken an offensive stance against Japan, especially the three countries Britain, the United States, and France, which have been constantly discussing steps to sanction Japan.

Regarding Japan's fishery problem with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union did not agree to Japan's request. If Japan really wants to fish freely, there are submarines and airplanes over there, which is not a game. Now Japan does not trust the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union does not trust Japan, so a shadow has been cast over the feelings of the two countries. However, international issues must be judged and resolved based on the magnitude of the event itself.

Recently, there are two actions of Japan in China that need to be noted. The first is Japan's occupation of Hainan Island. Hainan Island is separated from Taiwan by a narrow strip of water. It is located between Hong Kong and Singapore, and the island is rich in resources. In the future, Japan will advance into Southeast Asia. From a strategic point of view, it is an important military base. This has caused anxiety to Britain, the United States, and France, making them more concerned about the Sino-Japanese War.

The second is the continuous assassinations in the Shanghai concession. There are two concessions in Shanghai, one is the International Settlement, which is the same as the foreign settlements in Kobe and Yokohama forty years ago, and the other is the French Concession. These two concessions are the main bases for Chinese people in Shanghai to resist Japan. In February, assassinations occurred frequently. On February 19, Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the puppet "Reformed Government," and on the 21st, Li Guojie, a pro-Japanese figure, were assassinated in the concession. This anti-Japanese phenomenon among the Chinese is undoubtedly a reflection of the anti-Japanese sentiment of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Regarding this matter, Japan convened a meeting of the highest-ranking officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy. As a result, they demanded that the concession increase the number of Japanese police officers.

The most hateful country now is the United States. The United States refuses to sell airplanes to Japan, but is willing to sell them to France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the movement to prohibit the sale of oil and iron scrap to Japan is also surging. The budget for expanding armaments, especially the air force, in the Pacific region has also been announced. From this, it can be seen that the United States' offensive against Japan is becoming increasingly fierce.

Because Britain and France are encountering many events in Europe, it seems difficult to directly pressure Japan. Instead, they have turned to providing economic aid to China. The United States has lent 80 million yuan to China, and Britain has lent 10 million yuan. Furthermore, pilots from these countries have come to China in their individual capacities to participate in the war of resistance.

Why do Britain, the United States, and France have consistent interests? They believe that Japan's exclusive occupation of China is driving out their rights and interests in China. Previously, the Nine-Power Treaty stipulated respect for China's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the open door policy. Japan was also one of the signatory countries at the Washington Conference. However, last year, Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Arita issued a statement: "The situation in the Far East is completely different today. Japan cannot abide by the treaty now." Therefore, Britain, the United States, and France felt that Japan was breaking the treaty and successively lodged protests. The content of the protests was roughly the same, indicating that the three countries were taking consistent steps.

In summary, international relations with Japan have become very bad, but this is not just a problem for Japan alone. On one hand, it is the alliance between Japan and Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it is the alliance between Britain, the United States, and France, considering the outbreak of a future Second World War.

Therefore, the world problem centered on China and Japan should be studied and resolved with an extremely calm attitude.

Spring is spreading warmth across the earth, and green buds are sprouting on the treetops. However, the people of the world are still living a life that goes against nature.

### The Art of Pulling

— Geng Zhi

To give without return is impolite; thus: to push without pulling is unprofitable. Moreover, pushing is a passive action that prevents problems before they happen and removes troubles after they occur, unlike pulling, which pulls everything that is beneficial to oneself, a truly thorough active action. Therefore, pulling is to pushing as the wolf is to the lame wolf, inseparable, and also has independent value, especially that one must learn!

The primary skill in pulling is naturally pulling people. For example, if you want to become an official, you must learn to pull strings. The items for pulling strings include: inviting people to eat, go sightseeing, play, worshiping as a teacher; climbing in-laws, recognizing a godfather; recognizing fellow villagers, classmates, recognizing old friendships; sending gifts; paying respects at the yamen; taking the inner line through the senior wife, junior wife, sisters, or any woman... Each item, when studied carefully, can become a dedicated book: nothing is difficult in the world for a willing mind. I will not mention it here.

If you want to make a fortune, you must learn to pull directors. Because the quickest way to make a fortune, apart from becoming an official, is to run a company, open a store, or organize a factory. These avenues, as long as you can pull the first-class directors who are wealthy and reputable, the second-class directors who are wealthy but have no reputation, and the third-class directors who have no wealth but have a reputation, they will elect you as manager, open a branch company, a branch store, or a branch factory, and make you general manager, and you can make a fortune. If the company develops and is profitable, of course, you can make a fortune. Even if it doesn't develop, or even loses money or goes bankrupt, you can still make a fortune. Fishing in troubled waters has always been a secret skill passed down, and it is a fixed formula for shareholders to go bankrupt and managers or general managers to eat their fill.

Besides pulling directors, pulling shareholders is also important, but if you have directors above to rally, shareholders will respond to the news, and there will be no problem.

If you say that directors are elected by shareholders, how can they be pulled? Then I want to say to you: Foolish child, you cannot be taught! You must study hard! Because elections are just a formality, pulling is reality!

Recently, besides opening companies, etc., as a way to make a fortune, some people have the unconventional idea that running a school is also a good way to make money. Therefore, you must work hard to learn the art of pulling in running a school.

First, you must also know how to pull directors. The qualifications of the directors are the same as those of companies, etc. Second, you must know how to pull teachers: you must pull red teachers who are able to attract students, and you must especially pull black teachers who are able to work hard and be thrifty, help me make a fortune, be selfless and devoted to public service, and do not think of laying their hands on it. Third, you must know how to pull students: the principle is to accept all comers, the more the better; our school has thirty-six subjects, all of which are available, catering to students' various needs as a slogan; or advertise in the newspaper or put up posters, or distribute leaflets, or even hire runners or brokers as a means.

It is said that the principal is a leader in the cultural world. In our country, which values literature, the reputation is slightly better than that of a manager or general manager. Making a fortune is almost the same as that of a manager or general manager. It seems that in terms of fame and fortune, the principal's pulling is especially more important to learn cleverly than the manager's or general manager's pulling.

The second skill in pulling may be pulling credit. This pulling is the opposite of pushing.

To put it on a small scale: when playing soccer with someone, if you win, you shout to the crowd: Fortunately, I made that kick that secured the victory: if your brother shits and doesn't have toilet paper, if I didn't have waste paper to help you out of your difficulty, you wouldn't be able to stand up. Even the water-boiling boy can come up with a performance of "ugly boasting." To put it on a large scale: low-level junior staff, and workers who have worked hard, spared no effort, and made a fortune one day, when sharing dividends, are paid according to splitting seventeen shares, and get a fraction of one share, while the manager or general manager gets several shares alone; the white-robed young general and the cook, when seizing cities and territories, and the new general carrying the flag, are all credited to Zhang Shiguan and his son-in-law He Zongxian... Even the head of a whole country, who often oppresses the people and bullies the weak, calls himself the savior of the people and the protector of peace when giving speeches. In short, "all the unlucky, suffering, and loss-making bad things are pushed onto others," while all the smooth, prosperous, reputation-enhancing, status-enhancing, and income-generating good things are pulled onto oneself.

One pull after another, it seems that "three pulls" are needed to "reunite." However, there are really too many to learn for three pulls, and it is no longer just three pulls, which also goes beyond the circle of reunification. Now, I can only briefly mention a few to form a snake's feet.

People who write drafts and work as editors cannot help but learn this skill: there will be manuscripts when there is a shortage of manuscripts, and there will be good manuscripts when there are bad manuscripts. Generally, when there is no money, one can only bow, curry favor, and seize by trickery; when there is money, one can take from one to add to the other, or be thin to one and thick to the other. The former is a young newcomer, who is praised as an up-and-coming writer; the latter is an old writer, who is praised as an advanced figure in the literary world.

People who run booths and walk around on the Bund in Shanghai cannot help but learn this skill—

People who pull customers and frequent prostitutes—

Stop, if I keep pulling, it will become a mess. Let's stop here and not pull anymore.

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Aren't we treating you well now?"

"What about last night?" She twitched her nose and asked painfully, "How did you treat me? Have you forgotten?"

"I haven't forgotten. I'll always remember it. I'll remember it very clearly. However, I'm telling you, you shouldn't protect your father. You shouldn't let private feelings make you forget public anger! What happened last night, on the one hand, was to strike at your father, not you, and on the other hand, was for the necessity of our work, which is money. You are innocent, we know. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

"I understand, so I am now standing between my father and you to speak!"

"What about last night?"

"Last night—is already over!"

"What about tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow hasn't come yet. I don't know about what hasn't come!" She sincerely asked him, "What do you say about me tomorrow?"

"What do I say about you tomorrow—" He thought about it and told her very seriously, "Tomorrow, you can go to heaven, or you can go to hell!"

"Heaven, hell?" (58)

### In the Reed Thicket

— Si Fang

A Night at Zhaojiadu

Zhaojiadu, a desolate little ferry crossing downstream on the Huangpu River, is hidden in the reed thickets. Few boats dock here, and the silence throughout the day is terrifying. The wind blows through the reeds, rustling mournfully.

It is now evening. The evening tide of the Huangpu River crashes against the shore, the sound like a desolate lament. The reed thickets are buried in the thick darkness of the night, bowing their heads as the night wind whistles a weeping tune, causing them to sway left and right.

In the dark sky, a pale moon, like the face of a dead man, hangs, casting a faint, mournful, and sorrowful light.

Suddenly, rustling sounds emerge from the reed thickets, along with the sounds of footsteps moving in the shallow water. At the same time, faint whispers, mixed with the sobbing of the wind, rise and fall, indistinct and unclear.

Half an hour later, all sounds cease. Only the river, with a heavy voice, shouts, large clumps of foam swirling and crashing against the shore, rolling into the reed thickets.

The moon is obscured by a dark cloud, without a trace of light, and everything around is as black as lacquer.

In the reed thickets, a very faint, but rapid, breathing sound is revealed.

Amidst the shouting and roaring of the Huangpu River, the sound of wooden oars splashing water can be heard, making a "hua-la hua-la" sound.

A small boat quickly rows over from the opposite shore.

From the inky blackness of the night, one can vaguely see five or six people in yellow clothes sitting on the boat, all carrying guns on their backs, their eyes wide open like those of eagles, greedily looking at the dark night sky. Some are cheerfully whistling, sometimes bursting into loud laughter.

——Row faster!

A shout like a thunderbolt erupts in the silent night sky, and the sound of the wooden oars splashing water becomes more rapid, and the boat moves faster.

In the reed thickets, there is a slight commotion, and footsteps move through the water.

——Quick! Get ready! Chi Lao's boat is approaching.

A low command is given, followed by whispers among each other. Then, everything is silent again, except for the sobbing of the night wind, the lapping of the tide against the shore, and the sound of wooden oars striking the water in the middle of the river, like a depressing symphony playing in unison.

——Bang——

The first shot rings out from the reed thickets, followed by a series of gunshots. Bullets stream towards the small boat, like a driving rain mixed with hard hailstones. A cloud of thick smoke rises from the reed thickets, and firelight flashes in the dark night sky.

By the time the yellow-clothed men jump up in shock, raise their guns, and aim, they fall on the bow of the boat, fresh blood flowing gurglingly from the bow into the river. Endless bullets are shot from the reed thickets, and the bullets on the boat are also fired aimlessly into the reed mist.

The quiet Zhaojiadu is now lively. Bullets fly wildly in the air, and the shouts from the reed thickets are like roars from thousands of throats. The firelight reddens half the sky.

An hour later, the violent gunfire subsides, the firelight also disappears, and the smell of gunpowder and blood, mixed together, floats in the still air.

On the Huangpu River, a small boat is overturned, and several corpses roll with the waves, the yellow and turbid water mixed with fresh red blood.

In the reed thickets, fresh red blood also flows into the river. Several people emit painful moans, but they are drowned out by the majestic shouts and songs of triumph.

At this time, dawn has broken, and the morning light shines into the dense reed thickets.

### New Life at the End of the Century

— Shi Feng

One

The end

is coming;

the decayed

corpse of the old world

is beckoning you!

Two In Asia,

a hesitant giant

has stood up!

Standing firmly on the summit of the high mountain,

like an ancient sage,

lonely

and standing upright!

Three

Wild winds are swirling!

Morning rain is pouring!

Nurtured in the interplay of light and heat,

the century has been given new life again.
