### Wartime Shanghai Financial Market

— Zhu Boquan

Mr. Zhu Boquan's position in the domestic financial world is well known to readers. His observations on the dynamics of the Shanghai financial market during the war, from the perspective of an insider, are more profound and detailed than those of the average person. Therefore, we are eager to publish them. We hope readers will pay attention. Editor

1. Foreword

Shanghai is a major commercial port in China, holding the financial hub of the entire country. According to various statistics, as of the end of June 1937, the number of banks in Shanghai accounted for more than 32% of the total number of banks in the country (excluding branch banks). Among them, the paid-up capital of the 41 member banks accounted for 45% of the total paid-up capital of banks in the country, and the total assets accounted for 44.5% of the national total. Various deposits accounted for about 76% of the national bank deposits, excluding the Central Bank and other non-member banks. In addition, there are foreign banks, native banks, trust companies, silver firms, savings societies, and other financial organizations. Foreign banks and native banks, in particular, have a long history and deep influence in the Shanghai financial market, forming a three-legged balance of power with Chinese banks.

In recent years, the Shanghai financial community has suffered greatly, so it has been striving to improve. For example, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Shanghai banking and native banking industries successively established the United Reserve Association. Later, the banking industry established a clearing house and an acceptance house, strengthening solidarity and increasing strength. In November 1935, the currency system was reformed, concentrating the silver that controlled the national economic lifeline, unifying issuance, and further stabilizing the financial foundation. This achievement had already demonstrated its effectiveness before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and its value can be fully demonstrated during the war.

2. The Financial Market Before and After the Outbreak of War

In the first half of 1937, the general economic situation in the country showed a booming atmosphere. Since the currency system reform in 1935, general prices began to rise, and industry and commerce were stimulated by the price increases, showing a prosperous scene. Transactions in various markets were frequent, which was rare in recent years. In the first half of 1937, the total amount of Shanghai bank note exchanges increased by one-sixth compared to the same period last year, and the financial situation was also extremely stable. Interbank lending rates hovered around 10% interest. The foreign exchange market situation was consistently controlled by government banks, and stability was exceptional. The public debt market price reached over 89 yuan in June. The deposit and lending business of the banking industry also increased consistently. Unexpectedly, the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, shocking the market. The Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident followed, and a full-scale war between China and Japan unfolded.

Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, the first to be affected was the Shanghai financial community. The public debt market situation has declined sharply since July 7th. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Until the settlement period in July, the government stipulated a minimum price of 70 yuan to stabilize the situation. At that time, those who doubted the legal tender纷纷纷纷提取存欵,购买外汇或转存外商银行,资金逃避,爲数甚鉅. In early August, the situation in Shanghai became more serious, and the trend of withdrawals became even more intense. When the Shanghai Battle broke out on August 13th, Shanghai suddenly became a war zone, and people were panicked and uncontrollable. All exchanges were the first to suspend trading, and the banking industry was also ordered to suspend business for four days from August 13th. In order to maintain finance, the Ministry of Finance specially announced measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals. At the same time, the banking industry formulated supplementary measures to utilize the exchange system and determine the method of note remittance, which mitigated the financial panic. From August 17th, the banking industry resumed business across the board. Although there were still many people requesting withdrawals, they were limited. However, because the four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) lending associations and the Banking Association's United Reserve Association had methods for regulating the industry, they were able to cope with it easily, and people's minds tended to stabilize. By the end of the year, many depositors of various banks and native banks had redeposited the funds they had previously withdrawn. According to the Ministry of Finance's measures to stabilize finance, those who deposited legal tender in banks and native banks or opened new accounts after the war could withdraw legal tender at any time without restriction. At the same time, because the pre-war current deposits, in addition to the withdrawal limit, could be circulated with interbank remittance notes, the amount of deposits in each bank was not greatly reduced. At that time, the market situation generally showed a picture of currency contraction, credit stagnation, coupled with traffic obstructions, and commercial exchanges between various places and Shanghai were on the verge of being cut off, and almost all industries were in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to the blockage of the source of goods, prices soared, especially for necessities such as fuel and food. However, at that time, the government always maintained the foreign exchange price, so consolidating the credit of legal tender was by no means trivial.

3. Evolution of the Wartime Financial Market

Since the outbreak of the war, various financial conditions in Shanghai have largely changed with the environment, and they are all interconnected, or mutually cause and effect. It is not easy to analyze them. For the sake of convenience, the important evolutions of the financial market in the past year are described separately below:

(1) Interbank Remittance and Discounted Cash Before the war, the payment tools of Shanghai banks and native banks, in addition to legal tender cash, included two types of notes: one was the head note, which could be cashed on the same day and was no different from cash; the other was the remittance note, which could only be cashed the next day. The measures for stabilizing finance stipulated that current deposits of more than 300 yuan stored before the war, withdrawals were limited to 5% of the deposit balance per week, and could not exceed 150 yuan at most. At the same time, the Shanghai banks and native banks presented to the Ministry of Finance for approval: "In addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the regulations, each bank's current deposits, in business dealings, due to commercial needs, may be paid with interbank remittance notes outside the limits set by the Ministry." This type of interbank remittance note is allowed to be transferred between Shanghai banks, not paid in legal tender, and may not be used to purchase foreign exchange. It is completely different from the pre-war remittance notes that could be cashed the next day. Its purpose is to facilitate the circulation of industrial and commercial funds, while avoiding the escape of funds. During the January 28th Shanghai War, the promissory notes issued by Shanghai native banks were also temporarily suspended from being cashed the next day, only allowing interbank remittance, which was very similar to this situation. Shanghai industrial and commercial transactions are usually paid by transfer, and payments in legal tender are few. After the war, remittance notes were only allowed to be transferred between banks and could not be paid in cash, which had little impact on commercial needs. However, some foreign banks in Shanghai, because they have no dealings with Chinese banks and native banks, sometimes do not want to accept this type of note; and general import merchants, because they cannot purchase foreign exchange, gradually become discriminatory, and there are even those who lack legal tender funds. In order to facilitate use, they are often willing to exchange 100 yuan of remittance notes for 98 or 99 yuan of cash, thus starting the practice of discounted cash. General speculative merchants saw that there was profit to be made, and competed to make a living by exchanging cash; thus, remittance notes became the object of buying and selling. Initially, the discount for each thousand yuan was about 45 yuan to 120 yuan. Later, the circulation of remittance notes in the market became more and more, and the number of people exchanging cash also increased; in addition, the population of the concession increased sharply, and legal tender cash was required for living needs. Also, due to the active trading of the black market after the foreign exchange control, the discount rate continued to increase. By June of last year, the discount for each thousand yuan once reached more than 70 yuan. After the Banking Association's United Reserve Association came out to maintain it and made large-scale adjustments, the discount was stabilized at around 50 yuan. In November of last year, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell successively, and people were uneasy. Many people exchanged remittance notes for cash to purchase foreign exchange or cash, and the discount rate once again rose to more than 60 yuan. Soon, the war situation stabilized, and it returned to about 45 yuan. In January of this year, after the Banking Association's United Reserve Association officially managed it by announcing the buying and selling prices every day, the discount rate has stabilized at about 35 yuan per thousand yuan, with only a few cents of increase or decrease each day. In early March of this year, due to the impact of the foreign exchange and cash market situation, and at the same time, there was a saying in North China that the currency system was disturbed, the discount rate announced by the Reserve Association was raised to 40 yuan per thousand yuan, and soon rose to 50 yuan. At present, the market discount rate is still around 48 yuan.

2. Interbank Lending and Interest Rates After the currency system reform in 1935, the government originally planned to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. The preparations were not mature, and the Shanghai War had already started. In addition to restricting withdrawals, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four government banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) to organize joint offices and joint lending associations in major cities to unify authority and jointly assume the responsibility of regulating finance. The Shanghai Four Banks Lending Association specializes in interbank mortgage loans and discounting of commercial paper, mainly for discounting head notes. The interbank lending of remittance notes is entrusted by the Four Banks Lending Association to the Banking Association's United Reserve Association to handle it together with the original interbank lending. As of the end of September of the year before last, the loans of the Lending Association totaled more than 18 million yuan, and the interbank remittance loans released by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association also reached about 10 million yuan. After the war, banks and native banks were in great need of funds to prepare for withdrawals. With this assistance, they were able to cope with it easily. According to the statistics at the end of June last year, the total amount of loans released by the Four Banks Lending Association in various places totaled more than 50 million yuan. As of the end of last year, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of loans released by the Four Banks totaled 89 million yuan, of which about 16 million yuan were released in Shanghai, accounting for about 20% of the total, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared with September of the year before last. The amount of interbank remittance lending of the Shanghai Banking Association's United Reserve Association was more than 5 million yuan by the end of last year, a decrease of about 5 million yuan compared with September of the year before last.

There are two types of interbank lending rates in the Shanghai financial market: one is the interbank lending rate of the Bankers Association, which is the interest rate for interbank lending between native banks; the other is the interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Banking Association's United Reserve Association, which is the interest rate for interbank lending and discounting between banks. Since the establishment of the Four Banks Lending Association, it also announces the interbank lending rate and discount rate every day, and there are three different interest rates in the Shanghai financial market.

The interbank lending rate of the Bankers Association was 11% per thousand yuan per day in June and July of the year before last. In early August, due to the tightening of the Shanghai situation, it increased daily, reaching 19% on the 13th. After the opening of banks and native banks on the 17th, it stabilized at 20%. In November and December, it dropped to 15%, and in January of last year, it dropped to 10%, and there was no major fluctuation after that. It once rose to 14% in October, and then returned to the level, hovering around 12%.

The interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Banking Association's United Reserve Association are divided into remittance and national currency. In July of the year before last, the remittance and national currency lending rates were both 11% per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate was 12%. After the Shanghai Battle broke out on August 13th, the national currency lending rate and discount rate were as high as 30%, and the remittance also reached 20%. In October and November, the remittance lending rate and discount rate dropped to 18%, and in December, it rose to 20%. In early August of last year, the lending rate and discount rate of the national currency fell to 25%, and there has been no change since then.

The discount rate opened by the Lending Association in August of the year before last was 8% per week, and the loan interest rate was 30% per thousand yuan per day. From August of last year, the discount rate was changed to 7.5% per week, and the loan interest rate was changed to 25% per thousand yuan per day, which is equal to the interest rate opened by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association.

From the changes in the interbank lending rates of banks and native banks, it can be seen that the financial situation in Shanghai has gradually eased from tension. However, the above-mentioned interbank lending rate of native banks seems to be lower than the interbank lending rate of banks after the war, and the difference is nearly half. The reason for this is that remittance is originally the accounting standard of native banks, and all the head funds of banks have always been concentrated in native banks. The interest rate for interbank deposits is calculated according to the interbank lending rate. If the interbank lending rate increases, the remittance deposit interest rate of native banks for interbank deposits must also increase accordingly, which is tantamount to increasing the burden on native banks. Moreover, after the war, remittance notes cannot be paid in cash, and the remittance funds of native banks are more abundant than before, and they are even more unwilling to raise the interbank lending rate to add to the burden. In fact, the external lending interest rate of native banks is about 8% per month according to the on-site trading plus the average monthly interbank lending rate (for example, the monthly difference between the interbank lending rate of native banks in February this year is 3 yuan plus the on-site trading of 4.5 yuan is 7.5 yuan, that is, the monthly interest rate is 7.5%), which is not much different from the bank lending rate.

(3) Issuance of Legal Tender Since the currency system reform, the right to issue currency throughout the country belongs exclusively to the four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), and the issuance reserves of each bank are also concentrated under unified management. After this unprecedented reform, the financial foundation became more sound, so after the outbreak of the war the year before last, although people were extremely panicked, there was no problem with the currency.

At the beginning of the war, some people, in view of the past events of the European War, were quite concerned about currency inflation. However, judging from the figures in the inspection reports of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee after the war, although the total amount of issuance has increased, it does not seem to have currency inflation compared with before and after the war. According to the inspection report of the committee, the total amount of issuance at the end of 1937 was 1,639,098,000 yuan, which increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan at the end of June 1938. The increase rate was actually not as fast as in the initial stage of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the amount of legal tender issuance increased by 56.8 million yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, it increased by 37.9 million yuan, while in the first half of 1938, it only increased by more than 8.7 million yuan. The committee has not officially announced the issuance figures after June 1938, and there is no way to count them at present.

As for the amount of legal tender in circulation in Shanghai and the speed of its circulation, there is no significant increase in general observation. After the restriction of withdrawals, a part of the loan became a blocked account. In addition, with the stagnation of industry and commerce, the speed of currency circulation was greatly reduced.

(4) Foreign Exchange Control and Foreign Exchange Black Market Before the currency system reform, the foreign exchange price in China was allowed to rise and fall naturally. After the currency system reform, the foreign exchange price was centrally managed by the state banks, and the foreign exchange price became stable. At the beginning of the war, domestic funds once fled. At that time, commentators believed that the control of foreign exchange was a necessary measure during the war. However, the government authorities, with the special situation in China, did not act rashly. Until early March of last year, the so-called "United Reserve Bank" was established in North China to issue inconvertible banknotes in an attempt to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. In order to prevent this, the government had to announce the foreign exchange application rules on March 14th of last year, stipulating that banks could apply to the Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange when they needed foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting the receipts and payments. After the Central Bank approved it, it sold the foreign exchange at the statutory exchange rate. Imports of goods without legitimate purposes or unnecessary imports were not allowed to apply for purchase. In June of last year, it successively stipulated the types of imported goods to be restricted, and stipulated that each bank should provide the same amount of legal tender cash when applying for foreign exchange to prevent the abuse of deliberately exceeding the amount applied for. At the same time, in order to increase foreign exchange funds, the foreign exchange of export trade was also centrally managed by the state banks. All foreign exchange prices obtained by merchants for exporting goods should also be sold to the state banks. From August 8th of last year, it was also stipulated that the Central Bank would no longer accept applications for foreign exchange for imported goods imported after January 1st of last year. However, imports of necessities were still supplied as appropriate. At this point, foreign exchange control became more stringent.

Before the foreign exchange control, the Shanghai foreign exchange market generally followed the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank as the standard. All foreign commercial banks also abided by the gentleman's agreement and followed the Central Bank's listing. After the implementation of the control, this gentleman's agreement was virtually cancelled. At the same time, general import merchants had to buy at a high price outside the Central Bank because they could not purchase the full amount of foreign exchange from the Central Bank to meet their needs. In addition, those in the concession who are good at worrying about their personal property as a kind of insurance have purchased foreign exchange. Therefore, although the Central Bank still provides the approved foreign exchange at the original exchange rate, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai has been far more expensive than the statutory exchange rate.

The existence of the foreign exchange black market has an adverse impact on Shanghai's trade and finance. The remedy depends on the cooperation of foreign commercial banks and friendly countries. Recently, a new loan of 10 million pounds from China and Britain has been established and designated for balancing legal tender foreign exchange. Therefore, the international conditions for stabilizing China's foreign exchange have been ensured. In the future, we only hope that the people of the country will practice thrift, purchase fewer imported goods, and not seek private interests or speculate, so that the outflow of foreign exchange will not increase, and the black market will not only gradually stabilize, but it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of fundamental elimination.

(5) Over-the-Counter Trading of Public Debt The public debt market also occupies an important position in Shanghai's financial institutions. Banks and native banks not only regard public debt trading as a reliable investment, but also use it as a method of regulating funds. When there is a lot of idle capital, they purchase and store public debt. When there is a shortage of funds, they sell it. The market has the nature of a second business reserve. In the past, there were more than 30 kinds of domestic public debt. After the consolidation in 1936, it has been merged into a unified public debt with an annual interest rate of 6%, which is issued in five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In order to balance the national treasury revenue and expenditure and revive the economy, a revival public debt has been issued. This public debt has no trading in the market. After this consolidation, the financial foundation became more sound, the creditworthiness turned stable, and the price gradually increased. In June 1937, the market price of each debt reached about 89 yuan at the highest. After the outbreak of the war, the situation changed suddenly.

After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out in early July of the year before last, the Shanghai public debt market showed a sharp downward trend. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Finally, the Ministry of Finance restricted the minimum price of unified public debt to 70 yuan to stabilize the situation. After the Shanghai Battle broke out, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange suspended business, but over-the-counter trading was still active. The daily trading volume increased from 120,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Later, it gradually became a semi-open market. Initially, the over-the-counter market price was around 40 yuan. At the end of January of last year, in order to avoid the escape of funds, the government changed the repayment of principal and interest of the unified public debt to interbank remittance funds. The over-the-counter market price fell below 40 yuan. The lowest price in February reached a new record of 37 yuan. From March to June, the lowest price was 40 yuan and the highest was 60 yuan. By the time the principal and interest of the public debt due at the end of July were still paid by the government in legal tender, the over-the-counter market price stabilized at around 545 yuan. At the end of September, the European situation was tense, and securities prices fell all over the world. Shanghai was also unable to avoid this. The price of each debt fluctuated by several cents every day. After the peace news came out, it returned to the old level. Later, because the foreign exchange market was stable and there was no profit to be made from buying foreign exchange, some idle capital tended to go to the public debt market. The market price of each debt rose uniformly. In January of this year, the unified Class A public debt reached a high price of 63 yuan. However, at the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because China had lost a large amount of tariff revenue, the amount of debts guaranteed by tariffs paid by the government had accumulated to a huge amount of 17.5 million yuan. Therefore, it specifically announced that it would no longer pay for pre-war long-term debts in the future. The news came and caused a great uproar in the public debt market. The price of most of the debts fell by more than 6 yuan in one day. Later, the government announced that the principal and interest of the domestic debt due at the end of January would still be paid in legal tender, but the payment would be made in Chongqing. The Shanghai side could collect it in six installments from the three banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), which would be paid in full within six months. Thus, people's minds were slightly settled, and the debt market recovered. Recently, a new loan from China and Britain has been established, and the market situation has become more active. At present, the highest market price of each debt is around 56 yuan, and the lowest is around 48 yuan. Compared with the market price before the war, it has fallen by about 30 yuan. The market price of the national salvation public debt issued after the war has always been around 36 yuan, and there has been no change so far.

(6) Revival of the Cash Market The Shanghai Gold Market was originally a place for speculators to operate. In the past, the number of transactions per month often reached 34 million bars. After the currency system reform, it became deserted. The number of transactions per month was only 45,000 bars. After the Shanghai Battle broke out, it completely stopped. China's currency system was originally based on silver. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, it has become a managed currency. The foreign exchange price has long lost its connection with the changes in world gold and silver prices. Since the government implemented foreign exchange control in March of last year, speculators have once again used the changes in the world gold and silver ratio to manipulate it. As a result, the cash transactions in the Shanghai non-public market suddenly became active. After May of last year, the Shanghai cash price was affected by the London market, and the price rose. In mid-June, it rose to 2,000 yuan (the standard gold price of ten taels). It once softened and then rose again, reaching 2,068 yuan in November. In early March of this year, due to the lack of cash chips and the purchase in North China, it once created a high price of 1,200 yuan. At present, it is still hovering around 2,100 yuan. Although the cash market can affect the movement of a part of the funds, because the foreign exchange foundation of China has been stabilized, and the Sino-US Silver Agreement has also been extended last year, it does not seem to have any impact on the entire finance.

(7) Changes in Note Exchange Shanghai's note exchange is divided into three groups: Chinese banks, native banks, and foreign banks. The note exchange of Chinese banks was established in January 1933 and is hosted by the Banking Association's United Reserve Association. Its exchange procedures are similar to those in European and American countries. Native banks also have the organization of remittance headquarters, but their exchange methods are very old. As for the note collection and settlement between the Bund banks (including foreign banks and the three banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China)), there is only a reconciliation method, and there is no organization and system of the clearing house.

Before the war, the bank note exchange was held twice a day at 1:00 pm and 3:30 pm. After the war, due to the reduction in notes, it was changed to once a day at 3:00 pm. From January to July 1937, the average daily transaction volume of the exchange was more than 29 million yuan. From August to December, the daily average was only 7 million yuan, which was about 4 to 1. From January to July 1938, the daily average was only more than 6 million yuan. From August to December, it improved slightly, and the daily average was about 9 million yuan. Among the exchange amounts in various months after the war, December 1937 and December 1938 were the lowest, with a daily average of only 3.6 million yuan. However, the exchange amount has gradually increased recently. In January of this year, the daily average exchange amount has reached more than 24 million yuan, which is close to the daily average amount before the war, indicating that commercial transactions in Shanghai have gradually become more active under special circumstances.

The note exchange of native banks is called reconciliation of public orders. The daily number of public order settlements includes the number of interbank lending transfers, which is different in nature from the note exchange figures of banks and is difficult to compare. However, in general observation, the trend of the number of public order receipts and settlements of native banks is the same as the rise and fall of the number of bank note exchanges. As for the note receipt and settlement method of the native bank industry, it has been slightly improved after the war. In the past, each bank sent old clerks to collect the notes separately. Now, each bank sends two exchange staff members to the headquarters for centralized processing from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm every day. In addition, the public orders for reconciliation of accounts among native banks have always stipulated that large public orders should be issued for those who are full of 500 yuan, and small public orders should be issued for those who are less than 500 yuan and zero numbers. They should be settled with the native bank reserve every day. In November of last year, the native bank association decided to cancel the names of large and small orders. No matter how large or small the number is, one public order should be issued and settled every day, which has simplified the procedures.

As for the note receipt and settlement procedures of the Bund banks, after sending and verifying the notes to each other, large transfer slips are used to make a general transfer by the Bank of China. After the difference is settled with each other every day, the method of deposit or cash settlement is used, and there is no organization of the clearing house at first. Since the outbreak of the war, the large transfer slip method adopted in the past has been abandoned, and each bank sends staff members to the HSBC Bank at 11:30 am every day to centrally verify it. In addition, foreign commercial banks have never had deposit and debt dealings with Chinese banks. After the war, for the convenience of collection and settlement, foreign commercial banks have set up current accounts with our Central Bank as an exception, and the Central Bank has also opened current accounts with foreign commercial banks. Therefore, the notes receivable and payable daily between Chinese and foreign banks are entrusted to each other for collection and transferred within the current accounts, which is much more convenient than before.

(8) Status of the Financial Industry Since the outbreak of the war, the environment in which the Shanghai financial industry is located has been very different. Leaving aside foreign commercial banks for the time being, as far as Chinese banks and native banks are concerned, since the Lugouqiao Incident in July of the year before last, there has been a trend of withdrawals. In the month before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the deposits of various banks and native banks clearly decreased. After the Shanghai War broke out, banks and native banks suspended business for four days. After the government issued measures to stabilize finance, people's minds were slightly settled, and there was no large-scale decline in deposits. Later, as the war zone expanded, the rich from various places flocked to Shanghai to take refuge with their assets. As a result, the deposits of various banks and native banks gradually increased. However, most of these increased deposits were current deposits. On the part of banks and native banks, they could not but accumulate reserves to cope with them.

After the war, the business policy of each bank and native bank strived for stability, and they were very cautious about various loans. Most of them reduced the scope of business and only accepted deposits but did not release them. Fortunately, some of the pawnbrokers of the banks and native banks who suffered losses in the war have recently made profits from the high prices in Shanghai, in addition to making up for the war losses. Therefore, the pre-war loans of the banks and native banks, except for the customers who suspended business during the war, can often be recovered as scheduled. In addition, the business of each bank, in addition to some loans, foreign exchange and other businesses, was inevitably stagnant after the war, while other businesses such as custody warehouses, real estate trusts, etc., have increased compared with before the war. This kind of abnormal development is the only phenomenon under the special environment in Shanghai at present, and it goes without saying that it cannot last long.

In the war period, the losses on the assets of banks and native banks were inevitable. Fortunately, most of the banks and native banks were generally operating steadily and were well prepared in peacetime, and the previous profits were more than enough to offset the current losses. Only a very small number of banks with a smaller scope suffered from the war and were said to have had difficulties in turnover. As for those who went bankrupt as a result, there was only one bank. At the same time, among the four banks that suspended business one month before the outbreak of the war, two have resumed business one after another last year.

The four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) are the largest government banks in the country and have outstanding influence in the financial world. Their headquarters were originally located in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, these four government banks have moved their headquarters to the inland and set up institutions in various provinces in the southwest and Hong Kong. Shanghai's financial power has tended to be dispersed. At present, the ways and objects of each bank in Shanghai using funds in peacetime have all felt congested and reduced after the war. Moreover, because the government actively promotes and encourages investment in the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the inland, the general commercial banks in Shanghai have tended to develop in the inland. Recently, there have been many banks that have established branches in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The financial center has tended to shift, and the future development is worthy of attention.

### The Significance of Anglo-Soviet Military Cooperation

According to a reliable Rome dispatch carried in today's Hong Kong-based "China Mail," "The Soviet Union has suggested to the British that, in the event of war, the British are free to use Vladivostok and Kamchatka." The stated purpose of this cooperation is to jointly confront Japan. The Soviet Union's condition for allowing British and Soviet use of these two locations is that Britain supplies the Soviet Union with military supplies via Canada. If this is the case, then Britain will use Vladivostok as a base and Kamchatka as a base for the Canadian Air Force. Britain not only possesses the Singapore naval base on the ocean, sufficient to resist Japanese naval aggression and strike at Japanese power in the Pacific, but it can also cut off the Japanese army's communication in the Sea of Japan and threaten the Japanese islands with air power. If this cooperation is indeed realized, then even if the bellicose Japanese warlords do not yield to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they will inevitably face complete failure.

Japanese imperialism not only relies on the security of the Sea of Japan to conduct its continental aggression, but it also depends on this route of communication to secure the results of its aggression. Before the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident), Japan almost completely neglected the development of its Sea of Japan coastline, the so-called "Inner Japan." The achievements of several decades of development since the Meiji Restoration were entirely concentrated on the Pacific coast, the so-called "Outer Japan." Even its railways developed in a north-south direction, with very few east-west lines. However, since the "September 18th Incident," Japanese aggressors have keenly realized that to safeguard their spoils on the continent, they must fully expand the communication lines between the Japanese islands and the mainland, and shorten these communication lines and time as much as possible. Therefore, they adopted a three-pronged approach: first, building new ports in northern Korea, namely Chongjin, Unggi, and Najin; second, actively developing various ports on the west coast of the Sea of Japan, such as Tsuruga and Maizuru; and third, accelerating the construction of railway networks in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. As a result, the communication lines between mainland Japan and the continent have been greatly shortened. For example, the route from Changchun to Tsuruga via Chongjin is more than 750 kilometers shorter than the route via Dalian. Transporting goods from Changchun to Osaka via the Changtu line through Chongjin takes 17 hours less than going via Dalian, and passenger transport takes 21 hours less.

The construction of the three ports in northern Korea not only economically deprived Vladivostok of its position as a transportation hub, but also has extremely important political and military significance. Although the Japanese army claims to want to achieve self-sufficiency on the mainland through "local sourcing," this hope remains empty in the near future because most of the Japanese army's food still needs to be supplied from mainland Japan. The production of military supplies in "Manchuria" cannot supply much of the necessary materials; at best, it can only provide basic raw materials, which still need to be processed by Japanese mainland arsenals to become finished products. Politically, if this line of communication is cut off, not only will there be complete panic in "Manchuria," but there is also the possibility of major chaos in Korea. According to a report by the U.S. Foreign Policy Association, the Eighth Route Army, which infiltrated the Northeast last year, is very active, posing an even greater threat.

It is very clever of Britain to focus on this Japanese throat. If it can genuinely cooperate with the United States and the Soviet Union, then restraining the Japanese warlords is extremely easy. If the British and Soviet air forces can exert their maximum power, then the Japanese islands will immediately become scorched earth. The ease with which Japanese city facilities and house construction can be destroyed, and the fact that the entire archipelago can be turned into ruins in a short period of time, need not be mentioned. The fact that its industries and businesses, as a result of capitalist development, are concentrated in a few major cities, such as the Tokyo-Yokohama area, the Osaka-Kobe area, and northern Kyushu, is the most vulnerable point of Japan. If Japan's enemies can attack this weakness, the destruction of the Japanese empire will come easily. Japan is also aware of the danger of having its Sea of Japan communication lines cut off, so the military is planning to build an undersea passage to prepare for any eventuality. However, an undersea transportation route cannot be completed in a year or two. If Japan's enemies can take advantage of the period before its completion to inflict a major blow, then eliminating a global aggressor and safeguarding genuine peace in the Far East can be easily achieved.

### The Battle in Northern Jiangxi Enters a New Stage: Our Forces in Nanchang Shift to Favorable Positions; Increased Soldiers in Northern Hunan Attempt to Invade Southward

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The great battle in northern Jiangxi is still fierce. Due to our fierce counterattacks, [the enemy] has suffered a great blow. All [enemy troops] are now under our complete encirclement and control. Fierce battles are raging for the high ground near Anyi County, including Wangjiaqiao, Changshan, Wangshi Temple, and Taishan. Intense fighting is also taking place near Wanjiabu, including Tangkou, Tujiapu, Hucun, Wanshou Town, and Jiukou. [The enemy], invading from southeast of Fengxin, is still being blocked by us in the Wanshou Palace, Miaoshan, and Zhaoshan area of Xinjian County. South of Ruoxi, our [forces] are fighting fiercely north of Huajiashan, Nanshan, and Wufengshan. Intense fighting is also taking place northeast of Wuning, including Guanzhengshan, Shitishan, and east of Zilishanshan. Statistics show that enemy casualties have reached 7,000 to 8,000 in the past week, and we have also suffered considerable casualties. One of our units in the Fengxin-Anyi area has launched a flank attack on [the enemy], [capturing] quite a few [enemy soldiers]. It is reported that one of our strike teams has advanced to the vicinity of Ruichang.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] Military officials of the Chinese government here stated that the Japanese report of capturing Nanchang yesterday has not yet been confirmed, or it may still be in the hands of the Chinese army, which is not yet known. Neutral observers believe that the Japanese army has not yet completely occupied Nanchang, because the Japanese army usually occupies a station or a corner of the city and claims to have occupied the entire city. Chinese military officials admit that there is indeed fierce fighting near Nanchang, and the Chinese army is currently counterattacking Anyi.

[Shanghai, 27th] Unconfirmed foreign news: After the battle on the Nanxun line intensified, [the enemy] who broke through our positions between Qiujin and Yongxiu advanced along the highway to Anyi and then divided into three routes. One route advanced on Nanchang from Wanjiabu, one route attacked Jing'an to the west as cover, and one route advanced along the highway on Gao'an, attempting to cut off the Xiang-Gan Railway in the Jinjiang area and outflank Nanchang from the rear. For strategic reasons, starting on the 26th, we destroyed all buildings that could be used by the enemy, such as the Zhongzheng Bridge and the airport on the Gan River, preparing to abandon Nanchang. After we withdrew, [the enemy] advanced from the highway to the opposite bank of the Gan River, looting civilian boats to cross the river. Their engineers are repairing a temporary bridge on the ruins of the Zhongzheng Bridge. Currently, we are entering favorable positions. The 1.2 million population of Gan [Nanchang], has been repeatedly evacuated, and before the abandonment, there were fewer than 10,000 people left. Moreover, it has been repeatedly bombed, and the city is in terrible condition. Economically and strategically, it has lost its importance. [The enemy]'s invasion this time was carried out without regard for casualties, fighting to the death with us, so the losses were the greatest since the second stage of the war of resistance. Obtaining an empty city is actually not worth the loss.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] According to well-informed sources, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has recently moved from Nanchang to Ji'an, 130 miles to the south.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th Noon] Local newspapers reported that the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking Nanchang for the past week, with two purposes: (1) to cut off the railway connection between Zhejiang and Hunan, in other words, to cut off the connection between the Chinese army in southern Zhejiang and Shanghai and the central government; (2) to use Nanchang as a base to invade Changsha and attempt to occupy the entire Yuehan Railway line.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 27th] According to local Chinese newspaper opinions, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Nanchang this time is the most intense battle since the fall of Hankou. Its purpose is to open up the Yuehan Railway line, cut off the route from Zhejiang to the interior, and consolidate the Japanese army's occupied areas' transportation lines. Before this goal is achieved, the Japanese army only has the Yangtze River as a transportation route. Some people believe that if China can launch a large army to counterattack Jiujiang or Pukou to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply line, then the Japanese in Hubei will become turtles in a jar.

[Central News Agency, Linchuan, 26th] On the 24th, the enemy on the Nanxun [Nanchang-Jiujiang] line fiercely attacked Malukou (about 50 miles northwest of Nanchang) and engaged in fierce fighting with our troops. The main force of the enemy arrived in Anyi on the 24th and is now leading about 300 to 400 new [enemy] soldiers and four tanks, with no unusual movements.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] The enemy advancing east along the Xiang-Gan Highway has used a large amount of poison gas against our defending troops, and most of our soldiers have been poisoned. This afternoon, [the enemy] took the opportunity to invade Wushiqiao and continued to charge fiercely with tanks, advancing to the Niuxing Railway Station at one point. Our army bravely fought back and repelled [the enemy]. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Wushiqiao area.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 27th] At 9:00 PM on the 25th, Captain Uryu Takeo, commander of the [Japanese] squadron, and Lieutenant Suimoto Takao, squadron officer, were killed by us in Chenzhuang, northeast of Wuxue.

[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 27th] Our troops counterattacking Anyi are making smooth progress. On the 26th, they occupied the [enemy] strongholds of Fenghuangshan (4 kilometers east of Anyi), Hushan (19 kilometers southeast of Anyi), and Chenjia [unclear] (13 kilometers southeast of Anyi) and are advancing on the Xianxi-Anyi line and the city.

[Central News Agency, Taiping, 27th] In the morning of the 26th, we launched a large-scale attack on the [enemy] in [unclear] Mountain (southeast of Guichi). We encountered [the enemy] near Panhong Village (south of Qishan) and Xucun.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 27th] About two [Japanese] regiments have arrived in Yangloudong and Yanglousi in the past two days, on the 20th about 1,000 [Japanese soldiers] arrived in Minbanpu, 500-600 in Huaqiao, and [Japanese] soldiers have also increased in Tongcheng, with intentions to attack us.

[Central News Agency, [unclear], 27th] In the first half of this month, our army divided its forces to attack various [enemy] strongholds in Zhongtiao Mountain. We engaged in fierce fighting with about 1,000 [enemy] soldiers from the Taniguchi Regiment in [unclear], Xijiaokou, and Hejiacheng, killing and wounding over 200 [enemy] soldiers, including two officers. Our army, in the Jinshezhen area north of Zhongyang City, double-crossed the Kanamori Regiment, killing and wounding a total of 113 [enemy] soldiers below the platoon leader of the Yada Detachment. On these two routes, our casualties were only over 100 people. On average, our [enemy] casualties were in a ratio of one to three.

[Central News Agency, Xingxian, 27th] The [Japanese] troops from Linfen are providing eastern support to Fushan, with nearly 1,000 people in total. On the 21st and 22nd, they engaged in fierce fighting with us near the Xige River southwest of the city. Currently, the center of the battle has shifted to the Geqita and Shijia areas east of the city.

### The Rapidly Growing China Industrial Cooperative Association: Mr. Alley Reports on his Northwest Inspection at a Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Chongqing

[Chongqing Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we have lost cities with dense industrial areas. The workers in these cities and the machinery in the factories did not fall into the hands of the enemy. The workers would rather scatter in all directions, offering up their last bit of strength and their only iron nail to their beloved motherland, hoping to achieve final victory. This is the origin of the China Industrial Cooperative Association and the focus of its work.

To help everyone understand the development of its work, the China Industrial Cooperative Association hosted more than forty Chinese and foreign journalists in Chongqing. Mr. Liu Guangpei delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of this reception. Then, Mr. Alley, the initial initiator of the association, was invited to report on his inspection of various industrial cooperatives in the Northwest.

Mr. Alley, an American, with the simplicity of the Soviet people, stood up and said sincerely:

"I never thought we could have any success before, but after returning from my inspection of various places in the Northwest, I was surprised by the rapid development of the China Industrial Cooperative Association. Chinese workers have a very strong cooperative spirit. Although they have little education, they can produce various items for the front and the rear after a short period of training. Because these cooperatives are small in scale, the relationship between the workers and the cooperative is very close. The workers regard the cooperative as their own home, so they always try to save on the cooperative's expenses. Workers can find ways to buy machines with an original value of 1,600 yuan for half the price.

"When the workers in Hankou were evacuated last year, Madame Chiang sent a group of female workers to the Northwest. These female workers worked in the mountains or in earthen kilns. The environment is obviously much more difficult than before, but if someone were to ask them if they would like to return to their original places, they would definitely answer no, because they now have their own organizations and their own chairpersons. In their work, they can also work for their own benefit and the benefit of the entire nation. They bring their babies with them, and their parents and husbands are also by their side. These husbands used to spend all day chatting in tea houses, doing nothing, and relying solely on their wives to make a living, but now they also have an interest in working."

Everyone was excited to hear this news.

"The workers in the cooperative have a very strong organizational ability," Mr. Alley continued. "There are already joint cooperative organizations in the Northwest, as well as cooperative hostels, which are set up to solve the difficulties that workers encounter in their lives and when traveling and shopping. These hostels are cheap and clean, and other places can follow suit.

"The products of the cooperative mostly use waste materials and local products as raw materials. For example, dry batteries are mostly made by collecting and改造廢電池来加以改造廢電池來加以改造 old batteries. Military uniforms and blankets are made from the unique products of the Northwest. In the past, these wools were transported to Japan by the truckload, and Japanese goods were exchanged for them. Now, the wool cooperatives make products to supply the front lines.

"The Northwest has plenty of raw materials!" he lamented. "Everywhere there is soda, crystal salt, sugarcane... If these raw materials are manufactured, they will become indispensable items for the front and rear of China.

"Now more than half of the enthusiastic young people in China have gone to the front lines. In fact, the economic war in the rear is as important as the gun war on the front lines. Our Industrial Cooperative Association is the hub for promoting the work of all industrial cooperatives. We have already established six or seven hundred cooperatives, and there is an urgent need for young people with expertise in industry, so we hope that everyone will actively participate."

After this report was completed, everyone was very interested, especially the foreign journalists. They asked questions about what they did not understand, and Mr. Alley answered them one by one:

Q: Can industrial cooperatives succeed?

A: From the time of their establishment to now, none have failed in their operations.

Q: How many industrial cooperatives do you plan to set up? How much funding do you need?
A: We plan to set up three thousand from the Northwest to the Southeast, and the funding only needs one percent of the US$35 million in American defense funds.

Q: How many people are now living on these cooperatives?

A: Six thousand people, plus their families.

Q: How many types are there in total?

A: Fifty.

Q: Are they all different from ordinary consumer cooperatives?

A: Completely different.

Q: What kind of people do you hope will come to work?

A: People who can endure hardship and bravely shoulder the responsibility of resisting Japan and building the country! (Zhi Chao)

### Mussolini's Speech Expresses Demands on France, Affirms Close Relations Between Germany and Italy, and States Unwillingness for Unlimited Military Expansion

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] Mussolini's speech at the Fascist 20th anniversary celebration in the stadium here was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, so that some parts of his speech were drowned out by the cheers. He said, "This celebration is held at a time of serious European situation. Our actions will not be diverted by the fear of war. The word peace is now as prevalent as counterfeit money, but we have been working for a long period of peace for the construction of Europe. Various attempts from the outside to overthrow the Berlin-Rome axis are naive and ridiculous. The Berlin-Rome axis is not only a relationship between the two countries, but also a relationship between two revolutions, and modern civilization arises from these two revolutions. We will do our best to deal with the anti-totalitarian front. The events in Central Europe have become a predetermined fate. When I spoke in Genoa, I mentioned the differences between Italy and France" (at this time, the audience expressed contempt for France). "In a few days or a few hours, the Spanish National Army will launch its final attack, and Madrid will become the tomb of communism. The problem of Italian colonies was raised to France on December 17th of last year (when Italian congressmen shouted about colonies), mentioning Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez. Geographically, politically, and militarily, the Mediterranean is Italian, so we must implement armament. Today's so-called order is to build more cannons, battleships, and airplanes regardless of the cost. Our path has already been chosen, and our doctrine is very clear. Our revolution is not yet complete. If we speak of social customs and ethics, the revolution has hardly begun. How successful has our past twenty years of efforts for fascism been? Let others settle it. However, we can say with certainty that our achievements are very significant and will remain for centuries to come. Although we believe that permanent peace is the scourge of civilization, we also believe that a long period of peace is necessary to ensure the development of European civilization. Although others have asked us to find ways to promote peace, we will not engage in promoting peace until our sacred and inviolable rights are respected by other countries. The events in Central Europe were destined to happen. I dare to declare that if the democratic countries see the countries they created with their own hands suddenly die prematurely and weep, we have sufficient reason not to mourn with them. However, morally speaking, there is no reason to attack this issue. History has repeatedly proven that if a nation has sufficient manpower and sufficient military strength but cannot flex its muscles, it means that the nation has become a thing of the past and is no longer capable of fulfilling its new mission." He then mentioned the colonial issue, saying, "These colonial issues include Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. The French government can freely reject these repeatedly raised issues or only talk about them. However, if the gap between the two countries deepens as a result, making it difficult to bridge, then they will no longer have any complaints. If the current situation does not change, we hope not to hear the names of brother countries and sister countries again in the future (France and Italy are both Latin nations, and there is a custom of calling them this). Their relationship is a relationship of strength, and this relationship of strength is the element that determines our policies. Moreover, what we call the Mediterranean includes the Adriatic Sea. Our interests in that area are very important. However, we do not want to exclude the interests of the Slavic nations in that area, so peace has been maintained there for the past two years. The most fundamental luxury is that we must arm ourselves. Today's so-called order is to build more cannons, battleships, and airplanes regardless of the cost, regardless of any method, and even exclude the so-called national life completely. When you are strong, you will be loved by your friends and feared by your enemies. Since the dawn of time, the voice that has been passed down from generation to generation is "Woe to the unarmed." Comrades, the glorious brown clothes on your bodies are embellished with a color as red as blood. When the interests of the country are harmed, we are prepared to shed blood to defend them. Today is a great day for you, motivated by courage, sacrifice, and faith. You have given a major impetus to the wheels of history. I will now ask you, do you hope for glory or for a comfortable life? Do you feel that there is anything impossible? Do you still remember our three major creeds: "Faith, obedience, combat"? That's all. The secret of all victory lies in these three words."

[Central News Agency, Rome, 26th] Political figures here recently declared that Premier Mussolini's speech today could ease the Mediterranean situation. Even if this prospect is very weak, it should not be ignored. A careful reading of the Premier's speech reveals that the most important part is the section on the relationship between France and Italy, which clearly indicates that the Spanish issue is no longer an obstacle to relations between the two countries. The only thing that remains to be resolved is the colonial issue, but the Premier only uses the word "issue" and does not use the word "demand". As for the so-called colonial issue, according to well-informed sources, Italy's minimum wishes are nothing more than the following: (1) The legal status of Italian immigrants in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) France should cede the railway line from the port of Djibouti to Addis Ababa to Italy. (3) A part of the French port of Djibouti should be designated as a free port for Italy to use. (4) Reduce the Suez Canal passage fee. (5) Allow Italy to participate in the Suez Canal management rights. It seems that the so-called natural wishes of Italy have now officially targeted Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. Diplomatic sources say that in view of the speeches delivered successively by King Emmanuel III and Premier Mussolini, it is known that Italy is now waiting for France to take the initiative in order to reopen negotiations. As for the reason why the Premier mentioned the Adriatic Sea in his speech, it was probably to indicate that no third country should be allowed to set foot on the Adriatic coast.

The British side attaches importance to it, but believes that it will not have a bad impact.

[Associated Press, London, 27th] Although some parts of the Mussolini's speech were full of warlike rhetoric, British political circles believe that the speech is very hopeful and indicates that the problems between France and Italy can be resolved soon. There has been much criticism here for Mussolini's public demands for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. (1) Mussolini and French Laval concluded an agreement in 1935, and announced the abolition of this agreement on December 17 of last year, stipulating that the Italian people of Tunisia have special rights. It is heard that France is prepared to recognize Italy's special status in the area, but France, with the support of the United States, will definitely reject any demands that threaten the Bizerta naval base or important African ports belonging to Britain and France. (2) After Italy conquered Abyssinia, Djibouti lost its main value to France, and Italy's demands on Djibouti will be discussed by France and Italy.

[London, 27th] Foreign news Mussolini's speech in Rome last night has been carefully studied here and no public comment has been made. After reading it, authoritative sources here believe that it is not much different from the recent speech by the Italian King, and it does not seem to have any adverse impact on the current chaotic European situation. Mussolini's strong support for the German-Italian axis and his clarification of Italy's urgent needs are considered to be within expectations here and are being closely studied. At the same time, they are very pleased with Mussolini's expression of a desire for Europe to enjoy a long period of peace. It is generally believed that there is still room for negotiation and adjustment between France and Italy. Therefore, in this speech, Mussolini tried his best to avoid radical words, and did not express any intention to refuse Franco-Italian negotiations. Even with regard to the demands he put forward, there was no complexity or expansion. The British have no doubt about the importance of the Mediterranean or the Adriatic Sea to Italy, so there is no need for any concern on the British side regarding the Premier's remarks on this issue. Mussolini's mention of the danger of ideological conflict coincides with Chamberlain's recent statement on Thursday that "Britain does not want to create groups of ideological opposition in Europe".

French political circles express the limits of discussion

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] France believes that the main intention of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech is that Italy has for the first time publicly raised its demands for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, without mentioning Nice, Savoy, and Corsica. It is heard that France will take this opportunity to reopen negotiations with Italy through diplomatic channels.

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet, after carefully studying the French translation of Mussolini's speech, believes that the overall situation has not changed, because Mussolini still insists on making demands on France. Therefore, direct negotiations between France and Italy are impossible. However, Mussolini has not closed the door to negotiations with Britain and France. French officials believe that Mussolini's statement that the Mediterranean has important relations with Italy is denied, but they believe that France also has equally important relations, because its very long coastline is also in the Mediterranean. An official spokesman said that Premier Daladier's policy has not changed slightly, that is, France will never give up an inch of territory. The three issues of Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal raised by Mussolini are actually French issues. If Italy's demands can be abandoned, France is willing to consider negotiations. However, it is hoped that countries related to the Mediterranean and the general situation will jointly establish an agreement to resolve them.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech this morning has been commented on by political figures here as follows: Since he did not make an irremediable statement, the difficulties encountered in the relations between France and Italy have not become more serious as a result. The fact that he referred to his speech in the port of Genoa last year shows that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy cannot be resolved before the end of the Spanish Civil War. France's original position has not changed in this regard. In other words, the management rights of the Suez Canal and matters related to the French port of Djibouti in East Africa can be submitted for discussion. However, as far as the status of Italian immigrants in French Tunisia is concerned, France has no reason to accept other methods except in accordance with the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935. In addition, Premier Mussolini pointed out that the problems that Italy should solve in the Mediterranean are not limited to French-Italian cases. He said that Italy should be in a superior position in the Adriatic Sea. Although this statement is euphemistic, it is actually a warning to Germany not to take any action regarding the port of Trieste (which was ceded to Italy by Austria after the European War and has now been opened as a free port). In short, although Premier Mussolini said that the events that occurred in Central Europe a few days ago were inevitable, he did not indicate that this was a victory for the Berlin-Rome axis.

American officials have a good impression

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Officials and financial circles here have a good impression of Mussolini's speech, because some parts of his speech are moderate in tone and indicate that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy can still be resolved through diplomatic channels. Senator Cloutiere Peabody said that the Italian Premier's speech indicates that the current crisis can still be resolved peacefully.

[Associated Press, New York, 27th] The "Tribune" here today wrote an article, warning against those who consider Mussolini's speech to be "moderate", saying: Hitler gave a speech on January 13 that was considered moderate, but then he annexed Czechoslovakia. Mussolini's speech contains positive statements and should not be considered moderate. There is still no real security in Europe, but the current crisis may have been saved.

German spokespersons are still fueling the flames

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] A statement authorized by a newspaper here said, "Italy has now made clear through its government leader the historical demands regarding Tunisia, Djibouti, and Suez, so the possibility of evading a reply will no longer exist."

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] It is heard here that Mussolini's speech has been warmly supported and endorsed. A spokesperson said, "Mussolini has clearly stated that peace is not an unconditional reservation of past facts. If the old residence is not allowed to be rebuilt, it is imperative to build a new house. If Britain rashly launches a war, the end result may not be the same as in the past."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 26th] This criticized Mussolini's speech, saying, "The Italian Premier's speech is a response to all attempts to encircle the Axis powers. France must now give a clear answer to Italy's Mediterranean demands."

### Franco's Army Enters Madrid; Important Strongholds Secured; Government Accepts Surrender Terms

[Associated Press, Saint Johns, 27th] According to unconfirmed reports, Franco's troops entered Madrid at 7:00 AM this morning.

[Associated Press, London, 27th] According to a "Daily Mail" correspondent in Saint Johns, Franco's troops have entered Madrid, and all important strongholds are secured.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] According to authoritative sources, Franco's general offensive against Madrid is about to begin,

Adopting a Comprehensive Blockade Plan

[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 27th] Franco's headquarters issued a final ultimatum to the people in the government-controlled areas at 2:40 PM yesterday, demanding a cessation of resistance and complete surrender. Franco's side expressed that they would adopt a lenient attitude towards the government forces, and would not punish soldiers or left-wing elements. However, those who continue to resist will be punished in accordance with the law, because they are merely shedding unnecessary blood. If the government forces reject this final ultimatum, Franco will immediately launch a large-scale offensive, for which military preparations have been underway for several weeks.

[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] It is reported that the National Defense Council has accepted Franco's terms, and Madrid will officially and peacefully surrender today.

[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] Franco issued a final ultimatum to the government forces from Burgos radio this morning. The National Defense Council here has ordered a swift surrender because Franco's troops have adopted a comprehensive blockade plan.

Franco Issues Final Ultimatum

[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] Franco issued a final ultimatum from Burgos radio, stating in brief: "Spaniards in enemy territory, pay close attention. Victory in Catalonia has long been recognized by your leaders. We are now preparing to fulfill our previous promises. A major offensive is about to begin, and the seaports will all be blockaded. Your resistance is futile and will only increase your burden. If you wish to avoid bloodshed, raise the white flag and surrender quickly. Together, we will build a great and free nation."

[Associated Press, Burgos, 27th] The official announcement on the radio here this morning stated, "The time for the liberation of Spanish soil is approaching. Before that time arrives, we warn the enemy that the extremism and liberalism of the past are completely lost. The enemy must also understand that they are fighting for a worthless cause, causing Spain to fall into disaster. The enemy must also understand that only General Franco is the sole leader, and those who disobey will be dealt with according to the law." Reports from Madrid say that Franco's planes flew to the front lines to bomb, and the extent of casualties is unknown. It is also known that the National Defense Council there is quite busy.

Snow and Wind Intermingle; a Miserable Scene

[Associated Press, Madrid, 27th] The people here originally hoped that peace could be achieved on Monday, but now peace talks have broken down again, and the situation is quite chaotic. Franco's offensive seems imminent, and the people here are extremely panicked. They can now only fill their stomachs with water and bean juice. Furthermore, the wind and snow continue all day, and the accumulated snow is extremely thick, creating a miserable scene.

[Associated Press, Lisbon, 27th] Madrid radio broadcast news at 3:55 this morning stating that peace has broken down, and the National Defense Council met for a long time and decided to resist to the death.

### German General to Pressure Poland to Improve Danzig's Status; Poland Continues Military Preparations

[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Reports that Germany has made demands on Poland have not been confirmed. It is generally believed that Poland's military preparations are due to the belief that Germany will exert pressure to change the status of Danzig. It is heard that Poland has clearly stated its opposition to the "Polish Corridor" issue, while Germany may suggest building a German highway through this corridor.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Poland is still continuing military preparations, but maintaining extreme secrecy.

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] Hitler arrived in Munich today to attend the funeral of the director of the German medical department and will then go to Berchtesgaden.

### Slovak Government Refuses to Send Representatives to Hungary; Agreement Fails, Border Warfare Resumes; Heavy Artillery Fire, Heavy Casualties on Both Sides

[Reuters, Bratislava, 27th] According to reports here, although the Hungarian and Slovak armies announced a ceasefire on Saturday and Sunday, fighting has resumed on the Slovak-Romanian border. Artillery fire is heavy, and casualties are severe. Efforts by the chief of staff to stop the conflict have been ineffective. Slovak political circles believe that Hungarian forces are currently doing everything possible to invade Slovak territory in order to put pressure on Slovakia when negotiating peace and border demarcation.

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 27th] Approximately 36 hours after peace on the eastern border of Slovakia, the two armies re-engaged at 9:45 this morning. Hungarian artillery shelled the Rifeto fortress east of Michalovce, and machine gun teams on both sides also exchanged heavy fire, but the front lines remained unchanged.

[Associated Press, Bratislava, 26th] It is reported that the Slovak government has rejected the Hungarian government's proposal to send a delegation to the Hungarian capital to negotiate peace.

### British Conscription Issue Reportedly Rejected by the Cabinet; Eden Advocates Forming a Coalition Government

[Reuters, London, 27th] Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London this morning after spending the weekend on holiday. Opposition leader Greenwood immediately met with the Prime Minister. Opposition leader Attlee and Liberal leader Sinclair are also expected to meet with the Prime Minister, but the former is currently ill, and the latter has not yet returned from Scotland.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] It is reported that nationwide conscription, which has been unanimously proposed at home and abroad, has been rejected by the Cabinet. Prime Minister Chamberlain believes that if nationwide conscription is to be implemented, Parliament should be dissolved and re-elected first, because he has publicly promised that he will not implement nationwide conscription as long as he is in office.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Grimsby yesterday, advocating the swift formation of a coalition cabinet. The foundation for the organization of its members should be expanded as much as possible. The new government has two objectives: (1) to control British industry, wealth, and manpower to strive for expansion in the shortest possible time, and (2) to adopt an active foreign policy, uniting all peace-loving countries to resist new acts of aggression.

Commentary

### On the Loss of Nanchang and the Future War Situation

After ten days of intense fighting in northern Jiangxi, our army voluntarily withdrew from Nanchang.

Since the fall of Jiujiang last July, Nanchang has been threatened on three sides and is in imminent danger. It has been able to stubbornly hold out for more than half a year. This must be attributed to the persistent fighting of the soldiers and civilians in northern Jiangxi, southern Anhui, and the border areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Today, under the cruel bombing and large-scale gas attacks by the [Japanese] army for 72 hours, our army was forced to withdraw in good order. From an overall strategic point of view, there is absolutely nothing strange about it.

The [Japanese] army's "Nanchang Offensive" had a comprehensive plan, its purpose being to eliminate our main force around Nanchang and expand the "mopping-up operations" in the southeastern provinces. However, in this Nanchang offensive, it was still forced to fight for cities and transportation lines, and it failed to inflict any damage on our main force. On the contrary, although it forcibly occupied Nanchang, the elite troops it mobilized in central China have been sporadically cut off, resisted, and surrounded by us. It not only failed to complete its planned "Nanchang Offensive" but also plunged the troops in central China into even greater difficulties. Conversely, our army has maintained its full strength, is able to maneuver freely, and can strike at the [Japanese] at any time.

At the same time, we must also clearly recognize that Nanchang is the only important city we have left in Jiangnan. Now that Nanchang has fallen and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been cut off, the connection between the southeastern battlefield and the southwestern base area has suffered even greater difficulties. Conversely, after occupying Nanchang, if the [Japanese] further complete their connection with the Anhui-Jiangxi-Hubei area, they can advance to Changsha to cut off the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway or retreat to consolidate the southeastern occupied area and engage in "mopping-up" operations and preparations for further aggression.

We understand that the loss of Nanchang will not affect the overall war situation, and the [Japanese]'s forcible occupation of Nanchang will inevitably increase their difficulties. We must also guard against new difficulties that may arise after the loss of Nanchang. Therefore, today we must raise our vigilance and implement the necessary countermeasures under the principle of not being discouraged by defeat.

First, the loss of Nanchang proves that although the [Japanese] army's combat effectiveness is gradually declining, it still has the power to continue its offensive. The high degree of exertion of this offensive power can still cause us to lose famous cities and important towns. However, the result of each subsequent high degree of exertion will inevitably lead to a greater decline in its power. This can be understood by observing the time distance from the fall of Xuzhou and Wuhan to the fall of Nanchang. Therefore, our task today must be to strive to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front lines, develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, stop the [Japanese] offensive, and advance the second stage of the War of Resistance, namely the stalemate stage.

Second, based on the first point, we must today oppose muddled and unrealistic optimists. We must raise our vigilance against the [Japanese]'s new offensives and new conspiracies. We demand greater progress in military and political affairs in order to overcome the final difficult situation of defeat and destruction. At the same time, based on the above first point, namely that every high degree of exertion of the [Japanese]'s power will inevitably lead to a more drastic decline, we must work harder to smash all traitorous pro-Japanese elements' defeatist "peace and compromise" arguments and prevent any recurrence of pessimistic and disappointed sentiments. Because the [Japanese] are using the false "victory" they have gained by putting everything on the line to deceive their people and to induce us to surrender, this is something we must guard against even more.

Third, after the [Japanese] forcibly occupy Nanchang, it is certainly a major threat to the New Fourth Army and its allied forces, which are launching a large-scale guerrilla war in the southeastern provinces, and the [Japanese]'s military and political pressure on the southeastern provinces will be even more severe. At the same time, the [Japanese]'s strategy of occupying Changsha in order to open up the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway may be implemented immediately. In order to smash the [Japanese]'s further adventures, we must first reinforce southern Anhui and western Zhejiang with a large number of mobile corps, and penetrate into the various areas behind enemy lines in the border areas of Anhui-Jiangxi and Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi to prevent the [Japanese] army from maneuvering and to disintegrate and strike them. In view of the isolation of the southeast from the west, the anti-Japanese troops and civilians in the southeast should be given the power to establish a general anti-Japanese base area and local anti-Japanese governments, like the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi border area, to give full play to the anti-Japanese forces in the southeast. [The strategy] is still the basic policy of the [Japanese]'s new offensive. Therefore, we must not neglect the [Japanese]'s "northwest and southwest" strategy, especially to strengthen the security of the southwest!

Wah On Gold Store

### Wah On Gold Store on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok's Most Prosperous Area Robbed by Seven Armed Bandits; Three Bandits Rushed in with Guns and Fired Two Shots as a Warning; Smashed Display Cases and Looted Gold Jewelry Worth Over 1,600 Dollars

Lately, robberies have become increasingly rampant. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Wah On Gold Store on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok was robbed again, with a loss of over one thousand dollars in gold jewelry. The bandits, a total of seven, were extremely ferocious, firing two shots as a warning before proceeding to rob the store and escape with the stolen goods. The details are as follows:

Seven Bandits Rush In, Fire Two Shots as a Warning

The robbed Wah On Gold Store is located at 505 Shanghai Street, in the most bustling area of Mong Kok, where vehicles and pedestrians travel constantly throughout the day. The store was established on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month last year, employing many shop assistants and craftsmen, and the business has been thriving. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a fashionable young woman in her twenties entered the store to purchase gold jewelry. The shopkeepers, Huang Fangfu and Wu Gui, took out a gold ring inlaid with stones and handed it to the woman to examine. While the two parties were bargaining over the price, seven men dressed in gray and black suddenly rushed in from outside the store. Three of them were carrying Mauser and revolver pistols, two were carrying umbrellas, and the remaining two were empty-handed. They separately restrained and frightened the staff in the store. The bandits with the guns were extremely ferocious, firing a shot as a warning immediately after entering the store. At the sound of the gunshot, the staff were shocked and dared not move. The bandit fired another shot, hitting the ceiling and piercing a hole.

Smashing Display Cases, Looting Gold Jewelry

After the continuous gunshots, passersby, believing that an accident had occurred, scattered and fled. Taking advantage of the chaos, the bandits used the gun barrels and chairs to smash the glass of the display cases on the store front, looting all the gold jewelry on display and calmly exiting the store. They turned onto Soy Street and escaped towards the waterfront. The entire process, from the start of the robbery to the escape, took less than ten minutes. After the bandits left, the staff, regaining their composure, immediately closed the iron gate and then blew the whistle to alert the police and called the Mong Kok Police Station to report the case. Soon, Deputy Superintendent Wilson, Detective Inspector Cali, and McDowell from the Western District, Superintendent William from the Mong Kok Police Station, Superintendent Tailing from the Sham Shui Po Police Station, and Chinese Detective Chief Shi Dui led many detectives to the scene to investigate. They also dispatched a large number of patrol cars and detectives to search the area, but no one was found. They then summoned the staff from the store to the station for questioning and sent telegrams to various districts to arrest the bandits.

Total Loss Estimated at Over 1,600 Dollars

According to the owner's report to the police station, the exact amount of the loss has not yet been determined, but it is estimated that there are about 18 gold bracelets, worth 731 dollars, 7 gold rings, worth 146 dollars, 4 gold chains and 22 necklaces, worth a total of 750 dollars, and 2 pairs of gold earrings, worth about 20 dollars, for a total value of about 1,600 dollars. It was noted that when the bandits fired the guns and committed the robbery, they came with great momentum. The fashionable female customer was so frightened that her face turned pale and she looked extremely distressed. After the detectives arrived and took a brief statement, she was allowed to leave. Also, not long after the bandits left, a girl about twelve years old walked out from among the craftsmen, holding two pieces of gold jewelry in her hand. She returned them to the store, saying that she had found them on the ground. Her attitude was quite calm. None of the staff in the store recognized the girl and did not know when she had entered the store. She was handed over to the police to be taken to the station for investigation.

### Frequent Changes in Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong; New Consul-General Aiyi Tajiri Arrives in Hong Kong; Portuguese Consul Transferred to the Philippines, Succeeded by Morais

Changes in the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong have been frequent recently. The current Consul-General is Mr. Huangtian, but he has now been ordered by the Tokyo authorities to transfer. The new Consul-General is Mr. Aiyi Tajiri, who has arrived in Hong Kong to take charge of the consulate. It is noted that in the past six months, the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has changed three times. The previous Consul-General, Kazuichi Nakamura, was transferred back to Tokyo shortly after arriving in Hong Kong. His successors were Huangtian and Tajiri. Also, the Portuguese Consul in Hong Kong, Mr. Nogueira, has been transferred to South Africa and will leave Hong Kong soon. He will be succeeded by Mr. Morais, the current Portuguese Consul in Guangzhou. It is noted that Mr. Nogueira has been in office since March 1935.

### Hong Kong & Whampoa Dock Achieves New Profit Record; Profit Reached Over Two Million Last Year; Sir Robert Ho Tung Resigns as Chairman, Lo Man Kam Succeeds

The Hong Kong & Whampoa Dock Company Limited held its annual meeting at the Prince's Building yesterday. In the report submitted by Chairman Thornewill, it was mentioned that the profit for the past year was unexpectedly large and unprecedented. The high profit in 1921 was the best performance in the past, but this was due to exchange rate fluctuations that benefited the company. The business results for the past year showed a profit of $2,121,023.04. After deducting various expenses and depreciation, the net profit was $2,600,547.92.

17 Ships Built Last Year

Last year, the company completed 17 new ships, totaling 11,643 tons. Regarding the profit distribution method, some shareholders had previously expressed that the amount should be increased, but for the sake of the company's business prospects, the originally proposed distribution method was considered necessary by the directors after discussion. The proposed distribution method is as follows: (1) A dividend of 60 cents per old share (i.e., 6%), totaling $121,752. (2) A semi-annual dividend of 6% per new share, totaling $45,657. (3) A bonus of 40 cents per old share (i.e., 4%), totaling $81,168. (4) A semi-annual bonus of 4% per new share, totaling $30,438. (5) $350,000 allocated to the special account for expansion preparation. (6) $500,730 allocated to the general reserve account. (7) $70,000 allocated for employee bonuses. (8) $373,107.47 carried forward to the next year.

Ho Tung Resigns, Lo Man Kam Succeeds

Finally, I cannot but mention the matter of Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation as a director. In November last year, we received a letter from Sir Ho, stating that he was resigning due to health reasons. Sir Ho was elected as a director as early as 1920 and has been in office for many years. During this period, there have been countless years of difficulties and obstacles. Thanks to Sir Ho's accurate guidance and foresight, he has provided invaluable assistance to the other directors. I believe that you will all gladly join me in expressing our deep regret at Sir Ho's unavoidable departure and wishing Sir Ho a speedy recovery. We have invited lawyer Lo Man Kam to fill the vacancy left by Sir Robert Ho Tung's resignation. With lawyer Lo Man Kam's reputation in Hong Kong, his succession to the position of director is believed to be approved by everyone. Lo Man Kam and Landale were immediately elected as directors of the company and were endorsed by the general meeting. Jackson and Williamson were elected as joint directors.

### French Ambassador to China Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday; Awaits Ship to Shanghai to Inspect Overseas Chinese Affairs

The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haiphong aboard the French mail ship Guangdong, to travel to Shanghai and Tianjin to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and conduct a detailed investigation for submission to the French government. It is noted that the Guangdong arrived in Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday, and the French Consulate in Hong Kong sent personnel to the pier to welcome him. A meeting was held last night to entertain him. It is noted that accompanying the French Ambassador to Hong Kong was Lieutenant Colonel Yvan, the military attaché of the embassy. The French Ambassador will stay in Hong Kong briefly before leaving for the north.

### Unscrupulous Police Officers; Bribery Becomes a Habit; A Letter Signed "Pseudo-Gentleman" Was Sent to a Western Newspaper Yesterday, Pointing Out the Inside Story and Hoping for Social Attention

Yesterday (26th), a letter signed "Pseudo-Gentleman" was published in the Hong Kong English-language weekly newspaper, publicly pointing out the "protection money" collected by unscrupulous police officers from hawkers, prostitutes, opium dens, and other places in Hong Kong. The original text of the letter is translated as follows: To the Editor, esteemed sir, I have long admired your newspaper as the most honest and outspoken newspaper in our well-decorated island of Hong Kong. I would like to take this opportunity to report the following matters. I believe that your newspaper will be able to provide guidance and urge the authorities to take measures to curb this. The matter of police officers accepting bribes has now become an open secret. Those who accept bribes are fully entrusted by these unscrupulous police officers and do not know how to maintain "silence." For example, using the best bidding method, "to get the job." What is described below is also clear evidence of an open secret. Hawkers, in addition to holding a formal license, must pay five to ten cents each time to be allowed to sell goods on the street, otherwise they will inevitably be arrested. As for brothels and opium dens, each lamp must pay 1.5 to 2.5 dollars. There are about 25,000 prostitutes in various districts, each of whom must pay a protection fee of 5, 10, or 15 dollars. Those who run gambling dens must pay 10 to 15 dollars per month. In addition, there are other people who collect fees, such as sending "holiday gifts," etc. Although these illegal activities are sometimes charged before a magistrate, those who are unwilling have every means of escaping conviction. I believe that the creation of this bad habit is mostly due to the ignorance of hawkers and others, who fear the power of the police and dare not report them. However, this relies on people from all walks of life to help them. I hope that the authorities will study this. If your newspaper wishes to collect this information, I believe I can comply. If this fact can attract the attention of this society, I have some suggestions to present.

### Lin Zifeng and Others Visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs Yesterday: Requested Cancellation of Quarantine for Shantou Ships Arriving in Hong Kong; Secretary for Chinese Affairs Indicated Willingness to Forward to the Health Bureau

Several months ago, an epidemic occurred in Shantou. Hong Kong, as usual, declared it an epidemic-infected port. All Shantou ships arriving in Hong Kong were required to enter the quarantine area, and third-class passengers could not freely disembark. However, now that the epidemic in Shantou has subsided, third-class passengers are still not allowed to disembark freely. The directors of the Hong Kong Chaozhou Eight Districts Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying-Shantou Chamber of Commerce believed that this measure caused much inconvenience to people from their hometowns coming to Hong Kong, so they jointly wrote to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting the government to investigate the situation and cancel the order to restore free disembarkation for third-class passengers to facilitate travel. Having not received a reply, the chairmen of the association, Lin Zifeng and Lin Yiqiu, personally visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs yesterday afternoon to present the matter in detail. Mr. Lin Zifeng told reporters that the Secretary for Chinese Affairs expressed great sympathy for the association's request to restore free disembarkation for third-class passengers coming to Hong Kong from Shantou. He has now forwarded the request to the health authorities to cancel the previous rule. This matter will probably be resolved in a few days.

Transatlantic flights will also begin at the same time.

### Luo Wenjin Talks About the Protection of Tenants Ordinance: The Hong Kong Government Decided to Extend Validity for One Year; Macau Increased Rent by Only One Dollar Per Hundred

Last June, the Hong Kong government promulgated the Protection of Tenants Ordinance, restricting landlords from forcing evictions. This year, in January, the ordinance was revised to prevent landlords from cleverly creating reasons for rent arrears to carry out eviction conspiracies, while limiting unreasonable rent increases. The general public was very happy. However, the ordinance is due to expire in June of this year. Whether the Hong Kong government will renew it is a concern of the residents. For this matter, the reporter specially visited Chinese representative Luo Wenjin yesterday. According to his answer, the phenomenon of the demand for houses exceeding supply in Hong Kong is still serious, and the ordinance of course needs to continue to be effective. According to what I know, the government authorities have also decided to extend its validity for one year, and it can be announced at that time. Furthermore, according to the reporter's investigation, Macau is also experiencing a housing shortage. The Macau government has passed a law to restrict the arbitrary increase in rent prices, allowing only a one-dollar increase per hundred dollars, i.e., one percent. This method can be imitated in Hong Kong.

### Qiongdao × Feels Exhausted to Cope; Our Military and People's ×× Strength is Increasing; Southern Guangdong People Fully Loaded with Food Cross the Sea to Assist; Qiong Female Warriors Deeply Penetrate × Den to Lure and Annihilate Stubborn ×

(Xuwen Quick News) The Qiongdao war is still continuing to unfold. Although the × army has invaded the mainland after reinforcements, our military and civilians have jointly launched a large-scale guerrilla war, and × feels quite exhausted to cope. Now × is showing fatigue and is unable to advance. It has switched to a defensive posture, but our guerrillas continue to attack × and trap ×, and mobilize the Li and Miao people in the Wuzhi Mountain to participate in killing ×. The recent situation in Qiongya is recorded as follows:

The Military and People Resist × With Strong Will

Since × landed on Qiongdao, on the one hand, it has released the air of Anqiong's entry into Lei to confuse our side's vision, and still hopes to occupy the entire Qiong. Therefore, it dispatches warships to surround the coast of Qiongdao, block the coastline, and attempt to cut off the supply and assistance to our isolated army. However, our isolated island military and civilians continue to struggle and die holding on to ×. The military and political authorities of Guangdong Province also have great determination to protect Qiongya. Since military experienced personnel took over as county magistrates in the various counties in Qiongya that had been lost, the military and civilians have a strong will to resist the war, and the mood to kill × is even more tense. Now, the lost areas such as Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, and Qiongdong Cliff County are all covered with our guerrillas, self-defense groups, national salvation armies, etc., retaining the vast majority of the land. × is only limited to the cities and towns of three or two counties, and is often ambushed and attacked by our army, suffering heavy casualties.

Southern Guangdong People Cross the Sea to Assist

After the outbreak of the Qiongdao war, although × warships blocked the coast in an attempt to cut off our army's assistance, the people of various counties in southern Guangdong witnessed the heroic resistance of the isolated army in Qiongya and were all spiritually inspired. They sent weapons, ammunition, food, and salaries across the sea to aid. The loyal and brave soldiers, such as Feng from Xuwen County and more than a dozen others, drove several sampans and boats, fully loaded with food and various comforting items, and crossed south from near Hai'an Port. They stole through the × warship warning line in the dark of night and landed on the coast of Wenchang County. They went to various places to comfort the heroic soldiers who were defending the land. They safely arrived in Xuwen yesterday (22nd). It is said that the high tide of the Qiongdao military and civilians killing × is admirable, and they are familiar with the terrain and brave in combat. The future is very promising, but the supply of ammunition is worrying. Now the war has turned into a mountain war, and the Qiong people have begun to use knives, spears, bows, and arrows to hold on to ×, reducing ammunition consumption. Furthermore, Feng and others decided to contact other enthusiastic patriotic villagers and make another large-scale supply to the Qiongdao military and civilians, and they will cross the south in the short term.

Our Army Compiles and Trains Miao and Li to Resist Japan

After the Hainan Island war occurred, people from all over rose up to resist ×. Group leaders Feng Baiju and Ms. Liu Qiuju both served the country loyally, leading more than 10,000 people under their command, lurking in the mountains of Qiongshan and Ding'an, and implementing a wide-ranging guerrilla system × strategy to contain × people. According to military news, our army in Qiongya is extremely familiar with the terrain in various places and has a very good relationship with the Li Miao Qixiao people. In order to launch the anti-Japanese war of various ethnic groups, some of them live in the Wuzhi Mountain and its branch valleys, gathering the Qiong people, compiling and training the anti-Japanese national salvation army, using weapons such as knives, spears, bows and arrows, and attaching many long and short guns. Each is brave and good at fighting, no less than an anti-× elite force. If × dares to go deeper again, it will be hit hard.

Qiong Female Warriors Dress Up to Annihilate ×

Furthermore, the strong men led by female warrior Liu Qiuju are all young and heroic, with extraordinary courage. They often appear in Leimingju, Ding Huangzhu, and other places in Ding'an County, assisting various combat troops, guerrillaing against ×, and intercepting a lot of grain and machinery. Several female warriors often dress up as women fleeing from disaster, traveling on remote paths, to lure × army to pursue and ambush them to annihilate them, killing many × people. Now × is always wary, and × chieftain is even more afraid that his troops will repeat the same mistakes, and ordered that whenever encountering women, regardless of whether they are good or not, they must not be shot or raped. However, although × has repeatedly ordered this, the above-mentioned things still happen constantly, which further shows the corruption of × military discipline.

### × Nearby is Very Quiet and Thinks of Moving; Boluo × Was Badly Hit by Our; Dongguan × Army Rush to Build Fortifications; The Entire Lower Reaches of the East River are Controlled by Us

[Boluo Quick News] In recent days, our East Road Army, under the command of General Wu Qidawei, have moved into the lower reaches of the East River, cooperating with the teams of Huibo Dongzeng and other affiliated teams, and the situation has changed. The center of gravity of × and our confrontation is in Zeng, The two counties, according to reliable news, our security team's No. 1 regiment Wu Kanjian's department, in coordination with the Luo Kun department of the Second Detachment of the Third Guerrilla Column, is responsible for the front line of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and closely monitors the Zhangmutou area with strong forces. As for the dynamics of the × army near Dongzeng, the details are as follows:

WanCheng × Army Rushing to Build Fortifications

On the 26th, the reporter visited Luo Wei, the special brigade commander of the Third Guerrilla Headquarters. According to the talk, according to recent intelligence, the × army entrenched in Wancheng has about 300 people stationed in the County Middle School on Dongdou Zheng Street, with six cannons attached, and the Ming Sheng Middle School in Houfang is used as a horse stable. There are more than 70 horses, and the × soldiers stationed in the Zifusi Temple, People's Education Museum, and Relief Hospital in the old city number about 400 in total. Since then, fearing attacks from our guerrillas, in addition to implementing special martial law, they have built more than a dozen gun emplacements in the dockyards and affiliated Zhugang and Huayuanling, and the situation is very tense. Cars still come and go on the Wantai Highway to transport food. Although × occasionally sweeps the nearby villages, it is only for the nature of looting food, and it is really unable to attack us.

Zengcheng × Army Was Severely Annihilated by Us

The × army dormant in Ningcheng seems to be very quiet and thinking of moving in recent days. On the 25th, it sent about 500 troops, with two small steel cannons attached, and sneaked into the villages near Lianhe Market in Boluo County from the Lychee Twist side. The intention was to find out the truth about our army. At that time, the Chen Regiment, 12th Army stationed in Lianhe, etc. According to reconnaissance reports, they immediately met with the Lin Junsheng department of the First Detachment of the Third Guerrilla District, intercepted in three ways, and surrounded and attacked them unexpectedly. After a fierce battle for about two hours, × was immediately unable to support due to being attacked from the back and the terrain, and was unable to use heavy firearms. It retreated along the original road, killing more than 30 × people and seizing a lot of firearms and other military supplies.

### Military Emergency Adjustment in Xijiang; The Counterattack on Daliang is Imminent; Shunde's Shielding of Xinhui's Position is Important; To Protect Siyi, Shunde Must Be Recovered

[Xijiang Newsletter] After Daliang, the county seat of Shunde, fell, the local guerrillas tried their best to counterattack, but due to the weakness of the troops, the bed could wipe out the × in one fell swoop. In recent days, the × entrenched in Daliang has also attempted to attack Rongqi from the Rongliang Highway. In addition to telegraphing the guerrillas stationed in Rongqi Guizhou to strictly guard against it, our West Road Commander Deng Longguang also transferred a part of the regular army stationed in a certain place in Xijiang to rush to defend it, and telegraphed the headquarters of the Fourth Theater to send senior officials to command the counterattack military affairs. After listening, the reporter went to the command to inquire about the news. I was grateful to Deng Longguang for sending a staff officer to see me.

Shunde's Position is Important

The reporter asked about the situation of our Xilu army's rescue of Shunde. According to the report, Shunde is located in the vital point of Xijiang, and Xue Zhangxinhui Siyi's position is extremely important. If the entire Shunde falls, not only will Siyi be threatened, but also the Xijiang × army will reduce its containment and will attack with all its strength. Therefore, Deng Junzhang paid close attention to this. Previously, he had telegraphed the Shunde guerrillas to cooperate in the defense. Recently, he planned to transfer a certain regiment of the regular army stationed in a certain place in Xijiang to aid. This team is a newly established unit with sophisticated weapons. It has been ordered to set off and will arrive at the front line within a few days.

Senior Officials Command Military Affairs

Then he said to the reporter that in order to make the war quickly effective, Deng Junzhang had telegraphed the commander of the Fourth Theater to send senior officials to the Zaiz area to preside over the guerrillas and the regular army, and put them under his control to facilitate the command. The candidates will be announced within days. Once the command candidates are determined, large-scale counterattack military operations can be launched. Furthermore, the reporter obtained confirmed news from another source that the counterattack on Daliang military affairs will be commanded by Zhang Jun Song, the former chief of the tax police regiment and the current commander of a certain division, or will be taken over by Wu Fan.

### The Fourth District Administrative Commissioner's Office Sends Personnel to Inspect Huiyang

(Mainland News Agency Huiyang Quick News) Chi Zhongkuan, the administrative inspector and security commander of the Fourth District, has taken over. He has now been appointed by the Fourth Theater as the commander of the Dongjiang South Bank Guerrilla Team Detachment. In order to inspect the administrative modification measures of the various times under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District, and to reorganize and train the self-defense teams affiliated to the Dongjiang South Bank, in order to coordinate with the various troops to give play to the mobile war, he specially sent Deputy Security Commander Zhai Rongji, Commissioner's Office Inspector Zhang Qiushan, Section Chief Ling Zhong, and other dozens of people to set out for inspection.

### Guangzhou Traitors × People × Events: Traitors Find It Hard To Do, Fleeing in Succession; A Brawl Among The Ugly Crowd

[Foshan Quick News] After the robbery of Guangzhou, under the claws of the × bandits, although every effort has been made to restore prosperity, our people have been trampled upon. Filled with anger and upholding great righteousness, they swear not to be willing to be obedient people. Therefore, since May, the situation in the market has not only failed to recover, but has become even more desolate. The following is a record of two recent noteworthy events in Guangzhou:

Traitors Find It Hard To Do

Since × entered Guangzhou, they have been buying up a large number of traitors and establishing various puppet organizations. However, it has been found that the salaries of the puppets are all paid with × military scrip. Initially, this × military scrip could be exchanged for national currency or small change within the city. However, recently, × has been actively absorbing our legal tender, hoping to undermine our economy. For example, carrying small change or national currency out of non-occupied areas in amounts exceeding thirty yuan will result in confiscation. It has been found that the families of various traitors in Guangzhou often reside in Hong Kong, Macau, or other places. They often wish to use the ill-gotten gains to support their families, but find it difficult to do so. The military scrip they receive is virtually useless except within the occupied areas. At the same time, recently, our guerrilla teams have infiltrated the city in large numbers, and killings of traitors are frequently heard. These puppets not only sell their souls, but their lives are also in danger at any moment. Furthermore, they are subjected to abuse, humiliation, and oppression by × chieftains. Therefore, many harbor thoughts of quitting. In the past ten days, many individuals from various puppet organizations have voluntarily fled due to this issue, including Chen, Feng, and Chen, among others. These people are willing to attach themselves to ×, willing to recognize the bandit as their father, but will either die under the guns of patriotic heroes or be forced to quit due to the harsh environment. Those whose will is not firm and harbor different ideas can serve as a warning.

A Brawl Among The Ugly Crowd

It has been found that in order to promote the prosperity of Guangzhou's commerce, × chieftains appointed someone named Zhi, among others, as committee members of the puppet chamber of commerce. However, these individuals have recently been engaged in internal strife due to conflicts of interest, creating a state of animosity. On the 20th of this month, these ugly individuals were arguing again at the Tao Tao Ju tea house in western Guangzhou, unable to reach an agreement. At first, it was a verbal dispute, then it escalated into a physical fight. Each reverse henchman attached themselves to their master and came forward to help. The more they fought, the more people joined in, resulting in a chaotic scene. At that time, a team of × military police happened to pass by, heard the noise, and went upstairs. The crowd of ugly individuals suddenly saw the × police and mistakenly thought that the × chieftain had found out and sent a team to arrest them. They scattered in all directions, trying to escape. It is estimated that puppet chamber of commerce committee members Zhi and Huang were seriously injured in this incident. Currently, the undercurrent is still not subsiding. It is said that the reason for the conflict is that in recent months, they have been unable to restore Guangzhou's commerce, and the market remains as cold as ever, for which they were severely reprimanded by the × chieftain. Therefore, they began to shirk responsibility, leading to the internal conflict.

### Three × Warships Spy on Daya Bay, Cruising Back and Forth, Seemingly Up to Something; Our Coastal Teams Have Increased Vigilance

[Huiyang Quick News] After our army recaptured Huiyang and Boluo, the Dongjiang × army's resupply and transportation were based in Humen. Deliberately targeting the coastal area of Aotou in Daya Bay, there have been very few traces of × warships in the past month. However, it has been found that yesterday, the 22nd, three × warships suddenly sailed into the waters of Sanmen Pass in Daya Bay, cruising back and forth, spying, and seemingly up to something. That afternoon, they also launched several motorboats, chasing and robbing fishing boats along the coast. Two fishing boats were unable to escape and were robbed of all the valuables on board by the × bandits and transported back to the warships. More than ten people on board were thrown into the sea, and their fate is unknown. Currently, of the three × warships, two have sailed away, while one has not yet left. Our coastal army teams have increased vigilance.

### × Planes Bomb Haikang Again, Dropping Several Bombs in Gangtou

[Haikang Quick News] After × invaded Qiongya, × planes immediately went to Haikang to scout and bomb at will. As of the 20th of this month, the county town had been bombed five times, with a total of seventy to eighty bombs dropped, destroying more than a hundred civilian houses and causing dozens of casualties. It has been found that after the × planes狂炸Haikang County on the 12th, due to continuous spring rain, the × planes did not come to attack. On the 22nd, as soon as the weather cleared up, the × planes flew to reconnoiter and bomb again. At noon that day, a team of several × planes flew from the Qiongzhou area. At around 12:00, they掠過Xuwen County and continued to fly north. After scouting in Haikang County for a while, one × plane flew into the airspace above Haikang County from the south, flying around in a low circle for a long time. The people in the city dispersed to take cover. However, the × plane did not drop bombs and flew back along the original route. Unexpectedly, when it reached Gangtou, about ten li from the county town, it dropped several bombs indiscriminately, all of which fell into the sea, injuring only one fisherman and causing no other losses.

### × Planes Bomb Shantou Again, Shantou Authorities Rush to Build Evacuation Routes, Hua Zhenzhong Patrols Chenghai and Raoping Yesterday

[Shantou Quick News] On the morning of the 26th, four × heavy bombers braved the rain and fog to attack Shantou City. At around 9:00, they entered the city's airspace, circled once, and dropped six bombs on the Shantou Station of the Chaoshan Railway, destroying more than twenty workers' dormitories, the ticket office, railway tracks, and one train car. Fortunately, all the passengers on the train were safe, and only one railway policeman was seriously injured. Then, they dropped four bombs on the intersections of Chao'an Street and Shengping Street, all of which fell on the beach, causing no losses to us. At 10:30, they began to attack Chao'an, Jieyang, and Chaoyang, flying low to scout transportation lines and瘋狂扫射乡村居民 houses. At 11:30, they掠過Chenghai and landed on × warships.

At the same time, donations are being raised from Shantou merchants and overseas Chinese from Chaozhou to build the road, and more than 4,000 yuan have been raised. Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, due to the sudden tension in Shantou, specially left Shantou on the morning of the 26th to inspect coastal defenses in Chenghai and Raoping and review the teams.

### Severe Rice Shortage in Shiwan, Starving People Everywhere, The Situation is Extremely Tragic

Yesterday, a pottery merchant who had fled from Shiwan arrived in Hong Kong. According to him, the current rice price in Shiwan, under the iron hooves of ×, is extremely high, with only four catties of rice obtainable for one yuan. Due to the high price of rice, many poor people have starved to death. Although charitable people are currently holding porridge distributions, the number of women and children who benefit is very small due to the large number of refugees. Because there is not much porridge to distribute, the strong and powerful young people always get it first. They have seen many people starving to death on the streets. He also said that this time, he brought a batch of pottery worth about 1,500 yuan from Shiwan, but it was looted by × soldiers when he reached Leliu, who demanded a ransom for its return. Currently, there are only about twenty × troops stationed in Shiwan.

### × Planes Reconnoiter Huiyang

### Central Photography Studio Produces "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," a Grand Performance of the Heroic Posture of Our Air Force

Historically speaking, our air force is still very young, but in this sacred war of resistance against ×, our air force, fighting bravely, one against ten, has long been recognized and praised by countries all over the world. They give the invaders merciless blows, and at the same time, tell all countries that our air force is great and cannot be insulted.

On May 20 last year, our air force made a world-shaking ten thousand-mile expedition, spreading a large number of leaflets over the three islands of Fusang, without dropping a single bomb. How can this spirit be understood by the × of ×? Our air force is protecting the skies of the motherland, crushing the invaders' conspiracies, and not using it to bomb innocent civilians, women, and children. Bombing civilians is 无× and cowardly, not what our loyal and brave air force, fighting for justice, should do.

Now, we are even more gratified by the good news that the Chinese Air Force will be on the silver screen, undoubtedly writing a glorious page for the Chinese film industry.

Since the war, the staff of the Central Film Photography Studio of the Central Propaganda Department have often traveled to the north, south, east, and west battlefields, conveying the tragic, heroic, and moving real situation of the front line to the vast masses in the rear through lenses, films, and transportation. Now, there is another film with the air force as the theme, "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," which will soon begin shooting. The screenwriter is Mr. Sun Yu, the director of "The Great Road." The Central Propaganda Department had previously consulted with the Aviation Committee to send personnel to participate in the filming, writing, directing, and technical work. The Aviation Committee sent the fake aviator Xie Taojun to assist. Mr. Xie said, "... When he (referring to Sun Yu) earnestly buried himself in the screenwriting of this film, I helped him by his side, telling him some stories about the Chinese Air Force, and various issues related to air force driving and combat techniques. I am a pilot, I don't know how to write a good script, but I know how to fly a plane, how to fight ×, and how to defend the motherland's airspace. I want to contribute these things to the film industry. Also, I want to accurately describe the struggles, bravery, and heroic sacrifices of my partners. These are what the screenwriter should use as the objects of his description of the characters..."

After the film is completed, it will be publicly screened in Chongqing, and then it will be transported to major cities in western China and various places in Southeast Asia, so that patriotic overseas Chinese can see the new look of the motherland's air force. There is also hope that it will be shown in Hong Kong.

The male actors are Gao Zhanfei and Zhao Dan, the female lead is Bai Yang, and many air force soldiers will meet us in the film.

This film, "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky," is indeed an epoch-making and significant event in the history of Chinese cinema. Here, we pay our sacred respects to all the staff of "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky."

### Hollywood Stars' Wishes for This Year

Recently, an American reporter interviewed many famous Hollywood stars and asked them about their wishes for this year. Below are the answers from each star:

Shirley Temple: This year, I want to work hard to make myself interested in arithmetic, and I have to study it well.

Sonja Henie

I will vigorously promote various sports such as swimming, tennis, and skating, so that people all over the world can develop an interest in sports. People who love sports have healthy bodies. With a strong body, they are energetic in whatever they do, and future happiness will follow.

Tyrone Power

I hope to travel to South America again soon. The Brazilians and Argentinians in South America are so kind and lovely. Don Ameche: I hope I can take more time to play with my two children and our beloved dog.

Loretta Young

I want to make fewer films this year, read more books, see more stage plays, and travel to Cuba and other places.

Warner Baxter

I want to have a noble soul and a pure body. Lee J. Cobb: I hope I can speak American correctly this year and eat less sausage (note: afraid of gaining weight, which would damage her beauty).

John David

I will try to make my colleagues know that I am a solemn person.

### A Wide Variety of Star Publicity Methods (Continued)

Sometimes, for the sake of publicity, the birthplace of stars has to be changed. The singing star Roy Rogers, who performs in cowboy attire, changed his birthplace to Cody, Wyoming, when he entered the film industry, which is a place famous for Western cowboys. However, later, a real Cody cowboy came along and said that he had never heard of such a person. Rogers had to admit that he was from Ohio. Ingrid Bergman made the world believe that she was born in Norway, but now she has also admitted that Brooklyn is her birthplace.

Gene Autry also wears cowboy clothes when he is not filming, so it is easy for others to recognize him among many people, and the cowboy clothes are so eye-catching that you can see him from half a mile away. When Sonja Henie first came to Hollywood, she was not noticed, so she abandoned all colorful clothes and always wore pure white, driving a car that was also pure white, thus attracting attention.

Every once in a while, there are always a few foreign actors who declare that they want to become American citizens. This is also a good way. Remember Louise Rainer? After she obtained American citizenship, she wrapped herself in an American flag to show her joy. At that time, this photo was taken, which is a good publicity tool. Which American movie fan doesn't want those foreign stars to become American citizens?

Even small fireflies are used. Joan Bennett once publicly stated that she wanted to collect a large number of fireflies to raise in the garden. Similar to this is the "frog jumping" competition between Bing Crosby and Bob Burns.

There are many other methods. Danielle Darrieux's upward hairstyle, Joan Blondell changing seven male partners in seven nights, Jack Benny announcing last year that he would no longer perform, Marion Davies having a banquet once, inviting many guests, and the list almost took up an entire page in the newspaper, Mary Pickford saying that her house was haunted, these are all publicity methods. Some, when exposed, are simply not worth laughing at.

Female stars often do some soft exercises, specially for taking publicity photos, not for other purposes. Not long ago, Merle Oberon had a photo of herself running on the beach, which was otherwise impeccable, but look at her feet, she was still wearing three-inch high heels.

Stars often go on "vacations" to other places. New York is the best place to go. New Yorkers are busy all day long, and what they see are all unfamiliar new faces. But if they see a familiar face in New York, they are also willing to take a look. Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, and Tyrone Power often go to New York, and the purpose is for publicity.

Publicity sometimes gives stars a lot of trouble. It breaks up a couple of stars in love—such as Tyrone Power and Annabella—and forces a pair who are indifferent to each other to pretend that they love each other—like Lee J. Cobb and Anna Sten—. It tries hard to promote in the newspapers to make people believe that stars do have some quirks that are different from ordinary people, like saying that Rosalind Russell raised a dozen large frogs in the pool and cured her insomnia.

There are too many. Writing them all down could almost fill a book. For the sake of publicity, they will do many strange things. Is this why actors are actors?

### The Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday by Plane; A Group of Twenty-One People in Full Military Style; Defeated the All-Philippines Team 2-0 in the Fifth Game in the Philippines

[Our Report Quick News] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, at the invitation of the Philippines, went to compete. The team departed from Singapore on the 13th of this month. After arriving in the Philippines, they played five times between the 17th and the 26th, winning four and losing one, achieving satisfactory results.

After the competition in the Philippines, they came to Hong Kong by the way, setting three major battles, with the South China Athletic Association in charge of everything, because the South China Association is responsible for hosting the team.

The team of twenty-one people initially intended to take the China Clipper flying boat from the Philippines to Hong Kong on the 31st, but because the plane was rescheduled to depart on April 2, they changed to take the giant Boeing flying boat "Flying Hotel" California Clipper at 7:30 yesterday morning. They arrived at the Kai Tak Airport sea surface at 12:30 noon. Those who came to welcome them included South China Association staff Mo Qing, Zhang Wendong, Li Huitang, and many Chinese and Western reporters.

The original leader, Shen Tiaodou, did not accompany the team on departure due to temporary affairs. Deng Yuehan was promoted to leader and trainer, Secretary Cao Qiulin, Captain Xu Houkun, Vice-Captain Ji Youling, and the list of names is as follows:

Leader and Trainer: Deng Yuehan

Secretary: Cao Qiulin

Captain: Xu Kun

Vice-Captain: Ji Youling

Players: Li Botang Feng Huiwen

Chen Jiawan Ye Maofa

Sun Chunlai Ye De

Li Yiyou Zhu Chenggui

Cai Yuehan Wu Shi

Xia Zhixiang Xie Qingfu

Wen Guanzong Long Liewu

Li Haizhu He Guocai

Guan Xinde

All staff and players stayed in Room 305 of the Shengsi Hotel. According to Captain Xu, who told reporters that it was possible to win all five games in the Philippines, but in the third game, several players were injured and took to the field, resulting in defeat.

It has been found that the champion of the All-Philippines League is the YCO team this year (the captain and left inside forward Bao Seli and left winger Bi Zhi of the Philippine team who came to Hong Kong for the city-to-city competition last month are the mainstays of the team). The Singapore Chinese team met the team in the fourth game in the Philippines and defeated them 3-1. In the fifth game, they met with the All-Philippines team and won 2-0. Based on this, it can be proved that the Singapore Chinese team is very strong. This time they come to Hong Kong, they will definitely make a great contribution and satisfy the eye fortune of football fans on the island.

The team is best at short-pass tactics, and the cooperation is excellent (any football team that is good at short passes must have excellent cooperation). The members are also full of energy, and the headers are especially good, so they won the Singapore League Championship for two consecutive years, which is not lucky. When they went on the expedition, they defeated the elite of the Philippines with a tired team, winning by two goals. It can be seen that their football skills are superb.

Results of the Philippine Campaign

Evening of the 17th: Won against the All-Philippines B Team 5-2

18th: Won against Saint Thomas 3-1

22nd: Lost to La Salle 2-4

24th: Won against YCO 3-1

### Men's Basketball Game: South China and Brothers Both Triumph; Taikoo's Strength Insufficient Against Kwong Chung, Suffering Defeat

The public men's basketball tournament featured three games last night. In the first game, Kwong Chung (Group B) faced Taikoo. Kwong Chung was stronger. After the start, Wei Kai-wing, Leung Kang-cheung, and Fung Tze-keung successively scored. Taikoo tried hard to compete. Fung Ki-hung, Kam Kam-luan, and Tse Pui counterattacked from three sides, reporting frequent successes, but it didn't compensate for their losses. At halftime, Kwong Chung led 33-12. In the second half, Kwong Chung's Fung Chik, Tse Pui, Lee Chow-ching, and Ma Chak-hung all scored, while Taikoo struggled to cope, exhausted from defending. They lost 36-59.

In the second game, Hong Kong University played South China. Hong Kong University was much weaker than South China. However, the players worked hard from beginning to end, facing the game with six players. South China, on the other hand, had a continuous flow of fresh troops. The competition was fierce. After the start, Cheung Siu-min and Cheng Yuk-kun scored one after another, living up to expectations. They also made some gains in their counterattacks. However, South China had excellent coordination and control. At the end of the first half, South China led 24-12. In the second half, Cheung Siu-min made a bold move, scoring a remarkable basket. Shek Chun-chi rose to the occasion, attacking from both sides, and also scored several times. Hong Kong University's counterattack was unsuccessful and they were surrounded. When the game ended, Hong Kong University lost 37-6. In the Song game, South China (Group B) played Tsing Chi. South China's forwards coordinated well and were accurate in their shooting. Tsing Chi tried hard to resist, but ultimately lost 44-60 due to their weaker strength. The results of each game are as follows:

### Welcome Fellow Countrymen from the Singapore Football Circle (I)

— Lee Wai Tong

After the Lunar New Year, the Hong Kong football scene is bustling with activity. The local championship games are in full swing. In addition, there is a constant flow of arrivals and departures. The football guests from the Philippines just left last month, and now the Singapore Chinese football team is passing through Hong Kong on their way back from the Philippines, preparing to give three performances here, to our great delight. This news has been circulating for some time. Their visit, despite the long journey, is naturally something that all football fans in Hong Kong have been eagerly anticipating. Moreover, they are our close overseas compatriots, like brothers. We, as hosts, should express our warm welcome and fulfill our responsibility to ensure they feel at home.

They were summoned to participate in the Philippines tour and fought several major battles, achieving satisfactory results. I believe their performances in Hong Kong will definitely refresh our vision and not disappoint us. However, a football team on an overseas tour inevitably suffers from fatigue and war-weariness, making it difficult for the entire team or individual players to reach their artistic peak in a situation where they are facing fresh opponents. Therefore, when we appreciate or criticize their skills in the future, we must remember to consider this fact to properly assess their true value.

Here, I must issue a warning: our Hong Kong football friends must not underestimate this team of "renowned" players. In my twenty years of traveling throughout Southeast Asia and the Eastern Hemisphere, I have felt that the football skills of the overseas Chinese are most advanced in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Ipoh in Malaya, and Surabaya and Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. The overseas Chinese generally have the greatest interest in football in the above-mentioned places. The skills of the Singapore Chinese team are even better than those of other cities on average. Singapore is a transportation hub where Chinese and Westerners live together, and apart from the weather, it is not much different from Hong Kong. Its football scene includes teams formed by the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as Europeans, Americans, Chinese, and Malays, competing and fighting each other year after year. Therefore, their football is above standard, and when compared with the level in Hong Kong, it is truly difficult to distinguish between the two. Moreover, this Chinese team is the champion of the Singapore League for two consecutive years, the leader of the pack. It is easy to imagine that each player's skill is extraordinary. We should not underestimate them.

I remember in 1928, the Malayan Chinese United Team (with Singaporean players accounting for the majority) came to Hong Kong for the first Ho Wa Cup competition. Amidst the enthusiastic praise of the Chinese and Western audiences, they lost to the Hong Kong Chinese United Team by a narrow margin of 3-2. Their superb skills left the deepest impression. This was their first time breaking through the waves and visiting their homeland for sightseeing. In 1931 and 1932, the Malaysian Chinese and Singapore Chinese teams followed, performing several times in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangdong. In 1935, the Malaysian Chinese team won the runner-up in the Sixth National Games in Shanghai (Hong Kong, the champion, defeated Malaysian Chinese 3-2 in the semi-finals), with excellent performances and outstanding results, which people can never forget. Their full spirit and adherence to sportsmanship are also worthy of our admiration and emulation. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Yesterday's Tennis Match: Ho Ka-lau Wins Without Effort; Lam Chin Brothers Once Again Display Their Power in Doubles; Today's Schedule Includes Three Doubles Matches

The continuous rain has caused the tennis tournament to be suspended for several days. Yesterday, the sky suddenly cleared, and the tennis tournament was able to continue. Many fans came to watch the two doubles matches and three singles matches. In doubles, Lam Tim-tak and Wong Kam-hei defeated Storey and Farguson. The Lam Chin brothers defeated Nasik and Manlio. In singles, Crawford defeated Yu Peter, and Hung Wai-chiu automatically withdrew, allowing Ho Ka-lau to win without effort. Tong Lin-shun defeated Lam Kwun. The doubles match between Lam Wong and Storey Farguson was quite exciting. Storey and Farguson were full of energy, so their offensive was very strong at the beginning. Lam Wong were greatly threatened. Later, Wong Lam advanced step by step and changed to offensive tactics. Storey and Farguson gradually became unable to cope and were eventually defeated. In the doubles match between the Lam brothers and Nasik and Manlio, the Lam brothers had superb skills and worked well together. Nasik and Manlio were naturally no match for them. However, in the second set, Nasik and Manlio struggled desperately to try to reverse the situation, but the Lam brothers did not relax at all and were defeated again. In singles, the match between Tong Lin-shun and Lam Kwun was quite exciting. During the match, Lam constantly followed and resisted strongly, but in the end, he failed because his skills were not as good as his opponent's.

Yesterday's Results

(Doubles) Lam Tim-tak, Wong Kam-hei defeated Storey, Farguson, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2; Lam Chin brothers defeated Nasik, Manlio, 6-4, 7-5.

(Singles) Tong Yun-shun defeated Lam Kwun, 6-3, 7-5; Crawford defeated Kim Peter, 6-0, 6-4; Ho Ka, defeated Hung Wai-chiu, (Ho withdrew).

Today's Schedule

According to the schedule, all matches today are doubles matches. The match between last year's champions Tsui Wai-pui and Yun-pui and Olim Chin and Xia Xian should be worth watching. However, the Tsui brothers have improved their skills and have the potential to retain the championship, so it is expected that Olim and Xia will not be their opponents. The remaining two matches should also have exciting performances.

Lo Ting-ham, Lee-kee vs. Miles-nor, Afu

Tsui brothers vs. Olim Chin, Xia Xian

Kei-lee, Bin-yip vs. Ko-shan-nu, Lui-mi-tik

### Player Eligibility for the Davis Cup to be Amended

### The Thorns in the Future of Our Country's Sports

— Wang Xue-cheng

Although we often say, "Turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems," just as accumulated water forms a pond, small mistakes can also lead to big mistakes. To clear the thorns in the future of our country's sports, we must not ignore the smallest of errors.

The thorns in the future of our country's sports are too numerous to count, but to remove weeds, we must eradicate the roots. To clear the thorns in the future of our country's sports is not a difficult task; the difficulty lies in eradicating the roots. The source of these thorns is most often overlooked by the general public.

We all know the importance of sports to the War of Resistance. It is understandable that ordinary people do not promote sports, but it would be very serious if people in the so-called sports or education fields despise the importance of sports. It would be even more heartbreaking if they not only do not promote sports but also hinder its development. Indeed, especially in the education and professional sports fields, due to selfishness, jealousy, vanity, and even being blinded by profit, our country's sports have suffered major setbacks in intangible ways. Regarding this situation, I can cite several very obvious examples.

The establishment of gymnasiums in our country is not only lagging behind but is also mostly managed by foreigners. Although there are some established by Chinese, the facilities are very simple. We should not despise them for this reason, but rather do our best to maintain them. Only in this way can we uphold the purpose of promoting sports. But in reality, this is not the case. Ordinary people may look down on them because they lack a proper understanding of sports, but many people who have the responsibility to promote sports often do so out of selfishness, jealousy, contempt, vanity, and even being blinded by profit. They not only do not support various budding sports endeavors but also "nitpick" and make malicious criticisms, hindering their development with various despicable means. They are especially jealous of those who are more successful than them. But we must also know that there is a group of arrogant and self-righteous sports experts in the sports world who do not seek improvement but simply sell their "native" or "江湖" techniques. All of this can invisibly deal a major blow to the sports world.

In this professional sports field, the biggest reason why many people disregard sportsmanship is the issue of livelihood. But strangely, this situation is also common in various schools, educational institutions, or even between the same cultural institutions.

Between schools, I can cite a very obvious example. In the past, in a certain major city in our country, the football teams of two universities competed in the championship final. University A lost to University B by one goal due to a penalty kick. After the game, the players of University A vented their anger on the referee and beat him up. It should be known that even if the referee was unfair, it was not necessarily because he was biased towards University B. Everyone makes mistakes, and the purpose of competition is to promote sports. If this cannot be forgiven and the referee is beaten, it is a violation of sportsmanship. But afterwards, the sports director of University A not only did not reprimand the players who used violence but instead sided with them.

Although this is not related to livelihood, the main reason is nothing more than selfishness, jealousy, and vanity.

In short, to promote sports, we must cooperate and assist each other and encourage each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Selfishness and jealousy are the biggest obstacles to cooperation.

A friend of mine has a deep understanding of various effective fitness methods and has written and translated extensively on the subject. He also has nearly ten years of experience and has cultivated many strong young people. Under his guidance, in terms of physical strength, I have personally increased my "two-arm military press" performance from 65 pounds to 135 pounds in one year. Although this is entirely my personal experience, it proves that my friend has made a considerable contribution to the sports world in our country.

Recently, my friend has been organizing a certain sports endeavor. Although it is too early to assess its value, it is a first in our country. My friend inevitably encountered difficulties when he first started this endeavor. Even though praise and encouragement are abundant today, there is no shortage of those who look down on and ridicule it.

When this endeavor began, some people looked down on it, and others misunderstood its purpose, saying that there was no need for such a move in the current situation. Others dismissed it as a "small creation" and even belittled its due value. Unless one is "selling native techniques," everything must be done step by step, solidly and steadily, and build a strong foundation. We must not despise it because it is "small." Moreover, a "small creation" is always better than "no creation." As for nitpicking, it is a common problem of the Chinese people, and my friend's new endeavor is unlikely to be spared. As a result, irrelevant criticisms are often encountered.

Fortunately, my friend's strong will is not shaken by this. He still adheres to his original purpose.

In fact, failure is the mother of success. For anything to be a "creation," no matter how "small" it may be, it cannot avoid making some mistakes. As long as we do not hesitate to correct our mistakes, set our goals, and neither be arrogant in victory nor discouraged in defeat, and strive forward, the results will never be completely unsuccessful.

The scope of sports is very broad. Even just in terms of sports, a football coach may not necessarily have research on basketball. But there are many people who call themselves all-round sports experts, or even people who have no research on sports at all, who often like to make arbitrary criticisms. This is truly a major obstacle to the development of sports. If we want our country's sports to make significant progress, this trend must be corrected.

In short, to correct this malpractice, what is needed is a matter of character and morality.

### On Preserving One's True Self

— Spring Breeze

Lu Shusheng in "Summer Jottings" said:

"Lin Hai's Jin Yisuo reprimanded Heng, Xianju's Ying Rong'an, and Dayou were friends who valued righteousness. When Jin retired and returned home, Ying was about to be reappointed and went to Jin to say goodbye. Jin said, 'When you go out and return one day, I want you to return to me an Ying Rong'an who is exactly the same as before.' Both of them ultimately preserved their integrity in their later years."

Like Jin Yisuo and Ying Rong'an, these two friends who associated with each other based on moral principles, when Jin went out to serve as an official, repeatedly exhorted each other to preserve their original selves. Then, one can easily imagine how others of the same era quickly changed and did not preserve their true selves. Therefore, those who are obsequious and like to change their appearances in today's era are not worthy of excessive criticism.

Generally speaking, ancient Chinese Confucian scholars mostly regarded living in seclusion in the mountains as pure and noble, and withdrawing from the imperial court as the most commendable thing. For example, when He Zhizhang of the Tang Dynasty resigned from his official position and returned home, not only did all the ministers and officials of the entire court come out to see him off, but even the ruler, revered as the Son of Heaven, wrote essays and poems to commend him. For a time, scholars and literati all used this event as material for writing poems and exchanging verses. In fact, such an act of resigning from office and returning home to cultivate one's own virtue has already lost the inherent nature of Confucian scholars who regard the world as their own responsibility. There is no need to exaggerate it and promote it widely. However, although some scholars can break free from the confines of cultivating only their own virtue and share the joys and sorrows of the people of the world, it is indeed rare for them to maintain their original selves, truly act according to their conscience, and seek blessings for the people. From this, it can be inferred that the reason why most Confucian scholars would rather live in seclusion in the mountains than go to the imperial court is probably because they are aware of their own lack of virtue and inability to overcome desires. Therefore, they chose the passive path of retreat. From this, it can be further inferred that Jin's exhortation in "Summer Jottings" that Ying should preserve an old-fashioned and authentic self was indeed based on self-awareness.

Today's intellectual class seems even more degenerate than the literati of ancient times. Yesterday, they were still publishing statements of "The Central Government, The Central Government", but tomorrow they will already be among the staff of the enemy. It is truly ever-changing, greatly embodying the concept of "He is like a dragon." To give a more realistic example, there are many scholars and professors who were writing books and lecturing students before the July 7th Incident, but now many of them are new dignitaries in the puppet organization. They have changed so quickly, becoming like humans and ghosts. The saying in ancient poetry, "Seven days in the mountains feel like thousands of years in the world," seems inadequate to describe this transformation. The most contemptible thing is that they clearly know their lack of virtue and their inability to overcome the temptation of desires, but they still squeeze into the officialdom and the arena of fame and fortune. At a certain point, they lose their integrity and break their bodies, ending up as refugees who can only seek shelter. Some are even more despicable and insignificant, continuing to engage in lowly behavior, pursuing fame and fortune, even after losing their integrity, breaking their bodies, and relying on the power of foreigners. This is not only losing their original selves, but even transforming into their original forms, turning into foxes or dogs.

"Summer Jottings" also says:

"In the past, Wang Jiasou said goodbye to Wang Guiling, 'Our gatherings cannot be constant, but only retain each other's images in our eyes, so that we can meet again in the future.'"

This saying is even more profound than the previous quote. If it were true that one was a human yesterday and turned into a dog tomorrow, then friends would not only not dare to recognize each other, but would even join the crowd in "beating the dog." This is by no means a fabricated lie, and there are facts to prove it.

Can the two passages of literature quoted above be taken as words of encouragement for people today? The answer is: not at all—because the literati class, shameless writers, and frustrated politicians who have already surrendered today have long abandoned their ancestors, embraced their masters, fled to foreign lands, and specialized in receiving Japanese people. Their ugly faces have been fully and unconditionally exposed. What more is there to talk about preserving one's true self? The difference between people today and people of the past probably lies in this.

### Rainy Night

— Lin Yingchuang

Late at night. The earth is dark and oppressive; all things are stagnant in silence. Only long-legged fine raindrops, glittering and twinkling, softly murmur with a pattering sound. The blurred windowpane is covered with silky lines and fine particles, but sometimes they become very thick, and sometimes like palm-shaped large drops. The finger marks from closing the window just now can still be faintly discerned.

The rustling sound has gradually turned into a chaotic ticking. The oil lamp also flickers, emitting a pale green light. My thoughts have been shattered into fragments and scattered. Annoyance drives me to open the window railing. Before my hand can be withdrawn, the rain scene of my hometown has already surfaced in my mind: torrential rain beating on the jade-like stone steps, the whirlwind swirling in the empty courtyard, the ravaged banana trees rustling, the courtyard wutong trees shaking as if unable to bear the wind; chickens clucking in their nests, cats meowing softly, my kind mother repeatedly urging me to add more clothes. It is as if I have returned, clearing away all the bad and preserving all the good and vital! I am tightly closing the doors and windows, never allowing anything to damage them!

The wind, bleakly sending the whistling silk rain, shatters my dream.

Before my eyes is a solitary street lamp. The shadow of a rickshaw is plastered on the oily street surface. The thin rickshaw puller sits on the cushion, lost in thought, as if overwhelmed with sorrow.

The wind is stronger, penetrating every corner, brushing against the flesh of the rickshaw puller, rushing across the edge of the beds of the homeless sleeping under the building, and awakening their good dreams full of hope. They finally wriggle weakly, quietly calling their poor friends and wives, rolling up their paper bedding and burlap, and slowly walking into the toilet. Although it is dirty and damp, it is warm!

After a series of intermittent honks, the splashing mud chases away the rickshaw puller. A fragrance follows the wind and swirls. Undoubtedly, they will once again seek refuge under the wings of angels, using wine and women to spend this rainy night!

Rain, how sinful! I hate it. I angrily slam the window shut. Fragments of imagination flood my mind again, from the city to the countryside, from the rear to the occupied areas, and finally to the front line. This seems to be my way out, so it leaves a deeper and more lasting impression.

The spring rain should be pattering lingeringly. Slippery mud will cover the fields. Sharp winds sweep this forest to that forest. Soldiers hold their guns tightly, guarding, scouting, ambushing... Blood and water converge, and thousands of dewdrops are like the tears of the people. The howling wind is like the wailing of mourners. Ah, heroic, great! This is a group fighting for the nation!...

——In one corner, perhaps a group of people are weeping and yearning for their hometown: "This spring rain should be nurturing the cherry blossoms to bloom. Over there across the sea, do the cherry blossoms still have their past beautiful appearance? Perhaps they are withered and yellow, perhaps they are dead!... Tens of thousands of people have died, the fury of Osaka. Sixty thousand women came to China! My dear family, wife, perhaps buried in the fury, perhaps given to… Those thirty-five thousand specially made ash bags will perhaps one day hold me… War, what is this thing?…"

Thinking of this, the rain is so great! I deeply love it, I am excited.

### Dusk

— Tang Yingwei

A wind from the motherland blows from the distant sea. In this dusk, those who miss their motherland are all afflicted with sadness.

Passing through the streets where people from all walks of life gather, walking out of the smelly main road, the scenery along the coast is still thought-provoking. ——Open your chest and breathe in the sea breeze that still blows from the motherland! But Kowloon, in the nearsighted glasses, seems to be covered with a layer of misty dew in the thick smoke of war… People who have not been able to escape are still unable to shed a mournful face, and in the dusk, they turn their two pale white eyes more clearly.

Who would want to leave their motherland? This is something that no one would have expected! Entangled in the ropes of life, every heart dripping with fresh blood has sunk on this isolated island. Every active soul has been diminished in a cheap sale.

Streamlined cars weave a nocturnal web, and people pouring out of the pigeonhole-like houses surge like a burst of flood. Shouting. People who have lost the soul of their motherland! One cannot help but feel that if there were no dusk, one would not know how much darkness this place, into which the tide flows, would surge.

A paradise adorned in hell. The park is the paradise on the isolated island. Holy women with foreign sentiments, wearing veils, flash two star-like eyes in this dusk. Could this be the envoy sent by the Heavenly Father? But what about the angels of the Heavenly Father? Children who have lost their motherland do not think that the cross is a gift they like! Among the groups of children of different nationalities, the songs of resistance have turned into the noisy sounds of yearning.

The heavy bell is ringing. The isolated island is also molting.

### Starting from Some Memories

— Wei Fei

Recently, I have not been able to do anything properly. The woman in the neighboring house sings every day with a wide-open throat, very happily and joyfully: male voice, female voice, flower dan, martial actor, Erhuang, Xipi... I am familiar with all of them, but I don't feel happy or joyful at all. On the contrary, I feel heartache and sorrow.

Unable to do anything, I picked up a newspaper to read. "The True and False Wu Zetian," five large red characters, struck my vision like lightning, and I was stunned. I felt both like crying and laughing. Then, from the most eye-catching place, the most conspicuous advertisement column, I saw three startling lines: "The most fragrant, the most sensual, the most lascivious." Ah, my hand loosened, and I sat down on the chair, the newspaper falling to the ground.

Last night, when I passed that theater, many people—men, women, old people, students, workers—were gathered around watching. The advertisement also had those three most enticing lines. On the side was also written: "To avoid disappointment, please reserve your seats early." Sure enough, the ticket office clearly displayed a sign saying "First Two Shows Sold Out," but many people were still squeezing in. Walking to the ticket office and taking a look, their lips moved slightly, and with disappointed eyes, they walked to the front of the advertisement, squinting and lingering on those three sentences. Some walked to the stills of the movie showing today, gazing and gazing.

Several months ago, I went to a second-class theater to see "Taierzhuang". A theater nearby was showing "Three Thousand Female Stars." With the same ticket price, although "Taierzhuang" was fully seated, there were many people standing in front of that theater, looking at an advertisement for a half-naked female star with the same disappointed eyes. They were actually "disappointed."

With a sorrowful heart, I touched the slippers on my feet and slowly walked on the road home with heavy steps, thinking, "Movies are a tool for education, and those engaged in movies are no different from those engaged in education." Thinking of this, I also thought of the woman in the neighboring house.

She has changed recently. She has powdered her face white, applied rouge, dyed her nails red, and put on blood-red lipstick. She often jumps from inside to outside, and from outside to inside, singing songs she learned from movies:

"If you have it, you can drink water and be full... If you don't have it... feelings..."

"Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo... I don't want... anything..."

When she has time, she talks to people about the plot of the movie, saying how good this star is, how beautiful that star is, how tragic this drama is, how virtuous it is to maintain chastity, how filial it is to beg for rice to support one's mother-in-law. How touching these are! These are deeply engraved in her mind. She will firmly remember them, remember them, and will also be heavily influenced by them. But she has forgotten everything else, even the sentence she used to say: "Bomb, bomb, bomb as much as you want, China will always resist," she has also forgotten.

I often worry about her. No, not just her, many, many people who have escaped from the embrace of the motherland, from the enemy's bombing, from the war zone of gunfire and bullets, seem to be like men, women, old people, and young people who have escaped from the war zone and thrown themselves into this "Hong Kong Sea," sinking into the waves of the sea.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

Two people walked out of the door, the woman walking in front, the man following behind, the two maintaining a distance of one or two steps, silently walking along a dark street. On one side of them was a quiet road, with no vehicles coming or going visible; on the other side was a courtyard wall made of wooden strips. The lights in the residences inside the wall had already been extinguished. In front of them and behind them were impenetrable, mysterious, and terrifying dark curtains. Behind the curtains were the mysterious and terrifying sounds played by the wind and snow: sometimes wolves looking for mates, sometimes cats calling for sexual desire. All of this seemed to be preying on the night walkers.

He looked ahead, gradually approaching the only end point he longed for; he thought he could safely reach it without any more obstacles. He believed that his work had already succeeded, a cup of successful wine. When he met with his comrades, he would still have to wait a little longer. He began to taste the greatest joy in life, which is when work is successful; even a person born with depression will forget their worries. It's a pity he is not a poet, otherwise he would have a successful poem, praising success. If he were a painter, he would use limited colors to express his infinite joy, so that colorists could recognize the color tone symbolizing the joy of life.

"Comrade, do you want to buy a shirt… No, buy a pair of shorts!… Comrade, do you miss your wife?… You don't have money to write to her? Take this, here are five yuan for you. Send her dozens of registered letters so you don't have to worry later! Hey! Tell her to wait for you, don't let her marry someone else, marrying someone else is okay, but don't let her have an affair with someone else. Tell you, comrade, the nickname 'cuckold' is the most unpleasant. That's right, you are already a cuckold, a cuckold is you. You cuckold, don't bother writing to her, keep the five yuan for your mother as pension money!… Don't be sad! Our comrades are all heroes. Alas, heroes can also be cuckolds! Don't be sad, fight, fight, and win the battle, then give me a young wife. It doesn't matter if you die… you must first tell her that after you die, she must be a widow, don't let your children be bastards… Comrade, you love to smoke, I'll buy you a pack of cigarettes, but you have to smoke it for a year! Comrades, come, everyone, this is a gun, these are bullets, this is a gun, bullets, bullets, gun, bullets, bullets… Fire, fire, fire, fire. Three bullets, don't think this stuff came easily. It was my life that exchanged for it. No, if you shoot accurately, shoot a wild donkey to eat, no you can't… you can't do it. Let him, he… One-Eyed Dragon shoots accurately, you shoot an old bear, the meat is for everyone to eat, the bear skin is used to make shoes, the girls in the countryside make them well, make them well, well… So you can wear them until you're old, wear them until they fall apart. Otherwise you'll go barefoot all your life, xxxxxxxxx Remember, remember my hard work! What are you laughing at, what are you laughing at… you think it's easy? Ah! xxx! Hey, comrades, you can have whatever you want, everything, everything, everything… yes, yes, yes, everything…" (Twenty)
