### How to Cultivate Young Cadres? Introducing the Teaching Experience of Shaanbei Public School

— Shao Shiping

(Special Article) Now everyone knows that Shaanbei Public School is a school that adheres to the War of Resistance, insists on a protracted war, upholds the united front, implements national defense education, and cultivates cadres for the War of Resistance. Because it—Shaanbei Public School—has, in fact, become a school that young people across the country "admire like a high mountain and emulate its virtuous conduct, even if they cannot reach it, their hearts yearn for it." I don't want to give another comprehensive explanation of Shaanbei Public School here, but only share some personal experiences on the teaching methods of Shaanbei Public School. Perhaps our experiences are very superficial, but in today's situation where the old education is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the new education—national defense education—is growing with difficulty, contributing some experiences for the reference of national defense education enthusiasts across the country is not entirely meaningless.

I. Characteristics of Teaching at Shaanbei Public School

Shaanbei Public School was born and developed during the War of Resistance, and it has many characteristics. Here, I will only mention a few points regarding teaching:

First, Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on a correct educational policy. Teaching method is every way of implementing the school's policy, not simply a technical issue of lectures in the classroom. A school's educational policy is correct, and it will have many very correct teaching methods. If the policy is incorrect, discussing education methods away from the school's educational policy will never lead to correct teaching methods. At the same time, even if the educational policy is correct, if the teaching methods adopted are inappropriate, it will not only fail to achieve the correct methods and even the correct educational policy, but will also be hindered by bad teaching methods or reduce its feasibility. These are all common truths. Shaanbei Public School attaches great importance to the issue of teaching policy in its teaching methods. The educational policy of Shaanbei Public School is to adhere to the War of Resistance, adhere to a protracted war, uphold the united front, implement national defense education, and cultivate cadres for the War of Resistance. Is this correct? Of course, it is completely correct. However, the teaching method is not empty talk, but must be reflected in specific problems. The issue that is inevitably linked here is the issue of teaching material content. What to teach? What to learn? This has a decisive significance on the school's educational policy and teaching methods. If what is taught is incorrect, for example, if the school aims to cultivate talents for the War of Resistance and national construction, but what is taught is not about the War of Resistance and national construction, and even the outlines of the War of Resistance and national construction, the letter to the people by Chairman Chiang, and all the current practical experiences and lessons of the War of Resistance are discarded, and random lectures on the sayings of Confucius and the Book of Songs are given, such a school, to put it bluntly, can never teach well. Shaanbei Public School attaches great importance to the content of teaching, that is, what to teach. In order to ensure the correctness of the content of teaching, to achieve consistency with the educational policy, and to achieve the unity of theory and practice, it has specially emphasized the research work of each department, collected experiences and lessons from all aspects, such as research and sorting, and constantly listed major practical issues in the War of Resistance as the content of teaching materials, strengthened the construction of the textbook, established a broadcasting receiver, and collected practical materials from all parties as much as possible, especially from students, in order to seek the correctness, practicability, and richness of the school's teaching content. Although we have not achieved the ideal level or there are still many shortcomings, attention and effort in this area, and emphasis on this issue, is the primary characteristic of teaching at Shaanbei Public School. Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is built on the foundation of its correct educational policy and correct educational content.

Second, Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on the basic principles of revolution. Originally, teaching method is a reflection of the method of social production. The uneven development of Chinese society means that various methods of production exist simultaneously, and this is reflected in the teaching methods, which also have various differences. For example, the methods of imperialism in oppressing and massacring colonies exist in China. As a result, the education methods of massacring students, occupying schools, and barbarically oppressing students also exist. The feudal method of compulsory exploitation of production exists in Chinese society. As a result, feudal teaching methods such as spanking, confinement, and starvation also exist. The capitalist economic method of compulsory deduction of wages, demerits, and expulsion from factories also exists in Chinese society. As a result, capitalist methods such as deducting grades, demerits, and expulsion from school also exist. Shaanbei Public School not only does not adopt, but cannot adopt, the above-mentioned many opposing teaching methods. We deeply know that Shaanbei Public School is also a revolutionary school, a school for the War of Resistance and national construction, and a school for cultivating cadres for the War of Resistance. As a result, in terms of teaching methods, it can only be based on the basic principles of revolution. Originally, revolution depends on the active struggle of the broad masses of people to win. When the masses have not yet understood the necessity of revolutionary action, the revolutionary leaders can only patiently persuade the masses, encourage the masses from their own experiences, improve the masses, mobilize and organize the masses, and absolutely cannot force the masses to make revolution by adopting command and compulsory methods when the majority of the masses have not yet learned from their own experiences that revolution is urgently needed. This is not allowed and is bound to fail. Shaanbei Public School's teaching method is based on this principle. By applying this principle to all aspects of teaching, the spirit of teaching, the attitude of teaching, and the position of teaching are fundamentally different from past teaching. Therefore, I call it a revolutionary teaching method, which can also be said to be a characteristic of Shaanbei Public School's teaching.

Third, the teaching method of Shaanbei Public School is based on the principle of unity of teaching and learning. Teaching and learning are originally contradictory and unified things. Teaching method is to resolve the contradiction between teaching and learning and unify them throughout the entire teaching process. Here, we must consider the uneven level of students at Shaanbei Public School. In the unevenness, we must understand the unified power, which is the consistent requirement of the War of Resistance and national construction. Under the principle that the War of Resistance is above all else, all problems are specifically resolved and unified. What are the specific problems? The relationship between students, the relationship between teachers and students, the relationship between staff members and students and teachers, the relationship between the content of teaching and the understanding of learning, the relationship between the amount of teaching and the degree of acceptance by students, the relationship between various parties, various stages, various places, and various different degrees, and the relationship between educational policies, plans, content, and teaching methods all have contradictions. However, in teaching, we all pay attention to seeking unity and consistency. The method of seeking consistency is to transform the education plan into a learning plan, to lead and organize learning, and to flexibly adopt various different methods to proceed according to the conditions of the specific environment. People think that the unity of teaching and learning means that what is taught is what is learned. Shaanbei Public School believes that it is not enough to understand this issue so simply. It is necessary to ensure that the results of teaching and learning actually complete the teaching plan and realize the school's educational policy. This method is correct and is the unity of teaching and learning. Over the past year, Shaanbei Public School has cultivated more than 5,000 cadres who have fought bloodily with the invaders on various fronts. The students in school are loyal, united, energetic, lively, and fighting in their studies. The entire school, whether cadres, students, staff, or those in school, is united like one person in protecting the school, which proves that Shaanbei Public School's teaching is fundamentally successful. Although we still have some weaknesses in the issue of unity of teaching and learning, we ourselves feel that success is greater than weakness. This can also be said to be a characteristic of Shaanbei Public School's teaching.

Fourth, the teaching method of Shaanbei Public School is based on the specific environment. The question is this: Can teaching only be done under certain conditions? Or can teaching also be done under changing, complex, and difficult conditions? Shaanbei Public School's teaching method answers affirmatively: Teaching can be done under certain conditions, and teaching can also be done under changing, complex, and difficult conditions. In the face of the development of the War of Resistance situation, the latter is more important than the former. This requires changing one's own teaching methods according to the specific environment at that time and place. If one cannot change one's own teaching methods to adapt to and transform the environment, one will not be able to complete one's mission under some new changes. Look at the phenomenon of education across the country, there is no shortage of examples, so there is no need to explain in detail. Here, I will only say how Shaanbei Public School solves this problem. At the Yan'an Main School, there were no teachers, so we adopted the method of inviting celebrities to give lectures to solve the problem. The same difficulty with teachers at the branch school, so we adopted the method of the research room to solve the problem. There were few teachers, so we held large lecture halls. There were no classrooms, so we held classes in the open air. The bandits attempted to disrupt us, so we used armed protection for learning and integrated with the local people to obtain the help of the local party, army, government, and the broad masses of people. The road was difficult to walk, so we opened the road ourselves. The invaders' planes came, so we dug plane caves ourselves. Finally, when the Japanese invaders attempted to attack the Northwest, the school was completely reorganized and opened to the rear of the Japanese invaders. Without these methods, Shaanbei Public School could not be developed, let alone the completion of the education plan.

The characteristics of the teaching methods of Shaanbei Public School's branch schools are roughly like this.

II. The Educational Plan Is the Learning Plan

First, the educational plan is a plan for the entire school's struggle. Once a school's educational policy is determined, a specific implementation plan must be formulated and all methods and forces must be used to achieve its realization. Completing the education plan is the task of the entire school, so it is necessary to mobilize all organizations, departments, and even individuals in the school to consciously and actively rise up to fight for the completion of the education plan. The most important thing is to mobilize teachers, staff members, and students, so that teachers can deeply understand why they are teaching, so that staff members can understand why they are working, and so that students can consciously understand why they are learning. As long as everyone can correctly understand why they are teaching, learning, and working, they will inevitably be able to automatically, actively, and unitedly fight for the completion of their plan. For this purpose, Shaanbei Public School first discussed the educational plan in detail at the school affairs meeting to ensure its correctness, and then mobilized various departments to explain the school's tasks and policies, and improve everyone's political awareness. Then, the educational plan was brought to the teacher research room for discussion; on the first day of class, it was even brought to the students for discussion; the educational plan was reported to the students in detail so that everyone could understand what the goal of their efforts in school was. This will mobilize all the school's manpower and material resources to fight for the realization of the education plan. Some people think that if the education plan is brought to the students for discussion, what if the students disagree? I think it is only a matter of an incorrect educational plan. If it is correct, the students will enthusiastically welcome and support it. Even if some individuals cannot understand it all at once, they will be able to understand it after some persuasion and explanation. If a school's education plan is not dared to be reported to the students, and the students just blindly learn, it will not be possible to mobilize the students to fight for the education plan: and it will not be possible to complete the learning in fact, but the various aspects of the school's education plan. Because if the students are not consciously and actively learning, but use various methods to supervise, oppress, and force the students to learn, the teaching effectiveness will be derelict and even a failure. Therefore, whether the education plan can be effectively completed in the implementation depends on turning the education plan into the center of the struggle for all the school's work, especially to become the students' learning plan.

Second, how can the education plan be specifically transformed into a learning plan? Mobilizing all students to understand the education plan, which is their own learning plan, is only a principle-based method. The specific method is sometimes more important than the principle-based method in work. Turning the education plan into a learning plan, propaganda and explanation is one thing, and specific implementation is another. These two things are related and at the same time separate. How does Shaanbei Public School handle this issue? After the education plan is formulated and publicized and explained, the Department of Education formulates an implementation schedule based on the education plan, and roughly divides out the implementation stages. For example, in the first four weeks, what issues should be completed in Chinese studies, how much time is allocated for teaching and learning, and when. The same goes for other courses. Students are given it in advance, and all students, staff members, and teachers hold meetings to improve the schedule according to the plan, point out reference books, list the learning outline, and then each class formulates the class's weekly and daily learning plan according to the weekly learning plan of the entire team, and the class leader distributes the reference books to the subject representatives in advance. According to the scheduled time, they either look at the reference books, hold discussion meetings, or attend classes, all with preparation and arrangement in advance. In the remaining time, individuals can formulate a plan to read more reference materials. The completion of each person's daily learning plan is the completion of each class's learning plan. The completion of each class's learning plan is the completion of the entire team, which is also the completion of the overall education plan. We call this method planned learning.

Third, has the plan been completed? Some people raise this question, that is, if everyone is allowed to learn freely, will they work hard? Will they all make false reports? What methods are there to understand? This is a very important question, but Shaanbei Public School does not adopt examinations for this question, but instead mobilizes all students, staff members, and teachers to inspect. For example, has each class completed its own plan each week? This can be summarized at the full-class learning plan meeting every Saturday. Because the whole class lives and studies together every day, and everyone knows why they are learning, and it is a learning plan formulated by themselves, of course, they will automatically, actively, and diligently work hard, and they can also understand the learning progress of each person in the discussion. Because teachers and staff members are participating in learning and discussion, the students automatically initiate learning competitions, help each other, and encourage each other. Everyone understands who is working hard and progressing in learning. Secondly, there is a regular large inspection of the implementation of the education plan. When each stage of the plan is completed, the Department of Education organizes all personnel participating in the execution of the plan, such as teachers, staff members, students, and administrative personnel, to hold a meeting to inspect. Everyone prepares their opinions in advance, and the Department of Education also collects materials from all parties in advance and examines and sorts the materials in advance. At the inspection meeting, they promote their advantages and point out their weaknesses to each other, study the sources of their advantages and the methods to overcome their weaknesses, and plan new struggle plans. With this, whether the education plan has been completed, what else is there not to understand?

Fourth, the changes in the education plan, the education plan is not dead, nor is it immutable, especially in the face of the development of the War of Resistance and national construction situation, it cannot be immutable, because many issues are correct today, but may not be correct tomorrow; therefore, the education plan cannot but have some changes. This kind of change is also a change in the learning plan. Whenever the entire school gains a new major development, Shaanbei Public School inevitably formulates a temporary learning plan. For example, in the third phase of the War of Resistance, Baode Wuhan, On Protracted War, On the New Stage: special plans are formulated for research, and after such a research, there will inevitably be some new things added in the content of teaching and learning. This makes teaching consistent with practice, and at the same time makes the education plan even more transformed into a learning plan. Because the practical problems in the War of Resistance are what everyone urgently demands to understand. Some people think that Shaanbei Public School's education plan changes too quickly, and I think it is a fact that it changes too quickly. However, the actual life changes even faster than our education plan! However, basically we have not changed. This is to fight Japan and save China.

The issue of the education plan being the learning plan is like this.

III. The Center of the Educational Method Lies in Leadership and Organization of Learning

I once said that the teaching method is every method adopted to implement the school's education plan. In this way, the teaching method includes a wide range of things, but its center is in leading and organizing learning.

First, what is called leading learning? It means that the thing to be learned is a completely new path that the students have never taken, while the teachers have probably walked this path once or twice, or at least they can grasp the direction very well. Therefore, the teacher is a response to learning and helps learning overcome difficulties. This is one. Secondly, the members of Shaanbei Public School are all revolutionary advanced soldiers, some are revolutionary leaders, they teach for the War of Resistance and national construction, and they are even more consciously responsible for leading teaching for the young people who come to study for the War of Resistance and national construction. If the center of the school is learning, then the center of teaching is leading learning. The students of Shaanbei Public School can all understand the importance of their responsibility to the youth, so they work very hard on the research of teaching materials, and often get sick due to excessive hard work. They cannot be ambiguous about the weekly problems. They attend student plan meetings and discussion meetings, carefully answer various questions raised by the students, and discuss various issues with the students. On some issues, especially in the actual work of the War of Resistance and national construction, because of different experiences, they sometimes learn from the students. For example, regarding mass movements, especially youth and women's movements, many students come from actual work, and they have vivid materials. These materials are worth collecting and studying. Only in this way can the responsibility of leading learning be realized.

Second, what is called organizing learning? If the school has an educational policy and an educational plan, and they are both correct, then it is necessary to find the forces to struggle to implement the educational policy and plan. The organization of students and the allocation of cadres are the forces to realize the educational policy and plan. The students of Shaanbei Public School are generally very enthusiastic about the War of Resistance and national construction. The teachers and staff members of Shaanbei Public School are even more soldiers and leaders of the War of Resistance and national construction. But how can such a foundation be organized into a greater student force? Teachers are organized in various research rooms according to the various subjects, and students are organized into study classes, squads, and teams. The class is the unit of learning, the team is the unit of education, and according to the unit of education, this part of the teachers, staff members, and students are organized under the education plan to work together. Therefore, the team leader becomes the center of leading and organizing learning; the class leader becomes the core of learning; the squad leader is the bridge between the implementation of the education plan and the learning unit; the instructor is the assistant in leading and organizing learning: the student union is the organization for organizing learning, and the subject representative is the liaison between the teacher and the student, and at the same time the organizer of a subject's learning. In this way, under the goal of striving for the smooth completion of the educational plan and the learning plan, a strict team for learning is organized. Only with such a force can the victory of the education plan be guaranteed.

Third, the central link of leading and organizing learning is the mutual trust and mutual respect between teachers, staff members, and students. Whenever the students of Shaanbei Public School see a teacher coming, there is often thunderous applause, expressing their welcome to the teacher. There are also individual teams that prepare paper cigarettes to comfort the teacher. If the teacher is sometimes not feeling well, the students will send representatives to express their condolences. In the students' view, the teachers are all leaders and organizers of the youth, and should be believed in and respected. The teachers of Shaanbei Public School are also truly responsible, and will never ask for leave or be absent from class unless it is absolutely necessary; if they are accidentally absent from class, for example, due to heavy rain and no classroom, some teachers are willing to automatically make up the class at night or on Sunday; there are also individual teachers who teach barefoot in the rain, which makes the whole class of students express their respect to him. In the teachers' view, this group of young people are the trustees of China's destiny, the soldiers of the War of Resistance, the leaders of the masses, and the creators of China; doing more work for them will increase the strength of the War of Resistance and national construction, which is their duty. Our teacher Comrade He Gan of farewell at the conference of the graduating students going to the front line said:

"The students who are graduating and going to the front line will use guns and cannons to fight the invaders bloodily on the front line, and I will use pens and mouths here to fight the invaders. The front and the rear will use all weapons and forces to drive the Japanese invaders out of China."

From this, it can be seen that the teachers of Shaanbei Public School regard their teaching career as a part of the sacred cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, respect their own cause, are loyal to their own cause, and at the same time trust all the students, and place the sacred cause of the War of Resistance and national construction on themselves and the youth of the country. In this way, there has never been a student strike or a teacher incident in Shaanbei Public School. The key to the mutual trust and respect between teachers and students is the staff, especially the team leader. The team leader is the executor and organizer of the education plan. He not only plans the learning of the entire team in detail, making all the work in order to strive for the victory of learning, but also has to organize and allocate various forces. Originally, learning is the same as fighting a war. On the front line, the team, company, platoon, and squad leaders are very important. After teaching has decided on all the plans, the team leader and instructor have a decisive significance in learning. Because the team leader must unite the teachers and organize the students in every way, and all the forces that can be used to lead and educate learning should be organized into leading and organizing exercises. Only in this way can the education plan be changed into a learning plan, and its successful implementation can be guaranteed.

Fourth, competition in organizing and learning and specific mutual help. With a plan for learning and a learning team, the teams, classes, and individuals, under the mobilization of the teaching room and the student union, often voluntarily propose learning competitions to each other, just like the fighting competitions in the War of Resistance troops. They deeply know that their learning is learning for the War of Resistance, so they send representatives to negotiate the rules of the competition and hire judges, report their learning plans and efforts to the judges and the competing opponents, learn from each other's advantages, and help each other overcome weaknesses. The example can create a learning movement among all the students in the school, and in the movement, they can understand their individual abilities: qualities: promote the strong ones, and help the weak ones. This kind of help is very specific. For example, in order to win the competition, a class must have all the internal members understand each other's advantages and disadvantages and take specific measures. Sometimes it is specifically decided that someone will help someone. This not only intensifies learning, but also strengthens unity. However, the organization of this competition is not a school regulation, but a method of the students' automatic efforts to learn. The organizers of the competition are often centered on the student union and the salvation room. However, all education should actively support and help and guide its progress, and prevent the phenomenon of formalism, empty names, and unfinished business. If the students do not feel the need for competition, and only one or two leaders formulate a competition plan and announce it, then it is better not to have the competition. Shaanbei Public School has been very successful in organizing competitions in the vast majority of cases. There are achievements, but there are also individual cases where the competition is treated as a child's play, or has not been launched, or there are individual cases that go to the wrong direction of trophies. However, as soon as the school discovers that there is an incorrect trend, it helps to quickly correct it, which is the responsibility of the youth leader.

IV. The Significance of Teaching Success

What should be the standard for the victory of teaching and learning? Some people think that it is a victory to finish teaching the textbooks stipulated in the plan. In fact, such an understanding is not enough, but the same fact can be encountered everywhere. I think that the success of teaching is not simply a matter of teaching textbooks. In fact, there are no textbooks. Teaching can still be done in the same way. Many courses in Shaanbei Public School do not have textbooks. Is Shaanbei Public School teaching? It is teaching and teaching correctly. What is the reason for this? It is that education is not simply teaching textbooks. In fact, I think that the real success of teaching should have the following three standards:

First, to give the students correct knowledge, and the students truly understand and master it, and can flexibly apply it to practice, not verbatim recitation, nor rote memorization of formulas.

Second, to cultivate students not only with knowledge and ability, but also with the determination and belief to sacrifice and fight for the realization of what they have learned, not empty talk, and even less to be someone who puts up a sheep's head and sells dog meat.

Third, having knowledge, ability, determination, and confidence is basic and important, but the responsibility of education does not stop there. At the same time, it is also necessary to exercise their bodies so that they have the strength to shoulder the tasks they should bear.

Shaanbei Public School puts the success of teaching under the standards mentioned above, and thus deeply knows that education is not only about recognizing talents, but more importantly about cultivating talents. Originally, there are indeed many talents, and the school should further improve him and promote him, so that he can become a stronger cadre in the War of Resistance and national construction. The vast majority of those who were not originally talents and need to be cultivated into talents by the school, but they have a high degree of enthusiasm for the War of Resistance, and the school should make every effort to make them enthusiastically encouraged and progress forward. Even if there are one or two who are relatively backward in their thinking, as long as they are not members of the invaders, traitors, or Trotskyites, the school has the responsibility to transform them: patient persuasion, arduous education, and sometimes to win one or two such students, the responsible comrades of the school often spend a lot of time talking and educating. Therefore, some students believe that "those who cannot be educated in Shaanbei Public School are incurable." The school cherishes talents and cultivates talents in this way, so the students also cherish the school very much. At every difficulty facing the school, all the students are concerned to the utmost, especially in the material aspects, they get a lot of help from the students, donating money, donating old things, and donating radios, and have made great achievements. The development of Shaanbei Public School over the past year has been greatly benefited from the students. Here, I would like to express my lofty respect for the students who cherish the alma mater of Shaanbei Public School for the War of Resistance and national construction.

In order to fully complete the teaching mission, individual specific education, cultivation, cherishment, and help are very important. But it is even more important to generally cultivate a good school spirit, cultivate loyalty and unity, a spirit of tension and liveliness, a hardworking work style, and improve students' military capabilities and life. The most excellent style of Shaanbei Public School is loyalty, unity, tension, and liveliness. Whether in learning, work, or life, whether in students or cadres, it is fully manifested. Under the influence of such an excellent school spirit, whether they are members of the Communist Party, members of the Kuomintang, or people without party affiliation, they are united like one person, loving each other, trusting each other, and working hard together for the school's mission and the school's education plan. In establishing and promoting a good school spirit, the exemplary role of cadres, the learning of cadres, and the unity of cadres are very important keys. Shaanbei Public School has been very successful in its cadre policy. The school's love and education for cadres is a regular work. For example, the cadre class has classes twice a week, and the branch school has not been relaxed from the beginning until the reorganization. The improvement and unity of cadres is the center of improving and uniting the entire school, and it is also the foundation for achieving the goal of teaching victory.

Under the new situation, Shaanbei Public School is developing forward with a new attitude. I believe that with the love of the whole country and the efforts of the whole school, we will surely be able to achieve new achievements in the new struggle. From the establishment of Shaanbei Public School until the reorganization, I have been working in the Department of Education at Shaanbei Public School, and I am deeply ashamed of my lack of learning and ability. I have not studied anything about Dalton's system or Dewey's educational philosophy. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after Presidents Sun Suicheng and Luo, I tried my best and with the help of all the students and teachers and staff, I was fortunate to be innocent, and I was happy for myself. Now I am ordered to transfer to the front line, and formally, I have to leave Shaanbei Public School. I specially write down some personal experiences to ask for advice from those who are enthusiastic about national defense education across the country, and at the same time I respectfully wish the comrades and students of Shaanbei Public School good health.

Editorial

### Youth Movement in a New Phase

Twenty years ago today, an unprecedented youth movement in China, a model for the world, was launched by students in Beijing. In bloodshed and resolute progress, it awakened the entire Chinese nation under the oppression of feudal remnants and ××-ism. It developed from a purely patriotic student movement into a political movement encompassing youth from all walks of life, including industry, commerce, and agriculture. It further evolved into a new enlightenment movement in modern Chinese history, paving the way for the Great Revolution of 1925-27 and opening up a path for the Chinese nation to move from a democratic and scientific movement toward building a new China with "national independence, civil rights and freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness."

Twenty years ago today, the Chinese nation began to voice its first roar for liberation, mobilizing students, workers, merchants, farmers, and eventually attracting a large number of soldiers to fight for liberation. This roar and struggle have long been recognized as a signal and alarm bell for the rebirth of Eastern culture! And Chinese youth, with a pioneering attitude, met the world and occupied a very important position in the world's progressive movement.

Twenty years later, the entire Chinese nation has inherited the glorious spirit of struggle that began twenty years ago today. For the liberation of the Chinese nation and the defense of the rebirth of world culture, it has been drawn into an unprecedented anti-Japanese war that affects the whole world. This war has had a history-breaking impact throughout China and on the world. It has gained the full support of a magnificent socialist country created by the workers themselves, and it has also gained the sympathy and assistance of capitalist countries that love democracy and peace and the vast majority of righteous people around the world. It has promoted and expanded the revolutionary movement launched twenty years ago today, and has laid the foundation for victory in twenty-two months of arduous fighting. Nevertheless, we must also sincerely point out that our glorious and sacred struggle has not yet escaped the dangerous period. No, precisely because our struggle has achieved great and urgent significance for the entire nation and even the world, the × people have mobilized all the reactionary, dark, corrupt, and evil forces to prepare for the final counterattack. Therefore, we are facing the final moment of life and death, we will face a more serious, more difficult, and darker period; and what is particularly worth our vigilance is that all the foreign invaders who were our targets of attack twenty years ago, especially the Japanophile faction, traitors, and those who sell the country, the corrupt and backward, the stubborn conservatives, who are enslaved by Japanese aggressors, have, under the guise of Wang Jingwei's "anti-communist peace" theory, under the guise of the German and Italian superiority group's "anti-communist group," not only colluded more closely, but also played with the fascist and anti-democratic weapons concocted by the invaders, in order to use their skills of instigating, tempting, and deceiving, and launched various forms of general offensive against us!

The countercurrent will eventually be eliminated under the resistance of our vast and strong national united front, but we want to specifically raise the issue of the youth movement in the new phase here, we want to specifically recognize the youth movement in the new phase, which is also the issue of carrying forward the spirit of the "May Fourth" Youth Movement twenty years ago. The main content of this issue is, first of all, to carry forward the patriotic movement like a hurricane and angry wave in the May Fourth Youth Movement, on the one hand, to mobilize the vast number of young people to participate in the national construction cause, especially to increase , on the other hand, to step up the promotion of mass propaganda movement, with the spirit of the May Fourth youth mass going deep into the people, to widely mobilize the vivid power of the entire nation. The second is to carry forward the anti-traitor and anti-national traitor movement like a hurricane and angry wave in the May Fourth Youth Movement, from all aspects, using all methods, to fight against all current traitors, puppet traitors, and pseudo-organizations, , especially to make Wang's faction's "anti-communist peace" traitor...theory a strong backer. We must regard the struggle against traitorous theories and actions as the central task of youth in the future. Third, it is to carry forward the anti-feudal and anti-autocratic and promote democracy and promote the spirit of science in the May Fourth Youth Movement, and promote a new enlightenment movement that guarantees the victory of the liberation of the Chinese nation.

### Complete Victory in the Air Battle over Chongqing; Enemy Planes Attacked, Suffering Heavy Blows Midway; One Plane Shot Down Among the Twenty-Two Raiders over Chongqing

[Urgent Telegram from Chongqing, Associated Press, 3rd] This afternoon, this place suffered a large-scale bombing by Japanese planes, the first since mid-January. It is said that a total of forty-five Japanese bombers suddenly appeared over Chongqing, but only twenty-two actually entered the airspace over the city of Chongqing. Many of the remaining planes were intercepted by Chinese fighters on the banks of the Yangtze River. The Chinese side estimates that three Japanese planes were shot down. An Associated Press reporter personally witnessed one Japanese plane crashing and two Japanese pilots descending by parachute. Both sides engaged in fierce battles over Chongqing. The Japanese planes fought and retreated. The air battle extended to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were all incendiary bombs and small bombs, setting off seven major fires. The fire was most intense along the riverbank, occupying an area of about a quarter of a mile. Among the foreign properties destroyed was the Sino-French Shipping Company, which was hit by a bomb and completely burned down. Streetlights and telephone lines along the streets in the commercial area were all cut off by the bombing, and the fire spread, with smoke filling the sky. After the Japanese planes left, rescue teams and police officers were dispatched to teach. The Japanese planes attempted to completely destroy the city of Chongqing and twice flew in formation over the city from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, indiscriminately bombing the commercial area, residential area, and government area, dropping a bomb about every two minutes. At the same time, the Japanese planes also strafed the people below with machine guns. The Chinese anti-aircraft guns on the ground returned fire, so bullets flew across the sky. The banks of the river were also bombed, and several civilian ships were destroyed. The number of casualties is estimated to be more than 500, with more than 100 dead. However, because the fire and smoke have not yet cleared, some may be buried, so it is still difficult to ascertain the exact number.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 3rd] Some sources estimate that the number of casualties in today's large-scale bombing is over a thousand, as a refugee shelter was completely destroyed, with about 300 refugees inside, all of whom were buried alive. However, it is not yet known whether they were all killed. Four newspaper offices, including Ta Kung Pao, New China Daily, New Sichuan Daily, and Sichuan Daily, were bombed. The Sichuan Daily has been completely destroyed and cannot be published in the short term. The air defense headquarters was also bombed, and a large amount of stored gasoline was also hit and immediately burned down. It has been proven that the city's scattering cellars played a great role in this bombing. It is believed here that 1,000 casualties cannot be considered many. At the same time, the rescue teams and volunteer teams and the city's water storage facilities are excellent, so they can quickly rescue after the bombing and announce the extinguishment (according to a telegram from the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao to the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, when the × planes bombed Chongqing, the newspaper's building was damaged by the shock, but the staff were safe).

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] At 11:20 a.m. on the 3rd, the local air defense headquarters reported from Yuanling that many × planes were flying from east to west. At around 12:30 p.m., it reported again from Youyang that two batches of × planes, 18 each, were flying northwest. An air raid alert was issued at 12:45 p.m. Our planes also took off to intercept them immediately. At 12:55 p.m., an emergency alert was issued. The × planes invaded the city's airspace at 1:17 p.m. The target of their bombing seemed to be a certain military institution, but the military institutions had already evacuated to the countryside. The skills of the × pilots were also extremely poor, resulting in the nearby shops and homes suffering heavy bombing. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, there were also a large number of incendiary bombs. The areas of West 4th Street and Zuoying Street immediately caught fire and burned for a long time. At this time, our defense and police corps were dispatched amidst the sound of explosions to teach. In extreme indignation, their spirits were invigorated and their work was intense. Their emotions and sense of responsibility were fully demonstrated. The general public was also very calm and obeyed the order, with no chaos. The people also showed the greatest determination. The number of deaths and injuries and public and private losses are being actively excavated and cleared. At the same time, the Air Defense Department and the Joint Office for Emergency Relief for Air Raids are handling the aftermath. As the × planes were fiercely attacked by us, they mourned and escaped at 1:30 p.m. It is said that one was shot down by us and is now being searched for in the vicinity of Zheng. Also, today the × planes dropped hundreds of packs of red-paper-wrapped (Great Lu New Moon brand) cigarettes. Whether they contain toxic gas is being tested.

[Reuter, Chongqing, 3rd] Several Japanese planes heavily bombed this area with a dense population today. This is the first time this year. There are multiple fires breaking out. It is said that the casualties are very heavy.

[Haitong Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] At 1:15 p.m. today, 27 Japanese bombers attempted to carry out an air raid on Chongqing. Chinese fighter planes immediately took to the air to engage them, immediately shooting down one Japanese bomber. The Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs, destroying quite a bit of property.

Victories in Jin-Sui; Many Enemy Officers Killed

[Xingji, Central News Agency, 2nd] On the night of the 29th of last month, our army divided into three routes to besiege Tumen (northwest of Linfen), and dispatched small units to attack the enemy fiercely with hand-slipped bombs. The enemy was trapped in the fort and stubbornly resisted. After our all-night attack, more than 40 enemies were killed. At dawn on the 30th, hundreds of Linfen enemies came to the west for support. The battle in the Tumen area became more intense.

[Xingji, Central News Agency, 2nd] Many enemy officers have been killed recently in various parts of Jin-Sui. According to those who have been identified, there are Tanaka Masayoshi, the second battalion commander of the 77th Regiment of the 20th Division, Du Genlong, the company commander of the 26th Division, and Yamaguchi Meiji, the search team leader of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade.

[A Certain Place in Southern Jin, Central News Agency, 2nd] On the night of the 28th, the ××× Regiment of our × Division attacked Diantou Fort and Dongzhen (belonging to Wenxi). At midnight, Diantou Fort was surrounded. The battle was extremely fierce. The battalion attacking Dongzhen arrived at Macun. On the way, an encounter battle occurred with the enemy soldiers. At dawn, the enemy was exhausted and defeated. About 600 enemies from Eryanzhang, with artillery, divided into two routes and attacked our Xiaowang Village. At 8 a.m., our × Regiment contacted the enemy near Nanbucun on the enemy's flank and repelled the enemy, killing dozens of enemies. The remaining enemies fled to Weiguo Village.

[Xiangning, Civil Revolution Society, 3rd] The enemy and us are still facing off in the suburbs of Fushan City. Another part of our army attacked the area of Guanque Village and North and South Gancun (northwest of Fushan) to cut off the enemy's road to Linfen. The enemy used a large amount of poison gas to obstruct our army. The battle is still fierce.

[Xiangning, Civil Revolution Society, 3rd] The enemy in Linfen is very panicked. The puppet army is even more shaken. The enemy chief is afraid of accidents and recently forced the puppet army to all go out of the city, closing the city gates day and night to prevent our attack. Also, the Zicun Iron Bridge south of Linfen has been completely destroyed by our army. Another part of our army continued to destroy five miles of railway near Shizhuang south of the city. Traffic on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been suspended for two weeks.

[Guan County, Civil Revolution Society, 3rd] Since the 23rd of last month, a certain unit of our army in central Jin has occupied more than ten villages such as Hujia Yao and Yulin Village in Jiangshui, forming a situation of mutual support and taking the opportunity to attack the Jiangjiao area. On the morning of the 28th, about 400 enemies from Jiaocheng and Gaozi attacked Xiejiacun and Hujia Yao. They fell into our encirclement and were annihilated by more than half. Then the enemy reinforced with more than 600 troops, using fierce artillery fire to cover their attack on us. After another part of our army detoured to attack the enemy's flank, the enemy's formation was suddenly disrupted. During the melee, more than 2,000 enemy troops from Qingyuan, Taigu, and Yexian came to join the battle, with more than ten artillery pieces, and surrounded Pingyao from our southeast. More than 1,000 enemy reinforcements came from the Fenyang area, with eight artillery pieces and more than ten tanks. On our west side, a bloody battle unfolded. Our officers and soldiers bravely engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy more than ten times before breaking away from the battle. In this battle, one enemy captain, one interpreter officer, and more than 300 enemy soldiers were killed. We also suffered more than ten casualties.

[Xiangning, Civil Revolution Society, 3rd] (1) On the morning of the 27th, a joint infantry and cavalry enemy force of about 150 attacked villages such as Shuangchang and Hanhou (belonging to Zhaocheng) from Wan'an. Our army bravely shot at them. The enemy could not support it and fled back to Wan'an. In this battle, dozens of enemies were killed. We also had six soldiers killed in action and five wounded. (2) The remaining enemies at Heilongguan attempted to break through on the morning of the 28th. One part fled east and another part fled south. After we gave them a heavy blow, they still fled back. The encirclement and annihilation are still in progress. (3) On the morning of the 25th, more than 300 enemies from Fencheng, with three artillery pieces, attacked us in two routes. Our army had already ambushed west of Qianjiaping and Xitujian, attacking the enemy unexpectedly and giving them a fierce blow. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy could not support it and fled back to Fencheng. In this battle, more than 30 enemies were killed or wounded, and more than ten rifles were captured.

[Wuyuan, Central News Agency, 28th] A certain detachment of our army encountered hundreds of enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery joint units in Liangcheng, Weiyuanpu, and Jiaonigou in eastern Sui. The enemy also had air cover. The fighting was very fierce. Both the enemy and us suffered casualties. Also, a part of our army in the south of Qingshuihe in southern Sui launched a bloody battle with the enemy. After our repeated fierce attacks, the enemy suffered heavy losses.

[Wuyuan, Central News Agency, 28th] According to reports, there are now more than 2,800 enemies in Baotou and about 1,000 enemies in Guyang. Recently, the enemies in northern Sui have used many trucks to transport a large amount of ammunition and supplies to Bailin Temple.

[Wuyuan, Central News Agency, 28th] At a special time on the fourth day of the month, a certain guerrilla detachment of our army encountered more than 30 enemy armored vehicles, several artillery pieces, and about 500 or 600 cavalry west of the Black Church in Guyang. Our army bravely charged and killed. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, a certain unit of our army engaged in a fierce battle with more than 100 enemies near Shantang for three hours. The enemy could not support it and fled to the northwest.

[Wuyuan, Central News Agency, 28th] According to reports, from April 8th to the 26th, we killed more than 350 enemies in the territory of Sa County and captured two military radio stations and hundreds of guns.

After Our Adoption of New Offensive, Fierce Battles Recently in Urban Areas

### Shanghai's Newspaper Industry in Arduous Struggle; The Leader and Translator Automatically Stop Publication for One Day; Protesting the Banning of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Speech

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] The English-owned Chinese newspapers "The Leader" and "The Translator" here have voluntarily ceased publication for one day today because the British Consul banned the publication of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration on May 1st. Other American-owned Chinese newspapers have published the entire declaration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

[Shanghai Correspondence] The British Consulate General in Shanghai convened a meeting of publishers of English-owned Chinese newspapers on the 22nd of last month. During the meeting, the British Consulate instructed the following six prohibitions from being published:

1. The words "traitor", "enemy", "strong man", etc.

2. ×× - indicating the Japanese.

3. Announcements, etc., relating to the Kuomintang or similar organizations.

4. ×× - implying the Japanese.

5. All news relating to anti-war sentiment and movements occurring within Japan or among Japanese troops in China.

6. Propaganda news or submissions of an anti-Japanese nature that could incite anti-Japanese sentiment or create anti-Japanese terrorist incidents.

After hearing this, the publishers of the various foreign-owned Chinese newspapers were answered by Pace, who said that British newspapers had a traditional freedom, and that if various prohibitions were to be stipulated, it would be in clear violation of the Constitution, so the authorities of the Consulate General had no such authority. If it is necessary to stipulate various prohibitions, it must be resolved in the British Parliament.

(Note: There are six English-owned Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, four dailies and two evening newspapers: (1) Wenhui Pao, (2) Translator, (3) The Leader, (4) International Daily, (5) Great Evening News, (6) Great British Evening News. Also, Wenhui Pao publishes an evening edition separately, and has not obtained another license, so it cannot be called an independent newspaper.)

All the employees of the English-owned Chinese newspapers have sent a telegram to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China in Chongqing, asking him not to set any other prohibitions on English-owned Chinese newspapers.

### A New Force in the Resistance: The North China Railway Destruction Team (Continued from yesterday)

— Chen Zhengfei

His method of destruction is very simple, relying on his simple mechanical knowledge, which makes the enemy's vigilance very high. After being fooled once and having a locomotive blown up, they immediately tried every means to detect our actions. However, the result was still that the locomotive was decorated with a big lottery - it was destroyed. In order to avoid the locomotive's "Tai Ge death", the enemy finally installed two or three "tin cars" filled with stones in front of the locomotive. The old method worked once. Twice they were really blown up by this worthless tin car, and the locomotive was unharmed. But then they gained another method. Finally, under the protection of the third "tin" pioneer car lamp, they still sent the buying and selling car to the new head station. For the convenience of the destruction team's continued work in the future, the reporter is not accurate to say much about the many ingenious methods of the second team. In short, any enemy's strict prevention and countermeasures cannot stop the destruction team's activities, unless it concentrates all its forces on both sides of the railway line, making the soldiers stand in single-file columns, more densely than telephone poles. Otherwise, this railway destruction team can still multiply in his gaps like mercury. But can the enemy have such a large force? If it is true that they are gathered together, making it impossible for the destruction team to move, then we can glue together many enemy divisions without spending a bullet or a soldier. Therefore, the reporter said that the railway destruction team is the economic force of the resistance, the economic resistance force. Although that is the case, this railway destruction team cannot survive without the assistance of the local people and the cover of the army. The people near the accident site have exhausted many means of writing threatening letters. If the people cannot recognize the importance of this kind of action and are unwilling to endure the enemy's cruel blame, reporting to × at any time, then naturally all adventurous efforts have been paid to the stream. Therefore, the activities of the railway destruction team must first obtain the cooperation of the local people. The success of the railway destruction team on Daoxiao Road is indeed the effort of the tin destruction team under the leadership of ×××, and it is also the achievement of the people there. Secondly, it is because divisions such as ×× have already selected soldiers to learn from this destruction team in large numbers, making the work of destroying the railway now spread to the ×× Road. The reporter hopes that the troops in other battlefields across the country can also follow suit, so that the work of destruction can be spread to every transportation artery occupied by the enemy, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the future of the resistance. (The End)

### "May 3rd" Commemoration Day in Shanghai; Flag Hanging Causes Conflict; Police Arrest Eight People; Situation Tense for a Time

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] This afternoon, a small conflict occurred between Chinese shops and patrolmen in the area of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road over the issue of county flags.

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] After the Tongfu Road incident occurred, a large team of patrolmen went to the scene and summoned three teams of White Russian Volunteers to guard the area, demanding that Chinese shops remove the national flag.

### 300 Female Students Petition in Formation; Demand Release of Principal

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] After the Shanghai Municipal Council interfered in the matter of Chinese shops hanging flags on Tongfu Road, about 300 female students went to Chengdu Road Police Station in formation, demanding the right to freely hang the national flag. The police station is currently feeling the heat of this problem, because they do not want to use force against these female students. Therefore, there is currently no way to decide, and it is feared that they will stay in the police station until they become tired. They also indicated that the activists may be arrested.

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] The reason why the Chinese female students went to the patrol station was because the patrolmen ordered the principal to take down the flag when the school hung flags to commemorate May 3rd. The principal refused, saying that the flag belonged to the students and that he had no right to take it down. The patrolmen then detained him and took him to the police station. The female students of the school then went in formation. After negotiations, the principal was released, and the female students all returned home. The national flag was also taken down.

### Eurasia Plane Attacked Last Month in French Indochina; British Ambassador Fortunately Canceled Ticket; Japanese Plane's Target Deserves Attention

[Local News] According to the "Smesy" newspaper, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had originally reserved a seat to fly to Chongqing, but then, for some reason, he canceled his ticket at the last minute. The plane, en route from Hanoi to Chongqing, was suddenly attacked by Japanese planes. It is reported that the Japanese authorities were paying close attention to the movements of personnel from the British Embassy in China, and they had the latest information on their every move. The fact that the plane was attacked is particularly noteworthy. According to the pilot, when the Eurasia plane was attacked, it was definitely within French territory. The Japanese planes participating in the attack numbered as many as six, and they came with great ferocity, constantly strafing the plane with machine guns. Seeing this, the pilot quickly tried to fly the plane into the dense clouds near the mountain peaks to hide. The Japanese planes also circled around the dense clouds, and every time the Eurasia plane emerged from the clouds, they immediately resumed strafing with machine guns and guns. This went on for half an hour, and the pilot then decided to land. Fortunately, the plane landed safely within Chinese territory, but the Japanese planes did not stop and continued to drop bombs and strafe the landing area with machine guns. After the Japanese planes left, an unexploded bomb was found 5,000 meters from the landing site within French territory. The location of the Japanese plane attack on the Eurasia plane was at the border between Chinese and French territory. Subsequently, the French authorities in Hanoi dispatched another plane for the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to fly to Chongqing.

### Guiyang After the Bombing

— Ye Juesun

[Special Correspondence from Guiyang] At nine o'clock in the morning, I boarded the Ministry of Transportation's car again to go to Guiyang. All along the way were high mountains and steep ridges, and the car jumped and bounced violently. At twelve o'clock, I arrived in Guiyang. The section of the street from outside the city to the Far East Hotel can still be considered prosperous. This is also the only surviving lifeline after the Japanese planes frantically bombed Guiyang city on February 4th. According to statistics from the local Civilians' Association, 42 streets were affected, more than 1,300 households were destroyed, and more than 13,400 people were affected. The tragic situation can be imagined.

Because Guiyang is currently the transportation center of the Southwest, with highways leading east to Chengde and Changsha in western Hunan, south to Guilin in Guangxi, west to Kunming in Yunnan, northwest to Yijie, and north to Guizhou in Sichuan, and south through Xuanwei in Yunnan to Kunming. Going north from Guizhou, the Qianchuan Highway leads directly to Chongqing. Therefore, although Guiyang has just experienced a great calamity, it is still overcrowded today. The streets, taverns, and even every large and small inn are full of people, and the cost of living is surprisingly high. A guest meal costs at least seventy cents of a silver dollar. Underwear and undershirts all cost three or four yuan apiece, ordinary leather shoes are priced at twenty-five yuan, and pork costs just over two jin per yuan... As the small tea boy in the Far East Hotel said to me, "Guiyang has become Guiyang (expensive ocean)!" It is impossible to do anything without silver dollars. The cost of living in the countryside compared to the city is almost ten times different. This kind of abnormal and disparate situation really needs to be corrected. Economic tactics in the long-term war of resistance should also "cooperate" with military operations. "We cannot concentrate our forces at one point, giving the Japanese the opportunity to break through our main force. Therefore, building the countryside and dispersing capital to the western countryside" should be the proper steps for economic warfare in the second phase.

The surviving local newspapers after the bombing are the Central Daily News and the Revolutionary Daily News. The Chongqing-based Ta Kung Pao, Xinhua Daily, and Saodang Daily are also available every other day. Bookstores include Life Bookstore, World Bookstore, Self-Reliance Bookstore, Military Academy Bookstore... Among them, the best business and the most crowded are probably the World Bookstore and Life Bookstore. The latter is only open for five hours a day, from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. It is said that in these five hours, they can average 200 yuan in sales. Among them, magazines sell the best.

The situation of the March 8th Charity Bazaar in Guiyang was not very good. Many wives of important people were giving speeches while gesticulating around the copper and iron booths. Female students from Great China University were also doing group charity sales. The Central Daily News, Revolutionary Daily News... also organized charity sales teams. But the result was less than 4,000 yuan. If each of the 140,000 citizens contributed an average of five cents, it would amount to 7,000 yuan. Moreover, the current population is larger than before, and those who come are all wealthy. Given these results, we cannot deny that the atmosphere in Guiyang is still far from resembling a rear area of ​​resistance. On the other hand, the ticket prices for Peking opera are extremely expensive (including the donation, one yuan and seventy cents of a silver dollar per ticket), but the theaters are crowded every night. It is also said that if you don't tell the ticket seller what your background is first, it's really hard to buy even one good seat.

When I visited the five committee members of the provincial government, I was told that everything has progressed rapidly since the Central Army entered Guizhou in 1935. Since Wu Dingchang has been in charge of Guizhou, he has had good personal relations and financial resources, so many facilities have been implemented according to plan. Currently, the central tasks of the administration are roughly no more than conscription, strengthening local politics, and developing industry. Guizhou's prefectures and counties follow the principle of contributing money if they have money and contributing effort if they have effort, so they pay special attention to conscription. Currently, an average of seven or eight thousand conscripts are enlisting each month, and local politics are being improved, so progress will be rapid in the future.

Since the establishment of the Mining Bureau, the Agriculture Bureau, and the Cooperative Treasury, the industry of Guizhou Province has been greatly improved. Mercury in Tongren and Shengxi, coal in Zunyi, Anshun, and Pingyue, iron in Qingxi... are also being developed.

Most interestingly, two years ago, the people's tung oil was difficult to transport and had no market, so the people were very distressed. Later, the government helped them find ways to transport it and tried their best to sell the tung oil produced in the province. As a result, the people were very happy. Now, tung oil is more expensive than vegetable oil, and tung seeds are more expensive than tung oil, because everyone is buying tung seeds and working hard to plant tung trees.

Tangshan Engineering College of Jiaotong University is now in Pingyue, and Great China University and Guizhou Medical College are both in the city. In addition, many cultural figures, intellectuals, and technical personnel from all over the country come to Guiyang, so the government is taking this opportunity to run training classes for local administrative personnel and training classes for Baojia chiefs to gather talents from all walks of life in order to strengthen the efficiency of local political institutions. Naturally, these are all very practical and immediately visible achievements.

Finally, we talked about the issue of the "barbarians." He believes that this is by no means a national issue, as some people say, but simply an education issue. Because from the actual situation, the Han and Miao people in Guizhou are originally like one family, and there is fundamentally no political or economic conflict of interest. Frankly speaking, the Miao people's cultural level and political standards have not yet reached the point of making political claims and suggestions. Therefore, our most important work at present is how to educate, enlighten, and improve their lives.

As the saying goes, "Guizhou has no three sunny days." The reporter stayed in Guizhou for two weeks, but the sky cleared and the sun shone every day, and the weather was clear. Perhaps the weather has also changed with the times. Because the sky is clear, the fear of air raids constantly threatens people's hearts.

### German Troops Gather on Polish Border; Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; Polish Counter-Demands Adopt Resolute Attitude; German Foreign Minister to Go to Rome for Consultations

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] It was announced here that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will leave here tomorrow night for Italy, for a stay of several days. He will meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Foreign political circles believe that Germany and Italy intend to discuss taking joint action to respond to the "encirclement group." It is believed that Danzig and Poland will be the subject of Ribbentrop's talks with Ciano. When the Polish Foreign Minister delivers a reply to Hitler's speech in Parliament on the 5th, Ribbentrop will still be in Rome, so the reaction of the Axis countries is very smooth. It is reported that any demands by Poland in Danzig will be severely rejected by Germany, and Mussolini has also promised to fully support Germany.

[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] According to unconfirmed rumors in diplomatic circles here, Mussolini has advised Hitler to handle the dispute with Poland with caution, as Italy is unwilling to be drawn into a war over Danzig. Although the rumor did not specify whether Italy would fight alongside Germany if the Danzig dispute led to war, foreign observers believe that the Italian people do not want to think about it. They believe that if Britain can remain neutral, fighting with France would be most welcome; otherwise, they would rather focus on solving the problem of increasingly difficult domestic life. Local newspapers carried a dispatch from Paris stating that France hopes Italy can be responsible for mediating the dispute between Germany and Poland, which has profound implications. It is generally believed that Italy has no intention of allowing Hitler and Poland to have a genuine conflict.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 1st] The attention of French political circles continues to be focused on the Danzig issue. Most French political commentators believe that there is no possibility of coordination between Germany and Poland on the Danzig dispute. According to reports received this afternoon, the Polish government has notified Britain of its draft counter-demands, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Poland retains sovereignty over Danzig; (2) Poland controls the Danzig Senate; (3) Danzig is occupied by Polish troops; (4) Poland controls Danzig's heavy industry. "Paris Evening News" particularly emphasized the extension of the term of the German Ambassador to Poland. The visit of the French Ambassador to Poland to Berlin also has great significance. It is generally speculated that this move is related to Burke's visit to France on the 15th of this month. The other evening newspapers all believe that relations between Germany and Poland have entered an extremely serious stage.

[Warsaw, 3rd] Local newspapers are writing articles urging people to defend their country, and quoting the speech of Nationalist Party leader Kowalski, "If war breaks out in Europe, it must be due to German aggression, just like the Great War of 1914. Germany has now begun to advance eastward, and Poland will once again be an obstacle to its eastward advance. If Germany continues to advance eastward, it will be met with armed resistance. Poland will not only fight to protect its own direct interests, but also to oppose Germany's expansion of power to other parts of Europe. We only want to maintain the power of free nations, and we have no intention of encircling Germany. We are not afraid of war and are well prepared to meet any challenge."

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The German newspapers' attacks on Poland have become increasingly sharp and violent, mostly focused on two points: (1) Poland seems to have forgotten that it is neighboring a strong country; (2) After accepting Britain's guarantee, it has become too credulous. The "Hamburg Newspaper Foreign Edition" stated: "If Poland begins to engage in propaganda that is not coordinated with East Prussia, then in terms of reason and emotion, Germany should consider establishing an indestructible chain with that endangered province." According to observations in political circles, Germany will not take any active action on the German-Polish dispute before Burke delivers his speech on May 5, because Burke's speech will state Poland's position based on Hitler's declaration. According to visitors to the German-Polish border, troop convoys can be seen gathering in various towns, but officials have stated that the border has always been heavily guarded, so there are no special military activities. It is reported that troops recently transferred back from Bohemia and Moravia, who were originally supposed to be given leave, have also been transferred to the Polish border to reinforce defenses.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] German newspapers recently made inflammatory statements about German-Polish relations. Political figures believe that this is the beginning of German pressure on Poland in order to demand the return of Danzig. On the other hand, it is said that this is deliberately demonstrating to the Polish Foreign Minister and affecting his speech on Friday. The "Official Gazette" stated that Britain and France instigated Poland to participate in the encirclement of Germany.

### German Government Conducting Efforts to Conciliate Nordic Countries; Proposes Mutual Guarantees; Governments are Studying the Matter

[Associated Press, Copenhagen, Denmark, 3rd] According to news from Berlin, the German government has proposed to the Nordic countries that they sign mutual guarantees with Germany. Government officials have formally begun negotiations with Germany, but the content of the negotiations has not yet been announced. It is believed that the governments of the Nordic countries are currently carefully studying this issue with each other.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] According to a correspondent from the "Exchange Telegraph Mail" in the Swedish capital, people close to the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm said that the news reported by a Berlin correspondent of the Swedish newspaper "Millingen" that the Nordic countries will conduct negotiations with Germany to sign mutual guarantees is an exaggeration. Only Sweden may be slightly involved, as Germany has instructed its ambassador to Sweden to solicit the Swedish government's opinion on signing a guarantee treaty, but the government will not make any statement until it has held talks with the Nordic countries. These sources also said that this guarantee treaty can only be a non-aggression pact.

### Italian King Sends Telegram to Egypt; Expresses Friendly Attitude; Egypt Said to Support Italian Demands; Italian-Romanian Talks Have Concluded

[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] According to reliable sources, Italian King Vittorio Emanuele III has sent a telegram to Egyptian King Farouk, expressing the Italian government's desire to respect Egypt's integrity. The telegram also expressed Italy's friendly intentions towards Egypt. It is believed here that this guarantee from Italy to Egypt is to obtain Egypt's support for Italy's request to participate in the management of the Suez Canal.

[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held his final consultations with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this evening and is scheduled to return home on May 5.

### Portugal Awards King of England Honorary Cross Medal

### German Immigrants in England Engaging in Nazi Activities; Many Deported

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British Home Office has recently submitted to the German Embassy a list of German immigrants in England who are related to Nazi organizations in England and have been ordered to leave the country.

The reasons for expulsion were purely for engaging in Nazi activities. It is believed that the number of those expelled is quite large. As for the estimate of 50 people being expelled, as reported in the evening newspapers, it is somewhat exaggerated.

### Irish Opposes Extension of British Conscription to Northern Ireland; Northern Ireland Prime Minister Expresses Loyalty

[Reuters, London, 2nd] In the Military Training Bill, there are separate treatments for Northern Ireland and other parts of the Empire. The Irish MPs in the Lower House have decided to oppose this point.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Irish Free State President Eamon de Valera said in Parliament today that he has protested to the British government against the extension of the British government's conscription system to Northern Ireland in certain circumstances. The Irish government denies Britain the right to conscript in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland is part of Ireland. The opposition party also supports the government's position. Professor O'Sullivan said that this action by the British government is difficult to imagine.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain for half an hour, saying that he had repeatedly stated that he was prepared to hand over all of Northern Ireland's manpower and financial resources to the Imperial government, and said that he had asked the Imperial government how Northern Ireland people could show their loyalty to their motherland, and was awaiting the Imperial government's decision.

### European Anti-Aggression, Negotiating the Chen Line, Britain and the Soviet Union Continue to Study Good Strategies, Britain Hopes for Cooperation among Balkan Countries

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The British Cabinet held its weekly meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning and discussed the negotiations with the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to establish a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union with military conditions.

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European anti-aggression front is still being studied by the British side. However, the number of countries involved in the Anglo-Soviet talks is very large, so it is not possible to obtain the best solution in the short term. According to reports from various newspapers here, the Soviet Union advocates that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can form a firm alliance and repeatedly provide guarantees. The British side, on the other hand, believes that a kind of agreement should be established by various countries. The method of providing joint assistance to various countries does not need to be specifically stipulated, but can be decided by the countries themselves. Britain trusts that all Balkan countries (including Bulgaria) can cooperate harmoniously.

Short Commentary

### Grand Union of the Drama World

The famous play "Huanghuagang," a joint grand performance by the entire Hong Kong drama community, premiered at the Taiping Theatre last night and will continue to be performed for the next two evenings.

We express our utmost joy and importance to this performance of the famous play "Huanghuagang." The main reasons are as follows:

First, "Huanghuagang" is a great revolutionary historical drama that reflects the ideology of the early Ming Chinese national revolution. Although our national revolution has now entered a new stage, the experiences and lessons left to us by the revolutionary martyrs still need to be universally and conscientiously accepted. How to make these historical facts, experiences, and lessons universally recognized, understood, and absorbed by the public is one of the main tasks of the current drama community. The performance of "Huanghuagang" clearly has its pioneering significance.

Second, this performance is hosted by the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Association, and the funds raised will be fully allocated to the Fallen Soldiers' Dependents Relief Fund. This is not only a pioneering initiative in Hong Kong, but also has its scale of significance in China and even overseas. We must know that to win the Anti-Japanese War, we must rely on the enhancement of frontline combat effectiveness. It is imperative to ensure the livelihood of the soldiers' families, so that they can fight at the front with peace of mind. In the future success of nation-building, we must rely on the cultivation of a vast new force. Establishing a relief fund for the dependents of fallen soldiers is one of the primary tasks in cultivating the future new force, and should also be regarded as an important task of the current overseas Chinese community.

But what is particularly important is the third point, that is, this performance involves more than 30 theater troupes, mobilizing more than 500 actors. This is not only an unprecedented event in Hong Kong, but also unprecedented in China. In particular, it demonstrates the unprecedented grand union of the Hong Kong drama community. In addition to encouraging the actors and theater troupes participating in this union to go one step further, we should further consolidate and develop the united front of the Hong Kong drama community, so that the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement can have further development.

### Amidst Strengthening of the Anti-Aggression Front, Soviet Fleet to Visit Hong Kong, First Time in 25 Years, Comprising Four Ships including Destroyers and Submarines, Will Arrive in Hong Kong within This Week from a Certain Place after Visiting Manila for Ten Days

It has been 25 years since a Soviet fleet has visited Hong Kong since the Russo-Japanese War. According to a reporter's investigation, a Soviet fleet, including a new destroyer, a submarine, and three mine-laying ships, a total of four ships, will arrive in Little Luzon this Saturday and will then sail to Hong Kong for a visit after a short stay. It is reported that the Hong Kong authorities will give them a warm welcome. Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Memel by Germany and the conquest of Albania by Italy, the world situation has become increasingly dangerous. Britain and France are trying to save the critical situation, inviting the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Greece, and other countries to form an anti-aggression front, and adopting a grand encirclement against Italy and Germany. Amidst the strengthening of this anti-aggression front, the sudden arrival of the Soviet fleet is undoubtedly of great importance to the world. Since 1915, Russia has not had warships visiting Hong Kong. After the Soviet regime came to power, they changed the flag to the hammer and sickle, and warships with this flag have never been seen in Hong Kong (only merchant ships have flown it in recent years), so this can be said to be the first time. It is reported that the fleet coming east this time consists of four ships: (1) the "Most Jia" (加) , which is a submarine tender, weighing 740 tons, built in 1937; (2) the "Yu Jia" (域加) , which is a torpedo destroyer, also 740 tons, carrying 50 mines; (3) "Ba La" (巴刺); (4) "Ji Su" (急蘇), both of which are mine-laying ships, but their tonnage is unknown. According to the current schedule, they will arrive in Manila from a certain place on Saturday and will sail to Hong Kong 12 days later. The Hong Kong naval authorities have received this message, but have not yet formally received a notice from the Soviet side. According to usual procedures, foreign fleets must notify at least one week in advance before arriving in Hong Kong. It has also been found that in recent years, the Soviet Union has been vigorously strengthening its military preparations in the Far East. In addition to the powerful army and air force, the force stationed in Vladivostok is also quite alarming, especially the power of submarines, which often makes Japan uneasy. It is not yet known whether the fleet will be stationed in Vladivostok after cruising various ports in the Far East.

### Macau Water and Electricity Company Agrees to Reduce Water and Electricity Fees to Facilitate Investment by Hong Kong Manufacturers

After the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association visited Macau and returned to Hong Kong, they had a very good impression of the place. After careful consideration, the manufacturers all intend to set up branch factories in Macau. However, the factories set up consume a lot of electricity and water. Without the local electricity and water companies slightly reducing the electricity and water fees, they would not dare to proceed lightly. Therefore, the Manufacturers Association specifically wrote to the Macau electricity and water companies to request a reduction, and received a reply yesterday agreeing to support the proposal. Last month, the Manufacturers Association's inspection team visited Macau, and the association and its members donated a total of approximately HK$2,000 in charity funds to build refugee schools and subsidize the expenses of the Immaculate Conception Children's Handicraft Institute. A letter of thanks was also received yesterday.

It was resolved that the government should be urged again. Regarding the issue of insufficient Kowloon inspectors, which affects public safety, Chairman Guan Cheng said that he had sent a letter to the police to appeal for strengthening the Kowloon inspector force. Austin Road complained that the sounds of taxis and buses disturbed them at night and prevented them from sleeping, and requested to negotiate with the Transport Department. The horns of private cars are especially harsh. The chairman replied that the association had repeatedly complained to the Transport Department, but unexpectedly, the old habits have recently resurfaced. As for the problem of private car horns, they can negotiate with the Automobile Association. A member proposed that regarding tenants building air defense shelters or shelters, they are often obstructed by landlords, which is contrary to the government's original intention of promoting air defense plans. He requested the association to submit a new air defense law to the government, allowing tenants to build various air defense equipment in the rented houses. The chairman replied that it is not difficult to negotiate directly with the landlord to slightly renovate the house. The association will consider this matter carefully.

The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association has launched the Hong Kong Journalists' Signature and Oath Movement in order to support the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures.

### Another Farmhouse in Ping Shan New Village, New Territories, Searched and Robbed by Three Thieves, Two Western Women Robbed by Three Thieves in Kowloon City

Yesterday morning, a farmhouse in Ping Shan New Village, New Territories, was once again broken into and robbed by three thieves. The victim was a woman, who reported the incident to the Ping Shan police station. She was identified as Deng Tianhao (20 years old) and her friend Chen Cailan (13 years old), residing at No. 33 Ping Shan New Village, New Territories. On the morning of yesterday at 2:00 AM, the two were fast asleep when Deng was awakened by the sound of prying open the door. Deng fully intended to leave to see what was going on, but three thieves had already broken in. Two of them were holding sharp knives, preventing Deng from making a sound, otherwise they would cut off her head. Deng, in this situation, was forced to lie still and let the thieves do what they wanted. After the thieves subdued Deng, they also restrained her friend, and then looted on a large scale, overturning boxes and cabinets for about 20 minutes before escaping with the stolen goods. After the thieves left, she immediately went to the Ping Shan police to report the case. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large team of officers to search for the bandits, but the bandits had already disappeared without a trace and could not be captured. Fortunately, what was robbed this time was very little, only a gold ring worth five yuan, one Hong Kong dollar, and a copper alarm clock. Also, a Western woman named Lai, yesterday accompanied her five-year-old son and another female friend along the reservoir near Kowloon City. At 4 pm, while resting on a stone bench there, three big men suddenly ran down the mountain towards them. Two of them were holding small knives and threatened them, forbidding them from making a sound. The Western woman saw that the thieves were very fierce and dared not resist. As a result, a gold ring and a wristwatch, worth a total of 75 yuan, were stolen. The Western woman lives in Building A, No. 4 Kimberley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui. Afterwards, the Western woman went to the police station to report the case and asked for help in catching the bandits.

### The Intensification of the Struggle for Survival: Coolies Forming Gangs and Fighting, Occurring Several Times in Recent Days Due to Competition for Business; Another Brawl Erupted in Central Yesterday, One Person Severely Injured

Yesterday morning at 9:45 AM, in front of the Guangdong Bank on Des Voeux Road Central, several coolies, each wielding bamboo poles, cleavers, wine bottles, and other weapons, engaged in a fierce brawl. As a result, one coolie named Ling Huan, 38 years old (nickname "Hakka Kid"), was slashed three times, once on each ear and once on the forehead. His injuries were severe, and he collapsed on the ground, bleeding profusely. During the brawl, an Indian clerk from the Guangdong Bank witnessed the scene and immediately blew a whistle to summon the police to quell the disturbance. Police constables stationed nearby responded swiftly upon hearing the alarm. The brawlers scattered in different directions, but one coolie was eventually apprehended by a Chinese detective from a certain station and taken to the Central Police Station for investigation and prosecution. The injured victim was transported to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment by ambulance. It has been learned that the cause of this brawl was a conflict over securing jobs. Several days ago, three similar gang fights occurred, during which a coolie surnamed Wong was severely injured and is currently hospitalized at Queen Mary Hospital. The police authorities are now actively investigating and taking strict measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

### An Unprecedented Contribution from Hong Kong's Theatrical Community: "Huanghuagang" Premiered Last Night

— Kee Cheuk

Excellent Results, Enthusiastic Atmosphere, Performances Continue Tonight and Tomorrow Night

The highly anticipated great revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang" finally premiered last night at the Tai Ping Theatre before thousands of people. The unprecedented unity, unprecedented effort, and unprecedented contribution of the Hong Kong spoken drama community created a landmark record last night. This glorious historical page reflects the countless thoughts and spilled blood of so many people. Here, we should first pay the highest respect of national liberation to the hundreds of enthusiastic workers behind the scenes and on the organizing committee!

In this heated, tense scene, the most interesting place was backstage:

Actors, staff, props... filled the spacious backstage. Under the arrangement of makeup masters like Lee King-po, Keung Ming, and Tong Suk-ming, revolutionary patriots, old Qing officials, sedan carriers, and Qing soldiers were all transformed. She laughed at his queue looking like a pig's tail. He laughed at her embroidered dress looking like some kind of billboard! Some mumbled their lines, others practiced their stage movements with gestures and dances. The stagehands and electricians were all in lively work clothes, busily working tirelessly. "Division of labor and cooperation" and "no matter too small" were fully demonstrated in practice. There were also "large lanterns," "large dragon flags," and road signs saying "Silence! Avoidance!" ... What a set of feudal antiques, what despicable dregs of progress, heartbreaking national humiliation,

Inevitably evoking endless emotion!

Mr. Woo Chun-bing, the stage manager, was one of the most hardworking leaders. He said, "For the past half month, everything else has been put aside; the only thing we've been doing is preparing for the premiere of 'Huanghuagang.'" His complexion looked very tired, but his spirit was still very excited. Just like Mr. Au-Yeung Yu-qian, this is the cause they entrust their spirit to, this is the joy of their lives.

Mr. Au-Yeung said, "Joint performances are really troublesome; but once you start doing it, you can taste the real flavor."

After touring backstage, I took a walk around the three floors of the theater. The second floor was the most crowded, the third floor was mostly occupied by the choir, but there were still many empty seats in the main hall, showing that many upper-class people were still aloof, and that supporting the families of fallen soldiers had nothing to do with them. This is not necessarily an outline of Hong Kong society.

At 7:30, the magnificent singing voice, accompanied by bugles, shook the entire venue. Mr. Lau Ying directed with exceptional liveliness and power, because more than 20 choral groups, hundreds of choristers, were also, like the spoken drama, united on an unprecedented scale. The first song was the national anthem, and the entire audience stood in solemn tribute. "May 31," "May Fourth," "May 51"—what days they were! Sensitive overseas compatriots were moved again. The second was the "Huanghuagang Song," "... ""Who can bear to say goodbye to parents and wives and children forever?"" ... For the freedom and liberation of the nation, we vow to bury our white bones in Huanghuagang ""..."" "May the 450 million compatriots rise together" ... "" Every sentence touched people's hearts. Then came many more patriotic songs, deeply wishing that our dear compatriots would cherish the enthusiastic mood and initiate practical work.

At 8 o'clock sharp, "Huanghuagang" opened amid thunderous applause.

The scenery outside the East Gate of Guangzhou was very realistic, and the hawkers selling peanuts and sugar cane were lifelike, giving the audience a sense of fun first. Once the main plot unfolded, it was very passionate and very solemn.

The ugliness of the Manchu Qing Dynasty made people's teeth itch. Wen Shengcai assassinated Li Zhun, but he ran out of bullets and was captured. It was not Li Zhun who died, but Fu Qi. The heroic words, "Killing one more traitor, one more Manchu slave, will rid China of one more pest," aroused thunderous applause from the audience. Martyr Wen's calm spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is a typical patriotic martyr of the Chinese nation.

After the prologue came the first act. The scenery was the secret headquarters of the revolutionary party, where female comrades were working enthusiastically, and some revolutionary comrades were waiting for Huang Keqiang to arrive. Although the Manchu Qing dogs came to search, they were fortunately dealt with. Mrs. Lin Juemin came from afar to visit her husband, but for the sake of revolutionary work, she overcame her feelings with reason and avoided meeting him.

As soon as Huang Keqiang—played by Dun—arrived, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. The determination to either succeed or die moved many revolutionary comrades. However, certain vacillating elements were annoying. Taking the past as a lesson, there are inevitably cowards, short-sighted people, and selfish people parasitizing in any group. One day will be the end of their doom.

The interweaving of love between Huang Keqiang and his lover Xu Zonghan—played by Au Oi—warmed the solemn atmosphere. However, they were not lovers of love-supremacism, but love as a means of revolutionary assistance. This is not necessarily an inspiration for young men and women to have a correct view of love.

The scenery in the second act was the Western-style hall inside the Governor-General's Yamen of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the decorations were very gorgeous. Zhang Mingqi—played by Cheung Chik-sun—looked very much like a Manchu slave showing off his stinking airs. Keung Ming played a servant, although "heroes have no place to use their talents." But his actions were enough to make people laugh. Zhang's concubine—played by To Chuk-wan—'s flirting and charming demeanor also enlivened the plot. What this scene shows is that Zhang Mingqi "is wondering why the revolutionaries can't be captured and killed completely," the so-called "wild grass cannot be burned out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again."

The location of the third act is another revolutionary base, and the time is the night before "March 29." Many male and female comrades were carrying ammunition, actively preparing for the uprising. "Even if this time fails, the impact on the general public will be indelible"; "Whoever is afraid of sacrifice is not worthy of being a revolutionary"; "We want to complete this glorious page of history"; "The time has come to the final juncture; if we don't succeed, we will become martyrs." The revolutionaries encourage and influence each other. A good example is presented to overseas compatriots.

The fourth act is when Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun interrogate the revolutionaries Chen Meixin and Rao Guoying in the Governor-General's Office. The revolutionaries attack and the scene is very tense. Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun flee in a hurry, and their embarrassed situation causes half the audience to laugh coldly. However, because our strength was insufficient, the seventy-two martyrs sacrificed heroically! But at the same time, the revolutionary sparks all over the country spread even more widely.

This failure is the mother of the eleventh success. The final scene shows the success of the Wuchang Uprising in October of the same year, and the Republic of China was established! The seventy-two martyrs are smiling in the afterlife!

Twenty-eight years later, on "March 29," our compatriots hold a memorial meeting in Huanghuagang.

"Dear compatriots and comrades, after twenty-two months of national self-defense and resistance, we have progressed to a new and critical stage. To accelerate the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we must exhaust our own abilities and thoroughly fulfill the missions that the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and Dr. Sun Yat-sen entrusted to us! A new China is about to be reborn. The spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs will never die! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Republic of China!"

Right at 12 o'clock that night, amidst the extreme tension and the thunderous applause of thousands of audience members, the curtain fell. Tonight and tomorrow night, come and appreciate the most progressive theatrical art and receive the baptism of the revolution! This is too rare an opportunity.

### Inaugural Address

— Ho Chau

The life insurance business has only been around for over fifty years in China. Initially, foreign companies established branches in China to attract Chinese business, with annual profits flowing out unchecked. It wasn't until the first year of the Republic of China that Chinese people organized their own companies. However, due to the lack of public awareness, it failed to attract the attention of the society for a time. After more than ten years, Chinese-run companies were established again. Until recently, in the past seven or eight years, several more have been successively established, but the number is still no more than ten. Compared with the three hundred in the United States, there is a world of difference. And now, it is inevitably affected by the war, suffering considerable setbacks.

The purpose of life insurance is to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, to protect the livelihood of the family after death, so that there is no fear of hunger or cold. Life is full of dangers, which can happen anytime, anywhere. This is especially evident in these troubled times. If preparations are not made early, there will be regret. Therefore, life insurance should be purchased during peacetime, and even more so during wartime. People who love their families should purchase life insurance, and people who love their country should purchase life insurance from Chinese-funded companies to reclaim economic rights. Life insurance companies collect the small premiums paid by policyholders and accumulate them into huge sums, which are then used to invest in various businesses and develop national resources. The country becomes rich and the people benefit, truly relying on it. This is the motivation for editing and publishing this journal.

This journal is deeply grateful to all circles at home and abroad for their generous contributions of excellent articles. However, due to the limited space, we are unable to publish all of them in the first issue, and we sincerely apologize. The preparation time for this journal was extremely short, and it was rushed to print, so errors and omissions are inevitable. We hope that readers will point them out, which would be greatly appreciated.

### Life Insurance and National Economic Construction

— Wong Wan-yuk

I. The Significance of Life Insurance

Life insurance is the most appropriate method of preparing for the family's living expenses after death. The vast majority of our families rely on the daily income of the head of the household to maintain their livelihood. If the head of the household is well and the income remains unchanged, then the family can live comfortably without fear of hunger or cold. However, if the head of the household encounters an unforeseen event one day, the family will lose their support, and poverty after death is inevitable. This is why there is such a thing as "the family has no reserve grain, and the young daughter cries for food." However, the use of life insurance is not to ensure that the insured does not die, but to ensure that after the insured's death, the family can receive the insurance amount from the life insurance company to maintain their livelihood and prevent them from falling into destitution. Therefore, life insurance embodies the spirit of mutual assistance among human beings, uniting people with similar risks and sharing the economic losses that arise among them.

II. Life Insurance and National Economic Construction

The benefit of life insurance to families is the greatest purpose of life insurance, and this is known to all who have even a little common sense. But from the point of view of the national economy, its benefits are even greater. Here are the main points, divided into the following sections:

(1) It can encourage savings. The accumulation of capital depends on the thrift and savings of the majority of the population. There are many ways to encourage national thrift and savings, but life insurance is one of the most effective. Ordinary savings are generally based on a laissez-faire principle, while life insurance savings have a compulsory nature. Therefore, the extent to which life insurance can encourage national thrift and savings is actually greater than other methods. If the people of a country mostly enjoy life insurance, then there must be more savers, and if there are more savers, the national capital can be concentrated. From a negative point of view, it is enough to make policyholders feel at ease and have no worries, encouraging them to move forward bravely and cultivate a national spirit of enterprise; from a positive point of view, it can also increase individual credit for food and clothing and move towards a path of common prosperity.

(2) It can stabilize enterprises. In partnerships, dissolution is often forced by the death of a partner; even in corporations, the death of an important officer often has an impact. These are all drawbacks of not having insurance. If the partners have life insurance, then if a partner dies, the other surviving partners can receive the insurance money from the life insurance company, allowing the partnership to turn from danger to safety. Important company officers such as managers and engineers are of utmost importance to a company, and insurance should be taken out for them to prevent accidental losses. If such important officers are still alive after insurance is taken out, it is naturally a blessing for the company; if they unfortunately die, the company will receive a huge amount of insurance money to compensate for the loss.

In addition, if creditworthy officers often serve as intangible guarantors for the company's borrowing or bond issuance, then their survival or death is also of great importance to the company. If the company takes out insurance for them or does so when issuing bonds, then its creditworthiness will naturally be strengthened. Also, when money is particularly tight, the company lacks funds, and commercial borrowing is difficult, which has a great impact on the company. However, if the company's important officers have previously taken out life insurance, the company can use this policy to mortgage a loan from the life insurance company, so there is no need to worry about being unable to make ends meet. Company officers taking out life insurance can also make them feel at ease and dedicated to their careers, and they will not be tempted to change jobs. This is not only beneficial to the officers themselves but also to the company, because labor disputes can also be resolved accordingly. If this is the case, then the stability of the enterprise will have a significant benefit to the national economy.

(3) It can develop national wealth. The development of the life insurance business means that more and more people are taking out life insurance. As a result, insurance companies collect the small premiums paid by policyholders, and with many a little makes a mickle, they accumulate huge amounts of capital, which are used to develop national resources, invest in industry, and develop the national economy. The country becomes rich and the people benefit, truly relying on it. According to the end of 1926, the 52 life insurance companies in the United States had a total of 11,876,000,000 yuan in assets, of which 5,083,000,000 yuan was invested in mortgage loans, 4,536,000,000 yuan was invested in bonds and stocks, and 2,257,000,000 yuan was invested in other loans. It is known that the national economy of the United States is so developed, and it has benefited greatly from the investment of life insurance companies.

(4) It can subsidize finance. Life insurance companies absorb policyholder premiums, because their maturity period is always long-term in nature, such as ten, twenty, or thirty years. Therefore, they can often make long-term investments in life insurance reserves, and they can absorb large amounts of public debt issued by the central and local governments, whether in peacetime or wartime. For example, during the Russo-Japanese War and the European War, the insurance companies were the ones who recognized the most public debt issued by Japan and other countries. From this, it can be seen that the funds absorbed by life insurance companies benefit the national economy and subsidize national finances, and they can truly be compared with the banking industry.

(5) It can strengthen the nation. All those who take out life insurance must undergo a physical examination, and people's diseases often develop silently and are painful because they are not aware of them. After the examination, they will naturally pay attention to health care to protect their lives. Over time, this will become a habit, and the strength of the nation will be based on this. Labor is the most important factor of production, and national health is the foundation of labor. Therefore, if we want to develop the national economy, then strengthening the nation is essential.

III. Conclusion

The close relationship between the life insurance business and national economic construction has been popular in European and American countries for a long time, and has achieved results early. However, this system has only been around for over fifty years in China, and because public awareness is not high and promotion is weak, progress has been very slow. At this time of national crisis, economic construction is the top priority. The life insurance business is one aspect of economic construction, and it should be promoted urgently. On an individual level, because the wartime risk is greater, the need for insurance is more urgent. On the government level, judging from the current economic situation, due to the huge war costs, if we want to talk about construction, in addition to borrowing foreign debt, we must also rely on national thrift and savings, and insurance is the most effective way to save. Regarding national economic construction and thrift methods, the National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang have detailed regulations, which will not be repeated here. This article only briefly elaborates on the life insurance aspect.

### Prevention Methods for Common Summer Diseases

— Cheung Shiu-tung

There are many common summer diseases, and most of them enter through the mouth. In summer, the weather is very hot, and most people like to eat raw and cold foods and water that has not been boiled, which leads to various diseases. In Hong Kong, countless people die every year from infections of this kind of disease. Here are some common summer diseases, their causes, prevention methods, and treatment methods, so that readers know what to be careful about.

I. Typhoid Fever

Cause: This disease is caused by a bacterium. It is transmitted through the ingestion of water mixed with the feces and urine of patients with this disease, or through the use of river water used to wash their feces and urine, or through wearing clothes of patients that have not been disinfected, or through transmission by flies.

Symptoms: Initially, general fatigue, loss of appetite, aversion to employment, headache, insomnia. Initially, chills, followed by fever. In the first week, the body temperature gradually increases in a stepwise manner, rising to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. In the second week, the temperature reaches its peak, often remaining around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. In the third week, it shows a slight degree of variation and gradually decreases. By the fourth week, the variations are obvious, and the fever subsides.

The pulse is slower in relation to the temperature.

The tongue is coated with a thick, grayish-white fur and is dry.

Constipation is common at the onset of the disease.

The complications of this disease are intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, which often occur in the third week.

Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly, avoid eating solid foods, and give milk soup, etc., while the doctor prescribes treatment according to the symptoms.

Prevention: Prevention shots can be given, once a week for a total of three shots, which can prevent the disease for approximately up to September.

II. Cholera

Cause: Caused by a bacterium that invades the digestive organs. The causes of transmission are unclean food and clothing.

Symptoms: Initially, abdominal tightness and a feeling of bowel movement, followed by the discharge of thin, liquid stools, thirst, gastrocnemius muscle tenderness, and cold extremities.

This disease often leads to death in one or two days, but it can also enter a recovery period. Vomiting and diarrhea gradually decrease.

Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly, use only liquid foods, and the treatment often involves injecting saline solution into the blood vessels.

Prevention: Cholera vaccination can be given.

III. Dysentery

Cause: Caused by dysentery bacteria. In tropical areas, it is caused by a type of amoeba, called amoebic dysentery. Eating unripe fruits and any unhygienic diet can easily cause this disease.

Symptoms: Frequent bowel movements, tenesmus, combined with abdominal pain and rumbling. Each bowel movement is small in quantity and contains mucus and blood.

The complications of this disease are liver abscesses, and the important sequelae are intestinal stenosis.

Treatment: Lie flat and rest quietly. If it is bacillary dysentery, injecting horse serum can be expected to lead to early recovery. If it is amoebic dysentery, injecting emetine twice can cure it.

The above are the most common and easily transmitted diseases in summer. As for other vomiting and diarrhea diseases, there are many. The most important thing is to be very careful about food in summer. Do not eat food that has not been cooked, do not drink water that has not been boiled, and all foods must be moderate to avoid transmission by flies.

### Yesterday's Basketball Battle: Group A Star Island Defeats Eastern, Group B Spring Grass Wins Over Pui Ying

(Our Newspaper Special) Last night, the YMCA gymnasium was packed with men and women, creating quite a lively scene. The general purpose of the crowd was to watch the highly anticipated Group A basketball game between Star Island and Eastern, as this match had significant implications for the championship's future, making it particularly noteworthy.

In the first game, Group B Spring Grass faced Taikoo, putting on a show with plenty of highlights and a decent atmosphere. Ultimately, Spring Grass had better coordination and consistently held the advantage, securing a 48-31 victory.

Next, the Group A match between Star Island and Eastern was the most anticipated event for the audience. With the stakes of winning and losing being high, both sides played with all their might, making the game intense and captivating.

The Star Island players were all "products" of the gymnasium, with polished moves and excellent coordination. Their attacks under the basket were particularly fierce, allowing them to maintain the lead throughout the game, ultimately defeating Eastern.

Star Island's success stemmed from their effective coordination and accurate shooting. Each player's assigned position was both quick and responsive, allowing them to consistently score under the basket.

While Eastern's individual skills were certainly good, their teamwork was lacking. They handled the ball well in the mid-court, but became helpless under the basket. Even Xu Heng, traditionally known for his skill in scoring under the basket, was unable to showcase his talent due to a lack of support when penetrating the defense. In short, Eastern secured very few opportunities to score under the basket.

Furthermore, when players ran into position, they focused too much on marking opponents, neglecting opportunities for a clear shot. Although they often had chances to penetrate the defense, they lacked the agility to capitalize, missing out on opportunities to turn and shoot. This technique was completely absent throughout the game. While this could be attributed to Star Island's tight defense, Eastern's weakness in finding opportunities was evident to everyone in the audience.

Among the Eastern team, Feng Nianhua scored the most points, proving to be a true powerhouse. He was also cunning, cleverly drawing fouls. His actions easily deceived the audience. Upon gaining possession, he would charge forward at the first sign of an opening. Seeing him rush towards them, opposing defenders would invariably step out to intercept him, only to fall into his trap and commit a foul. As seen in the score sheet, Feng's many points were a result of this tactic.

However, victory in basketball doesn't rely solely on individual skill, but on teamwork. While Feng's individual skills were excellent, Eastern's teamwork couldn't compare to Star Island's refined coordination, leading to their defeat. The final score was 40 to 47.

In the final game, Group B Pui Ying faced South China. Pui Ying showed rapid improvement, creating numerous opportunities. Huang Yaohua, Guan Zhenbin, and Chen Xiyang were particularly active, leading Pui Ying to overpower South China with a score of 32-22. The score sheet for the Group A game is listed below:

Eastern Team: Shot / Penalty / Foul / Points

Feng Nianhua: 5 / 8 / 2 / 18

Luo Ji'an: 1 / 0 / 1 / 2

Xu Heng: 4 / 0 / 3 / 8

Huang Dingfen: 2 / 1 / 4 / 5

### Today's Lawn Tennis: Doubles Semi-Finals - He Jialiu and Li Rurong vs. Lin Zhen Brothers

(Our Newspaper Special) The Open Lawn Tennis Tournament will feature a doubles semi-final match at the Hong Kong Cricket Club grounds today at 4:30 PM, pitting He Jialiu and Li Rurong against the Lin Zhen brothers. He is a veteran of the tennis world, with extensive experience. He has been practicing diligently recently, and his skills have gradually returned to their former glory. His strength is also quite abundant. Therefore, he has been making good contributions to the competition. Since teaming up with Li for doubles, they have been victorious in every match, earning the right to the semi-finals. This is no lucky coincidence. Today, they will face the Lin Zhen brothers. If they win, they will secure a spot in the finals, where they will compete against the Xu brothers for the championship. A loss will mean the end of their journey, with all their previous efforts wasted. Faced with this critical juncture, He and Li are determined to fight hard. However, whether they can win remains uncertain, as the Lin Zhen brothers are leaders in doubles, with exceptional skills. Currently, aside from the Xu brothers, no one can defeat them. Although He and Li are determined to win and are encouraging each other in the face of a formidable opponent, hoping that their efforts will yield good results, the Lin Zhen brothers are technically superior and have better teamwork. Therefore, the reporter believes that it will not be easy for He and Li to win. However, we sincerely hope that they can achieve their goals and complete the great feat of Chinese players sweeping both the championship and runner-up positions in doubles. But such an idealistic outcome may not be realized. Facing such a strong team today is likely to bring more bad luck than good. If they can overcome this difficult hurdle, it will be truly commendable. (Dong Lang)

### Macao Football Team to Visit Hong Kong This Weekend to Battle Eastern, Jiang Shanqing Still Plays for Eastern

The Macao Interport Football Team, having recently lost to the Hong Kong team, remains ambitious and plans to visit Hong Kong this weekend to play against Eastern. The match is scheduled to start at 4:30 PM this Sunday. It is sure to be a fierce and exciting contest. The events leading up to this match started when veteran footballer Jiang Shanqing came to Hong Kong last weekend to play for Eastern. He discussed the possibility of Eastern being invited to Macao for a match with Shi Zuixi, a key member of Eastern. Before the Eastern away team departed, the Macao Football Association sent a letter of invitation. This matter was already under discussion. At the time Jiang came to Hong Kong, Eastern suggested that the Macao team could come to Hong Kong first. After Jiang returned to Macao, he reported Eastern's suggestion to the Macao Football Association. Eastern received a letter from the Macao Football Association yesterday morning, stating their decision to send a team to Hong Kong for a match, and listing the team's lineup as follows:

Jia Hualue, Luo Bado, He Zuosheng, Ke Tuohua, Yaluoshu, Sousa, Xiao Luobi, Ya Maiming, Huali Lu, Gao Lasu (Captain), Li Ji

Reserves: Liu Diqing, Ba Da Laige

This team is full of strength, and the forward Gao Lasu is particularly skilled. He played as a center-back in the interport match, but this time he will play as a right-winger, posing a threat to Eastern. Although Eastern is currently missing Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Miao Huaguo, who have returned to Shanghai, and Hou Chengtuo, who has gone to the Philippines and has not yet returned, there is still no shortage of talent, and the team remains strong. The lineup for the upcoming match has not yet been officially decided, but Jiang Shanqing is determined to play for Eastern, and many players have volunteered. The official lineup will be announced in the next few days. According to the Macao Football Association, the team is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the morning of Sunday via the X'ian liner, arriving around noon (11:15 AM). Eastern has decided to send someone to welcome them, showing the hospitality of the hosts.

### 克银汉 Overwhelms Three Famous Athletes

[New York Dispatch] A performance race, regarded by New York sports experts as the world's greatest long-distance run, was held at Madison Square Garden on April 4th, featuring the Indoor Two-Mile Championship.

The event included not only the world-famous 克银汉, but also 拉施, the holder of the world indoor two-mile record, ライス, the American 5,000-meter champion, and 狄　特, the champion of the American indoor 3,000-meter steeplechase.

Under the roaring cheers of 16,000 spectators, 狄氏 initially led the pack, but was soon overtaken by 拉施. 克氏, with his smart and graceful stride, followed quietly in third or fourth place.

With two laps to go, 克氏 gradually began to catch up, passing 拉施.　拉氏 immediately surged ahead, but 克氏 did not give an inch. The two ran as if it were a 400-meter race.

克银汉 crossed the finish line only about a yard ahead of 拉施, with a time of nine minutes and eleven and eight-tenths (the world indoor record is eight minutes and fifty-eight and whatever).

### Ling Ying Track Meet, Wang Xiushan Champion

The first annual sports meet of Ling Ying Middle School, located in Causeway Bay's Lee Garden, was held yesterday at the South China Athletic Association stadium on Caroline Hill.

Following the ceremony, the school's silver band led the athletes and over 700 students in a lap around the field, after which the competitions began. During the midday break, elementary and kindergarten students performed songs and dances for entertainment. At 1:30 PM, the competitions resumed until 4:00 PM, culminating in a 100-meter race for female teachers and organizing staff, at which point the meet concluded. Wang Xiushan was awarded the title of overall champion.

### Chinese Association Seeks to Revive Football, Postal and Telegraph Team Plans to Join Group C

(Our Newspaper Special) According to sources, those in charge of the Chinese Sports Association are currently seeking to restore sending football teams to participate in the upcoming league.

### Friendly Football Match, South China Triumphs, Defeats Foreign Sailors 3-1

Yesterday at 加山, a friendly football match took place between South China and foreign sailors. Although the audience was small, the game was worth watching. After the initial kickoff, the foreign sailors launched a fierce attack, starting aggressively. However, South China's line worked together effectively, resisting the attack while taking advantage of openings to launch their own offensives. The foreign sailors were repeatedly taken advantage of and lost 3-1.

The foreign sailors' teamwork was uncoordinated, repeatedly leading to wasted efforts. The forward, 列比, proved to be skilled, and the 特架 defense was effective. 烈厘 was also courageous, but the rest of the players had little to offer.

South China's Yang Shuiyi and Ye Beihua were more active. Li Guowei and Tan Zhen　 were also likable. Lu Dakeng's progression and passing seemed slow. The newcomer Zhang Jinhai was quite suitable.

The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, South China scored two more goals, ending the game with a score of 3-1. The scorers were Yang Shuiyi and Zhang Jinhai, with one goal being an own goal by 衣利士.

### A Dedication for Youth Day

— Huang Sheng

Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth.

In this vast land of 34.9 million square miles, when it was as silent as a dead sea, and millions groaned under oppression and cruelty, youth, with a spirit of no looking back, stirred up a surging wave, flying like petrels. They pointed out the bright path to the masses; when they ignited the flames of revolution, experiencing a fierce battle, youth, with the greatest strength, raised a banner of combat, acting as a bugler, sounding the charge for the slaves of the semi-colony.

Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth. In every great political movement, cultural movement, and ideological movement in modern Chinese history, youth has dedicated their strength, fulfilling the arduous tasks of initiation, leadership, and support. The history of each movement is infused with the cries of youth, the spirit of youth, and the blood of youth. The places where youth can gather are abundant.

The May Fourth Movement initiated a new birth of Chinese culture, and the youth's blow to the traitors was like the first ray of sunlight piercing through the darkness at sunrise. The May Thirtieth Movement unveiled the prelude to the Great Chinese Revolution, and the youth, with large-scale demonstrations and fresh blood, enriched and punctuated the glorious history of this movement. The Great Revolution of 1926-27 rolled the most intense flames across the Chinese wilderness. Youth became the strong backbone of the army and the vanguard of the mass movement, initiating the practical and genuine revolution. In the December Ninth Movement of 1935, youth, in coordination with the burgeoning national unity, raised high the spirit of the student movement, enduring water cannons, leather whips, and iron rulers, to awaken the masses and pave the way to a united front. After August 13th, what significant tasks have the youth undertaken, and how many astonishing achievements have they created? The facts are all there, and there is no need to waste ink on narration. This driving force for China's rebirth will, with the most mighty torrents and the most magnificent waves, wash away all the filth and obstruction, and establish even greater achievements than before.

Today is Youth Day. The young generation of China must cherish their history, piously accept the instructions of the highest authorities and the highest leaders, and the expectations of the national masses and international friends, to carry out work more broadly and practically, and to accomplish the tasks of battle.

Our young generation must not have the slightest complacency. We must admit that our achievements are not yet perfect, and that the work we need to do is infinitely more. Now is just the beginning. The thorns ahead need us to cut them down, and countless difficulties will give us merciless trials. Youth's struggle has a most arduous journey.

We must constantly reflect on whether our work has a definite plan and steps, pursuing the highest efficiency; whether we have become "事務主義者" (事務主義者 - roughly, "事務主義者" refers to someone who is overly focused on administrative details and routine tasks, neglecting broader goals and principles), rushing around all day but accomplishing nothing, completely neglecting learning, and not even reading the day's newspaper; whether we have become the new "华威先生" (华威先生 - a character who is known for attending meetings, drafting regulations, and having tea, but not for taking concrete action), spending all day in meetings, just drafting regulations and drinking tea.

We must constantly reflect on whether we have eliminated the petit-bourgeoisie's impetuousness, jealousy, and desire for leadership; whether we have been influenced by "张振华型" (Zhang Zhenhua type - refers to someone who is always boasting about their past achievements and flaunting their talents) characters, who open their mouths and talk about how they were in the past, dazzling with their talents; whether we have turned into "吴大雄型" (Wu Daxiong type - refers to someone who seeks a certain position, grabs the leadership of the group, and becomes resentful when they fail) fellows, seeking some position, seizing the leadership of the group, and then becoming resentful when they fail.

Furthermore, what must be constantly reflected upon is whether we have committed left-wing childishness, whether we have drunk the poison of heroism, whether we have indulged in some romance, forgetting the mission of our work, forgetting the hardships of the era... These, these, are all things that our youth should take to encourage others and to encourage ourselves.

Youth is the driving force for China's rebirth. Youth must become a tenacious fighter!

### Kong Yunting and Rousseau

— Qiong Fu

——Gleanings from Reading

Kong Yunting, in his preface to "The Peach Blossom Fan," describes the circulation of his play in this way:

When "The Peach Blossom Fan" was completed, all the princes, nobles, and gentry borrowed it for copying, causing a temporary scarcity of paper. On the evening of Yi Mao, an eunuch urgently needed "The Peach Blossom Fan," so I gave him a clean copy. Forgetting where it was transmitted, it was found by Minister Zhang Pingzhou, who offered a copy at midnight to the imperial residence, and it entered the imperial library.

In the fourth month of Si Chen, I had already resigned. Mr. Mu An invited me to watch "The Peach Blossom Fan." All the officials of the Hanlin Academy and the provinces gathered, allowing me to sit in the upper seat alone, ordering the actors to repeatedly offer me wine. They invited me to comment, and the guests pointed and looked, quite with an air of soaring to the clouds.

One can see that the author takes pride in this, but this is something one cannot think deeply about. "The Peach Blossom Fan" is "mainly to express the pain of the fall of the Ming Dynasty," but the author is pleased to have received the favor of the Qing emperor and the support of the Qing princes and nobles. It is really incomprehensible. Does it really confirm the claim of some of our "scholars" that the work and the author's personality are not at all related?

But so be it, let those "scholars" be happy. However, this reminds me of a French ancient whom we "scholars" have often scolded.

Rousseau, in the eighth volume of his "Confessions," describes the scene when his opera "Le devin viliage" was performed. It is somewhat similar to Kong Yunting's pride. He said that he, as the author, also sat in a box, and opposite him sat the emperor and empress, and all the figures of the court. He did not shave his beard, nor did he change his clothes. He sat there, quietly listening to the praises and comments of the noble ladies around him. He also described the scene after the performance, which was even more enviable than Kong Yunting's pride. He said that the next day, the emperor wanted to summon him and give him an annuity.

Everyone knows that Rousseau was a sworn enemy of the emperor and the nobles. Even the play that was considered successful at the time, although now recognized as an unremarkable work, still expressed the emotions of the common people and expounded his views. But he described the emperor and nobles treating him well in such a way that it seemed he was proud of it. This is clearly like Kong Yunting, slapping himself in the face.

In this way, it seems that our "scholars" should not have scolded Rousseau. Didn't Rousseau also help to prove the claims of those people?

But don't rush to conclusions. Although Rousseau described sitting with the emperor and nobles, he was proud of the fact that he was unadorned, sitting with the emperor and nobles in the clothes of a commoner. Then he greatly elaborated on the reasons for not shaving his beard and not changing his clothes, meaning: I watch my play, to hell with them. Although he also described the emperor wanting to see him, he immediately said that he did not want to see the emperor, and he even used sarcastic language to say some reasons why he did not want to see the emperor. Rousseau was, after all, a bit of a "spoilsport," and in the end, he did not achieve the same pride as our Kong Yunting, so he only ended up with no satisfaction.

In the end, what China has, foreign countries may not necessarily have. Rousseau is just one who doesn't join in the fun. I now understand why our "scholars" want to scold him.

But don't rush. If you have read the great work by one of our "scholars" introducing "Confessions" in the past, when you read the two passages mentioned above, you cannot help but be shocked. Rousseau sitting with the emperor and nobles was introduced; but Rousseau's elaboration of his contempt for the attire of the upper class was completely "banished," without a trace. The emperor wanting to see Rousseau was also introduced; but Rousseau's satirical text saying that he did not want to see the emperor was translated into two sentences with a changed face. Originally, our "scholar" insisted on making Rousseau exactly the same as the literary writers in our history. This work can be considered successful, but it seems that those "scholars" who scolded Rousseau did not see this great work. What a pity, what a pity.

### The Significance of Celebrating Youth Day

— Li Zhengyao, Xie Yude

As everyone knows, in the history of the national liberation movement, "May Fourth" is the most glorious and heroic page. It was the prelude to the Great Chinese Revolution of 1925-27, and the beginning of Chinese students participating in political activities and taking on the two major tasks of opposing × and opposing nation-building. This great movement is now twenty years old. In these twenty years, Chinese students have created many miracles in the struggle for the liberation of the people in an isolated environment, using their blood and flesh. In the future, they will complete their great historical mission of resisting the war and building the country with a more heroic posture.

As the War of Resistance enters its second phase, and with final victory approaching, it is of great significance for us to commemorate May Fourth. What excites us even more is that the central government has announced May Fourth as China's Youth Day. Undoubtedly, this shows that the Chinese student movement has gained the sympathy and assistance of the government of the motherland through its continuous efforts and struggles. In the future, the Chinese student movement will have a more glorious and promising future.

We, the students in Hong Kong, will overcome our past shortcomings and strengthen our future work to celebrate the great Youth Day! To safeguard the achievements of the heroic struggles of our advanced students over the past twenty years!

Before we point out the general direction of our future efforts, let us conduct a brief review of the Hong Kong student movement in the past:

Hong Kong students, like students in the mainland, have their own fine traditions. They are not afraid of hardships, nor are they afraid of boredom. In the desert-like Hong Kong, they have scattered the seeds of resisting × and saving the nation. They have worked hard and perseveringly to win the sympathy of society. They are also able to grasp the urgent requirements of the objective situation and carry out various tasks to provide material and human assistance to the motherland. Undeniably, there are also many shortcomings in the past Hong Kong student movement:

(1) Lack of a strong grassroots foundation (school organization). This is mainly due to the weakness of the Hong Kong student movement in the past. Because of this shortcoming, student movement work has not been able to penetrate into the vast student population within the school. In the future, we must intensify the development of school organizations and mobilize a wide range of students to participate in the work in order to support and expand the student movement in Hong Kong.

(2) The working methods are too advanced. Different objects, different environments, should use different working methods. However, the working students in Hong Kong have not paid attention to this point. When they carry out their work, they always follow the working methods of the mainland, such as propaganda, organization, current affairs seminars, etc. In the eyes of the average student, they are all a boring series, and as a result, only a small part of the more advanced students are united, while other vast students are still far away from the camp of saving the nation.

(3) The work is not closely related to the students' lives. Many students feel that schoolwork is too heavy, many students feel that life is boring, and many students feel that many personal problems, such as studying, love, and economic problems, have no way to solve. However, when working, our students in Hong Kong did not grasp these urgent requirements, but instead put forward empty slogans such as what kind of responsibilities young people should have in the great era. Of course, the results will not attract the attention of students full of depression.

(4) The work did not win the sympathy and leadership of teachers. Although Hong Kong students have often put forward the slogan of "teachers and students working together to overcome national difficulties," in fact, when carrying out the work, they rarely humbly asked teachers for instructions and assistance. Teachers have more experience than us, and their vision is broader than ours. Our work needs the instructions and supervision of advanced teachers. If all our work is also carried out through the relationship of teachers, undoubtedly, many difficulties will be reduced in the work.

### First Mission

— Ren Linrui

Early autumn, the weather is still very hot, the cotton nurtured and grown by the earth, the white flowers, have long been picked by the local farmers, as a reward for their hard work throughout the year, leaving only withered branches. Also, the graves scattered everywhere in this desolate field.

There are no mountains, but there are earth mounds, protruding in the fields, as if managing everything for the large field.

The small river is not wide, but there are several of them. It can lead you to the famous Tang Family Ancestral Hall, it can lead you to the bank, into the vast, dark, deep green bamboo forest. Now during the day, you can often see the garrisoned soldiers here. They will wave to you, driving a pointed little boat and rowing with a single oar very easily.

The Second Public Military Hospital is located in a public elementary school in the countryside. Inside, there is also a rescue team sent from the Shanghai Red Cross Society. The hospital is extremely quiet, and the quilts covered by the wounded soldiers are mostly sent by the common people themselves.

We often go to this hospital, because the Boy Scouts also have to do rescue work. When carrying the wounded soldiers, the road is very difficult to walk, all of it is on narrow paths between the fields, but we are not used to walking there, so we always walk along the bank of the small river. The small river is beautiful, and the small river is our compass.

There are only twenty or so rural houses near the public hospital in the fields, all of them old and dilapidated. This is the only housing here. Some of our comrades are going there.

It is already quite cool in the evening. The moon shines on the wilderness. Looking over, there is not a single light. Only the silver-grey of the moon shrouds the field.

I and Lao Gu - he is older than me, and taller than me; we went to stand guard together. He carried a rifle and a bamboo strip of bullets on his back.

Although I feel a little chilly, this kind of environment is what we are willing to accept. We patrol the fields.

There are two strong men in front. After answering our - the password of the day, they immediately rushed over and told us that someone seemed to be sending signals behind the grave mounds in front. A green flame first, quickly released into the sky.

I took the gun from Lao Gu's hand. Quickly, the four of us dispersed to surround this dangerous grave mound. I felt a little hesitant, a little scared, but catching people, ah, I stepped on the green grass and quickly circled around.

"No one," we ran two circles. When we encountered each other, we all made the same strange sound.

After sending the strong men away, we hid nearby with vigilance, pointing the muzzle at the newly-built grave.

The cool night is silent. There is only our breathing here.

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Are you satisfied this time?"

She puffed out her cheeks, looked at him, and remained silent.

"Do you still want me to buy you a newspaper?"

"I won't let you buy it anymore!"

He finally achieved his goal.

From then on, she dragged on that childishness and stopped talking to him; just like the kind of reserve that everyone often has in their childhood. He came to see her several times, looking for an opportunity to talk; but she ignored him, and deliberately pretended to have an expression and action that violated her inner feelings. To show the other party her dissatisfaction and revenge. The other party was not a child, he understood those things: so not only was he not angry, but he was also happy - his perverted expression proved her psychological normality - indicating that she had forgotten herself outside of the temporary changing situation.

It was at this time that a common thing happened. Two drunken Japanese soldiers, staggering with crooked limbs, walked into this building with inaccurate steps due to the loss of balance in their feet. On the corridor upstairs, the two of them walked arm in arm, as if after a meal, they had walked onto an uninhabited wilderness and picked a quiet path. Digesting food, and humming an unclear lewd tune in their mouths. Sometimes, they casually kicked open the door, roared at the owner of the door, and then laughed and closed the door. Therefore, all the doors were closed by the owners of each house, enduring with infinite tolerance.

However, that kind of harassment, in the ears of the local, was still for the first time. She felt both novel and distrustful. At this time, she no longer maintained that elegance towards her only acquaintance, and finally spoke to him.

"Open the door and let me see!"

"I can't!"

"It's not like I'm asking you to buy me a newspaper again, bothering you again!"

She seemed to want to restore the elegance that had just dissipated, and threatened him. (Five Six)
