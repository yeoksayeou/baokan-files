### The Life of Yi People in Western Yunnan, the Rear of the War of Resistance and an International Thoroughfare

— Min Kang (Sent from Mangshi)

(Special Article) With the persistence and deepening of the War of Resistance, Yunnan, which has traditionally received little attention, has transformed into a central base for the political, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as for international transportation in the rear. The vast Yi ethnic region in western Yunnan's border area is precisely the essential route for our southwest's international transportation line, and its importance in the War of Resistance is self-evident. This time, the reporter was fortunate to have the rare opportunity to visit the border area of western Yunnan; however, given the limited time, I could not conduct long-term and in-depth observations, and could only seek a superficial understanding. Nevertheless, considering the importance of the border area in the War of Resistance, I am eager to introduce the general living conditions and social circumstances of the Yi ethnic compatriots on the Yunnan border, hoping to provide a modest reference for friends who are concerned about border area issues and those who pay attention to ethnic minority questions.

Types of Yi People

The Yi people scattered throughout the western Yunnan border area consist of approximately eight types: Spiny Yi (sometimes written as Zhuan Yi), Mountain Head Yi (commonly known as Savages), Achang Yi, Suluo Yi, Bengshi Yi, Kawa Yi, Kala Yi, and Han Chinese who have migrated from the interior. Among these, the Spiny Yi have the largest population and are the closest to being assimilated into Han culture. They are naturally timid and deeply submissive. Second are the Mountain Head Yi, who come in two types: one that lives permanently in the mountains and rarely comes down, with a relatively strong nature; and the type that frequently comes down the mountain to attend markets, which are somewhat better. In the past, they were accustomed to robbing and killing in the markets, but after the Tusi's (local chieftain) soldiers implemented suppression in the markets, they no longer dare to do so. The Suluo Yi, like the Mountain Head Yi, enjoy drinking very much. The men are fierce and injure people when drunk, a temperament similar to that of the Savages. The Achang Yi are originally of Burmese blood and have recently gradually assimilated into Han culture. The Bengdong Yi originally lived in the mountains, but due to the bullying and oppression of the Mountain Head Yi, most have now moved to the plains. There are two types of Kawa: raw Kawa and cooked Kawa. The cooked type is still acceptable, but the raw type simply still has a taste for cannibalism. However, they do not eat their own kind but prefer to eat people from other ethnic groups, especially foreigners and Han Chinese. However, this group is small in number and lives in caves in the mountains. The Kala Yi are very few in number, and they have mostly assimilated into Han culture, with living habits similar to those of Han Chinese. As for the Han Chinese who have migrated there, their numbers are quite large, second only to the Yi. The majority still retain the characteristics of Han Chinese, but a minority have become Yi-ized due to their long generations there.

Seasonal Climate

The border area is mostly mountainous, with most areas experiencing a tropical climate, cool in the mornings and evenings, and hot and humid at midday. It is said that the miasma there is extremely severe and terrifying, but in reality, it is not so. Before we arrived in Mangshi and Zhejie, there was much discussion and apprehension in the car. Some said they were afraid, some said they were not, and some said that even if one need not be afraid, one should not disbelieve. As a result, phrases like "Don't eat at the guest house" and "Wake up early when you sleep" became our motto. Illusory Xia miasma and Edge Xia miasma are said to appear on mountain tops in the morning, while Black Water miasma and Frog miasma arise from the ground. Coupled with legends like that of the Mute Spring, it was simply terrifying. However, upon arriving at our destination, our friends there told us that we must eat our fill at every meal and wake up early in the morning, because sleeping in too much would only cause headaches. The midday heat and humidity were indeed somewhat oppressive, and I always felt dizzy and uncomfortable sitting in the armchair, so I joked to that friend, "If those miasma theorists were to sit in this chair, they would have discovered a new type of 'armchair miasma'!" The seasonal climate there is such that spring and winter are relatively clear, refreshing, and warm; and there is very little miasma. I heard people say that in the summer and autumn seasons, due to the heavy rainfall, coupled with unsanitary conditions in the streets and everywhere else, the rainwater would accumulate and then be exposed to the sun, causing these foul vapors to evaporate. Even without miasma, it would naturally turn into miasma. Many Han Chinese move back to the interior during these two seasons and return there after the seasons have passed. Blaming it on mysterious and strange miasma instead of working hard on sanitation is one of the many ways in which Chinese people are lazy.

Ten Tusi

In the western Yunnan border area, there are ten Tusi regions, each with its own Tusi acting as a local emperor, living in peace with each other. These ten Tusi are: Dao Chengxuan of Qianya Tusi, whose family has been inheriting this good position since the early Ming Dynasty, with over 5,000 households in the area, totaling about 20,000 people, mostly Yi people; Nanjian Tusi, also inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 8,000 households in the area, totaling over 30,000 people, mostly Han Chinese; Lai Fengyuan of Husa Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty to the present, with 500 households in the area, totaling about 1,500 people, mostly Achang Yi; Si Hongbi of Zhanjie Tusi, also inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 3,000 households in the area, totaling about 12,000 people, mostly Zhuan Yi; Fang Kesheng of Mangshi Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with over 5,700 households in the area, totaling about 28,000 people, mostly Spiny Yi; Duo Yingpei of Zhaofang Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty to the present, with over 1,000 households in the area, totaling about 2,700 people, mostly Mountain Head Yi and Zhuan Yi; Jiang of Mengban Tusi, inherited from the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, with over 150 households in the area, totaling about 620 people, mostly Han Chinese; Duo Yong'an of Suichuan Tusi, inherited the Tusi position from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with over 1,900 households in the area, totaling about 7,300 people, mostly Zhuan Yi; Dao Baotu of Mengmao Tusi, inherited from the early Ming Dynasty, with 1,400 households in the area, totaling about 2,700 people, mostly Spiny Yi; Gai Bingquan of Husa Tusi, inherited from the Zhengtong era of the Ming Dynasty, with 550 households in the area, totaling about 1,650 people, mostly Achang Yi. These Tusi were mostly officers who followed the generals on expeditions to pacify the Yi people during the Ming Dynasty, such as the Yizhuangsi, so they have a history of hereditary rule of four to five hundred years. Most of them are Han Chinese, but today they have also become Yi-ized to varying degrees. Most of the Tusi can speak Chinese, but their literacy is often limited. Only Dao Baotu is proficient in writing. Among the others, Fang Yuzhi, the agent of the minor Tusi (Mangshi), speaks relatively fluently and is relatively more adept.

Social System

The social system of the Yi ethnic region is, on one hand, a primitive agricultural society and hunting society, and on the other hand, it is a feudal system where the Tusi occupies all the land and implements severe exploitation. Speaking of the Tusi, he is the highest authority in the region, possessing the power of life and death. Even today, when Yi people see the Tusi, they must kneel. The Yi people themselves do not own land; they only cultivate for the Tusi. Each year, in addition to handing over 30 to 60 percent of the harvest to the Tusi, there are many expenses that must be offered to the Tusi as tribute. These expenses mainly include: the Tusi family's birth expenses, marriage expenses, the Little Tusi's enthronement ceremony expenses, birthday celebration expenses, funeral expenses, expenses for festivals such as Mid-Autumn Festival and Dragon Boat Festival, New Year's gift expenses, ploughing expenses, Frost's Descent festival expenses, the Tusi family's firewood expenses, border demarcation conference expenses, market expenses, Bao Gang expenses, and so on. These expenses are mostly distributed by the so-called Tou (now renamed Township Chief), on behalf of the Tusi, to each village (i.e., each township). In Yi society, women work more than men, but it is a patriarchal society. However, the Tusi's power only extends to the Spiny Yi and the Han Chinese residing in the Yi ethnic region. He cannot control or exploit the Savages and Suluo in the mountains. The Savages or Suluo have their own village chiefs or mountain officials in the mountains, but these mountain officials do not have the same power of life and death as the Tusi. Only during wartime (against other ethnic groups or other villages) do the mountain officials have the power to command all the villagers. In addition, in Yi society, monks and clergy have a high status, and the Yi people respect them. If the Tusi's behavior is inappropriate, the Yi people dare not and have no right to speak up; only the monks can say a few words, but naturally, there are limits.

Yi People's Occupations

Here, the officials in the Tusi's yamen, the township chiefs, village chiefs, and neighborhood chiefs, the teachers in schools, and the monks in temples are already close to the ruling class, and they are few in number. Ordinary Yi people do not have the opportunity to assume these positions. The general occupation of the Yi people is mainly farming, cultivating for the Tusi, which accounts for the vast majority. The second is doing small business, which is for a group with some small assets. They rely on a small amount of capital to make a living through trading. The Han Chinese in the border area mostly belong to this category. In addition to holding a market fair every five days, the Yi ethnic region has no market activity or shops on weekdays. However, there is always a little market activity on Han Chinese Street in Mangshi and the streets where Han Chinese are concentrated in various regions, such as a few food shops and general stores. However, the Yi people are not yet accustomed to it, so these small shops are relatively busy only on market days, and their business is very slow on weekdays. Other occupations include small handicrafts and casual labor, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and those who hull rice for others. The textile industry is not yet developed in the Yi ethnic region. Only a small number of families can be seen with Yi children weaving, and the tools and artistry are very primitive, so production is almost nonexistent. Therefore, the clothing problem of the Yi people is still very serious, relying almost entirely on outside sources.

Products

The border area has a hot climate and plenty of rainfall, making it very suitable for crops. However, due to poor planting methods and a lack of understanding of the use of fertilizers, and only practicing two crops per year, the land has not been fully utilized. In more progressive areas, they have already achieved one crop of rice and one crop of miscellaneous grains per year, alternating them. The main products there include rice, wheat, opium, vegetables, fruits, beans, coffee, and a small amount of kapok. Except for the excellent quality of the rice (some resemble the Changshu rice of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but some say that it is not easily digestible, so it is not good), opium is the most prosperous product, because many mountainous areas are suitable for growing it, but this prosperity is naturally not a good thing. In addition, there are few varieties of vegetables. The main reason is that they only have the old methods passed down, and they do not have other vegetable seeds to experiment with. The taste of the fruits is not good and is completely different from what we have tasted in other tropical regions. I first tried sugar cane, and it was not sweet at all. Later, I bought some bananas to try. After eating two, I only felt sour and astringent and had no appetite. This made me afraid to try the papaya. Other products such as coffee are also produced in small quantities. As for timber and bamboo, there are few in the plains, but they are everywhere in the mountains. As for the minerals underground, because they are still well hidden underground, there is no way to talk about them, but according to general observations, they are said to be very abundant.

Religious Beliefs

Among the Yi people, the Spiny Yi are the most devout Buddhists, while the other Yi generally worship polytheism and animism. That is to say, they worship everything they see, believing that there is a god in every object. In areas where the Spiny Yi are concentrated, there are many temples dedicated to Gautama Buddha. In the Mangshi area alone, there are said to be over fifty temples. At a temple called Bodhi Temple, I learned from a head monk who could speak some Chinese that their busiest festivals are the New Year's festival in January, the Jinwo festival in June, and the Chuwo festival in September, and these three festivals are the most prosperous. The offerings that the Yi people make to the gods are incense, candles, and fresh flowers, and they do not burn paper objects. The monks' food and clothing are provided by the people; they eat and use whatever is sent to them and do not rely on temple property. It is said that the temple has no property. I asked him how many meals he ate a day, and he said he only ate one meal. I did not quite believe it, because he was too fat. Compared to a thin little monk next to him, this was questionable. However, during the conversation, I saw an Yi woman carrying some things straight into the inner room. I was surprised at first, but then I remembered what Lu Xun said: "If monks don't have wives, where do the little monks come from?" and was relieved. In another family, I walked in, and they were having dinner. The head monk and another person were eating four dishes each: stir-fried ham with cabbage, stewed ham, bean sprouts, and pickled vegetables (a dish that Yi women must know how to make, because before she gets married, her fiancé will ask her if she knows how to make this dish). It is openly known that monks eat meat here. The Mountain Head Yi greatly respect Zhuge Kongming, because legend has it that the Southern Expedition of Seven Captures of Meng Huo was directed at them. In Zhaofang, one day I wanted to go up the mountain to see the life of the Savages, but I had to have armed escorts for protection. I suddenly thought that if I had known when I came, I could have brought a Bagua robe and a feather fan for acting, and I could have swaggered up the mountain alone and acted with impunity.

Culture and Education

It is a wrong to say that the Yi people have no culture; it is a fact that they use little writing or have writing but do not use it. Yi writing is more widely used. The writing of the Mountain Head Yi was created for them by American missionaries. At the same time, each type of Yi people has one or several of their own languages. In addition, there are also a few who study Chinese. In recent years, the government has paid attention to the education of the Yi people in the border area, allocating considerable funds and entrusting the Tusi to run schools locally, mostly at the primary school level. In a Spiny Yi's house, I asked a student to take out his books for me to see. One book was a Primer for Children, which, in addition to Chinese, had some English printed on it. One was a Commercial Press edition of natural science, one was a textbook on the Three Principles of the People, and one was a text written in a language I did not understand at all. I asked him what grade he was in, and he replied that he was in the fourth grade, which was divided into six grades. English was not read until the second grade. School is only in session for five or six months each year, and it is already April in the solar calendar, but their annual holiday has not yet ended. Mangshi is the most progressive area, with a total of eighteen schools, with approximately forty or ninety students per school, totaling approximately seven or eight hundred primary school students. This is still according to the Tusi himself. In addition, temples also accept students, but they can only learn some Yi classics, and they also wear small kasayas when studying. After they have learned well, they can become monks or return to secular life as they please. Before there were schools, it was the only holy place for learning. Yi writing is very close to Burmese, and the British used Burmese to spread their culture by setting up Mountain Head schools, etc.

Customs and Habits

The most important festival for the Yi people each year is related to their water festival. The only expression of the grand festival is the joy of the young men and women. The seven days after the Qingming Festival is their so-called Water Splashing Festival, which is when men and women splash cold water on each other for fun, regardless of whether they know each other or not, and they can splash water at will. This is an opportunity for them to find partners. There are also two festivals, Jinwo and Chuwo, which are originally festivals for people over the age of forty to go to the temple to worship Buddha, but young men and women are also particularly lively during these two periods and flirt with each other. Marriage expenses for the Yi people, except for the Tusi and his relatives, are relatively simple. In the past, the conditions for marriage were very harsh. Currently, the Tusi stipulates that, for example, in Zhaofang, roughly one hundred and fifty rupees, eighty bowls of wine (approximately five to six jin), and eighty pieces of meat (approximately two hundred jin) are enough to marry a wife. If even this cannot be produced, there is still a way to make up for it: abduction. That is, the man takes the woman away, and the mother-in-law will naturally chase after them, but you escape east, and she chases west. This is originally to save face. After three or four weeks, when the couple returns home, the relatives will persuade them and give a small gift, and that is the end of the matter. Currently, it is said that abduction is more common than arranged marriage. One day we went to see a bride, and all we heard was the deafening sound of dozens of women crying in the room, and the tone was the same. I suspected that we had gone to the wrong place, that this was a funeral home. Only after asking did I know that this was saying goodbye to the bride. All of the bride's female friends had to cry in unison. Funerals are relatively even simpler. A thin coffin is carried quietly to the mountains by a few clansmen and buried, and the tombs are built less than a foot above the ground. The Tusi stipulates that commoners' graves are not allowed to have tombstones or leave names. After a long time, their descendants will not be able to find the tombs of their ancestors. However, we saw that the Tusi's tombs were very large and had official titles engraved on them. The tombs of monks are made in the shape of pagodas, with inscriptions by the Tusi. The gifts that the Yi people send to funerals are mostly two bamboo tubes of rice and two to three hundred small coins (approximately three mao). In terms of clothing, the Spiny Yi are the cleanest. The clothes of the Savage women are black, and they wear large rings in their ears. In terms of food, three sentences can express it: sour Spiny Yi, fishy Savage, stinky Kawa. The Savages live in the mountains, and they mostly live by hunting and do less farming. When eating, one can still see the symbol of the absence of a production system, which is that regardless of size, host or guest, each person has two packets of rice, regardless of whether it is enough or not. The Yi people like to eat betel nuts, which turn their teeth black, their lips blood red, similar to the Annamese. But progressive young women have learned that white teeth are beautiful. The Yi people often move to another Tusi area to seek land to cultivate if they do not like this Tusi. Because the Yi people have nothing of value, it is extremely easy to move. There is a saying: "When Yi people move, they don't need more than three loads," so their mobility is extremely high.

Male-Female Relationships

The social interaction between young Yi men and women is relatively free, unlike that of the Han Chinese. They regard courtship as an open and aboveboard act, with no concealment or hypocrisy. There are two common places for courtship: the mountains and the rice mill. The method of courtship is singing. Men sing and women answer, expressing their love for each other. In the evening, we can see a row of young men squatting in front of each rice mill, because it is cool at night, and they are all draped in a blanket. The people working in the rice mill are mostly young women. The men are ranked in front and back according to their singing skills. The one who sings the best squats in the first position and sings first. After he sings well, the second one continues. The women listen inside and sing back. If she agrees, she may also come out and talk with him for a while before going back to work. The most interesting thing is that behind a group of young men, there is also a string of children following, squatting down, draped in a small blanket, and also humming along with their brothers. They are not seeking partners. I call them "trainees." In the mountains, they sing mountain songs completely. There are many people. I asked a Yi who understood some Chinese to translate for me. According to his not-very-fluent Chinese, it can be roughly translated like this: The men sing first; (to be continued)

### Editorial

### On the Wartime Administrative Guidelines of Guangdong Province

The Guangdong Provincial Affairs Council recently passed a set of Wartime Administrative Guidelines for Guangdong Province and ordered its subordinates to implement them as soon as possible. The original plan includes three major areas: First, in terms of reforming politics, it begins with "supporting the good and punishing the bad," and "praising loyalty and righteousness while eliminating traitors," to promote righteousness, which can also be said to be the embodiment of the spiritual mobilization movement, and will greatly help enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence. Second is "implementing joint office of the provincial government," "clarifying powers and responsibilities, streamlining redundant positions," "improving the organization of townships and Baojia," and "improving the administrative structure of guerrilla areas," which are the basic steps of "adjusting the administrative structure" that have long been echoed by all parties. The third is "eliminating corruption," "selecting the virtuous and capable," "strictly implementing performance appraisals," and "cultivating cadres," which are not only the main methods for rectifying officialdom but also the prerequisites for improving politics. In addition, such as training local militias and police, eliminating the seven types of bad elements and traitors to stabilize the local area; such as expanding anti-Japanese national construction propaganda, intensifying mass organization and training, popularizing national military training, and encouraging the masses to assist in military affairs to effectively mobilize the masses; such as improving conscription methods and providing preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on expeditions, to encourage military service and support the protracted war; and such as intensifying relief work, promoting wartime sanitation, strictly prohibiting opium and gambling, especially protecting returned overseas Chinese, encouraging overseas Chinese to develop industries, and facilitating remittances for overseas Chinese, are all essential measures to adapt to the current situation and enhance the political power of Guangdong Province. Second, in the economic field, regarding the rectification of finance, it was decided to implement measures such as "rectifying the tax system," "abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes, prohibiting arbitrary levies," "rectifying county and city finances," "determining autonomous funding," "establishing treasuries in various places," and "maintaining debt credit"; regarding the activation of finance, it was decided to implement measures such as "promoting provincial bonds to stabilize finance," "strictly prohibiting the circulation of counterfeit currency," "developing the business of provincial banks," "adjusting finance in war zones," "encouraging thrift and savings," and "promoting agricultural and industrial lending"; regarding the promotion of land administration, it was decided to implement measures such as "designating areas for land consolidation experiments," "continuing land surveying and registration," and "improving procedures for reclaiming wasteland"; regarding the development of industries, it was decided to implement measures such as "reorganizing and developing provincial enterprises," "encouraging industry," "promoting agricultural production," and "developing important mineral resources"; in addition, concrete measures were also decided regarding the rectification of transportation, management of trade, and improvement of accounting. These measures not only fully adapt to the urgent needs of Guangdong in the War of Resistance but also lay the foundation for future national construction. Third, in terms of culture, the administrative guidelines clearly stipulate: "implementing wartime curriculum," "promoting compulsory education," "enriching wartime social education facilities," "assisting teachers and students withdrawing from war zones," "promoting nomadic people's education," "ensuring educational funding," and "increasing the efficiency of educational administration" to develop education for the War of Resistance and national construction. At the same time, it also stipulates "promoting inherent culture," "promoting scientific research," and "developing wartime art," which are important steps to mobilize the strength of the whole nation to support the War of Resistance, and promote a new enlightenment movement to establish an ideal new China of the people, by the people, and for the people.

The formulation of these wartime administrative guidelines decided by the Guangdong Provincial Affairs Council was based on very careful consideration. First, senior officials of the various departments of the provincial government, following the instructions of Chairman Li of the provincial government and the heads of the various departments, deliberated on the environment and financial resources of Guangdong and drafted the initial draft. Later, they frequently held meetings to discuss and formulate the draft, and then Chairman Li invited members of the Central Committee, Lu Yougang and Deng Qingyang, and other members who were inspecting the party and government in Guangdong Province to discuss and revise each item, and then submitted it to the 28th Provincial Affairs Council meeting in early May for approval and implementation. The items and measures listed in it can be regarded as the crystallization of the experiences and lessons of Guangdong Province's bloody tears in the 22 months of the War of Resistance, and are also urgently needed by the current wartime environment and tasks of Guangdong, and can be promoted by human and financial resources; therefore, it is not only different from any past administrative needs that were made behind closed doors or represented a certain one-sided need, but also different from political programs that rely entirely on theory and ideals. We would like to express our warm and high respect to the Chairman of Guangdong Province and the leaders on behalf of the people of Guangdong and the whole country for the emergence of this most perfect wartime administrative program! According to the Shaoguan newsletter, regarding this program, it has been divided by the competent authorities according to its nature, and specialized talents have been gathered to formulate implementation measures, preparing for universal and effective implementation, which makes us have unlimited hope for the political future of Guangdong and the future of the people's war against Japan, and increase unlimited confidence in victory! However, learning from past mistakes, we still have something to say, and dare to offer three humble suggestions for reference. That is, first, we hope that this relatively perfect administrative program will not repeat the mistakes of the past that could not be fulfilled, and will no longer be just on paper and cannot become a reality. To achieve this requirement, first, we sincerely hope that the Guangdong authorities will carefully supervise and urge all relevant authorities to implement it effectively, and second, we sincerely hope that the persons in charge of all relevant agencies can deeply recognize the important significance of faithfully implementing this program, do their best to overcome all obstacles, and carry out the struggle effectively and conscientiously to achieve its realization. What is even more important is to intensify the work of universal and in-depth publicity and explanation to the whole people, so that all the people of Guangdong Province can understand whether the implementation of this administrative program is related to the entire fate of Guangdong and the whole country, so that all the people of Guangdong Province can recognize that complying with government laws and assisting the government in implementing this program is everyone's main task at present. At the same time, we must firmly recognize that the promotion of this extensive and in-depth publicity work not only depends on the efforts of the responsible personnel of the relevant agencies, but also depends on the bold promotion of young cadres and talents from various parties who have a correct understanding of politics, a strong confidence in the War of Resistance, rich experience in mass work, and prestige among the people of Guangdong. Second, in order to realize this relatively perfect administrative program, there is also an important prerequisite, that is, we must universally and effectively promote the spirit of democracy advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen throughout his life, in order to promote the initiative and enthusiasm of the people of the whole province to support the implementation of this program. First of all, we hope that the Provincial Assembly will give it enthusiastic support and earnestly mobilize the people to support it; at the same time, we must also step up and effectively promote the establishment of the organization of the township assemblies in various cities and counties, to assist the government from the bottom up and earnestly promote it. Third, we believe that this administrative program is not only suitable for the urgent needs of Guangdong Province today, but also roughly suitable for the urgent needs of other provinces. We hope that all provinces will take the Guangdong Provincial Government as a model, strive to formulate and promote this kind of wartime administrative program first, effectively, and conscientiously, in order to jointly mobilize the strength of the whole nation, support the protracted War of Resistance, and lay the foundation for national construction. Finally, we must also recognize that the × people and traitors do not want our perfect implementation of this administrative program, and they will inevitably use all methods to hinder and sabotage it, especially using rumors, provocation, alienation, and other conspiracies. Therefore, we must fight against this conspiracy, and the main thing is to consolidate our anti-Japanese national united front and consolidate the close cooperation between all ethnic groups, all parties, all classes, all groups, institutions, and the people and the government!

### Latinized New Writing is the Most Ideal Tool for Promoting Life Education Movement...After Reading Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Letter to Comrades of the Life Education Society"

— Chi Dan

Second, how to enable compatriots across the country to have two common languages. Although there is now a "Mandarin" (Northern language), this language is only popular among a small number of intellectuals, and most compatriots use their own dialects; although the War of Resistance also gives various Chinese dialects the opportunity to meet and merge; if we can strengthen it and make it develop rapidly, we can promote the formation of a unified language of the Chinese nation; purify the local dialects, and make China's language and culture reach a higher level.

Undoubtedly, the solution to these two issues depends on the implementation of comprehensive education and life education. Mr. Tao said:

"To turn a ××××× feudal country into a complete one is something that few people can do successfully. We must educate the masses and rise up together to shoulder this great mission, but to enable the people to receive this education, there must be three conditions.

First, it must save money so that the poor can receive education.

Second, it must save time so that the busy can also seek knowledge.

Third, it must be popular so that the uneducated can also understand.

The theory and practice of Latinized New Literature can be said to have been produced for these three conditions. In other words, to become a modernized new writing and meet the needs of the masses, it must have similar three conditions:

First, it must be easy to learn and use. Because of the difficulty of our old Chinese characters, to memorize thousands of sound, meaning, and form blocks that are like kaleidoscope changes, it takes more than five years,

Second, it must be able to fully express the spoken language of the masses and write it out truthfully.

Third, it must be able to cooperate with modern technology and life, such as typing, printing, telegraphing, cataloging,  language, translating and accepting international progressive culture, etc.

Because: Latinized New Writing itself has these three conditions to meet the requirements of education is the masses.

To save money and time, and not waste money and energy, Latinized New Writing is the most ideal tool for promoting the life education movement. According to a small statistic in the opinion letter signed by more than 600 people, including Cai Yuanpei, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, and Liu Yazi, in 1936:

According to the results of the New Writing Program experiment in Shanghai dialect, ordinary people spend one hour a day, and only need half a month to write New Writing letters, read New Writing newspapers, and read New Writing books. People who are a little stupid only need one month (30 hours), and the results are also good for each person. Only three cents are needed. It costs nine cents a year to train a child for compulsory education. It costs one dollar and eighty cents to train an adult for mass education. It costs three cents to use a small teacher to teach Tanzi in the Shanghai area. Popularizing the most basic Chinese character education for 300 million people costs 90 million... If we promote New Writing, from the perspective of time and money, New Writing is the most economical writing tool for popularizing mass education."

Moreover, after the War of Resistance, the results of New Writing education supported by Mr. Chen Heqin, director of the Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau, have been very considerable.

Third, it must be popular so that the uneducated can also understand. In fact, to achieve "popularity," using Chinese characters is limited, except for using Latinized New Writing. Because many of the things that the common people say, most of them cannot be expressed and written in Chinese characters. On the contrary, if you want to use New Writing to write "zhi hu ye zhe" classical Chinese or "foreign stereotypes," or the so-called "quotation style," it is also impossible to understand. Only the spoken language of modern people can be expressed. In this way, "popularity" in New Writing is no longer a "requirement" or "slogan," but a "lifeline." "It must be so popular," otherwise, it will not be understood. Moreover, using New Writing can also unite and integrate Chinese language and writing. I remember that Mr. Hu Yuzhi advocated writing Chinese characters together, but as a result, Chinese characters cannot be written together. This is Mr. Hu's exposure to the unreasonableness of Chinese characters. For example, the War of Resistance, propaganda, and the Three People's Principles are all the same concept, but Chinese characters are divided into two or four blocks, or four or more blocks that cannot be connected, so writing words together is more convenient for the common people to use. Because they know that a hoe is not a hoe and a head.

Now, I should end this article. We know that Latinized writing is just a language tool, just a simple language tool, and of course it cannot include education or everything else, but we cannot deny that the quality of the tool is enough to determine the success or failure of something, just like the means of production in society can determine the relations of production and even the entire social system. At the same time, just as the proposal of "mobilizing national intellectuals to eliminate illiteracy and popularize mass knowledge to resist Japan and build the country" said, in fact, in literacy training, we can simultaneously import preliminary knowledge about resisting Japan and building the country. Then, I hope that every intellectual in the country will rise up to actively promote the Latinized New Writing movement!

### The Battle in Southern Henan is Unprecedentedly Tense; Our Army Pursues and Attacks the Enemy to Prevent Them from Invading Southward; The Situation in Tongbai and Xinye Turns Stable

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] The bloody battle on the border between Henan and Hubei is in full swing. The enemy's main force is in northern Hubei, but the focus of the current contention is in southern Henan. The enemy's advance on Tongbai and Xinye is very urgent, with the aim of pressing the flank and rear of our large army in the Tongbai Mountains and cutting off our retreat route. However, our troops attacking in southern Henan have captured Tanghe and are pursuing the enemy, so the situation is more stable than before.

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 14th] The county seat of Tanghe was violently attacked by a certain battalion of our certain unit and two local self-defense units. On the 13th, they stormed into the city. A regiment of a certain division also engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the eastern suburbs of the city, capturing two enemy officers on the spot and killing more than a hundred enemy soldiers. On the 14th, they entered the city to appease the people.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] According to news from the front line last night, a fierce battle broke out between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Hubei Province recently. As a result, the Chinese army recaptured Huamiaoqian south of Jingshan, but Zhongxiang lost several small peaks to the Japanese army. It is estimated that the number of casualties of the enemy army from the 2nd to the 10th reached as many as 12,800, it is said.

The Entire Shanxi Border is in a Stalemate

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 14th] Military affairs on the Shanxi front have been in a stalemate for the past week. The strongholds on the east side of the Tongpu Railway in the triangular area are still under our army's encirclement and surveillance. The 1st Division of the enemy's main force in Shanxi Province has suffered heavy losses, with some regiments having only 700 or 800 men left. It is said that Division Commander Ushijima, after being reprimanded by Sugiyama for misdirecting command, will be transferred back to Tianjin to take on training work. Most of the key points outside Anze and Fushan are under our control. The enemy is only holding on to the city gate. Since the beginning of the month, the enemy in Hongdong has attacked the central area between Anfu and Anfu to the east, but after being attacked separately by our army, the enemy suffered losses and retreated to the northern section of the Jinbai Highway. The enemy also has no ability to invade southward, building bunkers and repairing roads to prevent our attacks. There have been occasional contacts on both the north and south banks of the Yellow River. The highways in Xinjian, Jishan, Hejin, Wanquan, Ronghe, and other places are constantly being destroyed by us. In the Xinjian area, the enemy has repeatedly tried to divide its troops and harass the villages and towns in the southern pass of the Lüliang Mountains, but has not succeeded. The important high ground of Shangzhen Xipokou, north of Hejin, which controls the Yumen Ferry, is currently under attack by our army. There are no major changes in Tumen Heilongguan in western Shanxi. In addition to continuing to besiege, our army also frequently attacks the enemy in transit. The area west of Fenhua River in Zhaocheng and Huoxian has become the focus of the war in western Shanxi. After the enemy increased by more than a thousand in Wan'an on the 8th, it is expected that there will be a larger battle in the area. On the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, after repeated large-scale destruction by us, the enemy's mobilization and transportation have become extremely difficult. Currently, the rails north and south of the city have been destroyed by us for a total of seventy or eighty miles. The bridges in Cuiqu, south of the city, and Xinzhilinfen to the south, and Zhaoqu Chaizhuang have all been bombed. In the Zhongyang Dashi Dawu area, the enemy reinforced about a thousand men from the rear, and there is a pattern of attacking Liucun in the west. The key points near Pianguan in northwestern Shanxi have been recovered by us one after another. The remaining enemies have retreated to the city and are holding on to the Wutai area. The enemy has transferred about 10,000 men from northern Taiyuan, stationed along the line from Dongye Town to Doucun in the city, and began to attack eastward on the 7th, invading Dongru Village to expand the walls. The enemy's machine gun company has also been unusually active in the area in recent days. According to last autumn, the enemy mobilized 50,000 troops and besieged Wutai in ten routes, but it was inevitable that they would be defeated miserably. This time they are disturbing again, and it will undoubtedly be crushed by us.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th] The puppet imperial collaborationist army in southern Jin deeply understood the great righteousness, and many of them have revolted one after another. Most of their forces have been disintegrated, and the remnants can be cleared up in a short period of time. It was found that on the 7th of this month, Xu Huapeng's troops revolted in Qizhi Town, south of Linjin. Following Xu, Shang Wujie's troops revolted in the Meili Town east of Linying on the 11th, and Su Xianbang's troops revolted in Guifeng Mountain east of Wenxi on the 13th. The revolting troops are now being reorganized.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th] The enemy in Tonghua Town, west of Wanquan, was severely attacked by us and most of them were annihilated. The remaining enemies fled east, and we immediately recaptured the town. The enemy in Ronghe has only a few left, and we are searching for them.

Our Army Advances into Southern Suiyuan

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 13th] On the 11th, a certain unit of our army advanced northward from southern Suiyuan to Houjia Yaozi, north of Liangcheng, and encountered 500-600 enemies. Another unit encountered more than 300 enemies in Zaohu Yaozi. A fierce battle broke out at the same time. Our army attacked bravely and fiercely, and defeated the enemy. Following up, they have now crossed the  road line and advanced to the Yulin area on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan.

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 13th] Two detachments of our certain unit and a certain unit fought fiercely with the enemy in Liangcheng near Xincheng for more than two hours on the 10th. The enemy could not support it and fled eastward. Our army advanced to the Bainao Ridge area and completely destroyed the highway from   to Liangcheng and from Yaohuodi to Dongzishan, cutting off traffic.

### General Deng Longguang's Interview Record

— Wang Hetian

【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】The Xijiang Front, which had been quiet for several months, is now tense again. X bandits who sneaked across from Lijiang are fighting with us in the area of Shaping and Jiangmen. Jiangmen has been gained and lost no less than ten times. The joint sea, land, and air attacks by the X people, and the intensity of the fighting, are rare since the battle of Beiting. The gains in the past few days include killing two X battalion commanders, Zhi Song Zhimu, and countless X soldiers wounded or killed. In addition, more than two hundred X puppet soldiers were captured alive. This is indeed a serious blow to the X people's invasion and a victorious page in our South China Anti-Japanese War.

However, the creator of this victory is General Deng Longguang, who has repeatedly gone north to kill X. The prestige of killing X on the Nanxun Line has reappeared on the Xijiang Front. Everyone is naturally very happy to hear this news. The war zone inspection group of this war zone arrived at ×× amidst the roaring artillery fire on the front line. The reporter took the rare opportunity to visit General Deng Longguang, the military leader who defended Xijiang.

Everyone knows that General Deng is a veteran of the Guangdong Army (Fourth Army). He has a spirit of perseverance and struggle, and he has far-sighted courage and insight. Seeing his shrewd and decisive eyes and the demeanor of a general of Guangdong, I am reminded of the influence of the spirit of General Zhang Fakui, the creator of the Iron Army. They have the same style.

General Deng lives in a newly built thatched house, which is simply furnished. In addition to a few small benches and a long table in the living room, there is a map of several feet hanging on the wall. He was in the house with Director Lin (Director of the Inspection Group) looking at the map, discussing how our troops should be deployed, where the enemy would attack from, and how to annihilate the X people. They were talking with great interest, deeply feeling that victory was very certain. However, he was very careful about this issue and asked the Chief of Staff and Director Lin to study it carefully. The reporter took the opportunity to ask for advice, and General Deng spoke out his views very frankly, as if he were an old friend.

(1) His thoughts after returning to Guangdong: He said, "Since the completion of the unification movement, there has been no progress in Guangdong's military and political affairs. The only effect is that the power has been unified, but the substance of this power has not been strengthened as a result. Moreover, a part of the quantity has become huge, and the quality has become even more empty. The ability of various troops to kill X in the north was slightly established, purely due to the historical origins accumulated by the people of each unit. Therefore, the X people voluntarily landed on Dan Dengmu and Guangzhou fell in only a few days. This is not an unexpected event. After I broke through in Nanjing, I returned to southern Hunan to reorganize and assist the troops. Later, I was transferred back to Guangdong and relieved of my military post. The 156th Division, which I had personally organized and established for many years, was assigned to the 64th Army and went north again to participate in the outer defense of Wuhan. I myself left Guangdong two days before the fall of Guangzhou and traveled back and forth to Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi for more than a month. Then I returned to my hometown for a short rest. Later, I was ordered to take charge of the 64th Army. I recovered from my illness for more than a month and had not taken over the matter for a long time. I only arrived in Zhaoqing at the end of last month, and it has only been a month since then. Therefore, the so-called thoughts after returning to Guangdong are always gratitude. My consistent feeling is that unless the evil disease of selfishness is eliminated from everything in the military, political, and social spheres, there is no way to do anything. Now it is still "expediency" that dominates the whole situation. People in high positions will often fall into the trap of "it is difficult to be a good person." I personally abide by doing my best. All the departments I supervise also hang this as their goal and go together, without arguing about merits or demerits, sacrificing ourselves for the nation above all else and the country above all else amidst discrimination and in the midst of all kinds of difficulties and pains."

(2) His opinion on the second phase of the War of Resistance: He said, "The War of Resistance against Japan is a war at the final juncture of national survival, and it is also a competition of two national strengths. We should mobilize the strength of the entire nation to fight to defend our motherland. The key to victory in the second phase of the War of Resistance lies in mobilizing the masses. To mobilize the masses, politics must be clarified in order to realize what Sun Tzu said, 'Those who lead, make the people agree with the ruler, they can die with him, they can live with him, and they will not fear danger.' My opinion is to take political clarification and military discipline as the foundation of everything."

(3) The situation of mobilizing the people in Xijiang: "In fact, this issue is impossible to discuss. After the fall of Guangzhou, the Guangdong people's faith in the government has dropped to zero. Therefore, the consciousness of being a docile subject and raising the white flag has been shaking vigorously within the narrow vision of some ignorant people. After our army arrived, the discipline of the troops gave the people a slightly better impression. Although we cannot love the people like our children, we will never disturb the people. The perception has improved slightly. However, the bad habits that have grown for a long time are not easy to eliminate immediately. Therefore, it takes a lot of time and effort to win over the hearts of the people. The use of politics is now hampered by the unsound local government structure, and the people are still unable to be moved. The first step is to start clearing household registration and eliminating bandits to engage in organization. All of these tasks are done by officers and soldiers personally. During these inspection visits, the political work of the army divisions and regiments has included mass movements in the work agenda. Each regiment has a work team of more than thirty people, who are fully responsible for this work, passing from the officials to organization and training. For example, in Wenwei Township, they have closely organized the people. The same work is being done in the villages of each defense army. In particular, the Xijiang Anti-Japanese Youth League is flourishing and developing in various parts of Xijiang. These are undoubtedly initiated by the army, but Commander Deng is doing his best to guide and encourage their work, providing them with various conveniences in their work. This is a new phenomenon."

"Because there are no good regulations for military-civilian transportation in the war zone, and the cooperation between the party, government, and military is not close enough, there is no good coordination in mobilizing the masses. It is already the best phenomenon if you do it and he follows. It is still the case that you do it and he still stands by. Our army currently does not have a political department organization, and the main tools for mobilizing and organizing the masses are not united. Everything is difficult, and the time to realize and unleash the power of the masses to strike at the X people is still far away."

(4) What are the X people's intentions for South China? He said: "The purpose of the X people's invasion of China is naturally what is said in the memorial to the throne: 'To seize China as a base for dominating the world.' Now the X people's plan to rule China with Chinese people has failed, and the attempt to fight a quick battle has also fallen through. Since Guangzhou has been unexpectedly obtained, they naturally want to expand their achievements. Therefore, the X people's intentions for South China are, first, to cut off our supply routes from the outside, and second, to unite the strength of South China. Therefore, opening up the Yuehan Railway and attacking Guangxi are unforgettable dreams for the X people. This time, the X people's sneaking across from Jiuting was a trial of strength and to rob food, but once they crossed the river, they were surrounded by our army in Shaping and severely beaten. Therefore, the X people, ashamed and angry at the failure, have increased their troops once or twice from several hundred to three thousand, resulting in the battle for Jiangmen, which is still being fought. Regardless of whether the X people are probing or launching a general offensive, we swear to fulfill our military duty to defend our territory and sweep the X people out of our land, giving full play to our "Guangdong revolutionary spirit" and giving the X people a final blow."

As he said this, his eyes were filled with angry flames, and the heroic spirit of commanding the three armies on the battlefield was revealed on his face. Even timid and fearful people would be excited when they saw this heroic and resolute spirit of fighting on the battlefield. We talked for a whole hour. Fearing that I would delay his official business, I said goodbye and returned. The bright moon was shining on the earth, and sparse artillery fire came from the front line. I thought that my family was waiting for the news of victory tomorrow.

### X Interferes with Administration in Gulangyu and Coerces the Concession to Accept Five Demands

【Xiamen, 15th Telegram】According to Japanese sources, Uchida, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, has made five demands to Mahoshinn, the Chief Director of the Gulangyu Public Concession: (1) Fundamentally control the anti-Japanese elements in the concession; (2) The Chief Director, Chief Supervisor, and Chief Secretary of the Public Works Bureau should be immediately replaced by Japanese people, and the number of Japanese police officers should also be increased; (3) Residents of He Guanji should have the right to participate in the election of the Public Works Bureau; (4) The three vacant seats for Chinese representatives in the Public Works Bureau should be filled; (5) The Japanese Consul is willing to cooperate with the Public Works Bureau police to stop "terrorist incidents."

### Gulangyu Incident: Britain Has Lodged a Protest

【Haitong News Agency, London, 15th Telegram】It was announced this afternoon that Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Tokyo, has received instructions to protest to the Japanese government against the landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu in the Xiamen Public Concession. According to Tongjie here, it would be a very serious incident if the Japanese army interfered with the administration of the authorities in the concession.

### Various Countries Protest Against X Aircraft Bombing Chongqing, X Side Decides to Ignore

【Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th Telegram】According to sources here, it is said that Japan has decided to reject the protests of Britain, the United States, and France against the bombing of Chongqing. The Japanese side's reasons are three: (1) Chongqing is not an undefended city; (2) The damage to foreign consulates was actually caused by Japanese aircraft counterattacking Chinese artillery fire; (3) Foreign authorities should request the Chinese side to move the artillery positions away from foreign property.

### British Parliamentarians Demand Landing of Navy

【Reuters, London, 15th Telegram】All newspapers here today gave prominent coverage to the atrocities of the Japanese army on Gulangyu, without comment. Officials and business circles have acknowledged the seriousness of this attitude, believing that if the Japanese pressure on Gulangyu is not resisted, foreign concessions elsewhere are also in danger of suffering the same fate. The authorities are still awaiting reports from the original consular and naval officers, but have stated that while the Japanese dispatch of troops is not a violation of the treaty, the Japanese attempt to interfere with the administration of Gulangyu should not be ignored. Reuters reporters heard that the cabinet is closely watching the situation in the Far East, and the Gulangyu issue may be discussed at Wednesday's cabinet meeting. Members of Parliament and the China Committee are now hoping to raise this issue in the House of Commons and demand that the British Navy land on Gulangyu as soon as possible to prevent the Japanese army from completely controlling the concession before it is too late. At the same time, they also request the US naval authorities to take the same steps.

### British Naval Commander Inspects Xiamen

(This Port News) The X landing on Gulangyu, which undermines the sovereignty of the concession, is taken very seriously by all countries. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, took the flagship Birmingham to Xiamen yesterday morning for inspection. He will make a short inspection in Shantou on the way and then go to Fuzhou and Shanghai.

【Associated Press, Shanghai, 15th Telegram】According to Japanese sources here, the Japanese authorities are currently conducting house-to-house investigations to compile a "list" for future reference. The list will include all Chinese who fly the national flag and will regard these people as anti-Japanese elements and enemies of the Japanese side.

### Generalissimo Chiang's Instructions at the National Production Conference

Full text [Chongqing, Central News Agency, 15th Telegram] The full text of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions at the National Production Conference is as follows:

Chairman, Vice Chairman, distinguished guests, today, experts in agriculture, industry, mining, transportation, and economy from all over the country have gathered together to hold a production conference. I am very happy and hopeful to have this opportunity to meet with you. At present, there are two major tasks in the country:

First, the war of resistance in the front, and second, production in the rear. Today, production in the rear is the same sacred undertaking as the war of resistance of the soldiers in the front. Without the bloodshed of the soldiers in the front, the production in the rear cannot be protected; without the production in the rear, the war of resistance in the front cannot be supported. We are holding a production conference here, which is as important as a military conference.

Since the War of Resistance, in addition to killing our compatriots, forcibly occupying our land, and burning our property, the X people have also blockaded our seaports, plundered our resources, and bombed our cities in an attempt to sabotage all our production undertakings. Under these difficult and distressed circumstances, our entrepreneurs have been able to do their best to support the government's war of resistance, work hard, and support the situation miserably. This is the glory of our entrepreneurs. Now that we are holding a meeting here, many of you have come from afar regardless of the hardships. This patriotic spirit and self-improvement are really commendable.

At the same time, you know that our materials are not as good as those of the X people. Our land is vast and rich in resources, so why are our materials not as good as those of the X people? Because our material resources, although unlimited, have not been created by human labor. To put it bluntly, it is because goods are abandoned on the ground, so our materials are not as good as theirs. It is because we have neglected production and have unplanned production in the past, so our materials are not as good as theirs. If we are not as good as them, we must fight desperately to catch up. In military affairs, we must reorganize the army and build the army to establish our modern national defense equipment; in production, we must also adjust production, create production, and build production to establish our modern national defense production. In this production conference, I hope that you will seriously discuss and study to review the past, encourage the future, and immediately implement the discussed methods to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. This is the great significance and great responsibility of this conference.

I often say that economy, military affairs, and education are the sources of the three major vitality of the country and also the three major important political tasks of the country at present. The so-called modern country is an economically independent country and a country with modern armed production. Our difficulties are multifaceted, but the root cause is due to economic backwardness. You know that the wild military aggression of the X people against our country has the ultimate goal of economic aggression. Now the X people are desperately carrying out economic aggression in North China. Although the X people's poisonous schemes will never be realized, we must deeply recognize the ugly face of the X people who suck blood and eat meat. A national spirit that is subdued by others is the beginning of national subjugation, and economic bankruptcy is the end of national subjugation. Today, we must mobilize the spirit, and at the same time, we must use the mobilization of the spirit to achieve the total mobilization of materials. If we cannot develop production at the same time during the War of Resistance, we cannot support the long-term War of Resistance. Moreover, even if the War of Resistance is won, if the national economy is bankrupt, this country can still be subjugated at any time. These days, you have witnessed the inhuman indiscriminate bombing of the central area of Chongqing by the X people. This kind of bombing and arson that is extremely devoid of military value certainly shows the X people's despicable shamelessness, but we must also recognize that the X people are vainly trying to threaten our spirit and destroy our production by this means. We are naturally extremely grieved, but we should grit our teeth, step up our work, and overcome difficulties. In the blood and fire, we should forge our spiritual weapons and build our material weapons, not only to drive out the inhuman X people with a long-term bloody battle, but also to establish a prosperous and strong new China based on the Three Principles of the People through long-term and arduous management.

Speaking of prosperity and strength, they are the two fundamental policies of establishing a country in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. This is the oldest policy of establishing a country in China and the newest policy of establishing a country in the world. Unfortunately, many people still do not understand this point, but we must realize profoundly that only when the country is prosperous and strong can it survive. In today's world, to be prosperous and strong, we must have sufficient food and troops. Today, so-called sufficient food means developing production, and so-called sufficient troops means reorganizing the army and building the army. Only with sufficient food and troops can we wage a long-term war of resistance and build a prosperous and strong country based on the Three Principles of the People. We must develop production to improve the people's lives and make everyone well-fed and well-clothed. We must develop production to ensure the survival of the country. Modern warfare, whether in equipment or supplies, must rely on industry, so production is the central issue of national economy and people's livelihood.

Since our materials are not as good as those of others, we must make up for the lack of materials with spirit and catch up head-on, accelerate economic construction. Construction is the backing of the War of Resistance and also the purpose of the War of Resistance. The fundamental work of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People is production construction. As Sun Yat-sen said, "The most important thing in construction is people's livelihood," which is what he meant. The Premier's lifelong goal was to build a country that is prosperous and strong and where the people live in peace and happiness. This is also the goal of our party's revolution. Twenty years ago, the Premier put forward an industrial plan. This great plan is still the fundamental policy of our economic construction today. At that time, the Premier wanted to use international capital after the European War to develop Chinese industries. Although times have changed today, and large-scale international investment may not be easy for a while, we must continue to work hard, try our best to attract foreign investment, and at the same time, do our best to build on our own. The National Economic Construction Movement that I put forward is to promote the national concerted effort to use its own strength to develop production, develop resources, and enrich the strength of modern countries. I have been promoting it for many years, but I must tell everyone that the National Economic Construction Movement is still far from completion. This movement must continue, and today, during the War of Resistance, we must make even greater efforts to quickly complete this movement. Regarding the wartime National Economic Construction Movement today, I would like to put forward a few suggestions for your reference. (To be continued)

### Original Text: 全國生產會議孔院長開幕詞原文

### English Translation: Opening Speech by President Kong at the National Production Conference

— (Continued from yesterday)

(1) Selection of Types and Nature of Production: Generally speaking, most production industries are beneficial to the national economy. However, their effects differ in terms of urgency and priority. Therefore, the nature and types of production must be suited to the current urgent needs. Recently, prices have been rising repeatedly in various regions. The main reason for this is the imbalance between supply and demand. People feel the lack of essential goods, while luxury and consumer goods still flood the market. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon. In the future, not only should imports be tailored to meet the needs, but domestic production should also strive to reduce the manufacture of consumer and luxury goods, concentrating all capital and labor on the production of essential goods, export trade goods, and national defense industrial goods. Among essential goods, special attention should be paid to increasing food production and promoting the textile industry. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but food imports are very large. Now that the occupied areas are expanding daily and import routes are interrupted, it is necessary to vigorously increase production in the inland areas to meet the emergency. The textile industry has mostly been concentrated in coastal ports. Since the outbreak of the war, the clothing problems of the military and the people all depend on the establishment of the inland textile industry. Export trade production is also very important at present. The replenishment of all foreign exchange funds since the war, the replenishment of military equipment, and the purchase of various necessities all rely on the export of local products as compensation. The production of items such as tung oil, tea, and fur should be promoted. As for the construction of the national defense industry, it is not only related to the future of the war, but also to the overall plan of national construction. It should be planned in a holistic and deliberate manner, and actively implemented.

(2) Regional Distribution of Production Industries: During this war, the center of the national economy and production has shifted from the southeast to the northwest. Therefore, I believe that, firstly, the establishment of provinces in the northwest should be successful first in order to unleash economic power as the foundation for national revival and prosperity. Therefore, current economic construction should focus on the southwest and northwest provinces, considering the source of raw materials, the supply of labor, the supply and demand situation, etc., to determine which area is suitable for which industry and when is suitable for which production. A comprehensive plan should be made to achieve the best results. Secondly, the success of an industry depends not only on detailed plans but also on striving to promote its work. Now, in this time of urgent war, everything must be put into practice, from planning to implementation, with swift means to achieve the greatest effect. The purpose of this production conference is to produce results through meetings, not to hold meetings for the sake of talking.

Therefore, all matters discussed and decided at the meeting must be implemented immediately to respond to the situation. The following points should also be taken into account in promoting production work:

(1) Improvement of the Organization of Production Agencies: The organization should strive to be sound, and it is especially important for organizations to coordinate with each other. In the past, production agencies in various regions often lacked close ties and presented a skewed state. Several organizations often focused on only one type of industry, while some industries that should be promoted were not noticed or promoted. As a result, one aspect developed particularly well, while many industries could not be fully developed due to a lack of capital and labor. As for the internal affairs of various agencies, there were also cases of bloated organizations with complex departments. Not only was the operation not flexible, but the authority was also not clear, resulting in many personnel frictions. Such situations are probably more likely to occur in government-run enterprises. In the future, regardless of public or private enterprises, their organization should strive to be simple, reasonable, commercialized, and civilianized, and should not be tainted with the old bureaucratic habits. They should vow not to engage in empty talk but to be practical.

(2) Raising and Allocating Production Funds: Our country originally lacked production capital, and the situation is even more difficult during this war. The highest principle of national economic construction is self-reliance. Therefore, in addition to using foreign capital when necessary, we should strive to develop national capital on the one hand and collect scattered funds from the people on the other hand, accumulating small amounts into large amounts for use. We should pay close attention to the promotion of rural cooperation and the encouragement of people's savings. As for the allocation of production funds, whether it is reasonable or not is even more important. The purpose of promoting production is to increase supplies and strengthen the war effort. It is necessary to achieve maximum production with a minimum amount of investment in order to comply with economic principles. Therefore, all production agencies should thoroughly study and discuss the methods of allocating funds, whether they are appropriate, whether there is any waste, and whether more economic methods can be sought based on reports. The government advocates thrift, not only hoping to save on consumption but also striving for economic rationality in production. I hope everyone can pay close attention to this point.

(3) Improvement of Production Methods: Striving for scientific and modern production methods is an unchanging iron rule in the process of national construction. However, during wartime, various production facilities have either been destroyed or are difficult to access due to traffic difficulties, lack of power equipment, and difficulty in restoring them. It is not possible to achieve immediate results in a short period of time by purchasing and establishing new ones. Therefore, we have no choice but to improve existing production methods and production institutions, such as handicrafts, home industries, and rural side businesses, by referring to modern theories in order to increase their efficiency. We must ensure that theory and method are matched, that industry and environment are adapted to each other, and that the old and the new are coordinated and used together. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Although some young men have been drafted into the army, there is still surplus labor among women, children, and the elderly. Moreover, the nature of women is most suitable for this type of work. If we can find ways to utilize this, engaging them in production will greatly benefit the strengthening of the war effort.

(4) Training in Production Cooperation: As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person." The development of all undertakings depends on the promotion of human resources. Therefore, training talents is the engine for promoting future production. We have spared no effort in promoting vocational education. However, recently, school education has placed too much emphasis on theory. The state spends huge sums of money to establish higher education, but the talents cultivated are mostly unable to engage in actual production. This is a waste. I believe that at present, there is a great need for high-level technical talents, but the number of people needed is limited and they are still being recruited. What is most lacking is skilled workers, because these talents are the backbone of production professions. The economic wealth of all industrially advanced countries is based on their large number of skilled workers. Before the European War, Germany's wealth was an important component of this. The accelerated recovery after the war was also the same. Without skilled workers, even with perfect equipment, it would be used improperly, resulting in waste and reduced efficiency. Therefore, in the future, we should establish vocational schools in various production departments. In addition to imparting theories, we must also give them opportunities for practical training to ensure that schools and industries are integrated and that theory and practice are interconnected. Young people will not have the fear of unemployment, and society will not feel the lack of talent. Construction and restoration will be successful.

What I have said above is just a brief overview. All of you are in charge of production agencies or are well-known domestic experts. You will certainly be able to draw on what you have learned and experienced in your daily research, outline the main points, and carefully study them to contribute to the country. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said that the victory of the war must be achieved by eliminating the four wastes: wasted people, wasted materials, wasted land, and wasted time. And in order to achieve the goal of eliminating these four wastes, we must start by developing the economy, increasing agricultural production, and actively supporting handicrafts. In this second stage of the war, while we focus on the war in the front, production and construction in the rear are also the most important tasks. The responsibilities you bear today are as great as those of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. You have not hesitated to come here to attend the meeting despite your hard work. Your enthusiasm and perseverance have been fully demonstrated. I believe that this meeting will achieve good results and make a significant contribution to the war and national construction. (End)

### Su Sends Reply to Britain Officially Yesterday, Molotov Meets with British Ambassador Again, Soviet Newspaper Praises British-Turkish Agreement

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today sent a note from the Soviet government to the British Ambassador here in reply to the British proposals for forwarding to London. However, the nature of the reply has not yet been disclosed. Molotov met with the British Ambassador for half an hour today, and the talks were very harmonious.

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] The government newspaper expressed its approval of the British-Turkish agreement, stating that the "British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is a step towards creating a peace front. This is also the only effective way to stop the spread of aggression. Turkey, because of its military importance, has long been the target of aggression. Turkey also deeply feels this danger, which led to the satisfactory result of the British-Turkish negotiations."

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] "Weekly News" reported that the British government will invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Deputy Foreign Minister to London to discuss the conclusion of a British-Soviet agreement. As for whether this trip will take place during or after the Geneva Conference, it is not yet known.

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 15th] Yesterday, the Times here commented that the sole purpose of the British-Turkish agreement is Britain's attempt to control the two straits of the Dardanelles and Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. The Citizen's Newspaper also stated that it is not known whether Turkey was lured by British loans, as was the case with the treaties signed by Poland and Romania with Britain, which contained commercial implications. The newspaper also stated that in the past, when countries prepared for war, they purchased arms with cash, but now they use maintaining peace and opposing aggression as a pretext to prepare for expanding their armies.

### US President Roosevelt Will Again Appeal for Peace

[Reuters, New York, 15th] The "New York Times" reported today that, according to sources in Washington, if a new crisis situation occurs in Europe, President Roosevelt (pictured) is prepared to issue another appeal for peace at an appropriate time.

### Italian Prime Minister Speaks Again, Some Issues Must Be Resolved First in the Tense International Situation, France Pays Close Attention to Italian Slogans

[Reuters, Trapani, 15th] Mussolini delivered a brief speech today at the opening of the new Fiat factory workshop, stating, "I clearly described the pressing international situation yesterday. I now wish to reaffirm in the clearest terms the Italian desire for peace. I have also said that some issues must be resolved first to prevent dangers from arising over a long period of time." The other parts of Mussolini's speech concerned Italy's national social issues.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th] According to the Rome People's Newspaper on Sunday, the tension in the European situation is not due to issues such as Danzig, Tunisia, Djibouti, or Suez. Each issue can be easily resolved, but if the democratic countries have fairness and sincerity, everything can be solved easily. It also stated that although the Treaty of Versailles has collapsed, the democratic countries still want to undermine the rights and interests of Germany and Italy by another method. The Axis countries have always been concerned with peace. The premiers' speeches in Turin, meanwhile, the Axis countries are waiting patiently to see whether London and Paris will choose peace or war. It also stated that the encirclement policy will only result in a major war. If the democratic countries abandon this policy, it is believed that the masses will resolve all outstanding issues peacefully based on fair principles.

Britain Says Italian Prime Minister Will Act as Mediator

[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th] Political and diplomatic circles here are surprised by the Italian Prime Minister's statement in his speech that none of the current European issues need to be resolved by force. They also stated that the Italian Prime Minister is now prepared to act as a mediator. Moreover, Mussolini's first speech since the establishment of the German-Italian military agreement, with its moderate tone, is worth noting. However, political circles stated that this is sufficient to indicate his determination to assist Germany in the German-Polish issue. Furthermore, the newspapers here this morning, while expressing satisfaction with the Italian Prime Minister's speech, still harbor doubts. Most still question the Italian Prime Minister's assertion that the democratic countries are harming the two Axis countries with economic policies. The Daily Express stated that the entire speech was moderate in tone and encouraged efforts to maintain European peace. The Daily Mail stated that this was a contradictory statement by Mussolini and questioned whether the Italian Prime Minister's statement that there is no need to resolve current issues with war refers to the Danzig issue or the conflict between his own country and France.

France Acknowledges Success of British and French Diplomacy

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Political circles here believe that Mussolini's speech has not changed the situation but has indeed eased it and is welcome internationally. The general opinion here is gradually feeling that the facts of the British-Turkish declaration and other successes of British and French diplomacy have had a great impact on the Axis countries, causing them to reflect on their future policies.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] After listening to Mussolini's speech, the Italian masses shouted slogans such as "Take back Nice, Tunisia, Corsica." The press here is paying more attention to this news than to Mussolini's speech. France still considers Mussolini's speech to be moderate and pays particular attention to Mussolini's statement that the severity of the European issue has not reached the point where it needs to be resolved by force. As everyone is on vacation and the Foreign Minister has gone to England and not yet returned, the government has not yet issued any criticism.

German Political Circles Express Welcome

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Today, German political circles warmly welcomed Mussolini's speech in Turin, considering it a direct response to Chamberlain (especially regarding the Danzig issue). A political critic claimed that some issues need to be resolved and do not necessarily require resolution by the sword, but the democratic countries must first prove their repeated statements that any change to the so-called "status quo" can be resolved through negotiation. It is feared that the arrogance of some people who insist on preventing the people of Danzig from using their democratic rights and self-determination to achieve their wishes will cause disputes. What the Axis countries expect in the future is the fact that Britain loves peace, not its empty words, because empty words are not enough.

Polish Newspaper Criticizes Italian Prime Minister's Speech

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 15th] The Polish official newspaper "Zes," was the first Polish newspaper to criticize Mussolini's speech yesterday morning. It expressed dissatisfaction with the Italian Prime Minister's attacks on democratic countries and the Treaty of Versailles, but considered Mussolini's statement that European issues do not need to be resolved by force to be extremely important. Official and semi-official circles are carefully scrutinizing the speech, but state that this speech cannot give the situation a chance to be resolved.

### British Foreign Secretary to Go to Geneva This Weekend to Attend League of Nations Meeting

[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th] According to authoritative sources, British Foreign Secretary Halifax has now decided to travel to Geneva on Saturday or Sunday to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, but it is not yet certain whether Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin will be able to attend.

### Hitler Suddenly Arrives in Aachen to Inspect Construction

[Reuters, Cologne, 14th] Hitler suddenly arrived in Aachen today to inspect the western defense fortifications in detail.

### Nazi Party in Danzig Parades in Demonstration, Polish Minister of National Defense Goes to France to Discuss Military Issues

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th] In the past ten days, about 46,000 German youths have entered Danzig under the guise of tourists, preparing to participate in the Nazi demonstration parade in Danzig on Sunday. However, Polish officials believe that no accidental incidents will occur and do not intend to stop the parade. A certain newspaper in Danzig has already printed a large number of yes-or-no forms for future referendums.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 15th] Polish Minister of National Defense General Kasprzycki left here today for Paris, where he will reportedly discuss military issues with the French authorities.

Poland Negotiates Business with Britain and the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Berlin, 13th] A Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that Poland has no intention of forming a four-nation agreement with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. He said, "We do not want any action that could be seen as an encirclement. If our neighbors are willing to maintain friendly relations, we are also eager to do so."

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 10th] According to the ABC newspaper here, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szczesiak will travel to England and Moscow during the day for commercial negotiations. It is reported that the task of the Polish Deputy Foreign Minister is to plan to exchange steel products for raw materials from the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 14th] Deputy Minister of Commerce Rost left today for London to hold talks with British government officials to discuss how to increase the amount of coal produced in Poland that is exported to the United Kingdom in exchange for British manufactured goods, especially various machines.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Shanghai Concessions and the Kulangsu Issue

According to today's newspapers, the situation in the First Shanghai Concession is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese Foreign Minister and the Shanghai Consul held an important meeting and are rumored to have finally decided to adopt firm measures (see the Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 15th). Second, the situation on Kulangsu is becoming increasingly terrifying. The Japanese side has even made five unreasonable demands, such as thoroughly suppressing anti-Japanese elements and having Japanese people serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, the Police Chief, and the Secretary-General (Xiamen News from the Japanese-British Allied News Agency of this port on the 15th).

We have pointed out that the landing of Japanese troops on Kulangsu is closely related to the seizure of the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions and can be said to be a probing operation for the armed occupation of the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions. Therefore, these two events can be said to be the same event. The main intentions of the Japanese side are roughly as follows: First, because the Tianjin, Shanghai, and other concessions, leaseholds, and international settlements are the last strongholds of the powers' interests in China and the national capital along the Chinese coast since the Sino-Japanese War, they have long been coveted by the Japanese, who are now urgently seeking to seize them in order to supplement the economic strength of their military aggression in China and at the same time打击to打击the forces supporting our long-term resistance war by international and national capital. Second, and more importantly, is to begin to exclude all the interests and labor of the European and American powers in China and the Far East and to achieve their so-called "New Order in East Asia." This move, especially when the European situation is serious, contains the indirect support of the aggressive actions of its allies, the German and Italian aggressors, in Europe. Therefore, this move is a further expression of the joint offensive by the fascist aggressors against the democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain and France. Third, and what our Chinese compatriots, especially those in South China, cannot afford to ignore, is that the Japanese threat to the Shanghai concessions is also an attempt to undermine the economic and political base of our military rear battles that are beginning to take place, and the Japanese landing on Kulangsu is also an attempt to facilitate the Southward advance policy that is being actively prepared, especially the Chaozhou-Shantou strategy that is being planned!

After we understand these conspiracies and intentions of the Japanese, on the one hand, we must step up international propaganda to explain the serious threat of this move by the Japanese to the European powers, especially the British, French, and American countries, and arouse the democratic and peaceful countries to step up the movement of the Soviet Union to aid China and sanction Japan, so as to protect their Far East interests and protect the world's safe order. On the other hand, we must step up the awakening of overseas Chinese to the attention of such conspiracies by the Japanese, step up the movement to return to the country to serve, especially to use all our strength to assist the central government ××××××××××××, and strengthen the defense forces of Chaozhou-Shantou, the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi border, and the South Road and West River!

### Franco's "Victory Parade" Scheduled for the 19th, 160,000 Troops to Be Inspected, German and Italian Troops to Withdraw After Participation

[Reuters, London, 15th] According to the Madrid correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," tens of thousands of Spanish, German, and Italian troops are concentrated in and around Madrid, preparing to hold a "victory parade" on Friday (the 19th). This military parade will be the largest in Spanish history. According to general estimates, General Franco will inspect 160,000 troops, including about 10,000 Italian troops under the command of General Gambara and about 4,500 German troops under the command of Colonel Liszten. The German and Italian troops will withdraw from Spain a few days after the military review. According to current plans, the German troops will leave Vigo on the 22nd of this month, while the Italian troops will leave Cadiz and Alicante.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 14th] The German volunteer pilots, namely the Condor Legion, will return home on the 22nd of this month from the port of Vigo. The National Army authorities have scheduled a grand farewell celebration for them.

### 太原 Under Iron Heels

— Lin Jia Lv

[Minge Society Jinxi Correspondence] In Dongguan, Suide, northern Shaanxi, in the afternoon, countless villagers carry grain, wool fabrics, straw paper, fox furs, etc., local products, from the surrounding villages, gathering on this street. When the year-round hard work is exchanged for a few sheets of flowered paper—banknotes—they always bring back some red and green foreign cloth, silk, socks, or some colorful buttons and pins...to give to their longing wives or daughters. Little by little, but every day and countless times, they bring them, while the bosses, sleeves folded, squatting in front of street stalls or leaning on counters, always supply them inexhaustibly. When it is Yihetou (sixty li east of Suicheng)'s market day every three days, this situation is even more lively. I went to inquire with those magician bosses, and they all pointed in unison, "The 'gate' is at Qikou." Arriving at Qikou in Hedong, wow, a long street of five li, one warm inn after another, people from all directions, coming and going in a continuous stream. When I accidentally ran into a lithography bureau, there were four-cornered notebooks with Saipi covers, a New Star brand mimeograph machine, costing more than fifty yuan. Genuine old-brand Horii stencils, six yuan a tube. There were also all kinds of vacuum tube fountain pens, pencils, ink, small knives, and dazzling (Eastern) foreign stationery. It was the first time I saw such a beautiful stationery store in the northwest from Xian to Han. Asking the shop assistant, he said calmly: "From Taiyuan!"

Arriving at Lin County in Hedong, whenever I went into a restaurant, as soon as I sat down at the table, the lively young waiter would come to me very seriously and ask: "What kind of money do you use?" I stared at him blankly, not understanding. He hurriedly explained apologetically and firmly. "We can't make change for ten-yuan notes. Last time, a few people ate more than three yuan, and we couldn't make change either, so we could only let them owe it..." A large lithographed notice was posted on the wall, hoping that the people would trust the new Shanxi provincial currency, but everyone, military, government, and civilians, felt that using banknotes was always nerve-wracking. Some said that there was a shortage of small denominations, and some said that Taiyuan was manipulating it.

Today, I found a guest who had just returned from Taiyuan, and he explained these mysterious puzzles to me. He is the manager of a large merchant in Lin County, ××, and often goes to Taiyuan to purchase goods. This kind of trade with the × area has been popular since April of the lunar calendar year before last and has continued uninterrupted until now, with an average of over a hundred people per month (some are villagers engaged in small trade). In the past, it was possible to transport goods from this side to be sold on the other side, and then buy goods from that side to bring back. The main goods exported from this side are hemp and hemp ropes, followed by salt, cotton, etc. (now cotton is cheaper over there than here). The goods coming in include white coarse cloth, white foreign cloth, twill, thread serge, tribute satin, kerosene, foreign paper, shoes, socks, soap, flashlights, batteries, Western medicine, and various daily necessities. Now we are forbidden to transport goods out, so we can only bring money to buy them. However, individuals in the × area issue a large number of counterfeit banknotes, and the new Shanxi provincial currency is prohibited, but a large amount of legal tender is absorbed. Old provincial currency is also allowed, but it is completely manipulated by them. Normally, legal tender with the Tianjin imprint is worth nine jiao seven fen per yuan, while other types are only worth seven or eight jiao. In the past, one yuan of old provincial currency could be exchanged for nine jiao of the bogus United Reserve Bank, but the latest announcement said that after February 20th, it would be reduced to 60% (one yuan would only be worth six jiao), and after March 10th, it would be completely prohibited. Therefore, it is now very difficult to use the new ten-yuan provincial currency in the market in northwestern Shanxi. And a ten-yuan legal tender can be exchanged for eleven yuan.

His most recent trip to Taiyuan was on the second day of the twelfth lunar month when he set off from Lin County with a companion, a county servant, and two head of livestock, passing through Fangshan County, Yanfan south of Jingle, and reaching Xiangyang. Xiangyang is thirty li north of Taiyuan City, and the heavy troops of the × people are stationed in Lanchun to its northwest. However, our troops often go to Xiangyang for inspections, and Japanese soldiers also bring propaganda teams to give lectures. He entered the north gate of Taiyuan on the seventh, taking only six days en route. The north gate and south gate of Taiyuan City are open for passage, while the east gate and west gate are closed. Two Japanese soldiers and two Chinese puppet police guard the city gate. The Japanese soldiers wear yellow woolen uniforms and carry rifles, while the puppet police wear grass-green uniforms, peaked caps, and badges that are five-pointed copper stars from the former Generalissimo era, and carry wooden sticks. When entering the city, one must salute the Japanese and be inspected by the puppet police under the direction of the Japanese. It's very casual. As long as you have a "good citizen certificate" hanging on your chest, you can enter and exit without hindrance. (He took out a "good citizen certificate" from his pocket and showed it to me. It was issued locally, a rectangular white cloth strip with the three characters "good citizen certificate" in the middle, the age written on the left, the place name on the right, and stamped with the seal of the Lin County Chamber of Commerce. To pass through our side, you need a passport, which is deposited in Xiangyang.) There are quite a few people entering and leaving the city gate. After entering the city, they stayed at a familiar firm and dared not stay in an inn, because there were frequent inspections. It's very dangerous. Although it is easy to enter the city, things can still go wrong. Not long ago, a shop assistant from a certain shop in Lin County went to Taiyuan to purchase goods. He carried a family letter for a certain soldier of the × army, and it was discovered before entering the city. He was taken to a small house next to the city gate for questioning. He explained that the letter was sent to his shop by a certain wounded soldier hospital in Suide, and then the shop asked him to carry it, and he knew nothing else. The puppet police reproached him for making trouble for himself, but at the same time, they intended to release him. However, the Japanese soldiers took him very seriously to the garrison headquarters. After sleeping for a few days in the cold, he found someone to prove that he was indeed a merchant from Lin County, so he was released without any difficulty. On the day he came out, the Japanese officer asked him very kindly: "Which unit is stationed in the Lin County area? How many people are there? Where is the 19th Army stationed? How do they treat the people?" He answered these questions vaguely. (Once, a plainclothes detective from the ×× army was discovered and arrested by the × people in Lishi City, but he was not harmed. Instead, he was propagandized with a set of ideas that 'China's resistance has no hope of victory.')

Transporting goods out of the city is the only difficult key. After we forbade the export of goods to ×, the × people also ordered a blockade of exports. Everyone leaving the city is only allowed to carry one bolt of cloth and only five jin of sugar... Other military supplies such as Western medicine, foreign wax, twill, kerosene, etc., are strictly prohibited from being transported out. But they still smuggle freely. There are two ways: one is to try to bribe Japanese cars, load them with goods, and rush out of the city gate. (There are now three motor vehicle companies in Taiyuan, one for × army use, one run by merchants, and one run by Chinese merchants. The motor vehicle road north of Xiangyang was only recently destroyed.) One car requires fifty yuan. This method is very dangerous. Last month, one car was accidentally checked. In addition to the car and the goods being confiscated, the manager was detained, kerosene was poured into his mouth and nose, and he suffered all kinds of abuse. In the end, he spent more than three thousand yuan to barely buy a remnant of his life. The customers all ran away. Another way is more reliable, which is to collude with the puppet public security bureau and use large rubber-wheeled carts with license plates. Load the goods, cover them with a layer of tarpaulin. When leaving the city, the puppet police glance at it and let it pass. Everything can be taken out, and the Japanese soldiers also pretend not to notice, probably also having a hand in it. Each license plate can carry about 1,400 jin, and it costs more than thirty yuan in bribes. He had to go through three times to get his goods out of the city this time. The second time he was almost detained, probably because he spent less money. These procedures are all handled by merchants in the city. Only when the goods arrive in Xiangyang does one know how much money is needed. This time, he spent twenty yuan on shipping for more than 700 jin. There were four large carts traveling out together, with a total of more than 14,000 yuan worth of goods, most of which were from Qikou and Sanjiao. Because he couldn't get the goods out of the city, he stayed for half a month. The market in Taiyuan is as prosperous as before the war. There are few students, but most merchants are doing business peacefully. They don't care much about the war, but in reality, there are great difficulties. First, there is absolutely no guarantee for business. He described a real example (this happened in a firm he knew in the city). The manager of that firm exchanged nine hundred yuan of "gold notes" from a bank one day. On the way back to the store, two Japanese soldiers followed him and asked him to exchange them. He did not agree. That evening, the two Japanese soldiers led several armed companions into his store, forced him to open the cash register, took the original nine hundred yuan that had not been touched, and forced him to hand over the rest of his savings, looting a total of more than two thousand yuan, and then left. As a result, the manager did not dare to speak out afterward and endured it in silence. Second, the × people completely control the financial situation by issuing a large number of empty counterfeit banknotes. Third, the production factories along the Tongpu Railway have been taken over by the Japanese, such as many textile factories in Yuci and the match and tobacco companies and arsenals in Taiyuan. They all ship goods under the original brand names, but in reality, the Japanese are making all the profits. Therefore, now, whether it is domestic or foreign goods, everything is Japanese goods. For example, Taiyuan matches are banned here due to the absurd propaganda of the × people (anti-communist and against ×), and replaced with Fenyang matches. In fact, Fenyang matches are also Japanese goods. The white coarse cloth, twill, thread serge, tribute satin, etc. that are sold the most here all come from Yuci. White coarse cloth is more than one yuan more expensive per bolt (twelve yuan) than before the war because the × people transport large quantities of cloth to Hongzhao to exchange for cotton. In short, Chinese merchants are eking out a living under the complete control of the × people. Various public buildings in Taiyuan have been occupied by the Japanese. The Railway Bank is a major base of the × people's secret service. The Japanese have opened many restaurants, tea houses, and kilns in Taiyuan City. Another type of business is buying wood, scrap copper, and scrap iron.

Talking about the business situation in the Lin County area, he feels that there have been no special difficulties since the war, and it seems to be more active than before. There is no export now. The sales of imported goods—general consumer goods are twice as large as necessities. In particular, the twill, foreign wax, and various daily necessities needed by the military and political circles account for the majority. These all rely on the supply from Taiyuan and have not yet been resolved. Their biggest problem at present is that the × area will prohibit the use of old provincial currency and legal tender. What he hopes most is "to be able to transport goods to the × area for sale."

He is from Fenyang. His family still lives in Nanguan, Fenyang. Sometimes he goes back to see them himself. Sometimes he asks someone to take some money to them. It seems that there is no need to rescue his family from the × area. He told me two recent stories that happened in Fenyang: First, in the past year (lunar calendar) this year, the × people recruited more than 600 Chinese strong men, who were trained in the city for six months. The main thing was to teach Japanese and not allow them to speak Chinese. On the day of completion, the Japanese took out many beautiful Japanese military yellow woolen uniforms and Chinese cloth military uniforms, and let everyone choose freely. As a result, two-thirds (more than 400 people) chose to wear yellow woolen uniforms, and the rest wore cloth military uniforms. That night, the first group was transported by train to an unknown location. The second group took on the duties of "maintaining local security" such as puppet police and rural cleaning teams. Second, once, the Japanese army in Fenyang drove a large number of Chinese strong men to "clean the countryside." In a certain place in the suburbs, they encountered the ××× brigade of the ×× army. The strong men shouted, "We are Chinese!" The comrades of the ×× army replied: "Chinese, turn your guns around!" As a result, more than 400 Japanese soldiers were completely "cleaned" up.

He has few opinions or feelings about the various situations in the × area and China's resistance. They usually don't think or discuss this much. He is very vague about the current war situation. Although he runs in and out of the × area, he is not very excited. I pointed to the map to show him the current Sino-Japanese military situation, and told him that the reason why China's initial resistance was bound to fail was not surprising, but the × people had certain fatal weaknesses, and they were increasing day by day. I said that in our rear in the southwest, the government is now working hard to develop new large industries and commerce, and training new troops that are more powerful than the × people. In the rear of the × people, we have countless regular troops, guerrilla troops, and the common people, entangled with the × people. This is not even considered a real attack on the × people. When the × people have even greater difficulties, our new strength has grown, and international friends can help us even more, that will be the day when we truly counterattack, and we will drive the × people out of China in one fell swoop. The time cannot be determined, it depends on the extent of everyone's efforts. But this period will definitely come sooner or later! He and the other shop assistants gathered around, listening very attentively, and agreeing as if waking up from a dream.

The reporter believes that to eliminate the economic manipulation of the × people, it is necessary to implement planned and strict blockades and restrictions in the political sphere. In the economic field, we must actively promote various handicrafts and necessary industries to achieve a state of self-sufficiency. The two aspects must be carried out simultaneously.

At the same time, although the appeasement policy of the × people cannot ultimately conceal their violent nature, the current sweet and deceptive phenomenon has a considerable effect on those compatriots in the business community who only know how to value profit and the honest people, especially on the many weaknesses that exist in the semi-feudal Chinese society itself. We should strengthen the propaganda work among the compatriots in the × area, and we should talk to those who come and go to the × area in particular, on the one hand, to inquire about the various actual situations in the × area, and on the other hand, to increase their awareness. This can not only teach them not to make erroneous actions but also deeply influence others. (End)

### Queen of Australia Sailing in Icy Mist, Expected to Arrive in Canada as Early as Tomorrow, Cruise Itinerary Unchanged

[Reuters London, 14th] A Reuters reporter on the Queen of Australia reports: "Passengers woke up this morning and immediately felt renewed excitement. The weather is clear, but everything in sight is large ice floes. The ship is traveling very slowly, only four nautical miles per hour. The ice floes are crashing left and right, and the paint on the side of the ship is sometimes wiped off. Looking back, a black sea divides the white ice, and black snow petrels are seen floating on the ice floes, while the escorting destroyer is closely following behind. The captain has changed course to the south to avoid thicker ice blocks. Although dense fog is gradually descending at this time, the ship is still able to slowly advance. In the evening, the ship's speed is only five miles. Those familiar with the situation in Canada know that they must be extremely anxious about any changes in the itinerary, so they are very sympathetic to them. The most restful service was presided over by the first mate, and both second mates participated, singing hymns in unison. This simple gathering added a special feeling because the ship's whistle was heard frequently."

[Reuters Quebec, 14th] According to the opinions of the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for Welcoming the British King and Queen to Canada, it is expected that the British King and Queen will not be able to arrive here before Wednesday. The official has not yet issued a notice regarding the exact time of the Queen of Australia's arrival here. Mr. Coleman, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, stated that he had not received notification from Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King to change the King's tour itinerary again.

### Trivial Matters Lead to Feud, Hong Kong Ap Lei Chau Yesterday Had a Bloody Brawl, More Than Forty Xiamen People Seek Revenge and Destroyed Ho Hing Shipyard

At around 2 pm yesterday, a bloody revenge brawl suddenly occurred at Ho Hing Shipyard in Haoking Street, Ap Lei Chau, resulting in one death and seven injuries. The incident involved Chan Choi, a woman in her forties from Ho Hing Shipyard. Due to poor income and expensive firewood in recent years, she often went out to pick up firewood branches and Miscanthus sinensis to supplement her family expenses during her free time. The day before yesterday (14th), Choi went to Tai Shu Wan

to pick up firewood branches. That area is a district where Xiamen people gather, many of whom are engaged in making rice noodles. On that day, several troublemakers, seeing Choi arriving, thought she intended to invade their sphere of influence, so they accused Chan Choi and punched her before letting her leave. Afterwards, Chan Choi returned to the shipyard, feeling aggrieved by being beaten and humiliated for no reason, so she complained to everyone in the shipyard. Those who heard this were greatly angered. Not long after, a Xiamen woman came from Tai Shu Wan to Ap Lei Chau to get rice water, and Chan Choi saw her and wrote that those Xiamen people should not unreasonably humiliate people. The woman who was written also returned to her room and cried about the situation. The Xiamen people there were also very angry. Thus, both parties had a deep hatred over some trivial matters,

causing a fatal and bloody tragedy. According to residents of Ap Lei Chau, the Xiamen people of Tai Shu Wan had come to Hong Kong to hire several instructors. At around 1 pm yesterday, they gathered more than forty people, divided them into four long dragon boats, and came from Tai Shu Wan. They arrived about an hour later, landed, and each held pointed wooden sticks and sharp blades. Shouting loudly, they rushed directly to Ho Hing Shipyard, went straight into the factory, smashed objects, and picked up stones at the same time, throwing them arbitrarily. A small wooden house next to the shipyard also suffered the same fate. At that time, it was still difficult to resolve the situation. The neighbors, fearing that the incident would escalate, blew whistles to call the police. The Aberdeen Police Station, hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western policemen to rush to the scene. At that time, two Xiamen people who participated in the brawl, fearing arrest by the police, jumped into the sea, intending to escape by swimming. One of them, dressed in a black shirt and black trousers, hit a reef in the sea with his head while jumping down, immediately dying. Seeing this, the police quickly rescued him and applied artificial respiration to try to save him, but due to the severity of his injuries and the excessive amount of water in his stomach, he

could not be resuscitated. Another person was arrested by the police. His head was also injured. In total, three people from Ho Hing Shipyard were injured in this incident, namely, Wong Kam Yau, a man over sixty years old, Chow Fo Tsai, over thirty years old, and Chan Choi, a woman. All three were injured in the head. On the Xiamen side, three people were also injured on the spot. The most unfortunate was Ching Do Fu Tin Choi, who stepped forward to mediate during the fierce fighting, but was hit in the abdomen with a wooden stick and fell to the ground.

The final investigation revealed that the deceased was named Lau Chau (53 years old), who cultivated vegetable gardens in Sham Shui Po for a living and lived in a wooden house without a street number. As a result of this fight, police detectives arrested more than a dozen people. In addition to the death of Lau Chau, eight people were injured. They were all taken back to the police station for detention and investigation, and then sent to Mary Hospital for treatment. However, their injuries were very minor, so after the doctor treated them, they were handed over to the police for detention. At the same time, the police telegraphed a photographer to the scene to photograph the scene of the incident and the body of the deceased for preservation. In addition to charging the detainees, they telegraphed a hearse to the scene to transport the body to the morgue for autopsy. The deceased's fatal injuries were to the head and the inside of the body. The head was broken open and the brain matter was exposed, a very tragic death, it was said.

### Jinmen Overseas Compatriots Relief for Refugees: "A Bowl of Rice" Campaign; Zhang Kunyi Donates Newly Inked Rubbings of Paintings

According to American shipping news, April 29th was the Japanese Emperor's birthday. Japanese people held a "Japan Day" at the Jinmen Expo, holding grand celebrations. The United Overseas Chinese Unified Charity Donation Association in the United States, in order to arouse Westerners' attention and break through Japanese false propaganda, specially obtained permission from the China Exhibition Company to hold a Refugee Relief Day at the China Exhibition site on the same day, named "A Bowl of Rice" campaign. It received enthusiastic support from various sectors and extensively publicized through newspapers and broadcasting stations. The effect was fully demonstrated. It is estimated that many Chinese and Westerners visited and donated to the "Chinese Rice Bowl." Our special correspondent, Ms. Zhang Kunyi, on that day, dressed in black, stood in front of the painting studio, using sales to aid refugees. The tourists were greatly moved and purchased over seven hundred rubbings. The People's Daily was sold by Zhang. Therefore, they requested Zhang to paint four paintings and write ten calligraphic works, worth five thousand US dollars, to be contributed to the motherland. Zhang has already agreed. Before this "A Bowl of Rice" campaign was held, Xiao Jishan, Deputy Minister of the Overseas Chinese Department of the Central Executive Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, happened to be in the United States. The San Francisco branch party members held a grand welcoming party. That evening, Ms. Zhang Kunyi generously displayed her adoptive father Mr. Gao Qifeng's works, and Ms. Zhang's recent masterpieces with anti-Japanese spirit, hanging on the four walls for public appreciation. For a time, the atmosphere of patriotism was extremely tense.

### The Maiden Voyage of the "Flora Lammesch" Ship; New Aircraft for China National Aviation Corporation Arrives Yesterday

The "Flora Lammesch," the newly fitted ship of the American President Lines, represented by the Jebsen & Co. in Hong Kong, departed from New York on her maiden voyage to Hong Kong and arrived this morning, docking at the Holt's Wharf. Also arriving was a Douglas DC-3 aircraft ordered by the China National Aviation Corporation. After the crash of the Guilin aircraft, the China National Aviation Corporation deeply felt the shortage of aircraft. At the same time, due to the successive opening of the Chongqing-Hanoi and Chongqing-Burma routes, a special envoy was sent to New York to order two aircraft, each capable of carrying twenty passengers. After the aircraft arrives in Hong Kong, it will be assembled at Kai Tak Airport before it can be used. The other aircraft will arrive in Hong Kong in two months. Afterwards, these two aircraft will be deployed on the Chongqing-Burma and Chongqing-Vietnam routes respectively. Also, the "Guilin" aircraft that was shot down by enemy aircraft earlier is still being repaired and assembled at Kai Tak Airport. The "Flora Lammesch" has a deadweight of 6,598 tons and a speed of 17 nautical miles per hour. It uses oil instead of coal as fuel. The cargo holds and passenger cabins are very modern. The first-class cabins have double rooms for four people and are equipped with private bathrooms. The ship also has a tennis court and swimming pool. It is also reported that the ship will regularly travel between New York and the Far East, its route passing through the Panama Canal across the Pacific Ocean.

### Patriotic Vendor Chen Xin: Long-Term Charity Sale

With the Anti-Japanese War authorities directing effectively, news of victories on various fronts is frequently reported. Various salvation and charitable organizations are becoming more excited and working harder. The enthusiasm for charity sales and donations on the island last year was remarkable, and it is believed that all sectors can still recall it. Vendor Chen Xin, since September 18th last year, has voluntarily donated 50 cents as capital for long-term charity sales. From then until May 13th of this year, during the eight months, he has worked hard without slacking off, and therefore has been able to earn hundreds of times the profit. Chen's sales methods are very clever. He sets aside 30 minutes of work every day from 12:30 to 1:00 PM. This time is the Tai Koo Shipyard workers' quitting time. He constantly hawks beef jerky to the workers, rain or shine. His patriotic spirit and arduous efforts are truly commendable. All his earnings from charity sales are donated to the Chinese Women's War Relief Association. As of yesterday (the 13th), the eighth installment of eight dollars was delivered, bringing the total to two hundred dollars. It is believed that future results will be even better. A record of the donations in each period is as follows: First period, October 14, 27th year, six dollars; Second period, October 28th, ten dollars; Third period, November 17th, eighteen dollars and thirty-three cents; Fourth period, January 6th, 28th year, forty-eight dollars and forty-five cents; Fifth period, February 11th, thirty dollars; Sixth period, March 24th, forty dollars; Seventh period, April 27th, twenty-six dollars and twenty cents; Eighth period, May 13th, eight dollars. In addition, public bonds were purchased for thirteen dollars and two cents, totaling two hundred dollars in charity sales profit.

### Chinese Women's Association Donates Ambulance Yesterday; Wang Zhengting Receives on Behalf of the Red Cross

The Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association recently resolved to donate an ambulance to the Chinese Red Cross. It has now been prepared, and a donation ceremony was held at 3:30 PM yesterday in front of Queen's Building. Those attending the donation ceremony included Mrs. Lo Man Kam, Dr. Ho Ai Ling, and the association's chairwoman Mrs. Li Shu Pei, Cao Xiuqun, etc. Wang Zhengting, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Ruiheng, and Wu Changyao also personally attended the reception. The atmosphere was very lively. At 3:30 PM, Mrs. Lo Man Kam handed the donation certificate to Wang Zhengting, and gave a speech. After the speech, commemorative photos were taken and the ceremony was completed. Afterwards, the association set up tea and refreshments to entertain the guests. Cao Xiuqun, the chairwoman, gave a welcoming speech. After the speech, Dr. Wang Zhengting rose to give a speech, saying that he felt very honored and grateful to be able to attend this meeting. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, both men and women in our country have participated in the war effort. However, some elderly people, although eager to go to the front line, do not have the strength. We must know that there are many ways to help the country. The strong can go to the front line, while the old and weak can contribute manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the country in the rear. The association currently has seventeen or eighteen medical teams serving in the front, with a total of about a hundred people. However, the disaster areas are so vast that seventeen or eighteen teams are not enough. I hope that we can organize three or four hundred medical teams in the shortest possible time to rescue wounded soldiers on the front line. If soldiers on the front are injured in battle, then rescuing them will make their hearts even more courageous, which will greatly enhance the strength of the war effort. Victory in the war requires unity and organization. Although your association is donating one ambulance today, if each organization donates one, given the large number of organizations in Hong Kong, the number should reach over a hundred. Our association currently has one hundred and forty-two ambulances serving on the front lines, and we urgently hope to reach two to three hundred. If we can complete this task, foreign friends will see the strength and spirit of unity of our compatriots and will naturally increase their trust. The future of the war will be even more promising. After the speech, the tea party ended.

### The Governor's Speech

The Governor praised the good achievements of the Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Brigade in the past year and especially commended the spirit of service of the ambulance brigade members. He said that the most commendable achievement of the St. John Ambulance Brigade in serving the community in the past year was its service to refugees in November last year. At that time, the Japanese army was active on the Sino-British border, and countless men, women, and children fled into the Hong Kong border, causing considerable disorder. The St. John Ambulance Brigade provided valuable assistance at that time, such as treating the sick, caring for refugees, and serving in the Shenzhen refugee camp. Even when the Shenzhen refugee camp was bombed by Japanese planes, the St. John Brigade members remained steadfast in their positions, assisting doctors in rescuing the wounded and sick. Their spirit is commendable. The brigade has also established a maternity clinic, benefiting pregnant women in the area. In addition to serving refugees, the St. John Ambulance Brigade also engages in social services in Hong Kong, such as vaccination, cholera prevention injections, and surveys of the homeless. Their work is commendable. The Governor believes that the St. John Ambulance Brigade needs to be expanded and said that the government has paid attention to this and will appoint a special person to be responsible for organizing a nursing team to cooperate with the Air Defense Controller so that in times of emergency, each district in Hong Kong will have its own rescue personnel, so as not to cause disorder. Finally, the Governor appealed to the community to provide financial assistance to the St. John Ambulance Brigade.

### Chatting about Hong Kong and Kowloon Herbal Tea Shops

— Bai Ying

The Only Place for the Proletariat to Linger After Work

It is generally estimated that the proletariat in Hong Kong accounts for at least 80% of the total population of over 1.2 million. Because there are so many proletarians, merchants plan for their lives and have restaurants and teahouses specially designed for them. And that "herbal tea shop" which is different from ordinary teahouses was also born in such a social background to meet the needs of the small citizens.

If we pass by the front of a herbal tea shop, the first thing that catches your eye is a two-foot-high brass gourd placed on a wooden stand. A newcomer to Hong Kong may not know what is in the gourd, right? In fact, the gourd contains more than a dozen kinds of "fresh herbs." Like bitter herbs, devil's claws, or cogon grass, bamboo leaves, etc., boiled into tea. Because of their "cooling" medicinal properties, Cantonese people call them "herbal tea."

More than ten years ago, these herbal tea shops were all simple. In a narrow or half of a shop, a few wooden chairs and wooden stools were placed to do business. Some were so simple that they set up a stall on the side, with a few bowls and a few earthenware pots on top, without chairs. The customers stood in front of the stall, drank it haphazardly, dropped a copper plate, and left. Later, those bosses who were good at doing business, with unique ingenuity, expanded their business and rented a larger shop. A long dining table was placed in the center, and neat wooden stools were arranged on both sides. Beautiful paper lanterns were hung on top, and a gramophone was set up to play records. One or two female employees were hired to entertain customers. With a completely new look, they opened up in a decent manner. At the same time, because most herbal teas are bitter, the emerging herbal tea shops also sold some cheap candies. The combination of bitter and sweet really attracted the small citizens. The sky was clear and bright, and the seats were full. Customers were like clouds. Once this trend started, in less than half a year, jealous colleagues imitated each other and competed to decorate lavishly and hire young and beautiful waitresses to attract customers.

Since then, herbal tea shops have become the only place for small citizens to relax. During their leisure time after work, as long as they have a few dimes in their pockets, they can come here and linger for a whole evening. Here, they can enjoy both Chinese and Western popular songs and admire the charming "tea flowers." They sit on both sides of the long table, looking so carefree, sipping a mouthful of herbal tea and chewing on a piece of candy. When they feel like it, they tease the waitresses to make them laugh, or talk nonsense about national affairs. In this way, they can sit from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, until they have dissipated the fatigue of the day and satisfied their subconscious interests, before leisurely returning home.

Some have taken a different approach. They hire a storyteller to sit high in the middle of the hall, slowly smoking and talking about "Five Tigers Pacifying the South" or "Yue Fei Sweeping the North." Others hire a commoner to sing Yangzhou opera, which can also attract customers.

The location of herbal tea shops is naturally not on Queen's Road Central or in the luxury district, but in areas where the hard-working masses and lower-middle-class citizens gather. In Hong Kong, there are already more than a dozen along Hollywood Road, from the Yaumati Street to the Dajie. Wanchai's Cross Street and Spring Garden Lane are also places where they make money. In Kowloon, there are at least thirty or more along Shanghai Street and Temple Street.

The names of herbal tea shops are mostly "Master Xiqiao," "Master Luofu," or "Master Gengtian," etc. The meaning of such naming is to indicate that he is a genuine "countryman" and that the herbal teas made by the villagers who gather authentic herbs in the countryside are the best.

In addition to herbal tea, herbal tea shops also sell "turtle jelly," which is almost the case everywhere. "Turtle jelly" is made from golden coin turtles and Smilax glabra. It is said that it can not only clear toxins and remove dampness, but its greatest effect is to treat venereal diseases. Therefore, they do not have to worry about not having customers.

Some herbal tea shop owners are also doctors who know a few herbal remedies and treat rare and difficult diseases. They hang up signs with a few herbs and a "secret recipe," and also open a fresh herbal medicine shop, where they sell herbs and boil herbal tea.

Don't underestimate their small business, in fact, it is a very good business to run. In the summer, the top few shops can have a business of 180 dollars a day. Calculating at a profit of 70%, they can easily make a profit of fifty or sixty dollars a day. It is said that many have bought good land and built houses.

The reason why the herbal tea shop business is so prosperous, in addition to the above, is some irrational rumors. There is a lot of sulfur in Hong Kong's soil, and drinking Hong Kong's water can easily cause fever, so you must drink herbal tea several times a month. In this way, how can the herbal tea shop business not be prosperous?

### × Planes Bombed Swatow Again Yesterday; Authorities Hastily Handle Aftermath and Provide Relief; Plan for Distributing Relief Funds for Refugees Determined; Population Effectively Evacuated; Women and Children Forcibly Removed from City

(Special Dispatch from YouTou) Today (the 14th), more than ten × planes, in batches, raided Chaozhou and Shantou, five planes attacked Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Chao'an, and three others flew low over the north and south ports of [blank space] Island to conduct reconnaissance, lasting more than two hours. Another three heavy bombers intruded into the city's airspace and dropped more than ten bombs in the area of Fuping Road and Hanti Road. Many houses near the water company's reservoir were destroyed. The homes adjacent to the Bingba Ice Factory and the Yong'an Hall Xinghua Newspaper on [blank space] Hanti Road were also destroyed, resulting in significant [blank space] losses. Fortunately, most of the citizens were evacuated, so there were only a dozen or so casualties. Currently, the × aircraft carrier is still anchored off the coast of Chaoyang, and several destroyers and transport ships are cruising the waters of Chengshan and Shantou.

Relief for Displaced Refugees

Today, × planes bombed Chaozhou and Shantou, causing numerous casualties. Upon hearing the news, Chairman Li Hanhun urgently allocated 5,000 [blank space] to Shantou to comfort the people. Mr. Zheng Zijia, a Chaozhou native residing in Hong Kong, also donated 2,000 [blank space] to provide relief to the victims, totaling 7,000 yuan. After receiving these relief funds, the Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Headquarters has now decided on the distribution method: 1. All disaster-stricken areas in Chaozhou and Shantou will be included in the relief effort. 2. The distribution method is as follows: For each death, 30 yuan in national currency will be provided, totaling approximately 3,000 yuan in national currency (any surplus will be used to subsidize the evacuation of the population). A subsidy of 1,000 yuan will be given to hospitals, with medical [blank space] accounting for 60%, subsidies for living expenses for the injured accounting for 20%, and pensions for the disabled accounting for 20%. Compensation for destroyed shops will be capped at 2,000 yuan, but only for those with total [blank space] less than 500 yuan. Compensation for 10% of the destroyed [blank space], and 30% for compensation for destroyed [blank space] (if insufficient, it will still be allocated proportionally). Approximately 1,000 yuan will be used for [blank space] evacuation expenses. 3. Subsidies for hospitals will be managed by the Health Department of the Shantou Municipal Government, in conjunction with Shantou Hospital, Gospel Hospital, Tongji Hospital, the health team, the Chao'an Red Cross, and Jieyang [blank space] Hospital. Relief for deaths and compensation for destroyed shops [blank space] will be handled by the Relief [blank space] Committee. Compensation for [blank space] evacuation will be handled by the Women and Children Protection Association in conjunction with the police department.

Forcible Evacuation of Women and Children

The evacuation of women and children has shifted from persuasion to coercion. Starting today, all Shantou police officers will be mobilized to forcibly evacuate women and children from the city. The deadline for completing the evacuation of women and children remaining in the city is the 20th. The methods are as follows: (1) Regardless of gender, all individuals aged 60 or above and 15 or below, or regardless of gender or age, those without occupations or official duties, are designated as the standard for mandatory evacuation. (2) If elderly and weak individuals who meet the evacuation criteria are found not to have evacuated, they should be taken to the respective branch offices to inquire about the reasons and ordered to provide a written guarantee to evacuate within two days. (3) If the elderly and weak population still delay evacuation after providing a written guarantee, the township offices or local teams may order the police to take them back to the relevant branch offices for detention and forcibly deport them within 24 hours according to their original residence. (4) The forcibly deported elderly and weak population should be escorted by [blank space] soldiers to [blank space] the transportation company and [blank space] leave the territory free of charge (until the vehicle leaves the district). (5) Unemployed individuals who are suitable for evacuation but refuse to comply, male individuals will be registered by name and organized into a transport team or stretcher team for front-line work, and female individuals will be organized into a laundry team and assigned to laundry work at the front line.

### Shantou Chamber of Commerce Asks Again for Allocation of Tax-Free Imported Foreign Rice

(Shantou News) Shantou's 600,000 metric tons of tax-free rice have reached the full quota, but the severe rice shortage has not been slightly reduced. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the layers of meaning, appealing to transfer the remaining 100,000 metric tons of the 700,000 metric tons that were previously reduced for tax-free import to enrich the people's food. The original telegram is as follows: Shaoguan separately presented it to Zhang, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th War Zone, Li, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Wu Junjian, Director of the Shantou Municipal Government of the 5th War Zone Wartime Grain Management Office. According to the submissions from the Shantou North and South Port Transportation and Sales Industry and the Grains Industry Association, Chaozhou and Shantou have always been short of food, and this year's rice shortage is especially [blank space] severe. Previously, the Ministry of Finance was requested to allocate 700,000 metric tons of tax-free imported foreign rice to the Chaozhou Customs, which was a small amount. Then, the Food [blank space] Management Office reduced it to 600,000 metric tons, which was even more insufficient. Now, more than 500,000 metric tons of foreign rice have been transported into Chaozhou and Shantou and sold to the mainland, and it will soon be sold out. At this critical time of the war of resistance, the local people's food must not be lacking. I respectfully request that the reduced 100,000 gongzu be transferred to the Chaozhou Customs for import to enrich the people's food and other situations. It has been verified [blank space] that it is true that it will take two months before the early rice harvest. The amount of rice stored is really difficult to use. I should report to the electric pole for identification and verification, and beg to allow the Chaozhou Customs to transport the 700,000 metric tons of import as originally scheduled to reassure the people. Hes [blank space] Qi Tao, Chen Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shantou City Chamber of Commerce, Kowtows,

Movies and Drama

### Satirizing Dictatorial Countries: A New Trend in Hollywood Cinema; Expanding from the Silver Screen to the Broadway Stage; RKO's Pioneering Work Already Released

Hollywood's movie audiences will temporarily forget the youthful love stories on the screen, because a batch of new films from general film companies are focused on those who discriminate against those who are different, especially the encirclement of Hitler, which is particularly obvious. From Chaplin to Warner Bros., they will all put Hitler's madness on the screen and point out that he is despicable and ridiculous.

RKO's "They Made Me a Spy" has already been released in the United States as a pioneer, and the story of the film is about foreigners doing secret work in Washington, clearly targeting Germany.

Warner Bros.' "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" seems to be the most powerful blow in Hollywood's attack on privileged people, pointing out that Hitler sent people to the United States to spy on military secrets and organized the National Society [blank space] in major cities, and also pointed out that Hitler's henchmen were scattered on ships in various European countries and used German ships as communication. There is a "character" in this film who goes to Europe on a [blank space] German ship in New York, and as a result is detained in a Nazi concentration camp.

Van [blank space] S. Yang is a producer who [blank space] contributed to Christman Taylor's short story Address Unknown and is preparing to immediately [blank space] make a film. This novel was first published in magazines. After the single edition, it has sold a lot in the United States. The story depicts a German and a Jewish man who jointly run a business in art goods. The Jewish man is in charge of the branch in New York, while the German is in charge of the business in Berlin.

Chaplin's short beard in "The Dictator" undoubtedly symbolizes Hitler first.

In addition, there are more anti-Nazi films in the planning or production, and this atmosphere has expanded from the screen to the stage. The costume maker Wei [blank space] Michael is scheduled to stage the play "I Killed a Jew" in Vienna on Broadway this summer.

Recently, the situation in Europe has been very tense, which has resulted in the [blank space] production of Paramount's "Air Raid" film, which has had to be delayed. The main reason is that several exterior scenes need to be shot on location in Europe, putting the situation of how people in various countries escape into the basement after hearing the alarm [blank space] on the screen. However, since Hitler destroyed [blank space] Czechoslovakia, the company has received news that London, Bar [blank space] and Brussels and other places, for the sake of the situation, underground homes have been regarded as forbidden areas. Photography is not allowed, so the [blank space] production of the film "Air Raid" can only be put on hold for the time being.

Movie Novel

### Selling Flowers

— Pygmalion, an export from MGM Studios, original work by George Bernard Shaw, starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.

In certain aspects, Professor Henry Higgins didn't resemble a professor at all. In fact, he had a high and broad forehead, filled with intelligence. His thin face always showed a stern expression. This sternness, combined with the tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses he occasionally wore, made him look even more like a scholar. However, his eyes held a kind light, and when he smiled, the sternness vanished.

He was indeed a professor, a renowned professor of phonetics. His monumental work, "Higgins' International Alphabet," was known worldwide, making him an authority on standard English pronunciation. In his house on Wimpole Street, he had a comprehensive laboratory with various machines for recording and analyzing speech sounds. He had taught the accurate pronunciation to the wives and daughters of wealthy men.

He had an interesting hobby, also his second boast: he could tell where a person was born in England from their speech, with an error margin of no more than six miles. If it was a Londoner, he could pinpoint the exact street they were born on. Last night, while waiting for a taxi outside Covent Garden with Colonel Pickering, he inadvertently pointed out the street a young flower girl was born on.

The poor, dirty flower girl initially stared at him in surprise. After a while, she became embarrassedly angry.

Because he carelessly said to Colonel Pickering, "Oh, listen to that voice—thinking she'll suffer for life! Hmph, in three months I can teach her to speak like a member of polite society, pretending to be a duchess to meet government ambassadors!"

He said this without realizing the implication. Today, as he led his guest Pickering to view his sound laboratory, he may have completely forgotten about the events of yesterday. Both were focused on the complex and interesting experimental electrical equipment. The air was filled with a monotonous buzzing sound from the equipment.

"How is it? Are you tired of listening to these sounds?" Higgins finally asked.

They were silent for a moment. Pickering lit a cigarette and said, "I really can't distinguish any difference in those sounds."

"Oh my," Higgins exclaimed, both embarrassed and surprised. He smiled and pointed to a recording machine with a speaker for Pickering to see, then pointed to a small Buddha statue that appeared to be used for setting things up, saying:

"Secret speaking tube." Before he finished speaking, someone knocked on the door. He called out, "Who is it? Is it Mrs. Pearce?"

The housekeeper said, "Sir, there's a young woman outside who wants to see you, a very ordinary girl. I originally intended to refuse her, but because..." She sighed, "You sometimes receive strange guests."

Standing at the door was a girl, her slender figure dressed in an ill-fitting cheap black dress. The dress was too tight, which only highlighted her youth.

### Finnish Baseball Included in World Games Demonstration, Cycling Race Route Length Decided to Be Extended

(Helsinki News) Finnish baseball (Posa Pallo) was invented by Mr. Pikkarainen. Its gameplay is similar to American baseball, but its rules are simpler. Currently, over 100,000 people in Finland enjoy this new game. It is said that the World Games Organizing Committee has included Finnish baseball as a demonstration event. Participants in the Finnish baseball demonstration game will be the top two teams from the Finnish league.

The long-distance cycling race for next year's World Games was originally set for 119 kilometers. After discussions between the International Cycling Union and the World Games Organizing Committee's cycling group, it has been decided to extend the race to 188 kilometers. The race route will still be on the roads near Helsinki. It is said that the route is a 94-kilometer loop, which needs to be completed twice to finish the entire race.

The nurses' school, which will serve as a dormitory for female athletes, has been under construction for some time, and the entire project is expected to be completed by April 1st next year. It has eight stories and is equipped with modern facilities, accommodating 550 female athletes and staff. During the games, a post office and telephone exchange will be set up in the dormitory to facilitate communication for athletes from various countries.

[Helsinki, Finland, New Fortune News] It is estimated that at least 300,000 spectators will attend the 1940 World Games. Therefore, the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee has expanded the grandstands around the venue. Temporary sales outlets have been set up under the grandstands. Currently, primary and secondary schools in Helsinki are actively training for the mass games, with an expected 10,000 students participating in the grand event.

### Establishing a United Front of Sports Friendship (Part 2)

— Chen Suixian

Many sports enthusiasts still hesitate and waver. On one hand, they admire the sports of Germany and Italy. On the other hand, they praise the sports of the Soviet Union. This contradictory phenomenon stems from a lack of understanding of the essence of sports, assuming that the sports of Germany and Italy are the same as the sports of the Soviet Union. This is because past sports were not closely linked to social sciences. The sports propaganda of Germany and Italy is "sports for national defense," and the sports propaganda of the Soviet Union is also "sports for national defense." Everyone knows that a country with aggression comes before a country with national defense. In reality, who is for sports for national defense speaks louder than words. Were Abyssinia and Albania not destroyed by the fascist aggressors of Italy? Were Austria and Czechoslovakia not destroyed by the fascist aggressors of Germany? Therefore, sports and politics have a cause-and-effect relationship. We cannot yet tell who is right here. If we proceed blindly, we risk becoming lackeys of fascism. This is because the sports promoted by fascism are used to destroy human peace, focusing on military sports to strengthen aggression, and training aristocratic sports athletes to compete for national championships. The recent centralized training of Italian tennis players is an example. If these athletes can dominate the world in the future, they can become international professional tennis players and bring glory to the country. This is the purpose of fascist sports training. In contrast, the sports of the Soviet Union are popular among all people. Whether in cities or rural areas, everyone has the same opportunity to enjoy training. The nationwide broadcast of morning exercises is a good example. The Soviet Union has never been seen to concentrate on training athletes to participate in any international championships. To those championship enthusiasts who do not understand the essence of sports, this is truly inexplicable.

Anyone who thoroughly understands the truth of sports knows that sports training is the starting point of all life, the starting point of all society, and the starting point of humanity's conquest of nature. ×××××××××××××××××××××× The income from a single tennis or boxing championship match reaches hundreds of thousands of dollars. Any athlete who can participate in the competition becomes a member of the property-owning class! Can such sports be considered the starting point of life? Can they be considered a productive element of society? ××××××××××××××××××××××××

We must know that China is an agricultural country, a society of farmers. ×××××××××××××××××× It is also a country where education is not widespread. Any aristocratic championship-oriented sports are absolutely unsuitable. Not only are they unacceptable in the objective environment, but they also deepen contradictions. ××××××××××××××××× However, I believe that many of my readers share the same sentiments. Let us, through the light of reality, rush to the verdant fields of friendship. No spiritual force in the world can be isolated from reality. "Friendship" is no exception. However, our current friendship is different from the kind of friendship that was promoted during the "May Fourth" Movement, because the social environment we are in is completely different from the past. Precisely because of this difference, we must encourage each other to grasp the truth of realistic sports and strive together. We must also quickly seize sports to cooperate with this great national liberation war, and at the same time, broadcast the truth of sports to the whole country.

At this difficult time when our nation is on the brink of extinction, we must, regardless of class or faction, forge a united front of ironclad friendship under common interests and common goals. (End)

### New Teas From Various Regions Are On the Market, Concentrated in Hong Kong for Export, Implementing Inspection Standards and Penalties to Improve Quality and Enhance Reputation

After the Trade Commission took over the management of national tea sales, it promulgated inspection standards and penalties for the collection and inspection of export tea by the responsible authorities in order to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market. New teas from various regions are now on the market. Inland teas are allowed to be transported internally after the foreign exchange is settled in accordance with the law. Export teas are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. The details are as follows:

New Teas On the Market, Implementation of Management

Pihong from Anhui, Ninghong from Jiangxi, Wenzhouhong from Zhejiang, Huhong from Hunan and Hubei, Jianhong from Fujian, as well as Pingshui green tea from Shaoxing, Anhui, Luzhuang green tea, Wulong and Longjing tea from Huzhou and Hangzhou have successively been put on the market. Tea farmers are picking and manufacturing them in groups. However, since the Trade Commission and other agencies have taken over the management of national tea, these agencies will continue to implement management this year. (1) Export tea is required to be concentrated for export in Hong Kong and is strictly prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. (2) Inland tea is allowed to be transported freely, but foreign exchange must be settled in accordance with the law.

Improving Quality, Enhancing Reputation

The Tea Inspection Office issued a notice regarding the new tea on the market, stating that tea inspection is originally intended to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market. Tea merchants understand this well and process and manufacture tea meticulously. Many teas meet the inspection standards. However, there are also many who seek immediate private gain and produce substandard products. Such tea merchants are clearly destroying regulations and hindering the sales of Chinese tea as a whole, which will have a significant impact on the future of Chinese tea if not strictly prohibited. Therefore, this is a serious warning. Those who do not comply will be punished according to the law without leniency. All tea merchants must comply without fail. This announcement is hereby made.

Penalties for Violating Inspection

Penalties for violating tea inspection standards: (1) Inland tea is absolutely not allowed to be colored. If export tea uses colorants, light and non-toxic colorants should be used. Those that are heavily colored or contain toxic substances will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (2) Tea that is insufficiently roasted or becomes damp during transportation, has been stored for too long and become moldy, has no aroma, or is cloudy and detrimental to health will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (3) Tea that contains fake leaves or other impurities that are detrimental to health will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (4) Tea that is over-roasted and has a strong burnt taste will be confiscated and destroyed by burning. (5) Tea with excessive moisture, exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-processed. (6) Tea with excessive powder (excluding tea dust), exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-processed. (7) Tea with excessive stems (excluding tea stems), exceeding the specified limit, will be ordered to be re-sorted. (8) Packaging that does not meet the regulations will be ordered to be re-made.

### Massive Import of Japanese Flour Affects Shanghai Flour Industry, Monopolizes Wheat in Occupied Areas, Shanghai Flour Mills Forced to Order Foreign Wheat

(Shanghai News) Shanghai has always been the center of the flour industry in the country. After the war, the massive import and dumping of Japanese flour led to the loss of the flour market in North China. At the same time, the monopoly of wheat in the occupied areas forced Shanghai flour mills to order foreign wheat to be transported to Shanghai for supply. The details are as follows:

Shanghai is the Center of the Flour Industry

Flour is one of the main food crops in our country, especially for the people in the north, so the demand is very high. There are a total of 93 mechanized flour mills in the country, spread across various provinces and cities. However, the largest supplier is still Shanghai. Of the national mechanized flour exports through trading ports, those exported from Shanghai account for 96%. Therefore, Shanghai is not only the center of the flour industry in the Yangtze River basin, but also the source of supply for flour nationwide. There are a total of 15 flour mills in Shanghai. The annual flour production is 10 million quintals, accounting for more than half of the national production. After the war, factories in the occupied areas were forced to shut down. Those that managed to continue operating were Fuxing, Beixin, and a few others. The flour production was greatly reduced compared to before the war.

Japanese Flour Import Monopolizes North China

After the war, foreign flour took the opportunity to import and dump. In 1938, 2,547,783 quintals were imported, valued at 52,985,269 yuan. In the first quarter of this year, 413,543 quintals were imported, valued at 7,820,964 yuan. Japan accounted for the most, followed by the United States, Australia, and Canada. North China, such as Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Qingdao, was originally a sales area for Shanghai flour. After the war, the import and dumping of Japanese flour affected the area, and North China was occupied by the Japanese flour market. As a result, the northern sales of Shanghai flour decreased, and the North China market was flooded with Japanese flour, such as Green Real Ship and Green Bamboo brands.

Shanghai Factories Forced to Order Foreign Wheat

Shanghai flour mills used to rely on Hebei, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the surrounding areas of Shanghai for their raw material wheat. Today, affected by the Japanese monopoly, they have no choice but to order foreign wheat to be transported to Shanghai for supply. Imports have been made in installments since January of this year. According to customs reports, imports in the first quarter of this year were 1,014,650 quintals, valued at 8,120,464 yuan, all from the United States and Australia. As for the import of wheat in 1938, it only totaled 27 quintals, valued at 611 yuan. The sharp increase this year is due to the Japanese monopoly of wheat in the producing areas. Shanghai flour mills have been actively purchasing foreign wheat.

### A Literary Controversy: Basketball Community Requests League to Sanction Lo Chun-hsuen; Evening Championship Game May Not Be Held

In this year's Open Men's Basketball Tournament, during last week's match between Sing Tao and South China, Sing Tao won 31-29. However, South China appealed, claiming that Sing Tao's two points were due to a premature whistle blow. The Basketball League Council decided and both sides agreed to replay the game tonight at 8:30 PM, with the original staff officiating the game to determine the championship winner. This was the proposal decided on the evening of the 12th. However, after Lo Chun-hsuen's "strange article" was published on the 13th, questions arose regarding Lo Chun-hsuen's amateur status, raising doubts about whether he would participate in tonight's game. Strictly speaking, in addition to Lo Chun-hsuen's article being untruthful, the entire Sing Tao team is suspected of "making false reports," which could result in the loss of their amateur status. (Article 19 of the Amateur Sports Regulations clearly stipulates that "Athletes who make false reports regarding their qualifications, abilities, and achievements will lose their amateur status." The first paragraph of Lo Chun-hsuen's article states that "The championship naturally belongs to our Sing Tao team." In fact, the championship is pending determination tonight.) Therefore, whether tonight's game can proceed as scheduled depends on the League's actions.

Although the basketball community presented a letter to the League yesterday, the first point stated that Lo Chun-hsuen is a member of the Sing Tao team (but not the captain or any official). Although the article contains the phrase "we," it should not be regarded as representing the opinions of the entire Sing Tao team. In this regard, the basketball community only requests the League to sanction Mr. Lo personally and not the entire Sing Tao team. However, until the other team members of the team declare that they are not responsible for this article, they also have joint liability. Therefore, the League should act impartially and not only focus on Mr. Lo personally but also discuss the entire Sing Tao team. The basketball community's request is the public's will, and the League's execution is the law. Since there are existing laws, the scope of people and events, this situation may be excusable, but the precedent should not be abandoned. Enclosed is the basketball community's letter to the League:

Basketball Community's Request to the League to Sanction Lo Chun-hsuen

To whom it may concern:

On the 13th of this month, the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily published an article written by Lo Chun-hsuen titled "Thoughts on This Year's Basketball League," which contains many sentences that insult the entire Hong Kong basketball community and contradict the identity of an amateur athlete. Our teams are shocked and, for the sake of rectifying the discipline, hereby submit a letter requesting a committee to resolve this matter. Our opinions are stated as follows:

1.  Lo Chun-hsuen is a member of the Sing Tao team (but not the captain or any official). Although the article contains the phrase "we," it should not be regarded as representing the opinions of the entire Sing Tao team. Therefore, our request for sanctions is directed at Lo Chun-hsuen personally and not the Sing Tao team as a whole. We request that the League consider this.

2.  The article written by Lo Chun-hsuen contains the following: "This year's basketball league has come to an end. Although the championship belongs to our Sing Tao team, we don't feel much interest because for the past five years, our group has occupied the top spot in the Hong Kong basketball scene."

As of today, this year's league has not yet concluded, and the championship is still in question. However, Lo Chun-hsuen claims that it already belongs to "us" and says that he "doesn't feel interested." His contempt for the entire Hong Kong basketball community is evident in his words. The last paragraph of the article states, "As for the International (the character 'international' ['際'] should be a mistake for 'local' ['貨'], but the original is 'international') Cup, we have decided not to participate in the competition, so let's give this trophy to others for some comfort." It is as if no team besides those that he added to the teams are participating in the competition could win the championship. Moreover, the implication is that those who are comforted are so because of the trophy, which he already regards as worthless. These words are inconsistent with his actions (the joy and jumping at the sound of the final whistle in the games against Eastern and South China are still fresh in everyone's minds) and show contempt for any basketball team in Hong Kong. The purpose of sports is to strengthen the body, and the goal of competitions is to increase competitive interest. If it were as Mr. Lo says, then the other teams in the basketball community would only participate in the cup competition with the championship as the goal, and without the championship, they would not be "comforted." The Sing Tao team members are the only ones who are "moved by the enthusiasm of Mr. Hu Hao, the manager of the Sing Tao Daily." Furthermore, there are also the following: "We don't find the term 'champion' strange at all," and "Therefore, this year's league, we originally wanted to hand over this four-year-old child to others to manage, just like sending him to kindergarten." Treating the championship term as not "strange" and regarding other teams as "childish" are self-aggrandizing, boastful, and disparaging to any team in Hong Kong. These are "arrogant words" never seen in the basketball community and shameless words. Therefore, Lo Chun-hsuen's deliberate insult to the entire Hong Kong basketball community should be sanctioned by your committee.

3.  According to Article 21 of the Amateur Sports Regulations promulgated by the China National Sports Association in 1931, "Amateur athletes may not concurrently serve as reporters for newspapers and receive money from them in the sports competitions they participate in (or in a part of the competition)." The Sing Tao Daily on the 13th clearly stated, "Special Writer of this Newspaper—Lo Chun-hsuen." According to journalistic practice, special writers must receive monetary compensation. Lo Chun-hsuen, as a special writer for the Sing Tao Daily, must be receiving salary or compensation and also serves as a reporter for the newspaper in the public basketball game he participated in (i.e., writing this article). Furthermore, Article 19 of the Amateur Regulations stipulates that "Athletes who make false reports regarding their qualifications, abilities, and achievements will lose their amateur status." Lo Chun-hsuen, claiming to have won the championship before the championship is resolved, is in clear contradiction with the Amateur Regulations. Your committee should immediately revoke his amateur status to prevent others from following suit and rectify the discipline. We request that the League consider this.

Based on the above reasons, we hereby submit this letter requesting that your committee sanction Lo Chun-hsuen, revoke his amateur status, and we ask for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted by the Hong Kong Basketball League, South China Athletic Association, Eastern Athletic Association, Chung Sing, Pui Ying, Sing Tao, and Hong Yuen.

### On Death

— Zeff

Death, originally, can be divided into heavier than Mount Tai and lighter than a feather. What is meant by heavier than Mount Tai is nothing more than "sacrificing one's life for righteousness, giving up life for justice." Only by being able to die in this way can one's name be recorded in the history books, shine with the sun and moon, and coexist with heaven and earth. Although dead, it is like living, hence the saying "heavier than Mount Tai."

But achieving benevolence and taking righteousness also seem to have a process. That is to say: one should sacrifice one's life when it should be sacrificed, then it can be called achieving benevolence; one should give up one's life when it should be given up, then it can be called taking righteousness. If one rashly sacrifices one's life, it may not be possible to achieve the goal of achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. There are two stories in Mencius that illustrate this point, I will first quote them below:

"When Zengzi was living in Wucheng, there was a raid by the Yue bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming, why not leave?' Zengzi said, 'Do not house people in my house, or damage their firewood.' When the bandits retreated, Zengzi said, 'Repair my walls and houses, and I will return.' When the bandits retreated, Zengzi returned. The people around him said, 'We treat you, sir, with such loyalty and respect. When the bandits came, you were the first to leave, to be a role model for the people. When the bandits retreated, you returned, which is almost impossible.' Zengzi still did it and said, 'This is not what you know. In the past, Shen Yu once said of the disaster of Fu Chu, "Those who followed the teacher were seventy people, and none of them were involved."'"

"When Zisi was living in Wei, there was a raid by the Qi bandits. Someone said, 'The bandits are coming. Why not all leave?' Zisi said, 'If I, Ji, leave, who will guard the ruler?'"

Mencius said: "Zengzi and Zisi follow the same path. Zengzi is a teacher, a father, and a brother; Zisi is a minister, and is humble. Zengzi and Zisi, if they were in each other's place, would all be the same." This is to say that being a teacher and being a minister are different. So when the bandits come, one can leave, but the other cannot leave, because Zengzi is only a teacher, without any weapons. Even if he sacrifices his life, it cannot be called achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. Zisi, as a minister, should forget himself for the sake of the country. Even if it comes to sacrificing one's life, he can still achieve benevolence and take righteousness. Therefore, Mencius criticized them, believing that Zengzi and Zisi's paths were actually the same, and if the environment changed, both of them could do the same.

Someone might say: In this case, only ministers sacrificing their lives can achieve benevolence and take righteousness; commoners, even if they sacrifice their lives, are not achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. But this is not the case. Zhuge Liang said in the Later List to the Emperor: "I will exhaust my efforts and die thereafter." Wen Tianxiang said in his self-eulogy: "Only when righteousness is exhausted can benevolence be achieved." These two "exhaust" characters are really worth our attention. The word "exhaust" is tantamount to indicating to people a positive meaning. We must actively work hard for the country, and only after exhausting our efforts can we die. Before exhausting our efforts, we really do not need to die, and we cannot die. Wen Tianxiang and the Yuan minister Boluo argued, and there is a paragraph that can be annotated for us. The original text is as follows:

Boluo said: "And tell me, did any minister in ancient times hand over the ancestral temple, city, and land to another country, and then run away? Is there such a person?" I (referring to Wen Tianxiang) said, "Those who offer the country to others are treacherous ministers. Those who sell the country do so for profit. I resigned as prime minister the other day and did not accept the position. I was sent to Boyan's army front and was detained. Then, a treacherous minister offered the country, and the country was destroyed. I should have died. The reason why I did not die was because Emperor Duzong's two sons were in eastern Zhejiang and my old mother was in Guangdong, so I went there." Boluo also said, "What功勞did you do when you established two kings?" I said: "The country was unfortunately lost. I established a ruler to preserve the ancestral temple. To preserve it for one day, then the ministers will do their duty for one day. Where is the merit?" Boluo said, "If you know you can't do it, why do it?" I said: "Ministers serve the ruler as sons serve their fathers. If the father unfortunately falls ill, even if it is clear that it cannot be done, how can there be no reason to prescribe medicine? I have done my best. Today, Wen Tianxiang is here and will die. Why say more—"

The so-called "should die but did not die" is because a ruler can still be established to preserve the country: the so-called "know you can't do it, so必做" is because as long as the country exists for one day, you must do your duty as a minister for one day. You cannot have negative thoughts because the country is destroyed, and you cannot lose your active heart because things cannot be done. Only when your heart and strength are exhausted, then you can die. This is the so-called "when you should die, you do not die, and you do it when you can do it; when it is really impossible to do it, then you die." (From Xu Youren's Preface to the Biography of Wen Chengxiang of the Yuan Dynasty) This kind of death is upright and honest, with a long-lasting spirit, heavier than Mount Tai, and worthy of our praise.

Today's China is in an era of arduous resistance. Everyone must be able to maintain this positive concept, putting the country and nation above all else, and making military victory the first priority. Swear to achieve it, persist to the end, then the resistance war will surely be won, and the nation-building will surely be achieved. The so-called "should die but not die, and do it when you can do it." Knowing that the environment is difficult and the work is not easy, if you try to get out of this environment and go to a place of harmony, and strive to work, you must not have negative thoughts. Taking death as bravery and giving up life as justice is a loss that does not outweigh the gain, which is neither beneficial to oneself nor to the country. It only makes a meaningless sacrifice, which can only be regarded as a sign of cowardice. Because I am moved by the news in the newspaper about those who are unwilling to sell out and often commit suicide, I wrote this to give further advice to those who stay on the isolated island.

### Waves

— Liu Zheng

In small rivers, within ditches. The filthy, stagnant water is the most disgusting thing on earth. There, only bacteria are jumping, larvae are singing, and green duckweed and blue reeds will never accompany them.

In lakes, in rivers, the quiet flow of water, the murmuring sound, seem to have little vitality. The space is too lonely, too deep! Staying there, aroused infinite laziness.

What is most worthy of praise is the wave in the river and the sea. It is so vast, and the sound of waves hitting the shore is even more magnificent—

This symbolizes life, a beautiful life, which should have the perseverance of waves. It will not be so quiet, without sound, and forgotten by the world—

In the sea woven by waves, the aquatic creatures that live there all have strong strength!

Waves after waves are rolling on the water surface, and the beautiful spray will not be stopped by any force.

Waves are the rare miracle in the world!

### Oath

— Liu

Imagining myself walking alone in Peach Blossom Spring or inviting myself to travel in Shanghai; concluding my thatched cottage in an unknown place, like a reclusive scholar. This often makes me wander in the confusing road for a long time.

But the whip of reality cruelly strikes from behind, startling me from my dream. Raising my head, I am deeply amazed. How vast is the world? What is life? Is life a dream?

The sharp hook at the bottom of the question mark grabs my mind, so I carefully look for the answer. I start to learn, to learn how to live.

A friend said, "I am seeking a change. Come and take my crutch!" But, where should I 朝述述? Extending a helping hand to the world, who will lead me onto the avenue of life?

Isn't it shameful to live in the pity and sympathy of others? I hesitated again. I withdrew my hand, but I started to walk. I want to rely on my own strength to walk. The road to truth will never lack like-minded partners. But we should not always stretch out our pale hands to others. If we are tired, we will fall. What does it matter? We have already exhausted our last breath for opening the way. One drop of blood is a mark in history. A complete page is made up of accumulated traces.

Discard the gray lenses of those who look backward. Do not remember yesterday. Do not bitterly mourn and regret the passing of what. Why always wander in the old courtyard, being someone who lingers on the scenery of the past?

We must learn to discard the ugly legacy left by the past, grasp today, and not let go of every moment in a sigh. Tomorrow will be a new day, with joy, with happiness, with a sunny day, which is an oath.

### The Gate of Struggle

— Wang Qing

At dawn, a few sparse, light-colored morning stars still hung in the sky. The earth was shrouded in a layer of mist. Around me, there were only unclear houses and the outlines of streets. People were still in warm dreams, waiting for a loud sound to wake them up.

The steady and resolute footsteps of a young man echoed in the air. His face was submerged in the mist. He stopped in front of an open door and glanced at the wall. On both sides of the wall were the two large characters "Struggle." Without hesitation, he wanted to raise his foot and step into the door. Suddenly, an old man with white hair appeared in the door and stopped him with his hand. Clear words came from the old man's mouth.

"Hey! What are you here for?"

"I want to enter this gate of struggle." The voice was as calm as a waveless sea, deep and clear. One word was said intermittently, "To struggle"!

The old man's face was solemn: "Every day, I don't know how many people come here, but many of them go in and come back out... "

"No, I will not come back, unless I get what I want. I came here with the greatest determination."

"What are you going through? Is it like them, to gain survival and liberation in this 'struggle'?"

"Yes, that's what I want. We have been bullied too much by others. We must wake up and give tit for tat. They did not recognize us before, but now there is new life, get up and struggle."

"Struggle, you have to know that this is not something you can just say. You look inside, this is true. Ah! Here! Here there is only death." As he spoke, the old man opened his body.

He poked his head in and took a look. Inside, the ground was covered with bright red and purplish-black blood, and piles of white bones were scattered around. Even more so, cries of agony, curses, and angry voices were mixed together, making it feel very gloomy and frightening. But he was not afraid. No, he had already seen the light behind it. He said even more resolutely and calmly,

"Death and bloodshed do not make me feel cold. In order to seek survival and liberation, death and bloodshed are necessary. I have long abandoned this."

"Death and bloodshed do not make you wary. But you turn around and look. Your mother, brothers and sisters, and lover at home are anxiously waiting for you to return, to give you comfort, to give you love; and the beautiful music, the fragrant wine, they are also waiting for you to enjoy. All this is so lovely, why not go back there?"

"Enjoy? Enjoying is not the time now. Let those things go to 　　. As for my relatives, I think they will soon come to this gate of struggle, for their survival and liberation. All love grows in the gate of struggle."

"Young man, come in—I wish you victory, and I will always bless you, may you succeed."

The young man gratefully stepped into the gate of struggle. Looking inside, suddenly all the gloomy things disappeared, and blood-red flowers were blooming everywhere, seemingly nodding and smiling at him.

He looked up again: light was rising in front of him.

### Dapeng Bay

— Yu Ren

People say you are a large 　　:

Blue sea water

Ripples with the blue sky,

White seagulls are in the waves

Flying quietly,

The surging waves wash away

Silver white 　　灘,

In the dense forest on the mountainside

Lurking

Zero Department village.

People say you are Dapeng 　,

Are the pirates on the sea

The place where they come and go,

The pirates roam around you

Waving 　　旗,

Looting, massacring, burning,

Making waves 　一般

Loud laughter,

They put

On the waves, on the beach,

In the woods, in the village,

To draw their barbaric

The pattern of aggression.

Dapeng Bay,

Let anger ignite the beacon on the sea! 　Let anger set off a shocking storm!

Now, the people on the bay

Have already united!

They gather:

Old 　, cannons, hoes, 　刀.

Prepare to strike those

Roaming on the sea

Let the bandits know in the battle—who is the master of this bay in the end

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

The sounds of footsteps in the corridor constantly disturbed their uneasy hearts; it was as if any detective or gendarme could walk into every room in the city for a case, and now, they were about to be inspected. If they were caught an instant before they left, how would they answer the armed comrades in the field? Therefore, Yuwen paced back and forth anxiously, just like when she first arrived at his home, finally, he went to hold her hand – this was the second time. Before he could speak, she asked:

"Do you want to shoot me again?"

"Ah, Zhulin, don't be like this! Listen to me—"

"I won't listen, I won't listen, not at all—" She was extremely angry. Hitting his chest, she also shouted: "You forced me here with a gun, force me back with a gun again!..."

"When you came, it was because you were an outsider. When you leave, you are already our comrade; our guns are not prepared for our comrades."

"I don't care!..."

"Zhulin, listen! Listen to me, the reason for you to go home is, for example, if you don't go back this time, it doesn't matter, we also hope you can work with us immediately. However, you should consider that your father will definitely think we have harmed you and taken his money—"

"Then I can write a letter to tell him!"

"No matter what, he can't get you, and his money is wasted, isn't that right?" She nodded, indicating she accepted his opinion.

"If we need to do the same thing again for money in the future, because of your influence, which family would be willing to spend money to hire people again? Isn't that right?"

She didn't want to nod again to indicate agreement, but the logic of his words prevented her from denying him.

"You are a smart sister, you should understand our difficulties. You are a good comrade, you should help our work, shouldn't you?"

She nodded again, indicating that she agreed with his opinion.

"Then, you go home now!"

However, she cried bitterly. Because she had obeyed everyone else's reasons in everything, and violated her own wishes.

Finally, she had no choice but to leave, she said:

"Alright, I believe you—"

So, he cheered up and hurried to wipe the tears from her face, and helped her put on her coat. She couldn't bear to leave the room and stopped for a long time. She asked him:

"Can't I stay one more night?"

"No. Go on."

"But I hope to see you again in the future!"
