### China's Creditworthiness and British and American Interests

On the 15th, our Ministry of Finance announced measures for debt repayment, stating that debts guaranteed by customs duties would no longer be advanced for repayment, but only allocated according to the proportion of customs duties from non-war zones. It is noted that most of our government's foreign debts and indemnities are guaranteed by customs duties; domestic debts are either guaranteed by salt taxes or consolidated taxes, and newly issued domestic and foreign debts are mostly guaranteed by direct taxes such as income tax; and the Unified Rehabilitation Loan and the Gold Bond, etc., are also guaranteed by customs duties. Now that our country no longer advances foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, it seems that it will affect the interests of Britain and the United States; on the other hand, it seems that our country's creditworthiness will also be questioned. We are willing to take a purely objective position and make a rational analysis.

First, the foreign debts managed by the Ministry of Finance and guaranteed by customs duties (as of January 1, 1939) include the Reorganization Loan, the Anglo-German Continued Loan, the British Boxer Indemnity, and the Sassoon Huai River Loan, totaling £24,611,367; and the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, totaling £25,546,000. It can be seen that the result of the Japanese seizure of customs duties is a loss to Britain and the United States, not to our country, especially the damage to Britain is the greatest. Recalling that in 1938, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Horiuchi discussed the disposal of Shanghai customs duties, and the Anglo-Japanese Agreement on our country's customs duties concluded on May 3 stipulated that all customs revenues under the control of the Japanese military would be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, and from this deposit, the amount of foreign debt to be repaid would be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fulfill the obligations of foreign debt and indemnity guaranteed by customs duties. However, in fact, after the agreement was signed, only one million yuan of the Reorganization Loan was repaid, and other foreign debts were not repaid at all. At that time, Britain was satisfied with this agreement, so that even though our country protested, it was still unable to freely dispose of the tax funds. Therefore, although the motive for our country's refusal to advance debt guaranteed by customs duties today does not include the meaning of resistance, it cannot but be regarded as legitimate in law.

Second, our government has made its best efforts in recent years to maintain the creditworthiness of foreign debts. For example, in October 1936, the reorganization of the Fickes Aircraft and Marconi Wireless loans, and in April 1937, the Chicago Bank Loan and the Pacific Development Company Loan were successively established for repayment, designating salt tax as collateral. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all customs revenues in the war zone have been seized by Japan and deposited in Japanese banks, so that the accumulated amount of debt due but not paid by the war zone customs, which was transferred by our government to the Central Bank for advance payment, reached as much as 175 million yuan, which shows that our government is still trying its best to maintain creditworthiness during the war. Since the customs duties have been seized by Japan, making it impossible for our country to fulfill its debt repayment obligations, the essence is not that our country wants to default on its debts, and naturally there is no obligation to advance repayment.

Third, the Ministry of Finance's refusal to continue advancing debt guaranteed by customs duties is not due to any flaws in our country's war-time finances that make it impossible to maintain creditworthiness. The starting point is entirely a self-defensive economic war to prevent Japan from using our country's financial resources as a tool for aggression. Therefore, after doing its best to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States for a time, it can no longer maintain the interests of Britain and the United States while at the same time supporting [Japanese aggression]. Therefore, this is a necessary measure during the war, and the reason is not financial. In September 1938, our country temporarily suspended the repayment of the principal of the Crisp Loan and the Anglo-French Loan due to Japan's interception of all salt taxes in the war zone, which was also the same reason.

Fourth, although our Ministry of Finance does not allow further advance payment of debts, it is still doing its best to maintain creditworthiness, in order to prevent the interests of Britain and the United States from being damaged. The Ministry of Finance's statement has clearly stated that in the future, for all long-term debts borrowed before the war guaranteed by customs duties, the amount due will be allocated to the Central Bank on a regular basis according to the proportion of customs revenues from non-war zones. If the customs offices in the war zones hand over the arrears of indemnity payments that have been deposited to the Inspector General of Customs as before, our government will still allocate debt funds as before to restore the pre-war situation. Therefore, if Britain and the United States do not maintain their interests in the Far East, but are determined to maintain their interests in the Far East, they should urgently cooperate to restrain Japan, so that our country's customs administration is independent and fully free, which indirectly means that their own interests can be reasonably maintained and protected.

In short, our country's decision not to advance debt guaranteed by customs duties this time is not due to the difficulty of war-time finances affecting the maintenance of creditworthiness, but entirely the result of Japan's seizure of customs revenues, which is in fact beyond reproach. We only hope that the British and American countries can have a more detailed analysis and a more profound understanding of the overall situation in the Far East for their own interests, realize that their claims are in danger due to Japan's aggression, no longer ignore them, and unite to sanction Japan with more effective measures, and act with the utmost speed. Only in this way can their claims - all interests in our country - be reasonably maintained and protected!

### Research on Anti-Aggression Tactics

— Chiang Kai-shek

And Other Important Tasks for Improvement of Units (4)

To obey orders and proceed accordingly is to find the path to survival; to disobey orders, to outwardly comply but in reality not execute them, is to find the path to death. If we soldiers do not obey orders, do not earnestly execute orders, the personal injustice of losing our lives is a small matter, but harming our superiors, harming our subordinates, harming our allied forces, and consequently harming the nation and its people, and harming generations of descendants is a great crime. Therefore, to fulfill our duties, complete our missions, preserve our lives, and elevate our lives, we can only obey orders and thoroughly execute orders. Everyone must explain this principle to the general soldiers, and must assist superiors in earnestly executing orders, leading by example, influencing subordinates, and cultivating in subordinates the habit of absolutely obeying orders and thoroughly executing orders. This is the greatest task of our chiefs of staff. Currently, commanding officers at all levels often issue orders casually; the transmission of orders is also often done irresponsibly; as a rule, the commanding officer issues an order to the staff, the staff hands it to a messenger, and the messenger delivers it, considering the matter complete. Whether the order is delivered on time, whether it is executed after delivery, and whether the execution is thorough are all ignored. With such a spirit unable to be instilled, many orders are not carried out, and are even shelved, causing untold delays. Therefore, from now on, we must demand that orders be carried out to the end and earnestly implemented, with strict supervision. The method of supervision may be occasional inspections or periodic assessments, to ascertain whether the orders issued have been faithfully executed and whether the execution has been effective. All urgent orders, or orders delivered to important locations, must have personnel assigned to supervise their implementation. If necessary, our staff officers should personally supervise each unit; otherwise, with the ingrained habits of the general troops, the more difficult an order is to implement, the more reluctant they are to execute it. Would this not mean that the more urgent the order, the more likely it is to be mishandled, especially for guerrilla warfare and special operations? If no one supervises the orders, you can order them to engage in guerrilla warfare, but they might not attack. The malpractices are even worse! Therefore, for important orders issued to various guerrilla teams and special operations teams, the headquarters must send personnel to supervise them, so that they can be thoroughly implemented!

Third, we must emphasize the education of messengers and communications personnel, and pay attention to sealing off news from the war zone. The education of messengers and communications personnel in the troops should follow the principles of "swiftness," "accuracy," and "secrecy." The transmission of orders and the relay of information should take "swiftness," "accuracy," and "secrecy" as essential requirements. If it is not secret, the contents of orders and communications can easily be leaked; if it is not accurate, there may be errors or omissions, and the recipients of orders and messages will be at a loss, or even execute them incorrectly; if it is not swift, it will not save time, and may even delay opportunities. Therefore, the transmission of orders and communication within the troops must be carried out in accordance with these three principles, and must be done in a solid and reliable manner, without the slightest negligence or delay. To achieve this, we must pay special attention to the technical training and spiritual education of messengers and communications personnel. In terms of technology, they must not only be proficient, but also strive for perfection, and be able to conduct on-the-spot research and make discoveries; in terms of spirit, they must be able to fulfill the requirements of swift, accurate, and secret transmission of all orders and communications, not only in places where traffic is convenient, communications are easy, and order is peaceful, but also in situations where traffic is difficult, equipment is simple, the war situation is urgent, time is pressing, or enemy fire is fierce and passage is difficult, they must be able to complete their tasks in accordance with the above three principles! If this cannot be achieved, it will affect military affairs and lead to defeat. Everyone should recall the losses suffered in the half-year of resistance since the start of the war because of delays in the transmission of orders and inadequate communication. Although there were many reasons for our past failures in the war of resistance, a detailed examination reveals that delays in transmitting orders and communications were a major cause. In particular, slow transmission, failing to strictly adhere to deadlines, caused the greatest harm. We must understand that our fighting is a race against time. Whichever action is quick and seizes the opportunity first will be victorious, and the opposite will be defeated. To be quick in action and save time, we need agile transmission and communication without any delay. This is the most important thing related to the success or failure of the war of resistance, and everyone must pay close attention to it. As for sealing off news, it is to prevent all news and information from our side from being leaked. Therefore, there must be strict organization and training of the people in the war zone and the rear, and the military and civilians must cooperate to eliminate all traitors and spies of the aggressors, so as to achieve the goal of strict blockade!

Fourth, we must study the performance of weapons and master the skills of using them. The most common shortcoming of today's general troops is that they do not know the performance of new weapons, resulting in improper storage and unskilled use. Even if they have new and sophisticated weapons, they cannot exert their full effectiveness. Often, a weapon can be used by foreign troops for two or three years, but when it gets into our hands, it breaks after only one use; when others' weapons break, they can immediately repair them themselves, but our officers and soldiers mostly lack the knowledge and skills to repair equipment, and even abandon them when they break, without even trying to repair them! Furthermore, the same weapon can be used skillfully by others to maximize its effectiveness and unleash its power, but when it gets into our hands, its effectiveness is reduced and its power cannot be brought into play because of unskilled use. If this shortcoming is not effectively improved, the future of the war of resistance is truly dangerous! In the future, to reorganize the troops and strengthen their combat power, we must pay attention to the study of the performance of new weapons and the training of usage skills. Whether it is rifles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars, or various cannons, after receiving them, our chief of staff must first gather officers in charge at all levels for careful research and practical testing. They must fully understand the performance of each weapon and the methods of using it, and must stipulate detailed methods for storage and use, to train the general officers and soldiers. During training, we must be realistic and strive for perfection, explaining things clearly and then asking questions, practicing well and then mastering it. If practice during the day is not enough, we must also practice at night, striving for pure skills and proper use. To ensure accuracy, our commanding officers must select several soldiers from each regiment every week for face-to-face testing and detailed guidance, so that all officers and soldiers in the entire army can be familiar with the performance of various new weapons and have proficient skills, so that they can exert the effectiveness of new weapons!

Fifth, intelligence must be accurate and plans must be thorough. The biggest bad habit of today's troops is inaccurate intelligence, incomplete plans, embellished accounts of battles, and false reports of victories. And the root of the problem lies in the word "hypocrisy." With this word of hypocrisy in their minds, all kinds of ills arise! In the future, to improve the ingrained habits of the troops, we must first break down hypocrisy and demand reality in everything, especially for our staff personnel in charge of intelligence and planning, who must take "reality" as the only principle for managing their work. For all information about the enemy, whether it is a report or a notice, we must strive for accuracy; with accurate intelligence, plans can then be thorough; with thorough plans, there will be confidence in battles. For example, when we win a battle, we must report truthfully about where we advanced, where we occupied, how many we captured, and how many we lost; or when we lose a battle, we must report truthfully about how many officers and soldiers were wounded or killed, how many weapons were lost, where the enemy advanced, where our troops retreated, and the reasons for victory or defeat, without vague terms or any exaggeration or cover-up. When our reports are truthful, we will have an accurate estimate of our own strength, and we can accurately understand the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the troops. Then we can give full play to our strengths, make up for our shortcomings, assess the situation, and win victories. Everyone must understand that when we went to war with Japan this time, we were inferior to them in terms of military preparations and material resources, but what did we rely on to dare to fight against them? What we relied on was the word "reality," this spirit of "reality." We relied on the truly practical awareness of the entire nation, gathered the strength of the whole country, to break the enemy's conspiracy of hypocrisy, deception, aggression, and oppression. This is to "attack falsehood with reality," to "rectify evil with righteousness," which is what is called a real war! It does not matter that our national power is weak and our resources are poor, and it does not matter that we lose battles and retreat from our positions. If we know that our national power is weak, we have ways to turn weakness into strength; if we know that our resources are poor, we have plans for poverty. As long as we can be practical, exert real strength, seek truth from facts, not boast when we win, not conceal our defeats, observe the real situation, make practical plans, speak truthfully, do practical things, and fight real battles with real strength, we can overcome all difficulties and turn defeat into victory! When you return to your troops, you must tell your commanding officers these words of mine. In the future, whether it is self-cultivation, managing affairs, leading troops, or fighting battles, everything must be practical. If we can carry out the spirit of reality, we will definitely achieve final victory!

Sixth, we must pay attention to the protection and inspection of warehouses, food, and ammunition. Food and ammunition are vital to the lifeline of the army, and we must always estimate the needs of the front line and make full preparations. We must also order our subordinates to take good care of them, and not allow them to be lost, damaged, or wasted. This is another of the most important tasks for our chiefs of staff. In particular, we must inspect the warehouse in various places on time, and accurately count all the stored firearms, ammunition, and food as a basis for assessment.

Seventh, we must pay attention to preserving old uniforms. Now in wartime, the national economy is very difficult. In peacetime, troops' uniforms can be issued according to regulations, replacing the old with the new. In the future, due to a lack of materials, it is not known whether they can be issued on time. Therefore, officers and soldiers must pay attention to preserving the cotton uniforms, cotton coats, military caps, and leggings that they take off, and must inform the general officers and soldiers that each set of uniforms must be used for at least two years during wartime, and the cotton clothing that is taken off this time must be kept for wearing this winter. When winter comes, they will not be issued again!

Eighth, we must cherish mules and horses. The horses of the cavalry and the pack animals of the transport teams are the most needed tools for combat, and we must take special care of them. Whether marching or camping, we must take care of them thoroughly. Every day, we must wash and groom the horses on time, and feed them grain and water on time. Especially on long marches, the burden must not be too heavy, water must be supplied on time, and when marching and camping, we must also urge the soldiers to wash them thoroughly; only after the mules and horses have been washed can the soldiers rest. Currently, the soldiers in various troops do not cherish mules and horses at all, either letting them die of hunger and thirst, or overburdening them to death. All kinds of negligence and carelessness harm the transport tools, which harms the army's transport. In the future, our officers must take the spirit of "diligence in small matters" and "love me, love my dog" to supervise our subordinates and improve this.

The above-mentioned matters regarding the improvement of the troops are all based on actual situations and opinions obtained by synthesizing reports from various parties. After everyone understands them, they must take them back to the troops and earnestly improve them accordingly. I have spoken a lot about the other matters that should be improved in the troops in the collection of lectures on the Review of the War of Resistance and the Essential Secrets of Certain Victory. Everyone must also take them all and study and implement them. In addition, everyone must also examine each of the instructions and orders related to tactics, strategy, and the improvement of the troops issued by the Military Commission in the past, and study them and assess them from beginning to end. In addition, the operational experiences and opinions presented by officers from various places and foreign advisors have been compiled into booklets, which have been distributed to everyone today. Everyone must also study them carefully, which will greatly benefit staff operations and the future of combat!

In short, the situation of the enemy aggressors is now caught in a dilemma. The further they advance, the more their forces are dispersed and the more difficulties they face, and the easier it is for us to eliminate them. Moreover, we see that their military discipline and morale are so bad that they cannot be remedied, committing rape, murder, arson, and looting, doing everything without any humanity! They also said that they would rely on superior weapons and rush headlong to eliminate us. They really despise us to the extreme and are arrogant to an unparalleled degree! With such licentiousness, greed, and cruelty, their spirit cannot but be decadent and their will cannot but be weak. The corruption and weakness of their army can be imagined from this! No matter how good their weapons are, it does not matter! In the future, we must tell the general officers and soldiers about the aggressor's fraudulent, arrogant, and corrupt situation, and raise our spirit of attack. Can't our revolutionary army block this army of beasts and this corruption and defeat them and annihilate them? Since the start of our war of resistance, the capital has fallen and even the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen is not protected. Our compatriots in the occupied areas such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, and Taiyuan are suffering the aggressor's brutal killings every day, living an inhuman life. Our soldiers are truly ashamed of their consciences! Especially as commanders-in-chief, we have an undeniable guilt for the great humiliation suffered by the country and the great calamity suffered by our compatriots. The ancients said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every man." How much more so for us soldiers! We must engrave it in our hearts, sleep on brushwood and taste gall, to avenge the country and avenge the dead soldiers and compatriots! I believe that everyone shares this feeling! I hope that everyone will tell this intention to the general officers and soldiers, so that everyone knows that if they do not kill the aggressors and defeat the aggressors, not only the compatriots in the occupied areas will suffer the aggressors' brutal killings, but also all the people of the country in the future, even our own parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, wives, children, relatives, and friends, will suffer the aggressors' humiliation and slaughter. In any place, we will have no place to stand and no place to be buried. If we do not give our lives on the battlefield now and die for the country, we will only regret it for the rest of our lives and will have no chance to serve the country again. Whether for public or private reasons, for the country or for ourselves, we must be determined to "either have the aggressor or have me, either have me or have no aggressor," know our shame and be determined to fight to the death to win our country's independence and the survival of our nation! (The End)

Letter to the Editor: Requesting Guidance from Mr. Zhang Junmai by Lin Beili

Greetings to Elder Junli: Since coming west, I have long wanted to visit you, but due to being tied up with affairs, I have repeatedly failed to do so. Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper a piece entitled "An Open Letter to Mr. Mao Zedong." Upon reading it, the words were lengthy and the sentiments were heavy, truly the words of a benevolent man. However, a student like Beili, after repeatedly reciting it, found much that she did not understand, and secretly suspects that what the elder says will not only be insufficient to move Mr. Mao, but will cause those who are enthusiastic about the war of resistance and unity not to weaken their beliefs because of Mr. Mao's report, but will instead cause a gradual increase in suspicion and friction because of the elder's letter, and even intensify. The impact may be more than the elder says: "energy is consumed in suspicion and friction." If so, then the elder may also regret his rash words, but it will be too late!

The elder's letter lists three points, which can be summarized as all being intended to support the central government and consolidate its authority. It is a pity that what is said is mostly contrary to the facts, not only is the theory not perfect, but also because the facts are distorted. If, unfortunately, those who do not read the elder's letter well mistakenly suspect that the anti-war military and political affairs are not unified and unreasonable, then the authority of the central government will be weakened, and the division of factions will be deepened. As the saying goes, "There is nothing wrong with the world, but mediocre people trouble themselves," which is not the original intention of the elder when he wrote this letter!

The elder said: "The army should belong to the country, and the army should not be associated with particularism." This is wrong. Any country in the world must have a way to establish itself, and the way to establish a country is ideology. Therefore, the army can be a tool of the country on the one hand, and on the other hand, it must be able to fight for the ideology that establishes this country. Only then will the army have value, and the bloodshed of its soldiers will not be a meaningless sacrifice. If it is only proclaimed that "the army should belong to the country," then the state of Manchukuo also calls itself a country, and has obtained the recognition of the German state that the elder worships. Should we also lead our army to belong to it? Not only that, but the puppet organizations in Central China and North China also claim to represent the Chinese state. Should we also lead our army to belong to them? If we do not ask about the ideology that establishes the country, but only ask whether it belongs to the country or not, it will inevitably lead to the sacred army that defends the country, and all foreign invaders and rebellious traitors who usurp the country can use its power to achieve their goals. How dangerous this is! Has the elder ever thought about this? Or is ideology not something special? The so-called special and correct are only from the opposition of objectivity and subjectivity. Moreover, the Republic of China is established on the basis of the Three Principles of the People, which is known to the world. The elder must want the army of the Republic of China not to belong to the Three Principles of the People but to the empty and boundless country. Those who know may suspect that the elder is negligent in choosing his words, and those who follow him may even suspect that the elder is close to advocating for Japan, Manchukuo, and puppet organizations, and opposes the Three Principles of the People and the Republic of China, which are unanimously obeyed by the whole country. Even if the elder is given the name of a general who touches the army, it is not impossible. I don't know how the elder can explain himself? "Communism is the ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the practice of communism." Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, often earnestly told his comrades in the Kuomintang several times. The elder still has things to say. "Seeing a camel and being frightened by a horse with a swollen back" is like this? At this point, Beili sighed even more that the elder is truly worthy of being the leader of the state and social parties that he spread and arranged. It is appropriate that he does not know what the Three Principles of the People are and does not know what communism is.

The elder also said that the border area government is like a separatist regime, which is even further from the facts. The origin of the original border area government is due to the situation of mutual dependence between the people and the military in the north after the war of resistance. Everyone in the occupied area knows this, and everyone praises its system. Therefore, this is a product of wartime, not a permanent organization that will not change. Even now, the central government recognizes it in fact, and also knows that it is beneficial to the war of resistance. Moreover, the word "border area" is added to the government, and it also receives assistance from the central government at the same time. Even in terms of name, it is already the same as the provincial government, municipal government, and county government of the central government. If, as the elder said, should all the provincial governments, municipal governments, and county governments of the Republic of China be abolished as well? Those who know know that it is impossible. Therefore, the elder's so-called separatism is also "shooting at a target that does not exist."

Finally, the elder questioned the Communist Party's efforts in the national struggle as abandoning class struggle, and then said that "it is better to put aside the teachings of Marx for the time being." This is even more laughable. For a party of one class, a party with internationalism, to advance together with parties of several classes to engage in a country's external struggle, this has its supreme significance. What is the significance? Today's war of resistance, on the surface, is only a country's external struggle, but in reality, this country's struggle is not just a struggle between one country and one nation against other countries and nations, but also a nation that bears the obligation to struggle for the peace of all the world's nations on the basis of its own and national liberation, and to further develop this epoch-making mission. The world's most oppressed proletariat will naturally be liberated when this great mission is completed. Those who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism should do everything they can to achieve it. This is one: Secondly, the so-called "put aside for the time being" is certainly something that politicians and bureaucrats are good at doing, but those who are loyal to a certain ideology or truly believe in a certain theory will not bear to say this. Moreover, to treat the Chinese Communist Party today in this way is not only disloyal to communism, but also untrustworthy to the Kuomintang. If the elder expects the Communist Party to be supervised by the disloyalty and untrustworthiness of politicians and bureaucrats, what will the countrymen and gentlemen think of the elder? This is two: As for the elder's intention in this letter, there may be entrustment, and the words are not entirely fair. Those who are slightly aware of the political situation today can know this in detail, which is not something that a woman dares to know. Only because my late father was close to the elder in Japan, and my family often praised the elder's love of learning, I forgot my own shallowness and dared to ask you something. I hope the elder will think about it again, then the war of resistance will be fortunate!

Respectfully submitted by your niece, Lin Beili

Two: A Series of New Experiences and Lessons

In this struggle where the × people launched a large-scale siege against the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region and the entire military, government, and people of Jin-Ji-Cha crushed the × people's massive siege, we have indeed gained many new experiences and lessons. These are described in detail below:

Regarding the × People:

The × people's siege of the border region was due to the consolidation and expansion of the border region, the resilience of its armed forces, and the repeated failures of previous offensives. Therefore, their strategic and tactical approaches were more thorough, planned, cautious, and persistent than before. The main manifestations are as follows:

(1) "Political Capital" and "Appeasement Policy"

First, before the × people launched this siege of the border region, they first conducted sufficient preparatory work. Not only did they gather their forces on each offensive starting line, conduct mobilization for the siege, and strengthen morale, and drive traitors and bandits to create disturbances in the border region and act as vanguards for the offensive against the border region. They also created many rumors among the people, deceived the masses, used airplanes to distribute various leaflets, and promoted the so-called "New People's Morality." They also engaged in mad dog-like scolding and slander against our anti-× political elbows and various anti-× parties, attempting to create "political capital" for the offensive against the border region among the people, provoke discord among the parties, military, and people of the border region. At the same time, perhaps because the × people already felt that relying solely on military offensives, cruel burning, killing, suppression, looting, and poison gas attacks could not conquer the Chinese people's consciousness of resisting ×, they also adopted an "appeasement policy" in this siege, carrying out the work of "consoling" the farmers. Therefore, the × people's political conspiracies and sabotage in this siege of the border region were more severe than in previous sieges.

(2) Thorough and Cautious Combat Deployment

Second, they mobilized over 50,000 elite troops, strengthened their technical weapons, and formed a number of detachments, each ranging from 2,000 to 7,000 troops. Taking the four railway lines of Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Tongpu as starting points, they adopted a "separate advance and convergence" deployment, launching a large-scale encirclement attack on the center of the border region. However, because they feared being defeated individually by our army, each detachment was mostly composed of a mixture of various arms, possessing independent combat capabilities. Moreover, close coordination was maintained between detachments, maintaining mutual response and cautious action, no longer like the past when isolated troops went deep.

(3) "Step-by-Step Advance" and Strong Depth Deployment

Third, when the × people's detachments advanced towards the border region, they generally adopted a "step-by-step advance" approach. When advancing from one stronghold to another, if our army was discovered, they only advanced ten or eight miles a day. Upon arriving at a location, especially the troops attacking key transportation points, they first constructed strongholds, repaired city walls, and mopped up nearby anti-Japanese forces, making defensive advances and retreats to prevent attacks by our army. For example, the × advancing from Datong, Yangyuan, and Yuxian had conducted a lengthy mopping-up operation in the Sanggan River valley. The × entering Quyang, Daying, and Fanshi also stopped construction work. At the same time, to prevent us from breaking through a part of them, prevent guerrillas from threatening their flanks and rear, and destroying rear communication lines, their advancing troops also mostly adopted a strong depth deployment.

(4) Rapid Communication and Mobilization, and Continuous Supply

Fourth, the × people's detachments mostly advanced towards the border region along transportation routes and worked hard to repair the automobile roads of various key lines to ensure the smooth flow of their rear communications. Rapid communication and mobilization, and continuous supply, have almost become an important part of the × people's offensive. × National Assembly member Ozaki once said, "The most important condition for defeating China is that the rear is not cut off." The × people know that the people in the border areas have already carried out tense combat mobilization and thorough clearing of the fields and emptying of houses. It is impossible to loot the people's property to supply the troops' provisions, especially the necessary supplies for the technical guards, and there is no way to obtain them. Therefore, every time they arrived at a stronghold, they immediately connected the automobile roads of each stronghold and stored provisions and ammunition to maintain them for a long time. If they encountered mountainous terrain, which was difficult to repair the automobile roads at once, they changed to carrying them in large quantities. The × attacking Wutai from Meng County carried over 100 mules and horses, or used airplanes to transport them. However, these methods are ultimately limited.

(5) Divide the Border Region and Attempt "Area Sweeps"

Fifth, the × people know that the border region has a vast territory and possesses the strategic advantages of the two major mountain ranges of Wutai and Hengshan. The border region's armed forces have rich experience in guerrilla warfare and mobile combat, and strong combat capabilities. It is impossible to "annihilate" all the main forces of the border region's army in one fell swoop. Therefore, they attempted to use a large force to penetrate deep into the border region along the main transportation lines, dividing the entire border region into many small pieces, in order to reduce the maneuvering ground of our army, make our actions inflexible, disperse our forces, and weaken our army's mobile forces. Then, they would proceed to carry out "area sweeps" to achieve the goal of annihilating our active forces or causing our army to transfer to other areas. However, this goal has never been achieved because the × people were constantly attacked by our army.

(6) Assembled Actions, Echeloned Advance, and Poison Gas Attacks

Sixth, although the × people knew that our army's equipment and firepower were weaker than theirs, they were deeply afraid of our army's sudden attacks. Therefore, each detachment of the × people mostly took cautious assembled actions, meticulously guarding against attacks, firing guns and artillery everywhere, conducting powerful searches, deploying a part of their forces to advance, while the rest of the main force adopted an echeloned formation. When our army was discovered, they used powerful and dense firepower to suppress us, stubbornly resisting, or breaking through a point. In times of crisis, they often used poison gas attacks and used a number of aircraft to cover and bomb our army's positions, dropping poison gas bombs. If the main force of our army was discovered in one direction or was attracted by it, the detachments in other directions could also flexibly make rapid advances.

(7) Deception and Suppression Go Hand in Hand

Seventh, with the progress of military offensives, the × people's political offensives also became very active, adopting an "appeasement policy," buying over and deceiving, creating discord and spreading rumors, promoting "Eastern Morality" and "New People's Morality," undermining our national unity. On the one hand, they actively "destroyed" all anti-Japanese organizations, suppressed the people's anti-× sentiments, especially suppressed the active anti-× elements among the people and called on the people to return home, attempting to organize maintenance associations and puppet vehicles.

(8) Burning, Killing, Looting, and Poisoning are Carried Out Simultaneously

Eighth, they carried out large-scale burning, killing, and poison gas attacks, in an attempt to carry out large-scale economic destruction. Not only were the people's grain, agricultural tools, and houses mostly burned, but livestock were also mostly killed and looted. Moreover, they adopted vicious means to destroy finance, release poison, inject poison needles, use airplanes to bomb everywhere, create a terror situation, and drop poison bombs. When the × people retreated, poison was released along the way, causing a large number of our soldiers and civilians to be poisoned. These means can be said to be the ultimate in brutality, cruelty, and meanness.

On Our Side:

The ferocious × people, relying on their elite and massive military strength, thorough plans, vicious means, and the coordination of the army and air force, launched a large-scale siege against the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region with a fierce momentum. This is indeed a serious situation for the still young Xi-Ji-Cha Border Region. However, the people's government and army of the border region, under firm leadership and close unity, were not afraid of this at all. On the contrary, they have grown, consolidated, and expanded under the encirclement firepower of the × people and in the continuous sieges of the × people, and have rich experience in countering the sieges of the × people. They had long anticipated the inevitability of such a siege by the × people, and they all had the firm determination to defeat the × people's siege and the confidence to persist in combat and achieve final victory. After two months of arduous anti-siege warfare, they once again shattered the × people's siege plan and achieved a glorious and exemplary victory and many valuable experiences and lessons (to be continued)

### Central Government Makes Partial Adjustments, Chongqing Senators Wire Speaker to Express Support

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 20th Special Dispatch] After the Fifth Plenary Session, the changes in the central political institutions were not significant. Xu Shiying's appointment as Vice President of the Executive Yuan seems to have been internally determined. (Editor's note: Mr. Xu is now in Hong Kong. When someone asked him about this, Mr. Xu was still modest.) Zhang Qun was transferred to the position of Secretary-General of the National Political Council, or a vice-speaker will be set up and Zhang transferred to fill it. Chen Lifu plans to resign from one of the two ministries of Education and Social Affairs. The candidate for the successor has not yet been determined.

### A Large Number of Our Heavy-Duty Trucks Waiting for Shipment in Vietnam, Totaling 1,800 Vehicles

[Haitong News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] According to the news, there are currently 1,800 motor trucks in Haiphong that have not been able to enter China due to tariff issues. Among these vehicles, there are 600 German-made and 1,200 American-made vehicles. The local French government levies heavy taxes on non-French-made vehicles.

[Central News Agency Paris 21st Dispatch] Rumors that commercial heavy-duty vehicles and Red Cross ambulances are prohibited by the French government from being transported to China through French Indochina have recently been denied by responsible persons, who said that after Guangzhou City, China, fell in early November last year, the government did indeed temporarily prohibit heavy-duty vehicles from being transported to China through French territory, so as to avoid excessive congestion in the port of Haiphong, but it quickly restored the original state, which has now lasted for more than two months. As for the transport of Red Cross ambulances to China, it has never been subject to any restrictions, and special measures have been taken to facilitate it.

President of Hanoi Chamber of Commerce Speaks Righteously

Vietnam Should Not Discriminate in Transporting Munitions to China Via Vietnam

[Central News Agency Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] According to a Paris telegram, the "Order News" reported that Bafurou, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Hanoi City, French Indochina, recently returned to China and expressed his views to the Colonial Committee of the House of Representatives, advocating on the business situation in the Far East, which has caused a profound impression. The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives have also asked Bafurou to submit a report. Bafurou said that this time he returned to China, he intended to state the common views of Vietnamese merchants and provide information to members of Congress so that they could easily complete their supervisory tasks. In terms of the Far East situation, the Sino-Japanese War has lasted for eight months. Although the two sides have not formally declared war, all important ports in China have been occupied by the Japanese army. In law, there is no state of war between China and Japan, and the third country has no right to maintain neutrality and prohibit private sales of munitions. The Southern Government is still allowing merchants to transport coal and iron ore to Japan, and the reason is that the transport of Vietnamese goods to Japan is considered normal cooperation, so the Vietnamese government should give the same treatment to the transport of goods to China. At a time when British Burma and Yunnan, China, are planning to build a railway, Vietnam should avoid if it insists on its original policy, which is to strangle its own business premise.

### The Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region Shatters the Experience of Being Besieged by the Enemy: A Conversation with a Certain General

[A Report from the People's Revolutionary Society's Frontline Communication] In order to coordinate the capture of Wuhan and consolidate their occupied territories, the enemy mobilized 50,000 troops in late September, based on the four railways of Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Tongpu. They launched a fierce and cruel encirclement and suppression campaign against our model anti-Japanese base area in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, attempting to "destroy" this model anti-Japanese base area in one fell swoop, in order to realize their cunning plan to "mop up" North China. However, after two months of close unity, courageous struggle, and bitter fighting by the entire military, government, and people of our border region, the enemy suffered heavy losses and repeated defeats. The enemy troops that had entered the border region have been routed one after another, and their plan to mop up the border region has been completely shattered. In order to understand the course of this campaign in the border region and the experiences and lessons learned by our army in this campaign, our reporter went to a certain place on the front line and paid a visit to a certain senior military general of the border region who was responsible for directing this campaign, General So-and-So. The following is a transcript of the conversation:

(1) The Border Region is a Thorn in the Enemy's Throat

From a military point of view, the position of the border region has significant strategic importance. It is located between the four railways of Pinghan, Zhengtai, Pingsui, and Tongpu, with the strategic terrain of the Hengshan and Wutai Mountains, encompassing seven or more prefectures and counties and a population of over ten million. Its existence and development poses a major threat and harm to the enemy, increasing the difficulty of the enemy's offensives to the south or northwest. Therefore, the border region is like a thorn in the enemy's throat. At the same time, under its development and exemplary influence, guerrilla warfare has been widely launched in areas such as Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Southern Rehe, and Eastern Chahar, and the work of establishing anti-Japanese base areas is gradually being carried out. This, of course, further expands the threat to the enemy, forcing them to only be able to be trapped along the railway lines and in a few towns. Even the railway lines are constantly being destroyed by us, and the troops traveling back and forth are attacked by us. For example, in Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan, which are in the enemy's rear, we are constantly in a state of war with the enemy, making the Japanese warlords uneasy and the traitors panic-stricken. It is no wonder that Gao Lingwei, the puppet governor of Hebei, lamented that there was "no province to govern." The enemy's military communiqué also put Wutai and Wuhan on par, calling it "north-south coordination to resist Japan."

At the same time, the existence and development of the border region has also generated three major effects:

First, it has won the hearts of the people. We must know that the enemy's attempt to conquer China is not only to seize our territory and eliminate our army, but also to conquer our people's hearts. However, due to the existence and development of the border region, the hearts of the vast compatriots near the war zone and even in the entire North China region have not only not been conquered by the Japanese invaders in the past year, but on the contrary, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the vast compatriots near Tianjin has increased, and the movement to oppose Japan and eliminate traitors has become increasingly widespread. They all hope and believe that our guerrillas will sooner or later come and drive away the Japanese devils.

Second, due to the existence and development of the border region and the widespread expansion of guerrilla warfare, the enemy's goal of plundering the economic resources of North China cannot be achieved.

Third, due to the existence and development of the border region and the development of guerrilla warfare, it is not easy for the enemy to establish puppet organizations and puppet troops. On the contrary, the puppet organizations and puppet troops that have already been organized are constantly being destroyed and disintegrated by us.

It is precisely because the existence and development of the border region has significant meaning and effect in military, political, and economic aspects, and has given the enemy the greatest threat and harm, that the enemy has launched attacks on the border region time and again, attempting to destroy this model anti-Japanese base area and remove this thorn in their throat.

### Madame Chiang's Speech in Chongqing: The War of Resistance, National Reconstruction, and Women

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The Social Hall – Another fervent and grand gathering! The first, unforgettable cry of the "Song of Struggle for Revolution" reverberates in the ears, again and again.

Madame Chiang is giving a speech here today on "The Women's Question in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," starting at three o'clock.

By 2:45 PM, the female compatriots at Jiaochangkou were packed. Cars and rickshaws couldn't get through. There were large groups of pure-hearted youths and students. If this were a movie, it would have been sold out. The scene was both extremely lively and extremely solemn.

Boy Scouts were on duty, guiding the young students, women, and foreign reporters and guests to their seats in the upstairs hall. They were busy getting everything organized, and everything was in order in less than half an hour. At three o'clock, Madame Chiang, wearing a dark coat and full of spirit, gracefully arrived at the venue. She sat down in the chair on the stage, smiling kindly and greeting everyone.

Over two thousand female compatriots from forty-six organizations were gathered in the hall, riveted by Madame Chiang's grace and beauty, and filled with anticipation. There was no clamor or noise; it was quiet, solemn, and somber. Countless spirits were gathered together.

On the stage were Shen Huilian, Zhang Aizhen, Liu Qingjing, and others, accompanying Madame Chiang on one side. The master of ceremonies quickly announced the opening of the meeting. The national anthem was sung, salutes were offered, the Premier's testament was read, and the fallen soldiers and compatriots were mourned in silence. Then, Zhang Aizhen, the director-general of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee, took the stage to deliver a speech. Following her, Huang Peilan, the head of the committee's life guidance group, reported on the work of the committee, providing a very detailed account of the establishment, organization, and work of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee. After Ms. Huang finished her report, Madame Chiang began her speech amidst warm applause.

Madame Chiang was full of energy. As soon as she stood in front of the stage, everyone became attentive, because they were fortunate enough to hear the leader's instructions. Madame Chiang modestly stated that on the day of the Women's Day Flag Offering by all circles in Jiangba during the February 25th Propaganda Campaign, she did not attend because she was not feeling well. But it wasn't entirely due to her health. She said, "I feel very ashamed, because I have not made any contribution to the country, and I am not worthy of receiving your flag offering, so I did not attend." Then she briefly explained the Guidance Committee, saying that "there are twenty or thirty staff members in the Chongqing branch, but they are not afraid of death and hiding in the rear, nor are they here to escape the disaster. The reason is that the rear is more important than the front! In the rear, it is necessary to mobilize, organize, and cultivate new cadres, and someone has to do it. There are more than one hundred comrades in the Guidance Committee in various places, and they are struggling through all kinds of difficulties, serving the wounded soldiers and refugees on the front line."

"The work in the rear, in Sichuan, has already become a center, and now it should be launched and organized immediately!"

"We have more than two thousand female compatriots here, and it is not enough for everyone to participate in the war of resistance. We must also persuade our relatives and friends to participate together. In the next week, each person must persuade ten people, then we will have twenty thousand people working for the war of resistance! If each of these twenty thousand people persuades ten people, then the general mobilization of women across the country will be realized immediately." Madame Chiang reminded the crowd, saying, "Don't think that you have nothing to do with the country. You are all intellectuals and have received more favorable treatment from the country than ordinary people. Your education is the cultivation of the country, and it is the favorable treatment of the common people. The common people have provided you with their blood, sweat, and oil. You should repay them. Working for the country is working for the common people, which is to increase production, increase national wealth, and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, which is to liberate the country and the nation."

Madame Chiang also told everyone many shocking things.

"There is a news item in the newspaper today saying that the enemy is forcibly recruiting prostitutes in the occupied areas. Think about it, who are these prostitutes? They are your mothers, sisters, and also my mothers, sisters. Can we tolerate such humiliation?" "The enemy's plot is not only to annex our land and plunder our money, but also to make our compatriots slaves." Madame Chiang shouted indignantly, "Are you willing to be slaves?" Four thousand angry eyes from two thousand people were about to burst into flames. Everyone shouted, "We are not willing!"

"During the battle of Shanghai, we heard reports that the enemy had grabbed our female compatriots, stripped them of their clothes, and tattooed numbers on their shoulders. On the one hand, they made our female compatriots ashamed and unable to escape, and on the other hand, they used them as their [redacted]. This was discovered at the North Railway Station. Also, our young men were dragged away by them and forced to dig graves. After the graves were dug, they were machine-gunned to death and buried themselves. If they were not killed, they were stabbed with bayonets and kicked to bury our young men alive."

"In Nanchang, I saw tens of thousands of women and children suffering hardships on the road to escape. I felt very sad. Who is suffering for these compatriots? It is also the enemy who harmed them." "But the generals, soldiers, and compatriots I have contacted on the front line, although they are very bitter, they can recognize the enemy, and they all unanimously want to resist the war to the end."

Madame Chiang also cited the tragedy of children in the war zone being bled by the enemy, and the fact that farmers were cooked by the enemy. Everyone who heard this was already filled with anger. At this time, Madame Chiang said again that if we want to avoid being slaves and strive for freedom and independence, we can only resolutely resist the war, and only resist the war to the end.

"When I was running a women's war zone service training class in Wuhan, I lived with the students, mopping the floor, wiping the table, and wiping the glass windows. It wasn't to make people maids or good housewives, but to train them to be hardworking and able to go to the front to serve the country. Now that the enemy is so brutal, then I should resist the war, and resistance will definitely lead to the final victory." At this time, Madame Chiang put forward many conditions for our inevitable victory in the war of resistance.

"Li Zongren's old lady is already seventy-six years old. Once I went to see her and expressed my condolences to General Li for fighting on the front line, but she stopped me and replied sternly; this is the duty of a soldier, and he should serve the country. She also smiled and said that China has 200 million female compatriots, and if they can all participate in the war of resistance, even if they use knives, they can drive the enemy back." Madame Chiang also pointed out that sixteen students from women's war zone services died three and injured two after being bombed by enemy planes in Hengshan. One of the seriously injured students recently wrote a letter asking me to assign her work. Her arm was broken, and she said she could do propaganda work. "There are also many heroic women in the war zone who help the army and encourage the army. In the battle of Taierzhuang, many women encouraged the soldiers, and it had a great effect." Then she said firmly, "This spirit is the spirit of the Chinese nation, and this heroic deed is the representative of the Republic of China. We Chinese should all feel honored and should all rise up!"

"Not only that, but our nation's resilience is also very strong. The enemy tries its best to destroy, but as soon as the enemy leaves, our order is quickly restored. Therefore, our war of resistance is indeed very bright." At this time, Madame Chiang also quoted a famous saying from Western philosophers: "Danger creates great people, and comfort creates monsters" to encourage everyone. She said, "The revival of the country must go through a very difficult process." "Only by restoring self-confidence, advancing bravely, will the war of resistance be victorious. Now, women's circles should especially unite and organize; now, the possibility of our country's women serving the country has not yet been fully developed, and if it is fully developed, it will be much stronger than men. We unite for the government, for the entire country, and we must concentrate our efforts under the major premise of the country!" "Now, as long as everyone takes out a part of their time to participate in the war of resistance, to do the work of saving the people and saving the country, we must concentrate our efforts to think about how to strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. No matter who has his strength, he can save the country!"

The more Madame Chiang spoke, the more excited she became, and the applause of the crowd became louder and louder. Finally, she put forward the actual methods for participating in women's mobilization work today and ended her speech with enthusiastic cheers!

The great and enthusiastic grand gathering ended, but the great women's activities in the war of resistance have just begun. Look, the women of Chongqing have roared under the leadership of Madame Chiang!

### Strengthening Defensive Power in the Pacific: The US Government Decides to Implement Plans for Expansion of Armaments, Aiding Democratic Countries Such as Britain and France

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations today passed a resolution stipulating that member states should consult with non-member states (i.e., other countries directly related to the Far Eastern situation) to consider the issue of assistance to China. In essence, this means that the actions of member states should be coordinated with the actions of the United States. Informed sources here attach great importance to this, saying that the US, British, and French governments have just sent the same note to Japan regarding the Five-Power Treaty. The Executive Yuan's passage of the above resolution at this time is tantamount to giving prior approval to the actions that the US, British, and French governments may take in the Far East in the future.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Regarding the question of fortifying Guam in the Pacific, President Roosevelt clarified the US government's position in a statement to the press, saying that he also supports the bill proposed by Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, which calls for an appropriation of $5 million to develop a harbor, build barracks, and establish an air base on the island. The projects currently planned will be limited to this extent. Whether defensive fortifications should be built on the island in the future, or whether the status quo should be maintained, will depend on how the world situation evolves. As for negotiations with Japan, the government has not considered them. Political figures have interpreted this statement as further evidence that President Roosevelt is determined to implement the national defense plan in a practical manner. The $5 million is not enough to build genuine defensive fortifications. In addition, the Walsh bill calls for an appropriation of $60 million to build air bases on the islands in the Pacific, from the Hawaiian Islands to Guam. This is also the first batch of funding, and more funds will be added in the future to complete the project. In short, this bill has political significance. The US government has decided to expand its influence in the Pacific on an unprecedented scale. The State Department said that if Japan raises objections to the Guam issue, the US government will only consider listening if the nature of the protest is conducive to the establishment of a new agreement. In short, President Roosevelt stated in his message on January 5 that if the expansionist policies pursued by totalitarian states are to be curbed, a firm attitude must be adopted. In addition to moral condemnation of the methods adopted by these countries, energetic diplomatic, military, and economic means must also be used. The majority of American public opinion agrees with this view. The government has now decided to strengthen the defense line from the Hawaiian Islands to Guam. Many countries in the world share the same interests and the same defensive views as the United States (including Britain and France). The principle should be to actively resist totalitarian states, especially to resist Germany and Japan. Supporting these countries to complete their armament expansion work and exchanging information on scientific research work. Under these circumstances, the question of amending the Neutrality Act will naturally take a back seat. The US government is most concerned with the following two matters: (1) Obtaining congressional approval to quickly begin implementing the armament expansion plan and setting up defenses at new strongholds in the Pacific and Atlantic; (2) Practically studying various methods to assist other democratic countries in accelerating the completion of their armament expansion plans, but without explicitly entering into any kind of agreement.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Senator Gibson, a Republican from Vermont, said that most Republican senators will support the president's naval expansion and Guam fortification plans. The fortification of Guam is of great significance to the Philippines. If the defense of Guam is consolidated, Japan will never be able to launch a large-scale attack on the Philippines, and the United States' influence in the Far East will also be preserved.

### The Spanish War Enters an Emergency Stage: The Town of Igualada Has Fallen, Rebels Continue to Attack Barcelona

[Reuter's Dispatch, Paris, 22nd] As the Spanish Rebel army continues to advance towards Barcelona, French newspapers express concern. Mr. Tirard writes in "Le Temps," "The fact that patriots are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the latest developments in the Spanish war is truly regrettable. I believe that Franco's victory in Spain is a disaster for France." "L'Ordre" states, "If Britain and France cannot get the Italian forces to withdraw from Franco's troops, then Mussolini will be able to threaten British and French Mediterranean traffic from the Balearic Islands after the rebels win, and it will be even more impossible to get the Italian forces to withdraw."

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Hull stated that he had received a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson requesting that the order banning the shipment of arms to Spain be lifted. Stimson stated that he had long believed that Spain was a battlefield between dictatorship and democracy. American celebrities had urged him to come forward to uphold justice for the Spanish Republican government, but he had not been able to do so due to his frail health. He had sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull requesting that the order banning the shipment of arms be lifted. Stimson had just joined with American celebrities yesterday to form the Committee to Not Participate in Japan's Aggression.

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Salamanca, 20th] In the assault on the town of Igualada, the gateway to Barcelona, fierce fighting between the Spanish rebel army and the government forces raged for over twenty hours. The town has now fallen into the hands of the rebel army. Yesterday, the rebel artillery bombarded the town heavily, and in the evening, the rebel army launched a fierce attack under the cover of tanks. By two or three o'clock this morning, Franco's troops had entered the town.

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Salamanca, 21st] The key town of Igualada near Barcelona has been occupied by the rebel army after twenty hours of fierce fighting. The government forces resisted desperately and held out bravely until the last moment. The news of the rebel victory was transmitted here this morning, and the people's hopes for a speedy rebel victory have been heightened again. The first reports stated that the fighting took place very close to the city, and all roads leading into the city were skillfully destroyed by the Asturian engineers. The rebel army's heavy artillery bombarded the city all day long, and the rebel army used flanking maneuvers and ordered a night attack, led by tanks, breaking through the government's defenses like a storm. The government army's defense force was the highly skilled Lister Brigade, so its casualties were extremely high. The rebel army entered the city at two or three o'clock in the morning. After occupying the city, the rebel army immediately occupied the high ground in the northeast. The government army retreated to the village of Franca. On the Mediterranean coast, the rebel army also achieved victories.

[Reuter's Dispatch, Lerida, 21st] The Spanish rebel army has occupied Arbós, 25 miles from Barcelona. Its southern and central detachments are making rapid progress across Catalonia. The northern detachments of Monistrol and Aranjuez are progressing more slowly due to bad weather and thick fog. The rebel mixed force occupied Igualada yesterday and continued to advance this morning, occupying Òdena, three and a half miles northeast of the town. On the southern front, the rebel army has occupied Arbós, which allows Franco to control the entire province of Tarragona. The rebel army has now reached the Foix River.

Spanish Refugees Pour Into France

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Paris, 22nd] Recently, the French government and the press have attached great importance to the problem of the tide of Spanish refugees pouring into France. It is reported that the Spanish Republican government has requested the French government to accept 40,000 civilians crossing the border, but this news has not been confirmed. Political sources say that the Spanish ambassador and the French foreign minister discussed this issue on the 20th. Catalonia is now surrounded on three sides by the Spanish rebel army, and the only way out is to escape across the border into France. It is generally expected that the French government will accept this large group of refugees for humanitarian reasons. According to last night's newspapers, the best way to handle the large group of Spanish refugees is to transport them to the port of Bordeaux on the west coast and then transfer them by ship to Mexico. The Paris Evening News reports that there are currently about 800,000 to 900,000 refugees in Catalonia, in addition to the original residents of the city.

Rebel Aircraft Shot Down

[Reuter's Dispatch, Barcelona, 21st] Today, twenty Spanish government fighter planes engaged five rebel bombers and several fighter planes in the skies over Barcelona. The rebel planes dropped only a few bombs. Several planes crashed during the fighting. Also this morning, a rebel bomber, along with several fighter planes, reconnoitered over the city. Government planes rose to meet them, immediately shooting down one rebel plane.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Barcelona, 22nd] The British ships "Blackburn" and "Dover" were damaged here last night by Spanish rebel planes. The cabin of the "Dover" has been flooded. The "Blackburn," a coal cargo ship, was hit by a shell in the middle.

### Various Circles in California, USA, Oppose the Shipment of Iron Materials to Japan

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Long Beach Harbor, California, USA, 21st] Various circles here have recently formed groups to oppose the supply of iron materials to Japan by the United States. As two cargo ships were being loaded with iron materials, more than 3,000 people, mixed with some Chinese expatriates, marched in formation to protest, holding banners with slogans such as "Don't Let Chinese Blood Stain American Hands" and "Thou Shalt Not Kill." The two ships had to stop loading as a result, but no incidents occurred.

### British Imperial Aircraft "Knight" Crashes into the Sea East of New York; Nose and Fuselage Iced Over; American Ships and Aircraft Rush to Rescue

[Reuters, New York, 21st] The British Imperial aircraft "Knight" was forced to land approximately 300 miles east of Chincoteague, Norfolk, and is now sinking. The aircraft carried eight passengers and five crew members, consisting of people from the United States, Canada, and Bermuda. The plane was flying from New York to Bermuda, a total distance of 770 miles, which usually takes six hours. However, due to the severe cold along the way, the nose and fuselage iced over, causing all engines to fail. Two American and Canadian destroyers, three speedboats, several merchant ships, and a number of aircraft are rushing to the rescue. Imperial Airways personnel believe that the "Leverpool City" has already reached the crash site of the "Knight," but as it is already dusk, its fate is unknown. The "Knight" is an "Empire" class aircraft of the company, capable of carrying 24 passengers, and is a sister ship to the "Caledonia" and "Cambria." The latter had made five complete transatlantic round trips in 1937.

### Germany Establishes Military Advisory Group in Czechoslovakia, Replacing France's Position

[Reuters, London, 21st] It is reported that today's German-Czech talks in Berlin will address the issue of Germany establishing a military advisory group in Prague. From 1919 until the last Czech crisis, only France had such a group in Czechoslovakia. Now Germany seeks to replace France's position in Czechoslovakia.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Hitler's meeting with the Czech Foreign Minister last night was entirely private. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, this morning's meeting between the Czech Foreign Minister and the German Foreign Minister was also purely for personal exchange. It is ascertained that during Hitler's meeting with the Czech Foreign Minister, no one else was present besides the German Foreign Minister. Furthermore, according to authoritative sources, issues such as German-Czech customs union, Czechoslovakia's withdrawal from the League of Nations, participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, and Ukrainian autonomy were not mentioned, as both sides wanted to understand the principles held by their respective governments before engaging in further negotiations. Furthermore, according to opinions within German political circles, there is currently a widespread hope for domestic unity in Czechoslovakia, so that friendly relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia can become closer and the Munich Agreement can be implemented. It is also reported that no political agreement of any kind was established during yesterday's meeting.

### Hitler Issues Decree; Forming German Defense Force; All Men Having Completed Military Service Must Join; Schacht Resigns Due to Opposition to Military Expansion

—Hitler—

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Hitler recently issued a decree to accelerate Germany's military preparations, stipulating that all men who have completed military service will be formed into a defense force and incorporated into the National Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA). It is claimed that the purpose of this measure is to "maintain their physical and mental strength." All able-bodied men over the age of seventeen must obtain the SA sports badge. The badge is now renamed the "Defense Badge." Therefore, German men must undergo compulsory physical training, part of which will be of a semi-military nature, in order to maintain physical and military standards.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] According to well-informed sources here, the recent resignation of Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the German Reichsbank, is believed to be related to Germany's accelerated military expansion program. According to the foreign correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" here, opinions within the National Socialist Party regarding the financing of the military expansion program are highly divergent. It is reported that Dr. Schacht stated that such a military expansion program could not be carried out using normal financial methods.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Yesterday, well-informed sources told a Reuters reporter that Hitler's adjutant, Wilhelm Brückner, has been appointed Consul General in San Francisco. Various sensational interpretations from outside are unreliable, claiming that this move is not intended to exclude stable elements around Hitler and has no connection with Dr. Schacht's resignation as President of the Reichsbank.

### Lenin Death Anniversary Commemoration; Stalin and Others Attend

Ciano also intends to attend and participate. Representatives from the Sudetenland will also attend for the first time. Furthermore, it is learned that Hitler will give a speech during this parliamentary session. However, Hitler never publishes the content of his speeches in advance, so it is impossible to know. But it is widely believed that he will pay more attention to domestic issues than foreign issues and elaborate more.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Yesterday, Manchester police officers discovered a large quantity of explosives in an uninhabited shop in the "Chorlton-on-Medlock" district. A police van was filled with wooden barrels, packages, glass bottles, clocks, and other items, which were taken to the police station for inspection. To prevent demonstrations from occurring, a number of special police officers were dispatched to guard the area. However, the many members of the public who were watching the police work remained silent.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] The command of the Irish Republican Army issued a statement yesterday, saying that the bombing incident that occurred in Darley, Ireland, a few days ago was not related to the army. On the morning of the 19th of this month, a bombing occurred in a hostel in Darley, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain's son was residing in that hostel.

Short commentary

### A Good Policy in Yunnan Province

This newspaper’s special dispatch from Kunming on the 22nd reports that Yunnan will allocate all land tax revenue to cover administrative and operational expenses in various counties. At a time when Yunnan's administration is facing difficulties, being able to follow the principles of the Founding Program of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and take the lead in allocating land tax revenue to strengthen local administrative organs and promote production and construction is a model for enlightened authorities in other rear provinces. At this critical juncture in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, all our local authorities, in addition to strictly adhering to the central government's national policies, should strive to meet the essential needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction by adapting to local conditions, provided that it is consistent with the program. Yunnan's move is only one example. However, the implementation of good policies must pay attention to two points: first, those who implement good policies must have the genuine enthusiasm to fight for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, a benevolent and compassionate attitude towards the people, integrity and detachment from material possessions, and sufficient experience and knowledge. Partisan prejudice and empty reputation are particularly to be avoided. Second, the environment for implementing good policies must eliminate passive and conservative, corrupt forces, and actively encourage close cooperation between the party, government, army, and people, especially the promotion of civil governance, which is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance but also a foundation for the success of National Reconstruction.

### On the War Situation in South China

The war in Guangdong Province has intensified in recent days, and a major battle will unfold soon. The main reasons are: on the one hand, the Japanese army is eager to "destroy" the main base and strength of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, taking advantage of the fact that its allies Germany and Italy are intensifying their harassment of the West and that Britain and France continue to show signs of concession, and is massively reinforcing South China, preparing for a large-scale southwest offensive; on the other hand, our side, since the establishment of the Southwest Military Council, has largely completed all deployments for the second phase of the War of Resistance, with fresh troops advancing step by step, actively preparing for a counteroffensive.

Based on the current situation of the Japanese forces and the reports from our military and political authorities, we are filled with excitement and anticipation for the future of the war in South China. However, there are still two issues hindering the smooth progress of the war that need to be resolved urgently. The first is that the principle of "politics being more important than military affairs and the people being more important than soldiers" has not been effectively implemented. In the future, it is necessary to realize the improvement of political and civil institutions, adjust the relationship between the party, government, army, and people, and unify the youth movement and peasant movement. The second is that in some areas, there is confusion between bandits and guerrillas, harassing the countryside, and in effect acting as advance units for the Japanese army, while many regular guerrillas and patriotic youths and overseas Chinese participating in the movement to go to the countryside to save the nation have been obstructed and tragically killed. Therefore, the unified command and widespread development of guerrilla forces is an urgent need. However, it should be noted here that (1) the barriers to monopolizing the civil movement should be thoroughly removed, and the enthusiasm of the people to assist in the War of Resistance should be unleashed; (2) talents with experience in mobilizing the people should be reused, and progressive and strong young cadres should be carefully cultivated.

The effect of boycotting Japanese goods in Nanyang over the past year Author: Eleanor Dennison Translated by Bao Ren December issue of New York Far Eastern Survey

Since China launched its sacred and heroic War of Resistance, the Chinese people residing in various parts of Nanyang have achieved remarkable results in boycotting Japanese goods. Reviewing the history, whenever China has been subjected to Japanese aggression and oppression, these overseas Chinese in Nanyang have always used the passive method of boycotting Japanese goods to protect their country, causing economic losses to the aggressor. Who dares to say that the Chinese are a backward and unprogressive nation, given this demonstration of national spirit?

In British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Siam, there are a total of seven million Chinese immigrants. Most of the industrial and commercial enterprises are controlled by Chinese merchants. Although they do not have much influence in local politics and culture, they are very concerned about their motherland and often provide great economic and material assistance to their country.

We know that Nanyang is the only important sales market for Japanese exports. In 1937, goods shipped from Japan to Nanyang accounted for 12% of the country's total exports. Before the Sino-Japanese War, because Nanyang was close to Japan and transportation was extremely convenient, the cost was lower. Therefore, most Chinese merchants were willing to sell Japanese goods. Even ordinary immigrants were happy to buy Japanese goods because of their low prices, and unconsciously became promoters of Japanese goods. The reason why Japanese goods were able to sell well in Nanyang was not unrelated to this. Because of the above special circumstances, it is by no means an easy task for Chinese immigrants to economically resist Japan.

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident in July 1937, the people of Nanyang, seeing the Japanese warlords' acts of aggression in China and the tragic scenes of grass-covered graves and bone-strewn hills in the war zones, deeply resented the aggressors' misdeeds. At the same time, Chinese newspapers in Nanyang were doing their best to expose the Japanese army's barbaric actions of aggression, thus arousing the sympathy of most local residents and overseas Chinese. They stood up courageously and automatically organized groups to resist Japan economically. Therefore, the movement to boycott Japanese goods arose like a storm, spreading throughout the region. Even newspapers run by the British and French in Nanyang also vigorously promoted the boycott of Japan.

Because of the great sympathy of foreign nationals and the efforts of Chinese immigrants, the boycott of Japanese goods has been effective. From January to September 1938, Japan's total exports decreased by 40% compared to the same period in 1937, and exports to Nanyang decreased by 54%. Goods shipped from Japan to the Dutch East Indies decreased by 58% compared to 1937, those to the British Straits Settlements decreased by 75%, those to the Philippines decreased by 41%, Siam decreased by 16%, Vietnam decreased by 40%, and British Malaya decreased by 59%. Only Borneo increased by 6% compared to 1937. Among the above regions, the first four places—the Dutch East Indies, the British Straits Settlements, the Philippines, and Siam—are important sales markets for Japanese exports, while the others are less important.

Since Japanese goods imported into Nanyang have been reduced due to the influence of the boycott movement, this will certainly not affect Nanyang's foreign trade. Their foreign imports have increased compared to the past. However, there are also several places where the total foreign imports have also decreased due to the too enthusiastic boycott movement. For example, in British Malaya (including the Straits Settlements), from January to July 1938, its total imports decreased by 16% compared to the same period in 1937, while goods imported from Japan decreased by 74%. In the Philippines, its total imports increased by 36%, while the amount of goods imported from Japan into the Philippines decreased by 20% of the total imports. The people of British Malaya are very enthusiastic about the boycott of Japanese goods. This work has recently become more active. Most stores do not sell Japanese goods, and even the Japanese inventory that was previously stored in the store is not sold. Japanese cotton fabrics, electrical materials, automobiles, machine parts, and canned foods are rarely seen recently. In particular, Japanese-made rubber tires and rubber hoses have almost disappeared from the market.

However, there is one point that I must mention here. Japan's reduction in exports to Nanyang this year is certainly due to the power of the boycott of Japanese goods, but another part of the reason is due to Japan's domestic restrictions on the import of industrial raw materials and the increase in the price of Japanese export goods. According to statistics, the value of Japanese goods shipped to Nanyang countries this year decreased by an average of 20 million Japanese yen per month compared to 1937.

Since Japanese goods have been rejected by Nanyang countries, it will naturally lead to competition from other European powers. For example, in British Malaya, goods imported from Japan in 1938 decreased by 74% compared to last year, while goods imported from European countries increased by 19%. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the commercial trade between the United States and Nanyang was underdeveloped, but last year, due to the boycott of Japanese goods, the United States gained a great deal of profit in trade. Recently, the cars used by the residents of the Dutch East Indies are mostly American-made. Cars manufactured in Japan and Germany are mostly rejected by the people. In British Malaya, Chinese immigrants and local residents are willing to eat American-produced sardines rather than Japanese goods, even though American sardines are more than twice as expensive as Japanese ones.

### Xu Shiying Returned to Hong Kong from Chongqing Yesterday, Discussing the Central Government's Plan to Establish a Labor Relief Zone in South China; the Entire Relief Plan Has Been Decided, Hoping Various Organizations Will Cooperate; Over Sixty Hong Kong Organizations Preparing to Establish the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Association for Hometown

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the National Government's Relief Commission, flew to Chongqing on official business a few days ago, and returned to Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing yesterday (21st). A reporter visited Mr. Xu yesterday to inquire about the process of this trip and the Central Government's plan for relief work. According to his reply, due to the severe disaster situation in South China a month ago, in addition to allocating funds for emergency relief, he specially requested instructions from the Central Government on the overall relief measures. After arriving in Chongqing, he met Chairman Lin and personally presented everything. Subsequently, he convened a meeting of the Relief Commission in Chongqing, and a decision was made on the plan for relief work in South China, such as establishing a labor relief zone and providing relief through work. However, he still hopes that various charitable organizations will cooperate effectively with the Relief Commission. Regarding Huang Yan's relief efforts, the number of rescued refugees reached 200,000, and they have now been relocated to cultivate land along the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and their lives have gradually become stable, and so on. In addition, regarding the Guangdong Province relief issue, in addition to the concrete plan of our Central Government already being implemented and intensified, various overseas Chinese groups here are also doing their utmost to provide assistance due to their deep feelings for their hometowns. Now, there are more than sixty legal organizations, in view of the lack of contact between the various organizations in the past, affecting work efficiency, who have jointly organized a Guangdong Overseas Chinese Relief Association for Hometowns, with the aim of relieving the war-torn and injured soldiers and refugees in Guangdong Province. All commercial, industrial, academic, and women's groups that agree with the association can join as members through the introduction of members of the association. The association is a liaison mechanism, hoping to trust and rely on each other and cooperate in parallel under the same goal to increase the work efficiency of each organization. The association's organization is divided into two types: (1) a committee jointly organized by the leaders of the organizations that have joined the association, as a deliberative body, and from among the members, select directors for the general affairs, recruitment, training, publicity, and investigation departments, and members of the design committee, to form a task force, as an executive body; (2) each member simultaneously serves as the director of the branch of each affiliated organization, consulting with the association to guide the work of the members of each organization. The association has one chairman, four directors each for the general affairs, recruitment, training, publicity, and investigation departments, a number of staff members, and a number of design committee members, all of whom are honorary positions, and are publicly elected, it is said.

### Bandits Rob Buses in the New Territories; A Chinese Detective Shot and Seriously Injured; Bus Ticket Seller Robbed of Money Bag; Injured Chinese Detective Immediately Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Recently, banditry has been rampant in the New Territories, and cases of robbery and murder are frequently seen. Yesterday, another thug armed with a gun robbed the money bag of a Kowloon bus ticket seller, got off the bus and fled. At that time, a Chinese detective was chasing him and was also shot by the thief. The circumstances that occurred at that time are recorded below.

Armed Robbery of Ticket Seller

At 5:45 pm yesterday, Kowloon Motor Bus No. 744, carrying passengers from Yuen Long in the New Territories to Fanling, had a man, about 30 years old, raise his hand at the section of the bus near San Tin, asking the driver to stop. The driver, seeing a passenger boarding, stopped as instructed. Unexpectedly, after the man got on the bus, he immediately revealed his weapon and threatened the ticket seller. After robbing the ticket seller of his money bag, he got off the bus and fled. The ticket seller, unwilling to lose his money, also got off the bus to chase him. However, the ticket seller did not dare to get too close because the thief was holding a gun in his hand, and called out from a distance. When the thief was about to walk to Lok Ma Chau, it happened that Chinese Detective Ma Shu of the Lok Ma Chau Police Station was walking out of a small road, intending to take a bus to Fanling. When he was walking on San Tin Road, Detective Ma suddenly heard someone calling out "thief" ahead. He immediately saw a person walking towards him. The person was holding a money bag in his hand. Therefore, Detective Ma knew that this person was undoubtedly a bandit, so he rushed forward to intercept him.

Shooting of Chinese Detective

However, the thief, fearing arrest, fired a shot at Detective Ma. The bullet entered from the left side of Ma Liang's face and exited from his right ear. After Detective Ma was injured, he fell to the ground. The people around him, seeing this dangerous situation, did not dare to chase after him. Thus, the bandit was able to escape with the loot. After the thief left, the ticket seller and other people helped Detective Ma onto the bus, intending to drive him to the hospital for treatment. Earlier, a Red Cross vehicle, jointly funded by merchants and residents of Shuikou and Wenkeng, had finished delivering supplies donated by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee to Shenzhen refugees and was returning. They happened to see this tragedy. Therefore, the people in the bus helped the injured Detective Ma onto the Red Cross vehicle and first sent him to Yuen Long Public Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Ma Liang was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment, it is said.

### Lin Bosheng's Condition Has Not Yet Passed the Danger Period; Serious Injury to Left Eye Poses Risk of Blindness; Nose Injury Has Not Healed, and Breathing is Obstructed

Lin Bosheng, a confidant of Wang Jingwei and the person in charge of the Nanhua Daily, was shot on the evening of the 17th of this month and immediately sent to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. After the doctors worked hard to treat him, there was no risk of a dramatic change. According to reliable sources, the most significant injuries Lin sustained this time were to his left eye and left nose. Although he has been treated for several days, although there has been some improvement, his left eye is seriously injured, and there is a risk of blindness. His nose injury has also not healed, which is obstructing his breathing. The danger period has not yet passed, and a considerable period of time is required before his condition can stabilize, it is said. Furthermore, it is reported that Wang Jingwei came from Hanoi to visit and comfort Lin after he was injured, it is said.

### Needy Fishermen in Dire Need of Relief; Fishermen's Association to Sell Flowers to Raise Funds

### Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Plummets, Dropping from Second to Eighth Place, Only Exceeding Three Million Last Year

Trade between Japan and Hong Kong originally ranked second in Hong Kong's foreign trade, but since Japan launched its invasion of China, its foreign trade has plummeted. Even considering trade with Hong Kong, it has dropped from second to eighth place, ranking behind England, the United States, British India, Germany, Siam, and French Indochina. In 1936 and 1937, Japan's exports to Hong Kong were over 58 million yuan, but last year they fell to 19 million yuan. Japan's imports from Hong Kong were 18 million yuan in 1936 and 20 million yuan in 1937, but last year they were only 3.3 million yuan. Japanese merchants have lost a large portion of their original trade with Hong Kong, suffering significant losses. As Japan's trade with Hong Kong has declined, the United Kingdom has taken its place. At the end of last year, imports reached 56,414,000 yuan, second only to China. In 1937 it was 46.7 million, in 1936 it was 29 million, in 1935 it was 23.9 million, and in 1934 it was 32.5 million. Although Hong Kong's trade was affected by the war in South China last December and trade with South China was reduced, the increase in trade with French Annam and Guangzhou Bay was sufficient to offset the decline.

### Leisurely Pursuits: Dog Show to be Held in Mid-March, and a Cat Show as Well

The leisure class in Hong Kong uses playthings as a pastime, such as cats, dogs, and birds. Recently, this group has been organizing a dog show and has already held meetings to discuss it. It is noted that a dog show was once held in Hong Kong, but it has not been held since. It is heard that the upcoming show may take place on March 11th at the St. John's Ground in Hong Kong. To facilitate participation from residents of the Kowloon Peninsula, a favor has been requested from the veterinary officer to allow participating dogs from Kowloon to come to Hong Kong without needing a ferry pass. It is heard that a cat show will also be held at the same time.

### Inauguration Ceremony of the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association

— 奇卓

Mr. Qian Xinzhi's Encouragement: Abstain from Gambling, Prostitution, and Early Marriage

Speaking of the "banking world," one seems to associate them with a life of "privilege and comfort." If one hears that this "aristocratic" group has also organized and become serious, it might surprise and astonish us, followed by joy and relief.

In fact, under the turbulent tides of the era, unless one is numb and willing to fall behind, who is not awakened from their slumber? The Hong Kong banking world is a tributary in the progressive torrent; it does not require us to be "surprised" or "astonished."

Their name is the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association, which was established after more than two months of preparation and registration procedures. The inauguration ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM at the Confucius Hall. Their direction, like that of the Hong Kong Amateur Association established 22 days ago, is to improve amateur life, promote wholesome entertainment, and enhance service efficiency, a rather interesting organization. However, the former integrates the professional circles of various industries, while the latter is purely the banking industry.

The association has three types of members: permanent members with 23 people, supporting members with 227 people, and ordinary members with 481 people, totaling 731 people. Permanent members pay a one-time fee of 50 Hong Kong dollars or more, supporting members pay one to ten dollars per month, and ordinary members pay three dimes per month. In addition, there is a fundraising fund, and the economic foundation is quite solid. The association's members belong to banks and bank-affiliated institutions such as the Central Bank, Central Trust Bureau, Central Savings Association, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Agricultural Bank, National Goods Bank, Guangdong Bank, Guangxi Bank, Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, Shantou Commercial Bank, etc., a total of 46 financial institutions. In terms of organization, there are general affairs, membership, academic, service, sports, and entertainment departments under the Standing Committee to share the association's affairs. Their honorary directors are Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Li Daonan, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Huo Baocai.

The meeting yesterday was lively, with guests and hosts showing the fun of group life. After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Ling Xianyang gave an opening speech. Then, Mr. Qian Xinzhi gave a sincere and insightful speech of encouragement:

"A person should have a career, especially a lifelong career. The banking industry is an emerging and progressive industry because most people commit to it as a lifelong career... To be loyal to the profession, one should abstain from bad habits and promote wholesome entertainment. The organization of the Banking Industry Amateur Association has been promoted in Shanghai, Hankou, and Chongqing. I hope that Hong Kong's will not just hold a meeting and establish the association and then do nothing. It should promote intellectual education and supplement new knowledge. The outdated set is not enough. Whether it is a new economic theory or a new economic doctrine, one must learn them to avoid falling behind. Physical education is very important. When visiting foreign banks, I saw the spirit of their employees standing while working, which our weak Chinese people cannot do. We should strengthen our bodies to be able to do things. As for moral and group education, their importance is also obvious and should be developed equally..." Mr. Qian spoke movingly, and at the end, he sincerely encouraged his colleagues to abstain from gambling, prostitution, and early marriage, and listed many facts of people who enjoyed themselves in the present but ruined their families, making people alert.

Mr. Qian's earnest spirit was like that of a fearful elder, and he said that Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Tang Chunmin could not attend due to matters, and he also represented their intentions. Yesterday's conference had such a speech, which can be considered quite fruitful. Surely many people will be inspired from their shame. Reporting on the preparation process, awarding prizes, discussing, electing, one scene after another passed by, interesting, powerful, and the enthusiastic cheers made the whole place excited and tense. The program included amateur singing, Cantonese opera, harmonica, and magic from the Amateur Association. The drama had two plays from the amateur theater group, "Song of the Night" and "Black Shadow", and playwrights Cai Chusheng and Situ Huimin were invited to attend, with excellent results. The Commercial Press choir also participated in the singing, which was truly a grand occasion. The children's cheers at the magic show were especially interesting. The general situation was largely the same as when the Amateur Association was established earlier. The reporter's excited mood in writing this special report is also similar to the one written on New Year's Day about the Amateur Association.

Come on: Following the Amateur Association and the Banking Industry Amateur Association, let employees of all industries move from individual to collective, from debauchery to seriousness!

### As Poisonous as Snakes and Scorpions: Gangster Women in Refugee Areas Induce Refugees to Sell Young Girls, Force Them to Sell Their Children to Repay Debts After Lending Money, Activities Located in Kowloon Area

The Hong Kong authorities, in view of the proliferation of private prostitutes, many of whom are underage girls, which not only harms public morals but also violates humanity, have been cracking down on them extensively. Many cases have been uncovered in recent days, and severe penalties have been imposed on gangsters who induce and oppress ignorant girls to sell their bodies, devoid of all conscience. It has been found that these gangsters who abduct women use vicious methods. In addition to coercion and inducement, they have recently invented a new trick, actively operating among the refugee population. They investigate refugees who have young girls and then take the opportunity to express intimacy with them. Since they are refugees, they may be short of money, so they pretend to be generous and lend them money, causing the beneficiaries to be moved to tears and fall into their trap, unaware of what is happening. After a considerable period, they then demand repayment. If they fail to do so, they are threatened. The deceived are then forced into a corner and persuaded to sell their children to pay off the debts, and the gangsters' plan is successful. It has been found that these gangsters are mostly middle-aged women who appear kind but have hearts like snakes and scorpions. Their activities mostly take place in the areas where refugees gather, such as Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Sham Shui Po. The authorities are now strictly investigating these gangsters.

### Hong Kong Student Community Prepares to Welcome Li Zhengyao, 25th Evening at Confucius Hall

Li Zhengyao, the Hong Kong student representative who attended the recent World Youth Peace Conference, has returned to Hong Kong by French mail ship after the conference. He is scheduled to arrive on the 25th. The Hong Kong student community has now scheduled a meeting at 7 PM on the 25th of this month at the Confucius Hall on Caroline Hill to welcome him.

### Chinese Tea is Heavily Promoted in the Soviet Union, Soviet Union Sends Special Ships to Hong Kong to Transport Tea, Ship "Feilisi" Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday from the Black Sea, Annual Sales of Chinese Tea in the Soviet Union Reached Nine Million

Soviet ships rarely appeared in Hong Kong waters in the past. Recently, the ship "Feilisi" arrived in Hong Kong from Odessa in the Black Sea, arousing the attention of the general public. Some even rumored that it was carrying military supplies to China. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited the ship owner yesterday. According to him, this is absolutely not the case. The ship has not been carrying any cargo recently. The ship's shallow draft is clear evidence of this. Moreover, the ship is not the first Russian ship to come to Hong Kong. Three weeks ago, one had already arrived in Hong Kong. The mission of these two ships is to transport Chinese tea promoted in Russia. It has been found that last year, the total value of Chinese tea exported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union reached as much as nine million, especially at the end of last year, this trade was particularly prosperous. In the future, the ship may regularly travel between Hong Kong and Odessa with many other Russian ships. If so, novel commercial ships with an axe and sickle painted on the smokestack will appear on the waters of Hong Kong from time to time. Hosted by Ms. Jinmen

### The "Sea Wave" Tank Ship Was Launched in Hong Kong Yesterday

The local naval authorities previously obtained approval from the British Admiralty to build a small steel-hulled tank ship, named "Sea Wave," at the Taikoo Dockyard. The ship is of a supportive nature and is used by the British Naval Department in China. The launching ceremony was held during this week, hosted by Ms. McKinley. High-ranking naval officers from Hong Kong, Mr.狄, and other dignitaries attended the ceremony.

### Mr. Tao Xingzhi Speaks on the Comprehensive Education of the Anti-Japanese War (Continued)

— 奇卓

At the Cadre Training Class of the Chinese Arts Advancement Association

Mr. Tao paused again after speaking to this point. However, neither the speaker nor the listeners showed any signs of fatigue. Mr. Tao continued, "However, I am not against running education in the rear area at the same time. Just don't use the old eight-legged essay or the foreign eight-legged essay. We must eliminate secondary courses and add courses that meet the needs of the anti-Japanese war. There is a very important principle that should be followed: that the organization and training in the rear area should be coordinated with the needs of the front line. I remember once meeting the dean of a medical school, and I urged him to quickly train medical personnel to contribute to the anti-Japanese war. The dean said proudly, 'Old Xun: Medicine is not like other things! To be able to serve, it always takes at least five years, and it cannot be sloppy.' My reply at the time was: 'Now the most soldiers die from malaria, dysentery, and unstoppable bleeding. Does it take five years to train specialists to treat these diseases?' 'Well, if it's to train such personnel, it doesn't take that long.' 'That's right! Please quickly train a large number of such personnel to treat our front-line soldiers and save our brave soldiers. As for training people to dissect and remove bullets, I don't object to your five years of training.' The organization and training in the rear area must be coordinated with the needs of the front line, and this is a concrete example.

Recalling a few months ago, before Guangzhou was occupied, a friend from Sun Yat-sen University asked me: Do you think Sun Yat-sen University should move? My answer was: 'Quickly move! Quickly move! Quickly move!' The reason is: Instruments cost money to buy; training a university student is not easy either. Unfortunately, they didn't move, and they suffered a great loss when Guangzhou fell.

Recently, I met this old friend again in Guangxi, and he asked me again: Do you think Zhongda should move from Guangxi to Yunnan again? My answer is: Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! The reason is that Yunnan is too far from Guangdong. In Guangxi, you can still participate in the work of defending Guangdong. Using the relocation fee to build air-raid shelters is more than enough. The second reason is that there are too many universities in Yunnan, and there is really no need to add another one.

But I am not mechanically opposed to running education in Yunnan. If there are not too many institutions of higher learning there, and they are determined to transfer their strength to the front line, then no one will object.

Therefore, running education in the rear area is not to hide lazily under the shield of a century-long plan. We must always consider the needs of the anti-Japanese war, that is, the needs of national construction. If the anti-Japanese war fails, everything is over, and the so-called century-long plan becomes a plan for slaves. So the most important thing in running education in the rear area is to increase the strength of the anti-Japanese war. Otherwise, hiding in a cave and still running education for education is an escape from education.

When Mr. Tao spoke to this point, the listeners were deeply moved again. Mr. Tao said enthusiastically:

'Our own education was one-sided in the past, and now it should be comprehensive. Comprehensive self-education means: seeing, thinking, playing, talking, and doing. Of course, we have two eyes; we must see; we have a brain; we must think; we have a mouth; we must talk; we are tired; we must play; we have hands; we must do. We have to see for the sake of doing, think for the sake of doing, talk for the sake of doing, and play for the sake of doing. Doing is the center of life, that is, the center of education. What to do? Anti-Japanese war and national construction!

Anti-Japanese war and national construction require:

Real doing, not fake doing;

Poor doing, not wasteful doing;

Joint doing, not divisive doing;

Fast doing, not slow doing;

Big doing, not small doing.

All fake doing, wasteful doing, divisive doing, slow doing, or small doing are suspicious. We should pursue evidence, distinguish between traitors and mediocrities, and give them appropriate treatment. Education is effective only through life; anti-Japanese war education is effective only through anti-Japanese war life.

Education is a weapon of national liberation and a weapon of human liberation. It is not enough to be called comprehensive education if it is not extended to the entire nation and all of humanity.'"

Warm applause ended this tense, serious, lively, and interesting lecture. (End)

Transportation and Travel

### Travelogue of Tai Po

— Tong Tai

One summer morning, the sky in the east had just turned the color of a fish's belly. Our group of five set off from Mong Kok along Nathan Road towards Tai Po Road. At this time, the sun had not yet risen, and the dark distant mountains were still shrouded in milky white mist because they were not exposed to sunlight. The weather was gloomy and dim. We walked for half an hour and arrived at Shek Shui Pei, where we took the opportunity to visit the reservoir. There are eight reservoirs, with high yellow mud mountains surrounding the four sides of the reservoir, creating a depression. Tall and dense pine trees are planted on the top of the high mountains. Water flows out of a large iron pipe on the left side of the low mountain, leading to the reservoir, impacting the stone steps, splashing white waves, and making a splashing sound, like playing a beautiful melody of music. Going in from the path on the right, there is a cave, about dozens of feet deep. Looking inside from the entrance of the cave, only the two ends of the cave are slightly bright, while the middle is gloomy. We walked through the cave, and the ground was very damp. When we reached the center of the cave, the air gradually became thin, and we felt short of breath. After this, we reached a flat green meadow. We rested here for a while and then walked towards the mountain road. The mountain road gradually became higher and higher, and rugged rocks protruded from the mountain road like sword peaks. Thorns were all over the road, making it difficult to walk. We carried our belongings on our backs and walked forward without any difficulty, with a spirit no less than that of soldiers on an expedition. We went down the mountain along the path around the top of the mountain and turned onto the wide road. At this time, the sun had already risen to the top of the high mountain, and the weather gradually became hot. Everyone seemed to feel a little tired, but they continued to move forward. Walking and walking, we unconsciously arrived at Sha Tin Station. Hearing that there was another scenic spot not far from here—Che Kung Temple—everyone discussed going there to play. So, guided by the locals, we walked along the small path around the fields, and it took us half an hour to reach our destination. The temple was built at the foot of the mountain, facing a rice field with newly transplanted seedlings. Green trees were planted on both sides of the temple, and the scenery was quiet and secluded. Guided by the temple's abbot, Zhilin, we visited the Buddha's throne. The inside was decorated very elegantly. Incense burners were burning pagoda incense, emitting a clear and fragrant aroma, which further highlighted the temple's purity. Being there felt like transcending the chaotic world. The worries and sorrows of the body and mind were washed away a lot. After playing for a while, it was already twelve o'clock. We had lunch in the temple. The vegetarian dishes were delicious and had a special flavor.

We stayed here for more than an hour and then set off again. Because everyone wanted to travel to Tai Po, they went along the railway track. After walking for two hours and passing through several tunnels, their faces were red, their ears were hot, and they were sweating profusely. However, the expected destination was still out of sight. At this time, everyone seemed to be anxious, but the more anxious they were, the farther the journey seemed to be. Later, they finally reached their destination—Tai Po. Everyone unloaded their burdens, found some tea in Tai Po Station to quench their thirst, rested for a moment, and went to stroll around Tai Po Market. The streets in the market are narrow and the roads are paved with mountain stones, which are uneven. There are dozens of shops of all kinds, but business is not very prosperous. Because the traffic between Kowloon and Tai Po is convenient, and the cost of travel is not high (round-trip tickets are only three dimes and a half), most residents buy their daily necessities in Hong Kong, so there are few large stores in Tai Po. The market is backed by mountains and faces the sea, and the scenery is quite beautiful. Families of military and political dignitaries who have taken refuge in Hong Kong mostly build houses on the mountains. There is a narrow mountain road from the market to the mountains, and they do not feel bitter in traveling back and forth. We stayed overnight in the chapel on the top of the mountain that night. Everyone ate two dumplings as their meal. The pastor of the chapel gave us the downstairs of the church to sleep. Everyone spread out their blankets and lay down, looking like skeletons on a tomb. Everyone spent the night in a daze. The next morning at three o'clock, we set off from Tai Po to Yuen Long.

Lianzhou, the Frontline of National Defense

### Shipping News

The French mail ship "非力士 蘇号", originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday and depart in the afternoon, will be delayed until tomorrow morning (24th) before arriving, according to the company's message last night, and will depart in the afternoon.

The "言路化沃号", managed by Jardine Matheson, brought more than 2,000 tons of goods from the United States. It is expected to be completely unloaded this morning and then enter the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs.

The Russian ship "打比利士号", arrived in Hong Kong from Vladivostok on the morning of the 20th and berthed at Kowloon Wharf. It is expected to stay for several days to load European goods, which are said to be about 8,000 tons, with minerals, tea, and wood oil being the largest items.

The "交通号" of Taisheng Company has been in the dock for many days. The repairs are progressing quickly and are expected to be completed. It is scheduled to leave the dock on the morning of the 25th and continue its voyage between Hong Kong and Hankou.

### Travels in Chaoshan

— Hai Ke

Since the outbreak of full-scale war, "Chaoshan" has stood on the front line of Guangdong's defense, its importance being more than ten times greater than in peacetime. The term "Chaoshan" encompasses Shantou, Chao'an, Chaoyang, Chenghai, Puning, Jieyang, Raoping, and Huilai—eight counties and cities. Shantou, in particular, is the central hub of all Chaoshan, the crucial gateway for those going abroad, and the center of industry and commerce. In recent decades, Shantou has transformed into a modern city with the turning wheels of time. For this trip to "Chaoshan," Shantou was both the starting point and the return line for the reporter’s itinerary. Therefore, in this travelogue, Shantou must also serve as the vanguard of the pen.

Opening a map, one can immediately see the importance of Shantou's location. Although ships of ten thousand tons cannot enter Shantou's harbor—Ma Islet—ships sailing on the Nanyang and Beiyang routes can directly reach the rocky mountain and the Chao Customs. The rocky mountain is the only place to escape the summer heat in Shantou. Many foreigners and consulate officials reside on the mountainside. Moreover, the consulates of various countries in Shantou are also located here, so many people call the area the second Gulangyu. However, this place is an integral part of our country's territory, and foreigners have no administrative power whatsoever. Speaking of Shantou's transportation, it can be said to be complete in sea, land, and air. However, since the outbreak of the war, there have been no airplanes for air travel. Land transportation continues to develop. From Shantou to Chao'an, there is the Chaoshan Railway and the dike highway. To Chenghai, there is the Shanzhang Highway and a light rail. Besides electric boats, Chaoyang also has provincial buses for transportation. To Huilai and Puning, provincial buses also provide direct access. As for overseas routes to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, and Annam, there are more than a dozen shipping companies operated by foreigners. Therefore, the sea in Shantou's harbor is often filled with many boats. The roads in Shantou's urban area have been well developed. The asphalt roads are soft and resilient. Especially Waima Road is a model for the entire city. The small park in the city center is bustling with traffic day and night. Zhongshan Park, spanning ten thousand mu, is the largest in eastern Guangdong. The park is gradually being completed with artificial hills, pavilions, a zoo, and flowerbeds. In the summer, rowboats on the lake are as numerous as carps crossing the river. The scenery of the entire park is also very spectacular. However, after Japanese planes bombed Shantou several times, the number of tourists sharply decreased, and part of the park was designated as a restricted area. This situation—half locked up and half open—is vastly different from the past. According to the Chaozhou Prefecture Chronicle, Shantou originally belonged to Chenghai and was initially named Shashantou because two hundred years ago, Shantou was just a sandy land protruding from the sea. Now, the term "Jiangxia" is also used. This time, the reporter took a train from Shantou to Chao'an. After about two hours, the train arrived at the county seat. After a short visit to the county seat, I took a rickshaw to the Xiangzi Bridge and the West Lake area for a stroll. This ancient city is where Han Yu served as a magistrate to govern the people. Even now, the cultural level is still very high. Xiangzi Bridge is a bridge named after Han Xiangzi, from the saying "Nine times Wen Gong, ten times his wife." The bridge is made up of eighteen boats linked together. At the head of the bridge stands a unique iron ox, but it is not known from which dynasty it originated. There is a Chaozhou folk song that says, "Eighteen boats connect twenty-four continents, two iron oxen, one slipped away." It is said that the iron oxen were originally a male-female pair. Several years ago, the female iron ox was suddenly stolen. However, it is now impossible to verify whether this event actually occurred. There are seventeen or eighteen shops on the Huzi Bridge. Unfortunately, in July, Japanese planes dropped several bombs at the head of the bridge, causing significant damage. The Han Wengong Temple is also nearby and is very popular. The people of Chaozhou are deeply superstitious about gods and Buddhism. All the statues in the city were gathered in the Chenghuang Temple by the county government last year. Northwest of the county seat is the Kaiyuan Temple, a famous ancient temple in Chaoshan. The architecture is very grand. Because the reporter came and went in a hurry, Chao'an could only be a fleeting visit. That same day, I took a connecting bus to Jieyang. Chaozhou was originally named Chaozhou. After the Republic of China, it was renamed Chao'an and has the beautiful name of Fengcheng. The reporter arrived in Jieyang in the twilight. After staying overnight, I went to see the Jieyang Sugar Factory, which had been bombed by Japanese planes, but all I saw was a pile of ruins. Returning, I made a tour of Jieyang City. The city's appearance and construction are a bit more backward than Chao'an. Banyan trees are planted everywhere in the city, so Jieyang is also known as Rongcheng. At dawn on the third day, I took a Shantou-Jieyang boat to Guantou. Without stopping in Guanbu, I hired a sedan chair to Chaoyang. It was noon when I arrived in Chaoyang. A tall stone tower could be seen from afar, named Wenguang Pagoda. The speech of the people of Chaoyang sounds coarser than that of other counties, so there is a saying that compares the people of Chaoyang, saying, "I would rather quarrel with the people of Chao'an than talk to the people of Chaoyang." Perhaps it is because the Chaozhou dialect is difficult to understand. The scenic spots in the northern suburbs of Chaoyang include Beidang and Xiaobeidang Peaks. There are temples on the peaks, and the vegetarian cuisine of Xiaobeidang is famous in Chaoshan. The monks in the temple serve as chefs, and tourists who arrive here must enjoy it to the fullest. The reporter also spent two yuan to eat four vegetarian dishes, which were indeed light and delicious, living up to its reputation. It is said that the oil used for cooking is buried underground for three years before being used, so it is different from ordinary bean oil. Standing on the peak, Xidang, which is facing it, is also visible in the distance. The scenery is secluded and clear, with a very detached atmosphere. It is said that there is a Lianhua Peak twenty miles away from Chaoyang, with a stone chamber under the peak. Looking through the cracks in the stone, one can see strange omens. Those who are able are also driven by curiosity. I immediately took the Chao-Hai Highway bus to go there. Upon reaching the destination, I rushed to see the stone chamber. Who knew that things would turn out contrary to expectations, almost to the point of coming with excitement and returning in disappointment. It turned out that Japanese warships were spying on the Chaoshan coast, and Japanese warships were shelling Haimen from time to time. Due to the emergency of the defense, people were forbidden to travel to the Lianhua area. The reporter did not take this into account when he came, but luckily I was specially allowed to see the stone chamber. However, looking at it again and again, there was nothing at all, nothing like the so-called Buddha appearing, it was really unfounded deception. Due to the itinerary, the reporter returned to Chaoyang and took a car to Leikou, and then transferred to Dahu. Dahu belongs to the second district of Chaoyang. Most of the residents make a living by fishing, but because Japanese warships burn and kill fishing boats, most people dare not go to sea to fish. The lives of the fishermen are extremely difficult now. There are three fish markets in the Da region, which are now managed by the government. After a brief stay in Dahu, the reporter rushed back to Shantou to go to Chenghai and Raoping counties. Therefore, in the afternoon, I took the Shantou-Da boat to Shantou, rested overnight, and the next day took the Shantou-Zhang Highway bus to Chenghai. Without stopping along the way, upon arriving in Chenghai, I was led by a friend, Li Wei, and walked around the city. As a result, I ran to a restaurant and tried Chenghai's famous ten-produced silver and pork head meat. The only gains from this trip to Chenghai were these two foods. I originally wanted to visit Puning and Huilai, but after a week of traveling, the journey was tiring, and my body was extremely exhausted, so the original plan had to be temporarily postponed.

### Guangxi Province Highways and Scenery Along the Lines (2)

— Pan Taifeng

B. Centered on Liuzhou

Liuzhou is located in the middle of Guangxi. Waterways crisscross, giving it the natural ability to control the entire province. In the past, the Liujiang River gathered produce from nearby areas, flowed westward, and passed through Wuzhou to Guangdong and Hong Kong. Therefore, trade was always prosperous. Now, the highways are smooth, connecting to Guizhou and Chongqing in the north, reaching Guilin and Hezhou in the west, and running through Yong and Long in the south to connect with eastern Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the war, all the coastal provinces have wanted to enter the interior, and most of them have passed through here. Merchants have gathered, making it extremely prosperous for a time. Liuzhou is also known as Maping because the Liujiang River comes from Shilong, encircles the east, west, and south sides of the city, and curves like a horseshoe. During the Tang Dynasty, Liu Zongyuan was demoted to this place. The Liu Hou Temple in Liuzhou Park in the east of the city is dedicated to Liu Zihou. Behind the temple is also a tomb with clothes and hats to commemorate him. Liyu Mountain is located in the southwest corner of the city. Its shape resembles a fish standing upright, just as its name suggests. There is a Fourth Army Pavilion on the mountainside, which commemorates the Fourth Army. Lei Mountain is ten miles south of the city, and there is a deep pool below, called the Datan Pool. Many famous Tang and Song Dynasty figures have composed poems and songs at the foot of the mountain. Longbi Mountain is thirty miles to the north. The stone wall is winding like a dragon, quite magnificent. The main product is tung oil, which generates profits of five million yuan annually. There is also a lot of timber, mostly fir, which is especially sturdy for making coffins, hence the saying "Die in Liuzhou." In recent years, new factories have been built, including a machinery factory, an alcohol factory (now closed), and an agricultural and forestry experiment station.

There are six highways starting from Liuzhou: Guiliu, Liuyu, Liuyi, Liuliu, Liwei, and Liushi.

1.  The Guiliu Line is 242 kilometers long. From Guilin to Lipu is 104 kilometers, sharing the same route as the Guiyue Line. From Lipu to Liuzhou is 138 kilometers, passing through Xiuren, Sanjiang, Toutang, Sipa, Rongjiang, Luzhai, and Chirong, seven stations. It was built between 1927 and 1928. The terrain along the line is undulating, making the engineering quite challenging. Since Sanjiang, the highway runs along the mountain valley, commonly known as the Nine Bends and Thirteen Turns, which is especially dangerous. The counties along the line produce tung oil, tea, and so on. The straw mushrooms of Liujiang are particularly famous. Cantonese merchants have established trading posts here to collect and process them into canned goods, which are shipped to Hong Kong.

2.  The Liuyu Line runs south from Liuzhou for 124 kilometers to Binyang, then turns east for another 136 kilometers to Yulin. Both sections have gravel road surfaces, passing through Labao, Ducun, Liudao, Sandu, Ligao, Datang, Silian, Beisi, Heli, Qianjiang, Shiling, Zouxu, Binyang, Qingtang, Leishen, Huanglian, Qiantang, Guixian, Luobowan, Batang, Santang, Qiaoxu, Zhanjiang, Pengtang, Shanxin, Shangmingshui, Xingye, Lidi, Gaopo, Ya, Sanshan, Gulouping, and Fengmentang, thirty-three stations. It is divided into three sections. The Liubin section started construction in October 1926 and opened to traffic in May 1927. The roadbed projects include Jiamaling, Shijiao, and Beisishan. The largest bridge projects are Longjiang Bridge and Lema Bridge. The Bingui section, from Qiantang to Guixian, was built by the Guican Steamship Company in 1925. The Binleishen section was built by the Bingui Highway Bureau in 1928. The Guiyu section was funded and built by local gentry and people along the line in 1925 and completed in 1926 and opened to traffic in January 1927. The entire section has a flat road surface, and the earthwork filling and cutting are well done. Many of the bridges utilize existing stone bridges, which are quite sturdy.

This line connects to the Wuyu Line in the east and the Yushi Line in the south. It is not only a major artery of the province's highways but also a conduit from Hong Kong to the southwest. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the number of vehicles has converged, making it even more important than other lines. Unfortunately, due to the recent tension in Beihai, travel is restricted.

Datang is located on the south side of Fenghuang Mountain, 59 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou. The highway comes from the north of Binyang and branches from here, heading northeast to Liuzhou and northwest via Hechi and Liuzhai to Guizhou. The area is scattered with stone peaks, resembling candles, pagodas, and bull horns, with different shapes, all vividly lifelike. Looking out from the bus, it is enough to be dazzling.

Beisi is 39 kilometers south of Datang and produces coal, which is currently mined by the Heshan Coal Mine Company.

Qianjiang is 24 kilometers south of Beisi, 122 kilometers from Liuzhou. It is located on the west bank of the Panjiang River, also known as the Hongshui River, named for its vermilion water color. On the east bank are Dayin Mountain and Xiaoyin Mountain, shaped like seals, just as their names suggest. There are coal mines nearby, with reserves of 20 million tons.

Binyang is 47 kilometers south of Qianjiang, 129 kilometers from Liuzhou. The highway comes from Liu and divides into two roads, one eastward to Yulin for the Liuyu Line, and the other southwest to Yongning for the Yongliu Line. The local handicraft industry is very prosperous and highly imitative, earning it the nickname "Little Japan." Nearby villages each have special products, such as the lamp wicks of Fangcun Village, the paper fans of Shikan Village, the daily necessities of Sucun Village, and the rain hats of Dazhuang Village, etc. The production of porcelain is particularly famous, with an annual output of over 200,000 yuan. The provincial government has established the Binyang Porcelain Factory to improve it. Nearby is the Cangqian Mine, with reserves of 16 million tons. To the southwest is Kunlun Pass, where Di Qing of the Song Dynasty defeated Nong Zhigao, a historical site.

### Today's Wuxi Industry

— Cai Hua

Large Factories Prefer to Rely on Others, Small Silk Factories Can Be Self-Reliant

[Shanghai Correspondence] Wuxi, one of China's four major rice markets and an important town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, can be said to have the most developed industry in the province. Before the war, there were nine textile factories, more than fifty silk factories, four flour mills, and over a hundred rice shops. Since its fall to the enemy more than a year ago, Wuxi has been filled with a murky atmosphere, the black hands of devils. All industries have suffered unprecedented catastrophe. The major factories have all been monopolized by the Japanese, and even small businesses are controlled by them. Disguised distribution-style Huazhong Silk Company, Daji Foreign Firm, Daxing Foreign Firm, etc., are grabbing Wuxi's industrial throat, not letting it breathe. The author will only report on its current situation—Wuxi's industry. Any omissions are unavoidable.

(1) Textile Industry

Before the war, there were seven factories including Shenxin, Zhenxin, Lixin, Guangqin, Qingqin, Qingfeng, and Yikang. Among them, Qingfeng and Shenxin factories had the largest scale, and Lixin Factory had the most output. Most of the factory buildings were destroyed, and many of the internal machines were also damaged. The Shenxin and Zhenxin factories were repaired by personnel sent by the Japanese Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd. The Yikang Yarn Factory was repaired by personnel sent by the Shanghai Dakang Yarn Factory. The Weixin and Xiexin factories were established in mid-October of last year. Although they started work once when the new cotton was launched, there were not many transactions.

(2) Flour Mills

The losses of the flour mills are much lighter than those of the yarn industry. The heaviest losses were the Fuxin and Maoxin factories. Guangfeng Flour Mill has already started work, and Jiuda is preparing. Of course, this kind of opening up still exposes the miserable situation, relying on the Japanese.

(3) Silk Factories

The silk industry, which holds the leading position in Wuxi's industry, is of course the most important. In the prosperous era of the silk industry, there were more than fifty silk factories, more than 13,000 silk reeling machines, and more than 60,000 workers. Now, the total number of silk reeling machines is less than a fraction of what it used to be. Its industrial situation can be seen. However, the Japanese believe that there are profits to be made and are unwilling to relax. They specially organized the "Huazhong Silk Company" to control it. Currently, the Zhenyi, Zhenyuan, Dasheng, Dingchang, Hongyu, Fulun, Qingkang, Hefa, and Dingsheng are reopened.

The so-called "Huazhong Silk Company" is really dark. The registered capital is nominally 8 million yuan, but in reality, it is probably worthless. Outsiders cannot know the details. The Japanese take 60% of the profits, and the Chinese take 40%. The purpose of the "Huazhong Company" is to control the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones. The general office is located in Hongkou, Shanghai, and branch offices are located in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. The "Wuxi Huazhong Silk Company" is located in Maozi Bridge in the city. Its organization is led by a Japanese general manager. Below the general manager, supervisors from each factory are also Japanese. The factory directors of each factory are Japanese, and the deputy factory directors are Chinese. It is divided into three departments: sorting, engineering, and affairs. The affairs of each department are as follows: (1) Sorting Department: opening workshop, sorting silk, inspection room; (2) Engineering Department: cocoon selection room, cocoon boiling room, silk reeling room, workshop, warehouse, waste silk room, power room, repair room; (3) Affairs Department: accounting, payroll, general affairs, miscellaneous affairs. Here is a list of the contents of the two silk factories that have reopened.

### Li Huitang Leads Effectively; Chinese Team Defeats Maritime Hegemon; All Troops Strive; Battle Tense; Eleven Team Members Injured Over Half; Navy's Strength High but Forwards' Shots Lack Assurance

[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] In an important football match, a team composed of mostly second-rate players was able to defeat a formidable opponent through the dedication of all its members and effective leadership.

Yesterday, the Chinese team was able to defeat the Navy in the Li Hua Cup, precisely because, as mentioned above, all eleven members of the team spared no effort. It was especially commendable that they achieved victory in the second half when more than half of the team members were injured.

All eleven members of the Chinese team deserve credit, but the most significant contributions came from Li Huitang in the forward line, Liang Rongzhao as the forward leader, and Tan Jun'gan in the defense. These three heroes are truly figures worthy of recognition.

With Huitang orchestrating the attack in the forward line, he remains calm unless he strikes like a river, and his reputation and amazing shooting skills require several defenders to restrain him wherever he goes. Even the goalkeeper Dixon, who likes to attack, is often held back by Huitang and dare not venture out easily. Although Huitang's performance was less outstanding, his success in restraining the enemy cannot be denied, and his teammates should forgive him for playing injured this time as he was doing his best, and he injured his waist before half-time, which considerably affected his performance.

The four goals scored were mainly due to flank attacks. As for Huitang's anchor-shaped attacks, they were too closely guarded to be easily executed. However, he contributed directly and indirectly to the victory, which shows that his tactics were effective.

Rongzhao advanced and retreated with purpose, demonstrating a powerful presence. He showed his true skill in midfield, especially after Xu Jingcheng was injured, when he had to take on more responsibilities, covering both interceptions and attacks, which was truly commendable.

Jun'gan showcased his defensive expertise, guarding the goal with many fine saves. Especially in the last twenty minutes, when the enemy attacked relentlessly, he used his skillful hands to avert danger. If the Navy had scored a goal at that time, the outcome of the game might have been different, making Jun'gan's contribution paramount.

Defenders Hou Rongsheng and Luo Weiquan lived up to expectations. Rongsheng's playing style was brave and agile, with commendable tackling and kicking skills, but his close-marking skills were not yet fully developed. Weiquan still played in the style of an old-fashioned halfback, but he was steady and reliable. However, because it was the first time he paired with Rongsheng, they sometimes overlapped in position.

Cheng He was injured at the end of the first half, but he continued to play with reduced mobility. However, he still managed to restrain Armstrong, preventing him from succeeding, which was a significant contribution. Zeng Zhongyun struggled against the formidable Kentish, but he persevered throughout, which was commendable.

Forward Zou Wenzhi carried the ball forward skillfully, and he and Hou Chengtou cooperated well. Zhuo Shijin was brave and performed well, while Chen Bingtou had many opportunities to move around, thanks to Shijin's passes, resulting in effective flank attacks.

The Navy's defeat was not due to inferior skills; in fact, their coordination was slightly better than the Chinese team's. However, their forwards lacked assurance in shooting, so they failed to score. Among the Navy's eleven players, Dixon performed the best, and Han Weilu was also good. The Navy had the upper hand in the midfield scramble, and Kentish and Speer also played well, creating many opportunities, but their poor shooting wasted their efforts.

Let's discuss the game and describe the battle situation. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:

Chinese Team

Tan Jun'gan, Luo Quan, Hou Rongsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rongzhao, Zeng Zhongyun, Hou Chengtou, Zou Wenzhi, Li Huitang, Zhuo Shijin, Chen Bingtou

Navy Team

Heather, Sutcliff, Barros, Fraser, Dixon, Han Weilu, Kentish, Touche, Henty, Speer, Armstrong

Nearly ten thousand spectators came to watch the match, causing a stir in Happy Valley. The Navy arrived late, and the game started at four o'clock.

As soon as the game started, Shijin and Bingtou charged forward, but Barros intercepted them.

In the blink of an eye, Shijin attacked again, firing a long-range shot that was slow, and Heather kicked it away.

After Chengtou was offside, Huitang made an initial probing attack, but Sutcliff blocked him, and Huitang had to retreat.

The Navy's forward line was eager to attack, but they could not overcome the Chinese team's defense and were unable to advance.

Soon after, Shijin and Bingtou combined to pressure the defense, with Shijin being particularly brave. Heather was trapped in a precarious position and could only barely save a corner kick. After Huitang took a shot, he was tackled by Touche.

Armstrong once attacked, but he was blocked by Jingcheng and Weiquan. On the other side, Huitang took two long-range shots, but both missed.

Kentish attacked again, but Rongsheng blocked him, resulting in a corner kick. Kentish delivered a dangerous ball, but Jun'gan made a fine save. Then Henty charged, but he was also stopped by Jun'gan.

At this moment, Jingcheng was injured and had to leave the field. Wenzhi immediately fell back to defend, just in case.

The Chinese team's morale was boosted and their attack did not diminish because of Jingcheng's temporary absence. Suddenly, Bingtou got the ball and sprinted forward. As he approached the goal line, he made a precise pass, but Chengtou missed the open goal, causing the spectators to sigh in disappointment.

Jingcheng returned, but he was less mobile. At this time, the Navy also gained momentum, and the Chinese team's defense was under pressure until Jun'gan cleared the ball, averting danger.

Shijin moved around actively and received a fine pass from Wenzhi, creating a promising opportunity, but he missed the shot.

Soon after, Bingtou also found an opening and shot at the goal, but the goalkeeper blocked it.

The Navy broke through and attacked again, and Rongzhao retreated to fight Touche, kicking the ball to the center. Huitang then passed it to Bingtou, who ran with the ball all the way. As he neared the goal, although he didn't score, the ball landed in front of Shijin. Huitang kicked it but unfortunately hit the post.

The two teams traded attacks, and the first half ended without any goals.

After the break, the Chinese team's attack became even more energetic. Soon after, Huitang passed the ball to Bingtou, who cut inside. Wenzhi headed the ball, and Heather, in a panic, punched it away. As the players scrambled, Bingtou arrived and slotted the ball into the net, opening the scoring and eliciting a roar of applause. At the same time, Shijin and Barros were both injured and fell to the ground. They left the field but soon returned.

The Chinese team took the lead, further boosting their morale. Bingtou attacked the goal again, and Heather dived to save it, but Shijin couldn't catch up, otherwise Heather would have conceded again.

After a period of siege, Dixon cleared the ball, and Speer, Henty, and Touche combined to attack. Seeing this, Rongsheng rushed to defend, but just as he reached Speer, the ball was shot, and Jun'gan's vision was blocked by Rongsheng. As he dived to save, the ball went into the net.

The score was tied at 1-1, making the situation tense. After the restart at the center, Huitang passed the ball to the left, and Wenzhi shot immediately. Heather was caught off guard and missed the ball, which went into the goal. The time between this goal and the previous one was less than a minute.

This was the golden age of the Chinese team. Soon after, Bingtou made another fine pass, but Chengtou was a step too late, missing a good opportunity.

A while later, Huitang made a fine pass, and Chengtou charged ahead, dribbling past Barros and Heather, and then shooting into the net, making the score 3-1.

The Navy, losing again, launched a counter-attack. Kentish and Touche took several dangerous shots at the goal, causing the spectators to tremble. Fortunately, Jun'gan made several brilliant saves, turning danger into safety.

Huitang had a chance to go one-on-one, but his shot missed. Then Shijin contested the ball with Dixon and was injured again. The Navy attacked again, causing Jun'gan to be very busy, but his good skills were on full display, earning praise from the spectators.

Shijin returned to the field, and the Soviet politics started again. Bingtou got the ball and passed it to the center perfectly. Huitang trapped and shot, Heather didn't know what to do. The ball went into the net, and the Chinese team's victory was sealed.

After that, the two teams continued to attack and defend, which was still entertaining. Until the horn sounded, the two armies collected their troops. Thus, the Chinese team won the final (Ball by Tai Sui).

### Women's Basketball Game Tonight

Three women's basketball games will be held at the basketball court tonight. The first game is Paul vs. Meifang. Paul is a weak team this year and will likely be easily defeated by Meifang. The second game is Snowflakes vs. Southwest. Although Snowflakes has Luo Qiaobin, Chen Manhong, and Chen Sihua, Southwest is quite strong and has Zhu Qingji, Wu Ruixin, and Ye Peizhi. With good leadership in the midfield, Snowflakes may not be their match. The third game is Sisi vs. Nanhua. Sisi is not a strong team, but Han Huixian, Zhong Qinfang, and Li Yumei are not weak in their offensive efforts. Nanhua has Li Ruomei, Li Yufen, and Li Shuzi. Therefore, Sisi will likely need to fight hard to achieve the final victory.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... The Baroness and the Butler

Baroness and the Butler

Originally a famous stage comedy, now adapted into a film, the story itself has a strong comedic flavor, coupled with the humorous stars William Powell and Anna Bella's energetic performances, making this film an excellent and successful work.

William Powell plays a butler, the most capable servant in a certain earl's household, handling all household matters meticulously. The entire earl's family is extremely satisfied with him. But unexpectedly, this butler secretly engages in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, standing on the side of the party opposed to his master. Professionally, he is a loyal servant to his master, but politically, he eloquently attacks his master. The earl is broad-minded and understanding, but the earl's daughter, a standard aristocratic lady (played by Anna Bella), is the most unconvinced. The conflicting situation creates a series of jokes.

The film has excellent dialogue, containing truth within humor. William Powell's style remains unchanged, with calm composure concealing laughter. Anna Bella, in her first American-made film, also gives an excellent performance.

Queen... Excerpts from Color Films

Walt Disney's pen-and-ink cartoons are praised and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", attracting greater attention from film enthusiasts. The screening of "Excerpts from Color Films" selects and combines his latest works, a total of ten films, listed below:

"The Fox Hunt", "The Mad Parrot", "Livestock Symphony", "Golfing Jokes", "Prince of the Crystal Palace", "Silver Anniversary", "Whaling Record", "Lucky Day", "Incompatible Cattle", "Giant Record"

The painting techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and sounds, are perfect. The stories are concise and lively, full of rich interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "Incompatible Cattle", "Prince of the Crystal Palace", "Silver Anniversary Fairy Tale", and "Giant Record" are particularly outstanding.

Peace... Modern Female Detective

The Mad Miss Manton

A film that combines romance and mysterious murder cases, performed in a humorous and crazy style. Bai Peilan Stanfei plays a spoiled socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse and reports it to the police. When the detectives arrive, the corpse has already been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual behavior, people think it's a lie she made up to get attention. This clearly wrongs her, and what she can't stand is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) coldly mocks her in the newspaper. So, she unites a group of sisters to conduct detective work. After discovering a second corpse, people sympathize and believe her, especially the young editor, who provides great help. At that time, the murderer tries to kill her to silence her, but she is saved by the police who surround and annihilate the murderer.

The plot in the film lacks some possibilities, but the excellent performances of the actors make the development of the plot natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the assassination case is also quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film, because what seems to attract people in this film is not a tense and serious detective story, but a strong sense of comedy.

East... Everybody Sing

Starring Judy Garland, whose singing voice is not as moving as Diana Po Ping, but is also an extremely talented newcomer. The film writes about a drama-crazed family, so everything is biased towards comedy and song and dance. It has the colors of general Hollywood musicals. She not only sings well, but also has good expressions. Allen Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Dragon Advises the Army".

Dahua... Adventures of Tom Sawyer

A very good literary film based on Mark Twain's thick book. Although the whole film is very long, the director handles it well. The light and lively rhythm makes us not feel bored. Part of it is also due to the outstanding performances of a group of child actors, especially the two leads. Aunt Mei's performance is also very good. The color photography further increases the value of the film.

New World... Zheng Yi, A Affectionate Seed

Starring Xu Manli, Fu Shanxiao

Central... Pearl Shirt

Chen Charlie of Hollywood had only just passed away, and now a Chen Charlie has emerged in the Chinese film industry. This speculative means requires no publicity efforts and can reap the benefits of a draw. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers is evident from this, but the film's content and story are not cleverly written. At the same time, all the tense scenes failed to be fully developed. The description of the actions of the bandits failed more than it succeeded. The allocation of actors was also not very suitable. Except for Gu Qiong, who had a fair level of success, Gu Lanjun and Hong Ling did not act in the play. Xu Qunyuan's Chen Charlie. The facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of actions is still a long way off.

### Nanhua Fights South Vietnam B at Night; Nanhua Performs Excellently, Winning 4-2

(Saigon Airmail Special Dispatch) Yesterday, the 14th (Saturday) night, the Nanhua football team, which had triumphed three times, fought against the South Vietnam League B team at the Saigon Stone Stadium. The reporter, driven by the fans, arrived early. The audience that night was still very crowded, but slightly less than the previous game. The reason is that Gong has been losing for days, and the local audience's expectations have greatly diminished. The reason for the slightly smaller number of visitors that night may be based on this. At 8 o'clock, the game began, first by two local barefoot teams playing to entertain the audience. At the beginning of the battle, the two teams fought bravely, but thousands of fans were determined to admire Nanhua's skills. They mostly ignored the barefoot immortals, focusing on the arrival of the swan and the five mountains rather than the spring mountains. Looking forward eagerly, the spectators were quite anxious. Suddenly, applause erupted, and the Nanhua flag fluttered in front of the audience amid tens of thousands of cheers. The lineup that night was as follows:

Nanhua Club

Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Tianshen, Liu Songsheng, Xie Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi

South Vietnam B

Fei, Abe, Arashi, Arden, Kiju, Ayin, Akai, Abang, Dinu, Ashida, Amon

As the silver whistle blew, the two teams clashed. The League team took the offensive first, and enemy figures appeared frequently in Nanhua's camp. Our army was very busy dealing with the attacks, but fortunately, the defenders were doing their best to defend the territory. Zhang Rongcai saved several goals in a row, which can be called excellent. Tiansheng was still strong, desperately defending the city. The League team had two corner kicks, both of which were cleared by Tiansheng, and the League team missed the opportunity. Nanhua then turned to attack. Xie Zhaorong got the ball on the right, and Yang Shuiyi launched an attack on the frontier, shooting desperately, but was unfortunately caught by the enemy goalkeeper. It was accidental. The League team counterattacked and approached our goal. The center "Dinu" kicked with all his strength, and the audience was shocked and very nervous, but unfortunately, his foot was not accurate, and the ball flew high and out. "Dinu" was indeed low-energy, just shouting haha. The two sides fought for a long time, but there was no construction. The South team had been quiet for a long time and began to move, trying to attack. Shuiyi was short and agile, Songsheng was brave and crowned the three armies, Jingxiang was experienced and old-fashioned, Xie was amazingly skilled, and Dehui attacked the enemy's goal, but was thrown down. Shuiyi was given a corner kick, and Zhaorong missed a kick, which was a pity. At this time, the League team's rearguard was still feeling guerrilla harassment. Traces of our army could be seen everywhere in the enemy's city gate. Shuiyi got a send-off from Dehui, and Dehui was blessed. Xie Zhaorong did not fail his mission and scored with a kick, and the audience cheered and praised him. Not arrogant in victory, Nanhua attacked the enemy's goal again. Jingxiang got the ball and was very magical, breaking through ten. Aiming accurately, he shot the ball forcefully, which can be called a fatal blow, but unfortunately, it hit the door frame and bounced out of the city. Zhaorong rushed forward and kicked the ball over the goal, and the audience was happy. What? The central general Dehui carried the ball to seize the throne, flew over three passes, bravely passed six generals, and gently picked the ball into the goal, and the audience cheered, praising him as the pride of art.

Becoming angry out of shame, a League player began to foul. His offside action attacked Jingxiang's magic legs, displaying his brutality. Two defenders also gradually presented the skills of Qian Donkey (kicking people with their hind hooves). Zuo General Songsheng was not afraid and bravely grabbed several balls, greatly frustrating his arrogance. A kick arrived, but Jingxiang's header was in vain, which was a pity. Then, the silver whistle blew, and the first half was over. Nanhua took the lead with one to zero. After eating the lemon, he reorganized his hero. The League team launched a counter-attack, with two corner kicks, which were very urgent. He accepted it with shame, Rongcai took it back twice, and General Qingcai got the ball and sent it to Shen Leg, and Jingxiang played a beautiful style, passing it to Shuiyi to cause trouble on the border, and Shuiyi scored with one kick.

After losing three balls, the League team felt too much loss. Encouraged by the onlookers, they began to turn hard and change the mountains. At first, Nanhua was based on art and did not pay attention to it, so they contained their edge and slightly let the opponent have a chance to move. Songsheng was tackled, and Guowei could not bear to sit idly by, and rushed forward. The opponent's right guard turned his buttocks to the sky, with a tumbling gourd, deservedly. The audience was delighted.

Songsheng was majestic in all directions, bravely surpassing the enemy generals, and fell down quickly, but was caught empty. Jingxiang was full of skill, and his art was skilled. Seeing Arden intentionally picking on Pingtong's legs, he performed magical balls, and Arden was barbaric, but there was no way to do it. At this time, the war had turned into worsening. The enemy riders were gradually seen in our camp, and the wind and smoke outside the Great Wall. Tiansheng worked hard, but even a thousand Lu would have a loss. The League team took the opportunity to shoot a goal in the middle, breaking his clean sheet record. From then on, the League team's military prestige was slightly shaken, and its unruly intentions gradually became apparent. With the army approaching the city, the enemy was in a hurry, pulling people and pulling hands, pushing and shoving. People are fair, and the sentence is a penalty. Jingxiang, who was the main kicker, gave up on his own, and the audience praised Wu. The team gained momentum and attacked. Tiansheng gave up the rescue, and the ball accidentally touched his hand. Being sentenced and scoring automatically, Abang took the main kick, concentrating on the whole spirit, and struggling to throw, and it really entered the net. Our team did not consider it a humiliation, and tried to counterattack. The army started, and in a blink of an eye, it went deep into the enemy's line. Xie got the ball and sent Dehui. The three armies started, and the big fear of the battle was announced. Returning to the teacher to save the emergency, Naine was too numerous and confused, and Mo Wan was frantic. De scored in the million army, kicking the success and laying the record of the last victory. What? With the silver whistle once, Nanhua played the triumphal song with four to two. (Zhu Zhaoheng)

Freedom Talks

### The Harvest of the Fifth Plenary Session

— Luo Er

The Fifth Plenary Session is currently in session. All the people of China are surrounding it with intense enthusiasm, and pouring into it ardent hopes, for this conference of great historical significance.

The Fifth Plenary Session is convened at a new stage of the War of Resistance, in an environment where national traitors are being purged and the internal and external situations of the War of Resistance are improving. At the same time, it is also convened under the new military offensive launched by the × people. This conference has a solemn significance and a great role in the future of the War of Resistance. This is what all the people of China today, especially comrades engaged in cultural work, need to deeply recognize.

According to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 19th, the content of this conference is very rich, such as: further strengthening military and political institutions; severely expanding and carrying out anti-traitor work, confiscating all property of national traitors; reducing taxes and improving people's livelihood to concentrate the vital forces of the entire nation; revising the regulations of the Three People's Principles Youth League to further unite the youth of the country, expand and develop the united front organization of the national youth; establishing a special committee to handle cooperation matters between various parties; establishing an international anti-aggression front, etc. These are all urgent tasks of this conference, and also the work that the people of the whole country eagerly hope the government will quickly resolve.

Therefore, today, cultural workers, facing such a Fifth Plenary Session, should undertake the following five tasks: First, to conduct widespread publicity and explanation of the significance of this conference to the masses, to hold various forms of seminars, celebrations, and even review meetings after the Fifth Plenary Session, etc. In various forms of meetings, to raise the enthusiasm and understanding of the masses about this conference. Second, to fully reflect the hopes and opinions of the people regarding this conference; according to the living environment and specific conditions of the masses, to raise the issues that are particularly felt to be needed and concerned, and link them to the issue of the second phase of the War of Resistance, so that the masses deeply recognize that the Fifth Plenary Session is a conference that directly relates to the entire War of Resistance and directly relates to the happiness of the people across the country. Third, to take various opinions and propositions related to the future War of Resistance as the goals of all future movements, so that everyone consciously understands that it is necessary to complete these goals with a more proactive attitude. Fourth, cultural workers, under this new situation, should strengthen their concern for political issues, unite personal life with the political life of the entire War of Resistance, and enhance the active role of cultural work in the future War of Resistance. Fifth, continue the anti-traitor movement in culture. This movement has a particularly serious significance at present because various pro-Japanese traitors and the special service agencies of Japanese imperialism are shamelessly attempting to use various despicable means to undermine this Fifth Plenary Session. Certain pro-Japanese and traitorous newspapers are spreading hateful rumors every day, slandering the government, and sabotaging the War of Resistance. Everyone understands the importance of this work.

The above work should be enthusiastically carried out by comrades in the cultural circles not only during the Fifth Plenary Session, but especially after the Fifth Plenary Session.

### Record of a Trip Back and Forth to Pingshi and Lechang

— Yu Jian

The car arrived in Binzhou at dusk, and it was already one o'clock in the deep night when we arrived in Lechang. I heard that we could reach Guangzhou tomorrow morning.

However, the car stopped for an hour, then another hour. Later, I learned that something was damaged in the front axle of the engine. It was repaired and repaired again. Seeing that it was dawn, and the × planes were sure to come and bomb every day, it was very dangerous to move forward. So the car retreated back amidst the curses of the passengers.

The impatience and anxiety of the passengers were immediately soothed by half by the beautiful scenery outside the car window - the highway climbed along the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. To the west was not only the Beijiang River, but also towering peaks and dense green trees. It was rare to see a few reddish-brown wooden houses. There were many white stone beaches in the Beijiang River. When the clear green water reached there, it stirred up whiter waves like boiling water. From time to time, there was a wooden raft or a few small boats by the river. Shrinking back behind the car window, many passengers were heard thanking the retreat for allowing them to see the scenery they had missed while sleeping last night.

Around ten o'clock, we arrived at Pingshi and stopped for repairs. I heard that it was repaired, so we set off for Lechang again at three o'clock in the afternoon.

Not long after arriving at the Lechang station, we heard the sound of airplanes. Passengers and vendors scattered into the fields. The plane flew overhead, just circling. A bold and observant station attendant later discovered that it was our own plane, so he announced loudly - passengers, this is when they gathered again.

Everyone laughed at the unnecessary hiding just now. At this time, a station attendant standing next to me told me a story of the × planes this month:

One day, three × bombers came to bomb the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. One of them crashed into the mountain wall while soaring up after diving, and fell down. The next day, two more enemy planes flew over and circled above our heads. Finally, we saw one of the planes drop a ball of something. People lying on the ground were waiting for the violent explosion sound and the flying soil, but there was no sound at all. At that time, the × planes also flew away quickly.

What was going on? Everyone was curious, so a station attendant ran to see what was going on. Near the crashed × plane, there were two wreaths lying on the ground. A letter was attached to the wreath, containing twenty yuan of Central Bank notes and a short pair of letters. The gist was: "We are all forced to fight and do not want to massacre the people of your country. We firmly believe that the time for handshakes and good relations is not far away. Please use the money in the letter to bury the Japanese pilot, and please put the wreath on the grave," and so on.

The car still did not start at nine o'clock in the evening. I heard that the engine was broken again and was being repaired in the engine factory. So the platform gradually filled with passengers, and there were voices of dissatisfaction and blame everywhere, but there were also cold and sarcastic words. I heard one sentence.

"It would be great if the expedition was so enthusiastic!"

If the people who escaped to the safe rear and evaded their sacred responsibilities heard this sentence, I think they would at least be ashamed and sweat.

Half an hour later, the engine was connected. It was still the broken engine. At first, everyone was worried that it would break down halfway. Many people who forced the stationmaster to put on this engine began to complain that others should not be so impatient, but all the way through Qujiang and Yingde, the uneasy people were able to sleep peacefully.

Blame and attack are the easiest, and enjoying success is also the easiest, but there are still few who try their best to help. I thought of the engine, and I kept saying that to myself.

### A Little Friend Who Died for His Country

— You Ru

Yesterday, I received a letter from Zhu Jun, saying that her younger brother, Tong Jun, died suddenly in Boluo County due to overwork after illness when he set off to serve on the East River front last year. Tong Jun was the son of my friend. This sacrifice for the country made me feel sad both personally and publicly.

I remember last year, Tong Jun was only eighteen years old and had always been the only son loved by your mother. However, he did not listen to his family's advice and resolutely joined the conscript team. At that time, your passionate enthusiasm moved me greatly. "I would rather die on the battlefield than stay at home." Didn't you say such fierce words? I knew that the words would really become your own request.

When you wore the uniform of the conscript team for the first time and participated in military training that day, how happy and excited you were, straightening your chest, taking strides, and striding proudly into the house. I still remember your posture very clearly. You have always been gentle and obedient, but you have gradually become stubborn; you have always been approachable, but you have gradually become brave and fierce. You became a lover of guns and wished you could grab one and keep it by your side, so that you could kill the × people and traitors at any time. You were always annoyed by this, not understanding why the government did not issue guns to you. "A Tong has changed." Your mother was very worried about you; she repeatedly asked me to dissuade you, but why should I dissuade you? You have not done anything wrong. On the contrary, I sympathize with you very much. You are being tempered day by day in the furnace of the national revolutionary war, just like other sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

The bombing of Huangsha continued for a year. Every time you rescued injured compatriots, you risked going to the disaster area. You were too anxious. You had to go before the air raid alarm was lifted. Didn't you get injured once or twice because of this? Looking back now, it was a great miracle that you did not die in the bombing of Huangsha at that time.

However, speaking of your death, I can't help but blame you: You were really too anxious. You shouldn't have rushed to the front line after a serious illness without even resting for a while. "The × people are about to invade, why rest? Even if I don't have the strength to take a gun to kill ×, it's good to do some rescue and transportation work." You used this as a reason to reject our advice. When you participated in the pre-war service team and set off for Boluo that day, I saw your pale face and frail body, and I was already worried about your health. Alas! Who would have thought that you really lost your life due to weakness and overwork! I heard that when you were carried back to the apartment that day, you lay down and fell down, and you parted ways with us forever!

You did not die from the bombing of the × people, nor did you die from the terrible tropical fever, but you died on the front line of the War of Resistance, in your own post. This may be the happiest thing for you. Although you cannot hold a gun to kill × and die on the battlefield, you are just as brave and just as heroic as them.

When I received the letter from your sister, I couldn't help but feel pain for a while, and tears almost came out. But I immediately held back. I know that sorrow is an insult to you. I should only praise and admire your death.

Tong! You have already died. In the history of national revolution, you have your glorious achievements. That spirit of not fearing death will always shine in the hearts of your friends and comrades; moreover, for them, it is also a powerful spur and encouragement.

Tong! You are forever immortal in our hearts.

### Starting from a Strange Fire

— Jin Chi

A few days ago (the 15th), a Hong Kong evening newspaper contained the following news:

(Shanghai Electric (Mingxing Company (the 13th, a big fire, the cause is unknown, but the × side had previously sought cooperation, but Mingxing did not allow it, and the next day there was a fire.

The headline is:

"Strange Fire Occurs at Shanghai Mingxing Company"

Fire and strange are really unheard of before. The reason why the fire at Mingxing Company is called strange is because it did not allow cooperation with the × side, and the next day there was a fire. What is the reason? Probably everyone can imagine it. This is also what we are used to seeing. If it gets strange, it is really infinitely strange. Just in Shanghai alone, the discovery of strange planes, strange bullets, and strange leaflets is almost a daily occurrence, and these strange things all happen because they do not allow cooperation with the × side. The discovery of strange planes spreading strange leaflets impersonating our ambassador abroad is because our government does not allow cooperation with the × side and compromise halfway. The discovery of strange bullets is because people of integrity do not allow cooperation with the × side and are willing to be puppets of the × side. There are countless similar examples. However, this also shows that the × side is becoming increasingly exhausted.

As for fire, like the strange fire that occurred at Mingxing Company, it has already spread across half of China today, and many places have been burned to scorched earth. If we are not forgetful, we will always remember that the × side would have asked us to talk to them about "Japan-China Cooperation" and "China-Japan-Manchukuo Anti-Communist Agreement" and other types of cooperation. However, can this strange fire make us afraid? No, we are not afraid at all. Because we are not afraid of such strange fire, such strange fire may spread even more. This is also what we expected, but I am not afraid. Only the weak-willed national traitors will tremble in the face of this strange fire, and thus be cowardly and weak, falling into the trap of the × side. Now, the new Qin Hui, who has always been spreading pessimistic and defeated views, has publicly surrendered to the × side because he is afraid of this fire that has burned across half of China. But this is also good. We just want to use this strange fire to extinguish the internal corruption of our nation.

An ancient saying says: "If you see something strange and don't find it strange, the strangeness will defeat itself." We not only want to make the strange fire that occurs because we do not allow cooperation with the × side defeat and extinguish itself, but we also want to grow and become strong from this strange fire, and completely eliminate all the people who set the strange fire!

### Jottings on the March

— Li Huiying

Where did the owner of the house move to? What did he do? Moving, why didn't he move his things away? So, what is the reason for this? That's right, the "army" and the "people" should cooperate, but looking at this situation, can the word "cooperation" still be uttered? However, should the blame be placed on the ordinary people for this? Please think, if there is no other reason for the ordinary people living well, they would not want to leave their hometowns and go far away. Those who understand a little should be able to guess a little reason. No matter what "sacred" and "great" nice-sounding words, they cannot completely cover up the "faults."

The political education of the army and the basic education of the people seem so important! From this, we can know the difficulties of mobilizing the masses even more.

I saw many empty houses by the roadside, and I felt a heavy stimulation in my heart; but later, when I caught up with the team and arrived at Linshanhe, the market in this small town was more prosperous than when I passed by a month ago.

Reaching Linshanhe Again

The season has already reached autumn. This is because when we arrived at Linshanhe, we saw that many decent people on the street had changed into long robes.

This small town is only three miles away from the shore of the lake. People who live by fishing in the lake take the fish they catch to the fish market here every day to sell. When we opened east last time, we lived in the fish market, and this time we opened north, we lived in the same place, and became familiar friends with the big-bellied fat boss.

"Where are you going?"

As soon as we met, he put on a smiling face and asked with concern. Then, without waiting for a reply, he said:

"You are very hard."

"It's nothing. This time we are opening north, and the place is not yet certain. It's too much trouble for you."

"Don't be polite." (To be continued)
