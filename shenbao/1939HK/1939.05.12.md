### Reflections on European and American Diplomacy

Loving peace and valuing promises are the customs of a civilized society. Therefore, the lessons of violence and the loss of credibility, though numerous, and the repeated setbacks over the years, though causing heartache, have not diminished the longing for peace and the hope that promises can be relied upon. Those who yearn for and pursue these ideals are countless. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's telegram to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini on April 15, calling for world peace and requesting guarantees for 30 nations, is a representative work of this undying habit. With Hitler's speech on the 28th, and Japan's informal indication that it did not intend to join the German-Italian military alliance, public sentiment seemed to calm down somewhat in recent days. Although discussions still unanimously pointed to the ongoing crisis and the lack of improvement in the tense situation, there was a secret rejoicing that the door to diplomacy had not been closed. People say that peace is uncertain, and promises are untrustworthy, but isn't diplomacy supposed to be based on peace and promises? Without a solid foundation, even if the door to diplomacy is wide open, it seems futile.

The reaction of European and American governments and the public to Hitler's speech was remarkably relaxed. According to common sense, this apparent relaxation likely conceals internal deliberations and will not end in mere relaxation. Just considering the current situation, while Britain does not abandon its anti-aggression alliance or its conscription policy, it readily takes Hitler's overtures to Britain as a topic for cabinet discussion and views Hitler's mutual guarantee proposal as a path worth trying. The tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is frequently reported to be progressing well, but the demeanor of courteous advance and retreat still maintains a semblance of peace and prosperity, as if in a golden age, not a plan to cope with emergencies. Hitler alone does not forgive Poland, so the most tense reaction seems to be limited to Poland. As for the United States, it intends to follow Hitler's lead and enact a second equation through normal diplomatic channels, believing that a mutual guarantee is possible and unwilling to lightly abandon the opportunity. The attitude of various countries towards Japan's expressed position is that if the Anti-Comintern Pact is not changed into a military alliance, Europe and the United States will have no worries about the East. Newspapers in London and Paris even see this as an important factor in the current situation, saying that it "is of great benefit to maintaining peace and can have a significant impact on Anglo-Japanese relations, paving the way for economic cooperation between the two countries."

From our perspective, the key to the future of the international situation does not lie here at all. In Europe, Germany's theories can often be answered by history and geography textbooks for middle and high schools, yet European and American politicians are left speechless. They claim they have never invaded, theoretically based on natural desires and living space, and factually evidenced by the fact that various countries have said they have not been threatened. Based on their arguments, they can at any time select the most historically favorable fragment for the Germanic people to promote. When asking whether they pose a threat to various countries, they do not need to ask the already deceased Austria and Czechoslovakia, nor do they need to ask Lithuania, which lost Memel, or Poland, which is trying to preserve Danzig. Even regarding the Czech problem, after instigating internal discord, they accept the request and provide protection, so in form, they can disclaim aggression. Moreover, if the German-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement had any value before April 28, it is a question, but once unilaterally abandoned, what can Britain and Poland do? Therefore, even if Germany follows Roosevelt's proposal and gives each country a guarantee, even if, as some people hope, it enters the door of diplomacy and concludes agreements with each, who can guarantee that it will never be abandoned at any time? Who can guarantee that it will never instigate minority groups to let wolves into the house? Furthermore, regarding the Far East, whether Japan colludes with Germany and Italy is not a matter of alliances, but only a matter of Japan's strength and the opportunities given to Japan by various parties. When opportunities are given and strength allows, actions follow, without waiting for alliances. Isn't the occupation of the New Southern Islands an example? In short, aggressive actions are the product of aggressive policies, and aggressive policies shift according to the tools of aggression. To pray for peace to aggressors today, or to secretly rejoice at the aggressors' temporary non-expansion of aggression, will ultimately lead to the regret of biting one's navel. The way to establish international order lies not in consulting the opinions of aggressors, nor in spying on the attitudes of aggressors, but in adopting collectively effective methods to stop aggression.

### Promoting the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement

â€” Pan Lang

The industrial cooperative movement is currently a progressive economic and social movement in China, a new undertaking to increase production in the rear, support the long-term war of resistance, and build a Republic of the Three Principles of the People. This undertaking or movement, since its enthusiastic promotion by President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife and President Kung Hsiang-hsi, has only been around for eight or nine months, but it has already spread throughout the country, especially in the northwest and southwest provinces, which have historically been industrially underdeveloped. It has not only become a bright banner ensuring victory in the War of Resistance, but has also unfolded a brilliant future for China's modernization and industrialization. It has not only aroused the interest and support of every patriotic compatriot, but has also attracted the attention, sympathy, and assistance of righteous people from friendly countries.

The so-called industrial cooperative movement, simply put, is to use the cooperative model to accommodate refugees and technicians from war zones, and to establish light and heavy industries of various sizes or to assist the movement and development of all existing industries in the rear and guerrilla areas. This undertaking has been promoted and proven effective in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. Now it is to be nationalized. The most important tasks at present are, first, to organize the following three types of industrial cooperatives: (1) establishing mobile units within the war zone, which can supply the army with urgently needed goods on the one hand, and become the center of local economic organization on the other hand, supplying agricultural and rural people with their manufactured products, and preventing Japanese goods from entering areas close to the guarded area, so it can be called the first line of economic defense. (2) Establishing units between the front line and the rear, with a wider scope and a greater role, constituting the second line of economic defense. (3) Establishing units in safer provinces, using larger machinery, employing a large number of workers, assisting existing larger industries, assisting in the implementation of the government's overall economic plan, and constituting the third line of economic defense.

The second is to be responsible for registering workers, technical experts, and tools and machinery left in the war zone or occupied by the [Japanese] army, and at the same time assist industrialists in the war zone or areas about to fall into the war zone to move workers, technical experts, and machinery and equipment to safe areas. Furthermore, it is to raise funds for the development and execution of cooperative business plans. At the same time, it is actively responsible for training a considerable number of staff members for the purpose of promoting the industrial cooperative cause.

According to the plan of the China Industrial Cooperative Association, four district offices are to be established nationwide: one in Ji'an, Jiangxi, to meet the needs of the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong; one in Shaoyang, Hunan, to meet the needs of Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other places; one in Wanxian, Sichuan, to meet the needs of Hubei and Anhui; and one in Baoji, Shaanxi, to meet the needs of Gansu and North China. The initial plan has already decided to establish 30,000 industrial cooperatives in the interior. The combined forces of the government, industrialists, workers, and friendly countries will equally assist in promoting the entire industrial cooperative movement.

In Hong Kong, a Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives has also been established, jointly organized by Chinese and foreign celebrities, gentlemen, and merchants in Hong Kong, with Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, as honorary chairman. Its work, in addition to the general plan of the head office, is mainly to contact people overseas who are enthusiastic about the industrial cooperative movement, so as to help promote the industrial cooperative cause in China with financial and human resources, and to convey the latest developments of the domestic industrial cooperative to overseas compatriots, so that they can pay more attention to and support this movement. The association is now preparing to launch a fundraising campaign in Hong Kong in order to expand its promotional work. Recently, a preparatory committee has been jointly organized by Chinese and Western celebrities in Hong Kong, and a tea party will be held at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 4:30 pm today (12th) to promote the importance of the association's work to national defense production and the development of Chinese industry, so that overseas compatriots and friendly people can have a better understanding, so that they can sympathize, assist, and expand the organization, in order to realize production for national salvation and production for national construction. We believe that the efforts of the Hong Kong Promotion Committee are worthy of attention, especially an event worth paying special attention to by overseas compatriots.

At present, the Chinese nation is facing a new difficult stage. The combat effectiveness of the front lines in various places urgently needs to be strengthened in a serious and universal way. The guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare movement on the flanks of the [Japanese] army urgently needs to be carried out widely and strongly, and the concentration, organization, training, and utilization of the dynamic forces of the people in the vast rear is especially urgently needed. If we do not work hard on this, then we will still be unable to prevent the [Japanese] army from penetrating deeply and bombing indiscriminately, and we will still be unable to take the initiative in a comprehensive general counter-offensive and strive for final victory. But if we want to seriously intensify our efforts on the above-mentioned needs, then promoting the industrial cooperative movement in the war zone, the rear of the [Japanese] army, and the vast rear has a very important significance. Everyone knows that modern warfare is completely dependent on the economy, so we must first strengthen the economic defense line, promote economic strategy, and actively and effectively use economic strength to supply the needs of the front line and the rear of the [Japanese] army. The Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement is the main step in concentrating the dynamic forces of the entire nation, supporting the long-term war of resistance, and striving for final victory. This is the first point we want to loudly call on all sectors to work together on.

According to reports from various telegraphs and communications, since the War of Resistance, most of the major factories occupied by the [Japanese] have already resumed operations under the pressure of the [Japanese] army's bayonets, manufacturing weapons, directly and indirectly, to kill us. According to recent reports and various telegraphs, the occupied areas and even the areas close to the front lines, even as far as Shantou, Shaoguan, and Changsha, have been filled with Japanese goods that have been disguised. If we do not quickly promote industrial cooperation, not only will our long-term resistance be immediately affected, but also the future of China's industrialization and modernization will encounter an unusually major blow. Those directly affected are, of course, the national industrialists and merchants of our country who have survived many hardships, and indirectly, we can think of the doubled suffering of millions of hardworking people, and we can think of the loss of the best position for developing economic undertakings for the vast number of overseas compatriots and friendly people. Promoting the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement is the primary step in laying the foundation for the future development of Chinese industry in the difficult process of the War of Resistance. If we do a good job in this foundational project today, and the industrial cooperative movement develops, then the ideal of building an industrialized and modern country in the future, that is, building a Republic of the Three Principles of the People with national independence, civil rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness, will surely be realized smoothly. This is the second point we want to call on all sectors to work together on.

However, the promotion and development of this movement will not be enough if it only relies on the government and enthusiastic people in the country to promote it. Therefore, first of all, we must encourage overseas compatriots to work together and respond with sympathy. Businessmen should recognize the importance of this movement, which enriches the country and benefits the people, saves people and benefits themselves, and actively contribute money to help promote it. All engineering and technical personnel and the vast number of workers or unemployed workers should also recognize the current needs of the motherland and seek their own proper development in the future and reasonable improvement in life, and step forward, enthusiastically respond, request registration, organize strongly, and return to the motherland to serve for industrial cooperation. Secondly, the head office's plan to "establish 30,000 industrial cooperatives" is not a difficult task in the scope of the whole of China, and it is also the minimum necessary undertaking to support the War of Resistance and revive the nation. However, this plan has not yet been perfectly achieved, so we must improve everyone's self-esteem and self-confidence. We must mobilize the vast number of intellectuals, technical talents, workers, women, unemployed youth, and displaced compatriots among overseas Chinese to jointly promote this work directly or indirectly, to realize the establishment of 30,000 industrial cooperatives nationwide, to realize the establishment of hundreds and thousands of promotion committees overseas, to realize the consolidation of the economic defense line, and finally defeat the [Japanese]. This is the third point we want to loudly call on all sectors to work together on.

Finally, and most importantly, we would also like to offer three suggestions: First, in this industrial cooperative movement, we must fully express the spirit of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, not only to cooperate vigorously regardless of ethnicity or party affiliation, but also to fully realize labor-management cooperation, and to carry out propaganda and education work to unite the hardworking masses, refugees, and vagrants, while also focusing on improving the lives of industrial cooperative employees. Second, we must fully express the spirit of democracy and talent, on the one hand, we must severely eliminate the habits of bureaucracy and the style of liberalism, and on the other hand, we must improve the democratic emotions of all members participating in the industrial cooperative movement, donate prejudices of parties or systems, promote true talents, gather ideas, help each other, and help each other to seek the development of the cause. Third, we must also step up international propaganda, carry out national diplomacy, mobilize the opinion circles, and arouse greater attention and sympathy for our industrial cooperative movement among friendly countries, and arouse their interest in research, investigation, and participation. We must recognize that only with this effort can the Chinese industrial cooperative movement perfectly fulfill its great mission. And only with the smooth progress of the Chinese industrial cooperative movement can we further strengthen the determination of the Chinese and international people to support the War of Resistance, and make the future of winning the War of Resistance and building the country more secure!

### Summary of the Latinized Chinese Character Movement Over the Past Eight Years

â€” Sun Guangling

The Latinized Chinese character movement has always taken the thirteen "Principles of Latinizing Chinese Characters" as the "basic program of the movement." Those thirteen principles were resolved at the 1931 Latinized Chinese Character Congress, which is now eight years ago. In these eight years, the social situation has greatly progressed, and those engaged in the teaching and research of Latinized Chinese characters have also accumulated countless experiences. When the Latinized Chinese character movement is being universally carried out, there is a need to compile these experiences and look forward to the future of the movement as a guide for the future movement. Therefore, after enthusiastic discussions and careful considerations by the movement colleagues, a new program was produced.

This new program is a concrete development of those thirteen principles in line with the current situation and the collection of eight years of practice. Those thirteen principles are a historical document. It is absolutely impossible to forget them. But it is even more impossible to ignore this new program, which is based on those principles to determine the basic attitude towards the national Latinized Chinese character movement at this time and place. For this new program, it is necessary to achieve the following two points as in the past for those thirteen principles: (1) To take it as the basic program of the Latinized Chinese character movement in China today; (2) To strive for national implementation in order to achieve the grand development of the Latinized Chinese character movement in all aspects of China, to eliminate illiteracy, popularize culture, and build an unprecedentedly bright and great new China. This is the responsibility that we, who are dedicated to the Latinized Chinese character movement, should undertake with unparalleled courage and perseverance.

(1) Any cultural movement in history reflects the social needs of the nation at that time. What we have now is an unprecedented new historical environment. We need everyone to unite together, and everyone to understand their responsibilities to the country and the nation. At this time, we especially need to quickly and widely launch a new cultural enlightenment movement. We must immediately eliminate illiteracy and popularize culture. Therefore, we also need to immediately solve the problem of the characters used as tools for eliminating illiteracy. From the ancient, cumbersome, and difficult characters, we need to evolve a kind of simple, rational characters that are close to the people and adapt to the requirements of modern science and literature.

We are now at a time when the whole country is working together to build a new democratic country. This must also be the time when the character reform movement needs to move forward without hesitation. Looking back on the past, the initial forms of our phonetic writing were discovered not long after the forces of foreign commercial capital invaded. Those initial forms of phonetic writing were scattered in the works of Matt Riool, Laiane Cattaneo, and others three hundred years ago, and the most complete one was found in the book "Xiru Ermuzi" written by Nfcolas Tnigault. As for the more complete form and the most knowledgeable movement, it only occurred in the past century after the fierce invasion of foreign Ã—Ã— doctrines.

Since the fierce invasion of foreign Ã—Ã—ism, the original economic structure of feudal society has gradually tended to collapse, and the demands of the democratic revolution have emerged and grown, becoming more urgent day by day. Although in politics, it has not achieved complete success very early due to the immaturity of historical conditions, it has reflected in the language movement, forming a most glorious history of language reform movement in China in the past ninety years, giving us countless valuable lessons and experiences. There are also many foreign historical facts that prove that a nation's character reform is an inevitable requirement in the process of a nation's democratic revolution, and it is also an inescapable task of the democratic revolution.

(2) "If you want to popularize education, you must have easy-to-learn characters. If you want to make easy-to-learn characters, you must use the phonetic method" (Qing Dynasty scholar Lao Naiyi). Characters are symbols of language. Characters and language were originally unified, and unification must be achieved. This has a very large impact on the difficulty of learning characters. It takes at least nine years to learn Chinese characters, while it takes foreigners at most three or four years to learn their own characters. One of the main reasons is that Chinese characters are separated from spoken language, unlike the consistency of speech and writing in foreign languages. Therefore, we completely agree with Lao Naiyi's saying that "the consistency of speech and writing is the great source of popularizing education," and firmly advocate that Chinese characters must be phoneticized. Furthermore, according to the law of character development, the characters of any country have evolved from the stage of pictographic and ideographic to the stage of phonetic, and Chinese characters are no exception. Facts tell us that Chinese characters have long been gradually separating from the pictographic and ideographic stage and entering the phonetic stage of phonograms and mutual interpretation. In addition, the common substitution of polysyllabic characters for monosyllabic characters, the complete substitution of vernacular Chinese for classical Chinese, and the vigorous development of the phonetic writing movement in the past decades all indicate the undeniable inevitability of the phoneticization of Chinese characters.

(3) On the one hand, there is no doubt that the characters of China should embark on the road of phoneticization, and on the other hand, there is no doubt that they are moving towards internationalization. Today's China is already the China of the world, no longer a closed-door China. And the world after today will also be a world under the influence of China's power. China and the world, the world and China. The connection between the two will be strengthened to an unlimited extent. Therefore, we also need a kind of character symbol that is not separated from the world to communicate the relationship between the two in large quantities, so that China can absorb the culture of the world in large quantities, and also make the world more fully understand the influence of China. Therefore, in terms of character symbols, we also completely agree with the correct proposition of Song Wenxiong, the creator of Jiangsu New Alphabet, and other pioneers of Latinization: "Rather than creating new characters that have never existed in the world, it is better to use the alphabets that are commonly used in the world."

Some people oppose Latin alphabets as foreign alphabets. We believe that alphabets are a tool. Tools only require perfection and suitability, and there is no international limit. Latin alphabets not only have advantages in the structure of the shape, the difficulty of memory, and the convenience and speed of writing that other character symbols do not have, but also are commonly used all over the world, and almost all countries use it as the phonetic symbol of their own phonetic writing. Even in China, it has long been familiar to the Chinese masses in daily life, just like Arabic numerals. Unless China can isolate itself from the world. This kind of opposition cannot be considered to have sufficient reason.

(4) A unified country should have a unified language. This is our highest ideal. It's just that the China we see now is still in the stage of complex dialects because of the vast territory, the backwardness of production conditions, and the underdeveloped transportation. Therefore, even today, there is still a problem of how to produce a unified language that everyone cares about. Regarding the solution to this problem, we advocate following the principle of development from divergence to unity, Latinizing the dialects, and then relying on the availability of various objective conditions to increase the opportunities for contact between dialects, both oral and written, and at the same time, investigating and studying the similarities and differences between the phonetics and grammar of various local dialects as much as possible, engaging in various phonetic comparison and grammar comparison research in order to make various phonetic grammar correspondence tables, and naturally, with artificial promotion, merge (i.e., "mix") or dialectically synthesize into a national unified language of a higher stage. Only this kind of unity is a true, thorough, flesh-and-blood unity.

(5) We do not agree with using one local dialect (such as Beijing dialect) to unify the whole country. We believe that this kind of unity is abstract, superficial, and violates the principle of the unity of speech and democracy. However, we admit that Northern dialect is indeed the most widely circulated dialect among all kinds of dialects, and "in the future national unified language of China, it will occupy the largest part of phonemes" (Lu Xun). Therefore, we also agree to use Northern dialect as the "inter-dialect language" of Chinese dialects today, and maintain its current plan with the greatest caution. For simply promoting Northern dialect, we also admit that it is a way of movement that is partially conducive to the formation of the future unified language of China.

(6) Chinese dialects should at least be divided into five phonetic regions: (1) Northern phonetic region, (2) Jiangzhe phonetic region, (3) Southern Zhejiang and Northern Fujian phonetic region, (4) Guangdong and Southwestern Guangxi phonetic region, (5) Northern Jiangxi and Hunan phonetic region. But we never regard this division as a mechanical opposition between dialects. They are unified in contradiction, and their Latinization process is also their dialectical synthesis into the national unified language of the highest stage.

We believe that only on the basis of dialect Latinization can we produce a mass language culture whose form is dialect and whose content is national revolution. Establishing this language culture is the unshirkable mission of the Latinized Chinese character movement.

(7) In the process of dialect Latinization, we advocate simultaneously refining all common and valuable elements in spoken language, eliminating all ideologically and politically harmful and culturally extremely rare and useless elements, and developing language towards unification and perfection. However, we can temporarily allow one or more local programs to be divided out in a large phonetic region program according to the degree of objective environmental needs (for example, in the Jiangnan dialect program, we can divide out Shanghai dialect, Ningbo dialect, Hangzhou dialect, Suzhou dialect, etc., with important cities as the center), but the drafting of this kind of program (1) must take the large phonetic region program as the basic basis, and only add a part of the most common special phonemes locally, (2) must maintain unity with other programs that have the same phonemes, (3) must recognize its transitional nature, avoid intruding into excessively rare and useless elements as much as possible, absorb ordinary vocabularies commonly used in other places, and carefully consider grammar

(8) For the propositions other than Latinized Chinese characters in the history of Chinese language reform movement, we decide to adopt a relatively active view, opposing extreme exclusion or negative attitude. We believe that Latinized Chinese characters are indeed the highest development of Chinese language, but Latinized Chinese characters have come from reconciling various propositions in the history of language reform. We feel that here, especially today, there is really no need to mechanically oppose Latinized Chinese characters to other phonetic Chinese character programs. As long as they are really determined to improve Chinese language and make Chinese language develop towards unification and perfection, they are all friendly forces of the Chinese language reform movement. We can compare with each other, discuss with each other in theory, and there is no need for anyone to exclude others. Moreover, the development of Latinized Chinese characters is not limited to this. It has unlimited prospects. It still needs to continue to develop. It still needs to absorb more advantages from others to consolidate itself.

(9) We oppose the overly left-wing proposition of shouting to abolish Chinese characters, and also oppose the stubborn proposition of regarding Chinese characters as unchanging, sacred, and inviolable writing spirits. We believe that characters are just a tool, and its development follows the development of social economy and politics. Before phoneticized Chinese characters were produced, Chinese characters were also constantly developing and changing in order to adapt to the needs of the developing and progressing society. And Latinized Chinese characters and every phonetic Chinese character program in the past decades are nothing more than a form of its consistent development. Chinese characters themselves have their own historical value of existence. It is neither necessary to abolish them nor will they be abolished. Even in the future when Latinized Chinese characters are universally popular, Chinese characters will still be learned by people as the main tool for studying ancient Chinese academic thoughts.

(10) We must constantly study the history of the language movement in the past ninety years, constantly collect the lessons of success and failure of various movements to enrich our content. We must also pay the greatest attention to collecting and studying the phenomena of phonetics and grammar in various dialects of our palms, and reveal the hidden laws. We must also pay attention to recording and exchanging valuable experiences in promotion and teaching at any time as the basis for further planning in the future. Latinized Chinese characters were originally progressive. We, who are engaged in the movement, must constantly maintain, develop and carry forward this progressive characteristic in theory and practice.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 11th] An unprecedented fierce battle occurred at Niuxing Station, five miles from Nanchang. The Chinese army is trying to cut off the connection between the Japanese army in Nanchang and Jiujiang. The Japanese army has now sent reinforcements to defend it to the death. The Chinese army has also assembled a strong force to launch a fierce attack, and is determined to break through the Japanese army's outer defense line of Nanchang in one fell swoop, and then annihilate the Japanese army in the city. The people of Tongcheng were surrounded by the Chinese army, and fierce battles were taking place in the suburbs. The Chinese army's heavy artillery brigade exerted its power and densely bombed the Japanese army in the city. A part of the city wall has been bombed down, and the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army has now formed a dare-to-die team with broadswords, ready to rush in at any time. It is reported that 400 Japanese soldiers were killed and countless wounded.

### The Enemy in Shanghai Is Taking an Inch and Wanting a Mile, and the Concessions Are Conceding Again and Again. After Inspecting the News and Interfering with the County Flags, They Issued a Notice to Ban Patriotic Actions.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 11th] The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession here recently jointly issued a notice stating that anyone who directly or indirectly participates in actions of a national nature will not be allowed to settle in the two concessions and will be expelled. It also said that this attitude is because the concessions are areas for foreigners, and their purpose is to maintain neutrality and order. A spokesman for the Public Works Department said that this measure is completely aimed at anti-Japanese organizers, and may not be related to the Chinese county flags. However, it is generally believed that this move is actually protecting Japan.

### The Enemy Is Trying to Poison Shanghai. Fake Police Are Openly Transporting Opium.

[Shanghai Correspondence] Dalu Bao reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department expects that the amount of opium seized this year will break the record. In the first four months of this year, it has already seized 7,800 ounces of opium from arrests. It is found that the amount seized in the whole year of the past was 12,500 ounces. In terms of seizing opium, the first month of this year has broken the record. It is said that no less than 4,200 ounces fell into the hands of detectives in that month. The second highest was April, with 1,600 ounces, which is exactly 100 pounds. Although it is rumored that a large amount of Persian soil was transported by Japanese ships, detectives claimed that, to their knowledge, there was no Persian soil in the opium seized. However, they admitted that various poisons have been mixed with impurities, and there is a possibility of mistaking North China soil for Persian soil, because its color has changed after being mixed with oil. Persian soil is also known as "red soil" because it is brownish when it is pure. The consumption of opium has increased this year, but according to the records of the Municipal Council's Poisonous Substances Department, the consumption of red pills has fallen sharply. The poor coolie class still prefers heroin because it is cheaper than red pills. Red pills have actually disappeared from the Shanghai poisonous substances market. Those who used to smoke red pills instead of opium before the war are now smoking opium because opium is scarce. Anyone can buy an ounce of opium for 13 yuan. The soil houses in the Western District are still rapidly increasing. As soon as one closes, several more open. The Xinkangli area of Xisfei Road "Avenue" is almost entirely occupied by soil houses. Bandits are still active in the Western District, but the Shanghai Municipal Police Department pays little attention to and targets such crimes, because the locations where they occur are still far from its jurisdiction. When poisonous substances are transported, they are escorted by fake police.

### Surprise Attack on Yantai, A Large Amount of Military Supplies Was Intercepted. Our Guerrilla Forces Are Active.

### The Mouthpiece Newspaper of the Japanese Army Threatens British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The Tone Is Unprecedentedly Cruel. It Expresses Anger at Britain's Upholding of Justice.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 11th] The Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece newspaper of the Japanese Army, today threatened the life safety of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The newspaper said, "According to reliable sources obtained here, the British ambassador is very active in Chongqing, supporting General Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan. The British ambassador took advantage of his position on May 6 and flew to Chengdu with General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, attempting to protect their lives. This has truly stimulated Japanese public opinion. Therefore, we warn the British ambassador that if he wants to escape into a safe area and misuse his diplomatic rights, Japan cannot guarantee his life safety."

They will go to Chongqing for training during the day.

### American Residents in Chongqing Wire Roosevelt: Friends' Indifference Encourages Aggression, Demanding Immediate Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th dispatch] The rampant Ã— bomber planes and the evacuation of foreign residents have caused deep resentment. The American residents, in particular, are deeply disturbed by the continued supply of war materials to Ã— Japan by the United States. Therefore, on May 10th, Fei Wu-niu (transliteration) representing them, wired Roosevelt, Hull, Pittman, McKellar, and others, demanding the immediate implementation of a ban on the export of arms and military supplies to aggressor nations. The original text of the telegram is translated as follows: "To President Roosevelt in Washington, Secretary of State Hull, Senator Pittman, and Congressman McKellar: The recent bombing of military celebrations by Japanese troops and the large-scale massacre of civilians in Chongqing have deeply shocked the American residents. The courage and steadfastness of the Chinese people are unwavering. This indescribable tragic experience further strengthens their determination to resist. We protest the so-called neutrality of the United States. For twenty-two months, it has continuously sold kerosene, metals, cotton, machinery, etc., to Japan, making the United States equally responsible for Japan's inhumane crimes. We, in the name of God, request the establishment of a national policy and its implementation to prohibit the export of all goods that could enable aggressors to engage in slaughter. Fei Wu-sheng (transliteration) bows."

### Fuzhou Intensifies Wartime Preparations: Bai and Gu Inspect and Instruct, Strengthening and Supplementing Defensive Works

[South China News Agency, Fuzhou dispatch] Since the war of resistance began, Fujian province, being close to Taiwan, has been vulnerable to enemy invasion at any time. Fuzhou, as the provincial capital, is the political and economic center of the entire province. Therefore, the various wartime preparations are more comprehensive than elsewhere. Recently, our troops on various battlefields have launched active counter-offensives, causing the enemy to be exhausted and rush around. In order to disrupt our rear and contain our forces, the relatively peaceful Fuzhou has been subjected to several consecutive indiscriminate bombings by enemy planes, creating a state of extreme tension. Coincidentally, General Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, and General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, successively visited Fujian for inspection. After consulting with the Fujian provincial military and political authorities, it was decided to immediately intensify wartime preparations to fight the enemy to the end. The Fuzhou Garrison Command, responsible for security, has been strengthened and reorganized in terms of its internal organization and personnel. Along the riverbank and in various strategic locations, many defensive fortifications have already been built in the past. Now, after a new plan and arrangement by the military authorities, they are being improved or added to, forming countless strong and solid new fortresses. The city and Nantai Island will soon be divided into civilian and military zones, preparing to build fortification works. Gambling dens, brothels, opium dens, etc., will all be closed down. Labor unions and hotels will be strictly restricted and shut down. Large-capital industrial enterprises will be ordered to relocate to the interior. Ordinary shops are only allowed to open night markets and must be closed by 5:00 PM every day. During the day, only leaving the city is allowed; entering the city is prohibited. Grain and goods are also restricted from entering and are subject to unified control and inspection.

When Xiamen fell earlier, the authorities repeatedly ordered the coastal population to evacuate. The Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters even published two talks in the newspaper, strongly urging the people of Fuzhou to evacuate. However, the people of Fuzhou held a mentality of seeking temporary peace and security. When the situation was tense, some people fled in panic. But when the situation eased slightly, they all ran back. Therefore, Fuzhou has recently presented a scene of bustling activity and singing and dancing. However, under the current situation of intensified wartime preparations, the people of Fuzhou, in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment, are all subject to strict restrictions. In addition, the enemy planes bomb indiscriminately without aiming, making it impossible for them to seek temporary peace and security. Therefore, in the past few days, the population evacuating to the interior has caused traffic jams, and transportation is insufficient, forming an unprecedented state of congestion and evacuation.

Evacuation is definitely not an escape. Therefore, the evacuating population is limited to the elderly, weak, women, and children, and students. As for able-bodied men, none are allowed to leave. The military authorities plan to gather these able-bodied men, strengthen their training, and organize them into various wartime task forces to cooperate with the regular army in joint operations.

After the above-mentioned wartime preparations, Fuzhou is filled with a wartime atmosphere. The scene of singing and dancing has completely disappeared, leaving no trace behind.

### Lanzhou Youth Donate Funds: Nearly 40,000 in One Week

### Our Country's Antiques to Be Exhibited in the US: Rumors of Loss En Route, Resulting in a False Alarm

[Associated Press, New York, 11th dispatch] Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, entrusted by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, was in charge of the exhibition of the Chinese Emperor's Dragon Throne and Jade Pagoda. Yesterday, she suddenly notified the US Detective Department that the Dragon Throne had mysteriously disappeared en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to the US. The Pagoda and Throne were secretly transported out of the Forbidden City in Beijing, and then shipped to the Netherlands via Siberia. The Jade Pagoda had safely arrived in New York, but the Throne was said to have been transported on the Dutch ship "Saendam," which had arrived in New York several days ago, but the Throne was not found on board. It is estimated that the Throne and the Pagoda are worth a total of three million US dollars. Furthermore, according to the latest news from New York, the Chinese Dragon Throne has been recovered. It turns out that the item was mistakenly sent to California by a "distracted professor" in the Netherlands. It was later found by US detectives in a customs warehouse.

[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 11th dispatch] Officials of the Holland America Line stated yesterday that they had no knowledge of the reported disappearance of the Chinese Dragon Throne on the "Saendam." Furthermore, the authorities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands stated that they would certainly be aware if the ship was carrying such valuable items. The current report of its disappearance is unfounded.

[Associated Press, New York, 11th dispatch] Several Chinese treasures, worth mentioning, were damaged due to a fire on the French mail ship "Paris," but have now been urgently repaired so that they can be exhibited at the Arden Gallery on May 16th. The treasure exhibition includes a jade carved throne from the 18th century, six models of important buildings in the Forbidden City from the 18th century, and a throne of Emperor Qianlong.

### The Puppet Organizations in Shanxi

â€” Qu Yongshan

[People's Revolutionary Society Jinxi Correspondence] According to Mr. Chen Bosheng's statistics, to completely eliminate China's combat forces, the Japanese Ã— would need 12.6 million troops. However, the Japanese Ã— can only mobilize 500,000 troops to China for combat. Therefore, the Japanese Ã—'s conquest of China is naturally impossible. Based on this insurmountable weakness, the consistent policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" arose. The so-called "puppet organizations" are also a product of this. On the one hand, they assist the Japanese Ã—'s aggression, and on the other hand, they reduce our strength in the war of resistance. Therefore, the existence of puppet organizations is a major reef on the road to our war of resistance, and we must pay close attention to it.

The Shanxi Guidance Department of the Puppet Xinminhui

To understand the entire Shanxi puppet organization, we must start with the Taiyuan puppet provincial government. Although the candidates for the puppet figures around the puppet provincial government were generally selected soon after the fall of Taiyuan, the formal establishment of the puppet provincial government was delayed until February of last year. This was due to the cautious consideration by the Japanese Ã— of the selection of personnel and the structure for governing Shanxi, which led to a long period of shelving. As a result, they found suitable figures such as the traitor Su Tiren and formally announced the "Organizational Regulations of the Shanxi Provincial Government." Su Tiren was appointed as the puppet governor, and the puppet government established six departments: the Secretariat, the Department of Civilian Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Education, the Department of Construction, and the Department of Police Affairs. Li Shengpei was appointed as the Secretary-General, Song Che as the Director of Civilian Affairs, Song Qixiu as the Director of Finance, Xi Jianquan as the Director of Education, Zhang Lianbi as the Director of Construction, and Bai Wenwei as the Director of Police Affairs. Other traitors such as Guo Kejie and Gao Yunjie were appointed as members of the puppet provincial government council.

Any puppet organization is merely a puppet. The Shanxi puppet provincial government is no exception. The Japanese Ã— did not grant it any authority in terms of operational power. Even superficial announcements were directly handled by the Ã— special affairs agency. As for confidential matters, there was naturally no possibility of asking about them. The puppet provincial government could only follow the will and instructions of the head of the Japanese Ã— special affairs agency (Akiharu Kawana served as the head) to carry out the conspiracy to deceive and numb the masses. The important subject of "using Chinese to control Chinese" was directly performed by the puppet organization. In August of last year, the Shanxi Guidance Department of the puppet Xinminhui, which had been in preparation for many days, was formally established, with Su Tiren as the Director of the Guidance Department, a Major General of the Japanese Military Affairs Department as the Deputy Director, and Akiharu Kawana as the Advisor. The work guidelines passed by the association for the 27th year clearly declared the intentions of the Ã— puppet regime. A summary is as follows:

1.  The initial work of the Xinminhui is to devote itself to propaganda, appeasement, restoration of public order, and strengthening the organization of the Xinminhui.

2.  Attempt to seize various organizations of young girls, boys, and farmers, and devote itself to production and life guidance, with the goal of appeasing the public's psychology.

3.  Cultivate pro-Japanese sentiments in many ways, with the main purpose of promoting anti-communism, eliminating the Communist Party, and preventing banditry.

For the above purposes, the Shanxi Guidance Department of the puppet Xinminhui was produced. It can also be said that for the above purposes, the Han traitor puppet organization was produced. In fact, the puppet provincial government is equivalent to a nominal setup, and all matters that should be handled are handled by the Ã— special affairs agency. However, the group of Han traitors in the puppet provincial government are responsible for carrying out the conspiracy of the Shanxi Guidance Department of the puppet Xinminhui. The functions are chaotic, and the organization is contradictory. The strategy and intention of the Ã— side in manipulating the puppet organization are fully revealed. At the same time, the shameless Han traitor elements are pitiful enough under the arbitrary command of the Japanese Ã—.

How Puppet Organizations Incite the Public

The Japanese invaders are doing their best to support the puppet organizations. What can the puppet organizations do for the Ã— people? Where is the brutality of the "accomplices"? If we can point out the specific work of the puppet organizations, we can understand the conspiracy of the Japanese Ã— at the same time. In the basic strategy of the Japanese Ã—'s aggression of "using strike to control," it will not abandon any opportunity. It not only uses the Han traitor elements of the upper class to organize maintenance associations, but also wants to further use the general ignorant masses as the claws and teeth of the maintenance associations. However, the Japanese Ã—'s plan is also a last resort. Since the occupation of Taiyuan and the Tongpu line, the people in various places have been "leading each other to avoid" the enemy. After the situation has stabilized slightly, some are still fleeing into the mountains, and some have even joined the guerrilla units and the local people's armed self-defense groups. Returning to the Ã— area is generally regarded as a long journey. The Japanese Ã— has spent a lot of effort on this issue, repeatedly asking the maintenance associations in various places to do their best to call on the people to return to their hometowns. Before the establishment of the puppet provincial government, Gu Qiuhua Xiong, the head of the Japanese Ã— special affairs agency, posted announcements in various places and stipulated methods for the people to surrender and anti-Japanese elements to come over. After the establishment of the puppet provincial government, more attention was paid to the issue of "public security." When Su Tiren took office, he followed Gu Qiu's opinion and took "rectifying the public security of the entire province" as his own responsibility, eagerly hoping that the people would "return to their former residences and live in peace." Shortly after taking office, he stipulated the "County Defense Regiment Organization Method" and the "Self-Defense Regiment Provisional Method."

The puppet county defense regiment is based on "collecting good people from various places" as the principle. The purpose is to assist the puppet army in maintaining local public order on the one hand, and to attempt to attract anti-Japanese elements on the other hand. When necessary, it can also be driven to the front line to serve as meaningless sacrifices. Therefore, most of the recruited members are able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 35. The uniforms worn are mostly made of blue cloth, with purple-red leather belts around the waist, black leggings, and the cap flower is the five-colored pentagonal puppet national emblem. However, there are often many who wear plain clothes to do intelligence and secret work.

The puppet self-defense regiment is an organization based on the village as a unit. The purpose and function are similar to those of the puppet county defense regiment. The puppet "Self-Defense Regiment Provisional Method" also clearly stipulates: "The self-defense regiment is responsible for patrolling within the area of the regiment, detecting thieves, checking travelers when necessary, and assisting the county police in suppressing the anti-Japanese army or serving in local services." The last designated one is to serve on the front line. Last winter, when the Japanese Ã— attacked Jinxi, the people from various counties in Jinxi were sent by the Japanese Ã— county to the front line to fight. But in fact, their anti-war mentality is exactly the only powerful factor promoting the failure of the Ã— invaders.

In addition, there are also "Model Youth Teams" and "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" in the villages. The nature of these organizations is slightly different from that of the county defense regiment and the village self-defense regiment. They are directly led by the political workers of the Ã— army. Generally, the level of wisdom is higher than that of the defense regiment. They are tools for appeasement and have more power than the defense regiment. They deceive and extort everywhere. Their brutality far exceeds that of the defense regiment. Because the latter is only led by ordinary soldiers, but most of the members are local people who have joined out of necessity. They will of course try to protect the local area as much as possible. The former is the opposite. Most of the members, except for a few Ã— people, are organized from local thugs and ruffians. They take advantage of disasters and arbitrarily extort money wherever they go. This is an object that the people deeply hate.

The most peculiar thing is the "Coolie Brigade" recently organized by the Japanese Ã—, which is specially used for investigation, detection, and guidance during combat. It is a group dedicated to absorbing farmers. When the Japanese Ã— invaded Jinxi on New Year's Day this year, they recruited people from counties such as Hejin and Jishan to organize the "Coolie Brigade" to guide the Ã— army to directly invade Jixian County from the mountain valleys and paths in Xiangning County. In February, Zhao Ã— invaded Fenxi County, and the "Coolie Brigade" also led the way. The Japanese Ã— encouraged them to arbitrarily plunder wherever they went, so some Han traitors and ignorant people are happy to "act as accomplices," This is the Japanese Ã—'s attempt to use the past grievances between local areas to deepen their hatred, thereby shifting the people's hatred of the Ã— puppet regime to the neighboring people, and indirectly reducing the power of the people's unity to resist the invaders. What a vicious and cunning means this is.

Two Plans Carried Out by the Ã— People

We deeply believe that all the puppet organizations of the Ã— invaders, as mentioned above, are only temporary groups to win over the people. The Ã— invaders initially have no long-term plans and will never be able to establish a solid foundation among the people. However, we still cannot ignore its role, and in some places, there are actually organized and planned groups that will hinder the progress of our people's movement work. At present, the Ã— puppet regime is extremely intent on fostering two plans: 1. The organization of villages of protection; 2. The implementation of the Baojia system.

Since the guerrilla units ambushing in various parts of Shanxi launched a full-scale guerrilla war, the only lines of communication held by the Ã— puppet regime - the Tongpu Road and the Zhengtai Road - are constantly in fear of our attacks. Therefore, the Ã— invaders followed the old trick in the Northeast and designated all the villages along the railway line as "villages of protection along the railway line," so that the people are responsible for the security of the railway, and several bunkers are built along the railway line, each separated by a mile, with one or two Japanese soldiers stationed for defense. However, the Japanese soldiers are frightened birds, timid as mice, only lurking inside the bunkers and dare not go out. The people who pass by are still calm and self-possessed, and get used to it. In the past, the intention of prolonged Ã—'s malice has gradually diminished, while the self-confidence to bravely kill Ã— is gradually growing.

In November of last year, the Puppet Xinminhui in Beiping decided to order all localities to implement the Baojia system, but to this day, there is no specific organization, but the Japanese Ã— is still actively promoting it. In the past, the Japanese Ã— universally implemented it in the Northeast, with a large village system similar to the Baojia system. After several years of implementation, it cannot be said that it had no effect on the control of the people. However, since the widespread development of guerrilla units, the number of people joining anti-Japanese groups has gradually increased, and the communication and gathering organizations among the people have become increasingly skilled and dynamic. Therefore, the organizational system has completely lost its effect. At present, in the entire Shanxi, the favorable conditions for the anti-Japanese war, whether in terms of leadership or people, are better than those in the past in the Northeast. However, the Japanese Ã— still "follow the old trick," and we predict that it will inevitably fail.

### Britain, France, Soviet Union, and Poland to Confer on Anti-Aggression: Britain Invites Soviet Foreign Minister to Geneva, Ambassador Gu Weijun Visits Bonnet

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th dispatch] French Premier Daladier met with Foreign Minister Bonnet at the Ministry of the Army today for a lengthy discussion. According to informed sources, the two reviewed the international situation so that Daladier could express his views on the recent situation when he addresses the Chamber of Deputies in Geneva today. Earlier today, Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun and Romanian Ambassador Tarleescu separately visited Bonnet. It is heard that Ambassador Gu's discussions were related to China's request for practical assistance in finance, economy, and military affairs at the upcoming League of Nations Executive Council meeting, in order to resist Japan. The Romanian Ambassador discussed the general agreement system between Britain and France. It is expected that Bonnet conveyed to him the latest news from the Soviet Union. It is also generally believed that Bonnet will stay in Geneva for three or four days and travel to the meeting with Halifax. All countries related to the British and French agreements seem to hold a preliminary meeting on Sunday this week. In short, Bonnet, Halifax (British Foreign Secretary), Beck (Polish Foreign Minister), and Potemkin (Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister) must hold the first talks on the 14th. According to Intransigeant, they will also take the opportunity to contact representatives of Turkey, Sweden, and Norway.

[Central News Agency, London, 10th dispatch] Well-informed sources recently announced that the government had invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Geneva during the League of Nations Executive Council meeting (15th of this month) to negotiate with the British Foreign Secretary on the matter of an anti-aggression group.

Cordial Atmosphere at Soviet-Polish Talks

[Reuters, Warsaw, 10th dispatch] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck again at noon today and had a long talk. It is heard that they discussed recent events and Germany's changing attitude towards Poland regarding Soviet-Polish relations.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 10th dispatch] The Polish Express published an article today, apparently authorized by the government, stating that any unilateral action to resolve the Danzig issue, such as the rumor that Danzig will declare its return to Germany, will fail. The report also said that if a referendum is to be held in Danzig, then the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia should be held first. It is claimed that the authorities have expelled thirteen Germans who were spreading rumors and plotting from the Posnan border, and two women who were acting unlawfully have also been expelled.

[Reuters, London, 11th dispatch] Today, British and French newspapers published the news of the meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin in prominent positions. It is the first time Beck has received a Soviet envoy since he returned to Moscow in 1934. The meeting was very cordial. Potemkin is returning to Moscow via Ankara, Bulgarian capital, Romanian capital, Warsaw and other places. It is believed that this meeting must have an important impact on European anti-aggression actions. In this anti-aggression action, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and major Eastern European countries are extremely important. The Warsaw correspondent of "Daily News" said that Poland is prepared to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union alone. London newspapers also stated that the general public believes that Beck and Potemkin may have also discussed the Baltic issue. Regarding this point, it is noteworthy that some diplomatic correspondents are now speculating on the Soviet Union's response to the British proposal. Some believe that the Soviet Union is willing to expand its guarantees to its neighboring Baltic countries, especially Estonia and Latvia. Mr. Patale wrote in "News Chronicle" expressing that he does not believe this request will be rejected by the United Kingdom. The Paris "Globe" criticized the Soviet-Polish approach, saying that if an agreement is to be concluded, only the unanimous agreement of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is needed. "Daily Express" said that the British-Turkish negotiations are about to end, and said that Turkey has agreed to accept Soviet military assistance to defend the Balkans. Foreign Minister Beck visited Moscow in 1934 and signed the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, which was extended to 1945.

### Chamberlain Outlines British-Soviet Negotiations; Continued Discussions Anticipated to Achieve Satisfactory Outcome; Soviet Ambassador Re-visits British Foreign Secretary

[Reuters, London, November 11] This afternoon, the House of Commons was unusually crowded, eager to hear Prime Minister Chamberlain's report on the progress of British-Soviet negotiations. Chamberlain first addressed Moscow's statement regarding British proposals, stating that it was based on a misunderstanding of the original intent of the British proposals. Negotiations are still ongoing, so he is unable to provide a detailed report to the House. However, in light of Moscow's statement, he felt it necessary to provide the House with a summary of the negotiation situation. The British-Soviet negotiations have discussed the matter of assisting European countries in resisting aggression. The British government is also aware that obtaining the direct participation of the Soviet Union in guaranteeing Eastern European countries would make certain difficulties easier to overcome. Therefore, the British government proposed to the Soviet Union that it issue a declaration similar to that of the British government. If Britain and France were drawn into the vortex of war and requested assistance, the Soviet government would immediately provide it. This declaration is consistent with Stalin's proclaimed Soviet policy of assisting invaded countries in safeguarding their independence. Chamberlain stated that the Soviet Union simultaneously proposed a new approach that was broader in scope and more serious in nature. While the Soviet proposal may have other advantages, from the British government's perspective, it inevitably raises many difficulties that the British proposal seeks to avoid. The British government immediately informed the Soviet authorities of these difficulties and revised its original proposal, making it clear that it was not requiring the Soviet Union, under any circumstances, to intervene on behalf of countries that Britain may or may not have already assisted in fulfilling its treaty obligations. The British government further stated that it would not object if the Soviet Union voluntarily provided assistance to countries guaranteed by Britain and France. Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday, and the Soviet ambassador explained to Halifax that the Soviet government was unclear whether, based on the British proposal, the Soviet Union could be trapped in unilateral intervention without obtaining a response from Britain and France. Halifax immediately assured him, stating that the British government's proposal contained no such notion, and any points that might cause concern could be promptly removed. He asked Maisky to convey to the Soviet government that any facts that might cause concern should be clearly indicated to the British government. Maisky agreed to this. Chamberlain further stated that the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, had met with Molotov two days ago. At the late-night meeting, Molotov indicated that the Soviet government would give careful consideration to the British proposal and was awaiting the British response.

[Reuters, London, November 10] Today, after British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons on the progress of British-Russian negotiations, opposition members of parliament raised questions one after another. Chamberlain was unwilling to provide many answers, but he clearly informed Labour leader Attlee that the British government was currently in close contact with the French government, and he believed that concluding British-Russian negotiations was of the "utmost importance and urgency." Labour MP Henderson asked if they could assume that the British government had not yet made a final decision not to enter into a military alliance with Soviet Russia. Chamberlain replied that he could not answer hypothetical questions. The British government was currently pursuing discussions along several avenues, hoping to obtain a satisfactory result.

[Reuters, London, November 11] Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax at the Foreign Office this morning. This was his third visit in three days.

[Reuters, Berlin, November 10] Today, Berlin newspapers focused on the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union. The newspapers generally believed that British-Soviet negotiations had reached a stalemate and expressed premature joy. However, the Hamburger Fremdenblatt published an article with fair comments, stating, "Britain and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly continue negotiations. It is too early to predict the outcome at this time. The noteworthy aspect of the Soviet Union's announcement on this matter is that the danger of an encirclement strategy has been fully exposed. What we should understand is that the Soviet government has not rejected guaranteeing Romania and Poland in its formal declaration, nor has it opposed providing Britain and France with military assistance in the event of war in Eastern Europe, as requested by Britain."

### Ã—Indiscriminate Bombing of Chongqing Causes British Indignation; Serious Protest Lodged Several Days Ago; House of Commons Discusses China Issue

[Reuters, London, November 10] During question time in the House of Commons today, the China issue remained the focus of discussion. Labour MP Sorensen asked whether, in light of the recent military alliance between Germany and Italy, the Prime Minister would immediately urge the Japanese government to cease its aggression against China, withdraw its troops, and immediately convene a Far East conference of the relevant countries to establish a non-aggression pact and seek fair economic cooperation. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax had only read about this rumor in the newspapers. The government's views were already set forth in its note to the Japanese government on January 14 of this year. Subsequently, Conservative MP Haslam asked whether the government should call the Japanese government's attention to the chaotic and lawless situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of Shanghai, where it was extremely difficult for the Municipal Council to maintain law and order in the International Settlement. The Under-Secretary of State replied in writing that the Japanese government had already been informed of these difficulties. In response to a question about the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, the Under-Secretary of State stated that during a Japanese air raid on Chongqing on the 4th of this month, a bomb fell in the residential area for Chinese staff at the British Consulate-General, killing two Chinese staff and injuring eleven others, which was very regrettable. The Foreign Secretary was awaiting a full report on the air raid, and the government had instructed its ambassador to Japan to lodge a serious protest. The Under-Secretary of State also replied to a question from Labour MP Williams, stating that the government had expressed its indignation at the air raid. Subsequently, Labour MP Jones asked about reports that two young men in Singapore had been rejected from joining the Imperial Air Force because their parents were not British. The Secretary of State for Air, Wood, replied in writing that the specific case cited by Mr. Jones had not yet been verified. However, according to regulations, those who join the Imperial Air Force must be British citizens, and their parents must also be British citizens. There was no intention to change these regulations.

### Future War Will Involve 40 Million Participants; Main Battles to be Decided at Sea and in the Air; French General Staff Believes Britain and France Have the Advantage

[Paris, November 10 (Foreign Dispatch)] The British and French General Staff believe that if war breaks out between Britain, France, and the dictatorial states, Britain and France will have an advantage in sea, land, and air power, and this advantage will only increase. Currently, the five major European powers (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union) have a combined force of 33 million armed personnel and reserves, which is the largest military force in history. The Soviet Union currently has 18 million trained troops and reserves, Britain has 550,000, France has 6.25 million, Italy has 6.3 million, and Germany has 2.2 million. In addition, the allied forces of the democratic countries and the Axis powers total 8 million, so if war breaks out, the participants could reach 41 million. Military experts believe that after the outbreak of war, the main battlefields will be in the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa, and northern Italy. The French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line are both very strong, and neither side is willing to sacrifice millions of soldiers to break through them. France may cross the Alps into Italy, or enter Germany through the Brenner Pass. Germany can also enter France in the same way. The main struggle in this type of war will be decided at sea and in the air. Experts believe that once war breaks out, the borders of the small countries from the Black Sea to the Red Sea, which have always been considered inviolable, will see military action.

### Britain Improves Military Position; Prepares for Far East Contingencies; Plans to Station Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific; Australia Builds Large Dockyard in Cockatoo Island

[Reuters, London, November 11] Naval correspondent Peter Howard of the "Daily Mail" has learned that as a result of negotiations between the British and Australian governments, the British government is prepared to station several warships in the Pacific to prevent contingencies. However, the exact number and names of these warships cannot be disclosed. The dispersal of naval combat power in the Far East has also been carefully considered in light of the balance of power in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. Although Germany and Italy are actively building ships, Britain and France will be able to maintain their current advantage. The Singapore naval base is now fully constructed, and Australia has also decided to build a large dockyard on Cockatoo Island. The shipyards in Malta and Gibraltar are large enough to accommodate the largest battleships. The British Empire's military position for Far East defense has been greatly improved. According to well-informed naval sources, the threat that may have existed in the Australia-Asia region a year ago has now been completely eliminated. The British fleet east of the Suez Canal can unite and generate strong military power in the event of war.

[Reuters, London, November 10] The Daily Mail's naval correspondent has learned that recently, naval officers and staff of the British fleet east of the Suez Canal will hold a meeting in Singapore to discuss and update methods for adjusting the Far East defenses in order to cope with any emergencies. The newspaper said that similar meetings have been held several times in recent years, but this one will be particularly important. It is heard that Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, and the commanders of the Australian and New Zealand fleets will all participate.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, November 11] Local naval authorities have no knowledge of the report in the London Daily Mail that British naval commanders will hold a meeting in Singapore.

[Associated Press, Rome, November 11] Well-informed circles here are widely rumored that the Italian King and Prince will visit Berlin in June, following Ciano's visit to sign the German-Italian military alliance. Although this news has not been officially confirmed, it is considered very reliable. It is also learned that Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul will also visit Berlin in June, before the Italian King.

Short Commentary

### Singapore Naval Meeting

Today's newspaper reports that a Reuters dispatch from London on November 11th stated that the British Navy Department will soon convene a military conference in Singapore of the commanders and staff officers of all naval units stationed east of the Suez Canal for the purpose of planning the cooperative combat plans of various fleets in the Far East defense in the event of war.

Looking at this news positively, it is naturally inspiring! Because, from the perspective of Britain's own interests, British interests in China are suffering from Japan's [censored] destruction, and Britain's entire Far Eastern interests have also suffered a comprehensive threat, and Britain's defense of its Far Eastern rights and interests has become a matter of urgency. However, in the past, Britain had repeatedly made mistakes in the Far East; and since Munich, the repeated performance of the appeasement policy has made the flames of the German and Italian aggressors increasingly rampant in the Mediterranean, and Britain's naval and shipping in the Euro-Asian region has encountered considerable serious difficulties, which has a considerable significant impact on Britain's plan to protect its Far Eastern interests. Now that Britain is preparing to hold a naval conference in Singapore to discuss the wartime cooperation plans between the East and the West, it has its major significance in military terms, and it is also very gratifying and earnestly hoped for in guaranteeing Far Eastern peace.

On the other hand, we have infinite sorrow for the "advanced" and "quasi-advanced" Chinese who are surviving in special areas. Perhaps these Chinese will be more sensitive. Will they be preparing to fly high? Will they have more obscene and shameless performances? But the compatriots with conscience and backbone still constitute the vast majority! Where should we go again? It is time for deep reflection. Large-scale investment in all production and construction undertakings in the motherland; a large number of workers, technicians, and young people should be helped to return to the motherland to serve; broad assistance to the motherland in striving for national independence and national rejuvenation is a more urgent task for us at present!

### Mourning Dr. Shang Zhongyi

More than a dozen organizations, including the Hong Kong Christian Youth Association, are scheduled to meet at 7:30 this afternoon to organize a preparatory committee to mourn Dr. Shang Zhongyi. In addition to mourning this matter, we feel that we have a few words to talk to our readers.

Shang Zhongyi is not an unfamiliar name among the general cultural circles, patriots, and those who are working hard for the national salvation movement in our country. He was a loyal Christian, and a loyal and brave warrior in the national salvation movement as a well-known religious follower. Especially since the December Movement of students and cultural circles in the North, he has been running around east, west, north, and south, driven by the movement for the liberation of the Chinese nation, leading young students, going deep into rural work, and promoting the high tide of national salvation. Since the War of Resistance, he has even been selfless, personally serving the army on the front lines, and working hard on political mobilization in a bitter environment. He has put even more effort into the united front. Unfortunately, he died in a car accident near [censored] on the 23rd of last month. The country has lost a talented person, the society has lost a person of lofty ideals, and the youth have lost a loyal leader and comrade-in-arms, which makes people feel infinite sorrow, and investigating the reason why Dr. Shang died so unfortunately makes people feel infinite grief and indignation!

However, we hope that the various groups that are about to mourn Dr. Shang and those who are saddened and indignant by Dr. Shang's death should not only not be sad and disappointed, but also use everyone's tears of grief and indignation [censored] Use the [censored] crystallized from everyone's grief and indignation to [censored] to all those who were hated and opposed by Dr. Shang! To the Japanese aggressors, to the traitors and pro-Japanese factions, to the stubborn and conservative elements, to all the obstructing forces of the anti-Japanese united front [censored]â€”At the same time, we must promote Dr. Shang's great spirit of faithfully participating in the [censored] united front as a Christian, and we must also learn [censored] Dr.'s working methods of befriending young people, going deep into the lower classes, and mobilizing the masses to participate in the work of building the country, and we must use a more loyal and revolutionary struggle practice to complete Dr. Shang's unfinished business! Dr. Shang is not dead! He will always be actively present in front of every compatriot who does not want to be a slave, and he will always be actively present in front of every warrior in the world who is fighting for peace, freedom, and equality; we hope that every Christian, every university professor, every youth leader, every young male and female warrior, will take Dr. Shang as an example, face a more difficult environment, and promote a more heroic struggle!

### Yesterday's Legislative Council Meeting: Extension of the Anti-Eviction Ordinance Passed; Valid Period Not Limited to One Year, Subject to Revision at Any Time; Sino-Japanese War Unprecedentedly Increases Hong Kong's Government Expenses

The Legislative Council convened a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote, Colonial Secretary Smith, Financial Secretary Keen, Attorney General Ainsley, Commissioner of Police Bartle, Commander of British Troops in Hong Kong Garsia, Director of Medical and Health Services Selwyn Clarke, Director of Public Works Digby, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Cary, Harbour Master Hall, Sir E. D. C. Brown, Chau Tsun-nin, Lo Man-kam, Dhun Ruttonjee, Lo Yuk-li, Tam Yax Shi, and Seru Shi, among others.

Supplementary Government Funding of Over Three Million

Agenda: (1) The Colonial Secretary moved to pass Report No. 3 of the Finance Committee on April 27, 1939, seconded by Attorney General Ainsley. (2) Financial Secretary Keen moved for the first reading of the bill to authorize a supplementary appropriation of $3,426,343.48 for the 1938 fiscal year, seconded by Colonial Secretary Smith. When moving to pass the bill, Keen delivered a speech, stating that he was moving for the first reading of the "1939 Supplementary Appropriation Bill for 1938." The financial report and detailed expenditures for the past year have been presented for the councilors' reference. The overspending of various items has been explained in detail in the bill and has been approved by the Finance Committee and councilors through normal channels. According to the second item of the bill, the shortfall reached $3,426,243.48, which is the actual figure exceeding the budget. Councilors should be aware that last year was particularly eventful, leading to extraordinarily high government expenditures. Chapter 4 of last year's financial report explains in detail the various items of underfunding. The reasons for the shortfalls were mostly directly or indirectly affected by the Sino-Japanese War, and other unexpected events could not have been foreseen when drafting the 1938 budget. Moreover, the implementation of new storage regulations and the amendment of construction bonds last year resulted in an increase of $1.2 million. Although the increase in government expenses last year was extremely large, the draft budget had already estimated a shortfall of $3,124,629. The current excess of only $440,043 should be met with understanding.

Record-Breaking Tax Revenue Last Year

According to the financial report of Hong Kong last year, released by the Financial Secretary, the budgeted tax revenue for last year was $30,254,920, while the actual revenue was $36,735,855, breaking the previous record. As a result, the asset-to-liability ratio of Hong Kong exceeded $13,562,235. The increase in revenue was attributed to the Sino-Japanese War, as many Chinese businesses relocated to Hong Kong until the Japanese invasion of South China. Furthermore, due to the sudden increase in population caused by the Sino-Japanese War, vacant houses were almost non-existent, leading to a significant increase in rates income. At the same time, taxes on tobacco and alcohol also greatly increased. Other taxes, such as entertainment tax, gambling tax, and contributions from transportation companies, also saw substantial increases. Revenue from land sales reached the highest level since 1932.

Eviction Ordinance Subject to Amendments

(3) The Attorney General moved for the first reading of the following bills: (A) Amendment to the 1935 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance; (B) Amendment to the 1934 Trust Ordinance; (C) Amendment to the 1936 Hong Kong Ordinances (1937 Edition D) amended by the 1939 Amendment to the Prevention of Eviction Ordinance, which amends the 1938 Prevention of Eviction Ordinance. All were seconded by the Colonial Secretary. When moving to pass the amendment to the eviction ordinance, Ainsley explained that the ordinance was due to expire on the 21st of this month. However, in view of the turbulent situation and the increased population of Hong Kong, the government decided to extend the ordinance. Its valid period is not limited to one year as before. If the situation changes in the future, it can be amended or supplemented at any time. All bills will be implemented after passing the second and third readings at the next meeting (the 25th of this month).

### Protecting Residents' Health: Health Bureau Sends Personnel to Inoculate Residents; Vaccination to be Administered to All Men, Women, and Children Who Have Not Been Vaccinated; Cholera Injections to be Conducted Similarly

Recently, the climate in Hong Kong has been erratic, with frequent changes between cold and hot, leading to an increasing spread of seasonal diseases, especially smallpox and cholera. The municipal health authorities, recognizing this, are taking measures to protect the health of the general public. In addition to urging self-vaccination and cholera inoculations for self-defense, they are also strictly cracking down on unsanitary food sold in the market that could serve as a medium for spreading seasonal diseases. More recently, they have taken proactive action by instructing public medical bureaus in various districts to send personnel to visit homes and vaccinate residents. Regardless of gender or age, anyone found to be unvaccinated will be inoculated. This week, such personnel have been seen in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Jordan, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hung Hom, Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Central, Sheung Wan, Sai Ying Pun, Wan Chai, and Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island, advising residents to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The health authorities are also closely monitoring the development of cholera, as several cases have been discovered in recent days. If deemed necessary in the future, they will follow the same approach as with smallpox vaccination, sending personnel to homes to administer cholera inoculations to residents.

### Sharp Increase in Number of Marriages in Hong Kong; Cupid is Busy; Over Five Hundred Forty Couples Last Year

Hong Kong's population has surged, now estimated at over one million, leading to a corresponding increase in the number of happy couples. According to a report from the Marriage Registrar, Mr. A. W. Whitting, a total of 544 couples were registered last year, of which 336 were Chinese. This is an increase of 123 couples compared to the 421 couples registered the previous year, of which 236 were Chinese. A total of 24 couples obtained special licenses, and 518 obtained ordinary licenses. The government collected a total of $5,081 in fees from the latter, compared to $3,286.16 the previous year, an increase of $1,794.84. Most couples held their wedding ceremonies at the Marriage Registry, totaling 287 couples.

### Hong Kong Authorities Prepare to Celebrate the Emperor's Birthday; Large-Scale Military Exercises Planned

### Shanghai Refugee Students to Host Reception for All Sectors Tomorrow; to Report on Their Work in Shanghai at the War Relief Society at 4 PM

The Shanghai Refugee Student Wartime Service Corps was expelled from Shanghai by the French Concession authorities for displaying the national flag during the National Spiritual Mobilization on the 20th of last month. They came to Hong Kong and then proceeded to Guilin to continue their work. The members of the corps, both male and female, were rushed in their departure and unable to raise travel expenses. After arriving in Hong Kong, they were penniless, and the members mostly supported themselves by pawning their clothes for food. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, Ap Lei Chau Girls' Club, YMCA, Reporters' Association, and Amateur Association, sympathizing with the corps' work, have been actively appealing to the public for assistance. It is reported that the corps, to thoroughly explain their organization to the public, has specifically scheduled a reception for the Hong Kong press and various groups and schools at 4:00 PM on the 13th of this month (Saturday) at the Women's War Relief Society located at 10 Des Voeux Road Central, to report on their past work in Shanghai and future work plans.

### An Undeserving Death of a Fighter! In Memory of Mr. Shang Zhongyi

â€” Qi Zhuo

Hong Kong Organizations to Hold Meeting Tonight to Prepare for Memorial Service

What? Mr. Shang Zhongyi is deadâ€”this shocking news stunned everyone!

Death is, after all, a common occurrence. But, a soldier who shouldn't have died, has finally died! Heaven has mourned the loss of this intellectual, the loss of this brave man, it is truly heartbreaking!

Sorrow awakens poignant memories:

Mr. Shang, Dr. Shang, he was a progressive educator, a well-known scholar. He was a professor at Peking University, Zhongshan University, Xiang University, and other universities. He was the principal of Zhejiang Provincial People's Education School and Guangxi Provincial Sun Yat-sen Memorial School. However, these academic qualifications and experiences cannot fully illustrate Mr. Shang's greatness, cannot illustrate that Mr. Shang was a pioneer of the national liberation movement, and even less can illustrate that Mr. Shang was a mentor worshiped by the vast youth masses.

When the cannon fire of national liberation of the "July 7th Incident" sounded, Mr. Guo Moruo resolutely abandoned his wife and children and joined the embrace of the motherland, presiding over the sacred mission of the Third Department of the Political Department. Comparable to Mr. Guo was Mr. Shang Zhongyi, who also resolutely abandoned the briefcase of a university professor and joined the ranks of national salvation, presiding over the sacred mission of the Third Group of the Political Department of the Fourth War Zone.

Although he was over forty years old and had been a university professor for over ten years, he was still purely innocent and enthusiastically cheerful, a typical young man. His papers, in addition to being insightful, were as touching as literature, and his speeches deeply moved people's hearts and inspired them. He demonstrated a spirit of hard work and pragmatism in practice, which was especially admirable and convincing.

"Friends! The great era has arrived! It has indeed arrived! We must welcome this great era"â€”these were the words that Mr. Shang sincerely encouraged his friends and taught his students. He himself was a staunch practitioner of this belief. He devoted all his energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge to his work. Mr. Shang was a key figure in the establishment of the united front in South China, and the surpassing of the Wuhan results in the "August 13th" donation drive.

When Mr. Shang, along with Mr. Zhong Tianxin, Mr. Huang Zhongmian, and others, organized the Anti-Japanese War Education Practice Society and ran self-study classes and various training classes, he slept on the floor with the young friends, exhausting himself and preparing for battle, which moved countless young people and inspired many who worked with him. "Passionate in private, ruthless in public"; "Comrades! Are you working diligently? Are you taking time to read useful books?"; "Work for others first, enjoy after others"; "Don't fall behind the times, don't rush ahead of the times, stay in the middle of the times, and push the times forward"â€”these were all indicators that Mr. Shang practiced himself. They are also frequently repeated admonitions to young people. Unexpectedly, they have now become his last words!

Just when the country and nation needed Mr. Shang, Mr. Shang fell asleep underground! Mr. Shang did not die in his proper place, which makes people even more sad!

Recentlyâ€”in a sudden change within a monthâ€”Mr. Shang left the Political Department and continued to work as before. Director Xu of the Education Department invited him to be the director of the Provincial People's Education Center. He came to Hong Kong on official business and died in a car accident on April 22 in Zhaoqing. Upon hearing the news, the reporter felt both grief and suspicion. He then went to Mrs. Shang's home in Kowloon to inquire. It happened that Mr. Zhong Tianxin was also there to offer condolences. Mrs. Shang was extremely grieved, and Mr. Zhong and the reporter were even more saddened! According to Mr. Zhong, Director Huang Zhongmian of the Education Department had already sent a telegram two days before the news was published in the newspaper. Unfortunately, the news turned out to be true. It is reported that two people were injured. All other passengers were safe, but only Mr. Shang was killed. Heavens! Heavens!

The reporter recently received a special issue of "Condolences to Mr. Shang Zhongyi" printed by the Art Symposium in Shaoguan, which further revealed that the friends in Qujiang were weeping and sighing, and the night scene in Qujiang was also dimmed. The special issue contained seven mourning articles written with blood and tears, including Zuo Hongtao's "Fill His Position"; Sima Wensen's "A Fighter Who Shouldn't Have Died, but Finally Died!"; Zhang Jingren's "Complete Mr. Shang's Aspirations"; Li Yuzhong's "Lost a Fighter"; Xinbo's "Turn Our Tears of Grief into Bullets"; He Jiahua's "Use Work to Commemorate Our Warrior"; and Zheng Lixia's "The Bad News." Reading them made people feel grief and indignation, and also made them realize that those who survived could not relax their work. The cause that Mr. Shang left behind is waiting for us to complete. Hong Kong cultural groups and cultural figures, in order to commemorate Mr. Shang's spirit and inspire patriotic and national salvation enthusiasm and action, have jointly launched a "Memorial Service for Dr. Shang Zhongyi," which is scheduled to hold a symposium at 7:30 PM today at the Kowloon Shandong Street Chinese Children's Academy branch, in order to prepare everything. It is hoped that Mr. Shang's friends will wipe away their tears, suppress their grief, and attend on time to jointly carry out the event. The organizations initiating the memorial service include: Clerical Association, Amateur Association, Zhongda Northward Service Corps. Hong Kong Chinese Christian Youth Association, Chinese Education Society, Tsinghua Alumni Association, Hong Kong Branch of the Youth Reporters Association, Guoxun News Agency Hong Kong Branch, New Literature Research Association, All Faculty and Staff of Kowloon Tong School, China National Salvation Drama Troupe, Shengqi Women's Advancement Association, Chinese Amateur School, Chinese Children's Academy, etc.

The individuals initiating the memorial service include: He Canghai, Shen Hengshan, Xia Yan, Zhuang Zexuan, Chao Guanhua, Zhong Tianxin, Tang Lopo, Mrs. Zou Lu, Wen Donghan, Fan Naiguang, Hu Chunbing, Lu Fu, Liang Ruochen, Cai Zixin, Tao Xingzhi, Fang Yuyan, Hu Yuzhi, Wang Jiyuan, Liu Simu, Jin Zhonghua, Wu Hanzhen, Li Xinhui, Ye Lingfeng, Zhu Qizhuo, etc.

### Our Motherland Fights Like This! Our Motherland is So Bright! The Laudable and Tearful "Phoenix City"

â€” Huo Xi

China Travel Drama Troupe to Perform at the Queen's Theatre Tonight

Special Feature

When Mr. Wu Zuguang presided over the provincial training institute in Hubei, he obtained two volumes of "The Posthumous Manuscripts of Martyr Miao Kexiu," a famous historical work, from Mr. Jiang Wenyu. This is a heroic fact about Miao Kexiu Zhao Tong and a group of righteous male soldiers from Northeast China, and it is a praiseworthy and tearful "new legend" known to the general public, aspiring young people, and villagers. Mr. Wu believed it to be an unparalleled panacea to revive the paralyzed nerves, so he used it as a textbook for "spiritual lectures." When Mr. Wu spoke about the most painful parts, he choked and could not speak, and none of the four hundred instructors and students present did not cover their faces and weep, lingering in despair. Later, Mr. Wu keenly seized this good subject matter at the National Academy of Drama and, with the skills of theatrical art, wrote "Phoenix City," a masterpiece in the national defense drama front. When "Phoenix City" was publicly performed in Chongqing, many people shed tears, many people were filled with righteous indignation, and many people rose in awe, which was truly a remarkable achievement.

When Ms. Tang Ruoqing came from Guilin to Hong Kong to participate in the reconstruction of China Travel, she brought this script with her as the first shot of the new China Travel. China Travel's spirit of fighting in hardship is very sympathetic and admirable. Using "Phoenix City" to lay its new foundation is especially eye-catching in terms of consciousness. The reporter was deeply moved after visiting their rehearsals and has written a special report, detailed in this newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly.

On the 28th of last month, the troupe first performed "Phoenix City" at the Queen's Theatre as a charity performance for the Women's Joint Committee to raise funds. The overall performance can be said to be very satisfactory. The most valuable thing is the spirit of hard work behind the scenes. The actors who were well-dressed also worked hard to take care of the stage set-up. It makes people think that the seasoned veterans who have struggled in the theater circle for six years are now starting anew in the difficulties of starting a business. If they continue to work hard with this spirit, their future will definitely be infinitely bright.

The opening, the setting, and the costume were as meticulous as the original China Travel. The actors' serious efforts showed that they were sincerely using all their energy to report on the expectations of those who love and care for China Travel.

Mr. Tang Huaiqiu himself played Miao Kexiu, showing the indomitable revolutionary spirit from beginning to end. It fully symbolizes that the soul of the Chinese nation cannot be humiliated. The experienced Ms. Ruoqing played the female spy, which was also one of the most vivid characters. And Ruoying's liveliness, the old woman's slowness, "Zhang Sheng"'s liveliness, Lin Jing's gentleness, and Jiabao's simplicity are all extraordinary characters in the play. It is believed that they will further develop their advantages in the re-performance. In terms of plot, every scene is very tense and captures the audience's mind. The heroic spirit of the volunteer army, Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—, seems to make people throw themselves into the arms of the motherland. In Hong Kong, where the smell of gunpowder cannot be smelled, and from the perspective of overseas Chinese whose self-confidence is not strong enough, it is a very meaningful subject matter. National defense scripts do not make people feel dry in terms of interest, and "Phoenix City" also has its own unique features.

China Travel will present "Phoenix City" at the Queen's Theatre again tonight at 9:15. It is believed that this performance will definitely purify the past experience and take a further step. Whether from an artistic or ideological point of view, "Phoenix City" is worth recommending to readers. Every Chinese person should understand that our motherland is struggling like this! Everyone should accept this heroic revolutionary cleansing!

### Recent Situation in Shantou After Repeated Tragic Bombings

(Shantou Correspondence) After the tragic bombings of Shantou in recent days, the city has become a dead city during the day. Trading habits have suddenly reversed. Stores are closed and pedestrians are scarce from morning until 4 pm. Only at night does it return to a lively city. The municipal government is currently investigating the exact number of compatriots who were injured and killed and the loss of houses, and has handed it over to the Relief Association to allocate funds for compensation. On the night of the 9th, more than ten Japanese warships sailed west in formation, and the situation suddenly became tense. It was later learned that this batch of Japanese warships was transporting reinforcements from Taiwan to Guangzhou. In addition, the British merchant ship Yunnan, belonging to the Taikoo Company, was intercepted and inspected by a Japanese warship at the mouth of Mamoi on the 9th. More than 30,000 Hong Kong newspapers on board were burned. It was found that the same incident occurred when the Kunming ship entered the port on the 30th of last month. This shows that the Japanese are outwardly tough but inwardly weak and fear our righteous public opinion.

### Provincial Government Orders Counties Along the West River to Protect Dikes to Prevent Japanese Bombings from Causing Floods

(Zhongshan Fast News) With the gradual rise of summer floods, the military authorities in the counties along the lower reaches of the West River, such as Gaoyao, Sihui, Qingyuan, Gaoming, and Heshan, in addition to actively deploying defensive works and strictly preventing the Japanese army from invading the west, are also paying close attention to the protection of various dikes. Yesterday, the provincial government ordered Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Third District, to issue an order to the counties of Yao (Gaoyao), Ming (Gaoming), He (Heshan), and Si (Sihui) to strengthen the defense of various dikes and strictly prevent Japanese aircraft from bombing and breaching them, causing floods. At the same time, the dike management committees organized rescue teams and construction teams. It was found that the largest dike gardens on the south bank of the lower reaches of the West River include Sanjiang, Chongbu, Chongyue, Yinjiang, and Tiantang, etc. The Lubaoshuichan in Sanshui is also protected by the county government sending special personnel to be responsible.

### Japanese Planes Attempt to Bomb Our Anti-Japanese Slogan

(Wuzhou Fast News) In recent days, one or two Japanese planes have been scouting along the West River, frequently wreaking havoc on our firewood boats. Many firewood boats in Nanjiangkou, Yuecheng, Fengchuan, and other places have been bombed and destroyed by Japanese planes. On April 30, two Japanese planes, scouting along the West River from Sanshui, flew over a mountain in the waterway entrance of Wuzhou. They attempted to bomb the four large characters "Resist Japan and Save the Nation" written by General Li Zongren, but they did not hit. The bombs fell into the sea. The four large characters are made of stone, each character being more than ten feet long and wide. This bombing was the third time, but there was no damage. (May 1)

### Provincial Party Headquarters Widely Implements Mass Training

[Shaoguan Correspondence] The Provincial Party Headquarters believes that it has been half a year since this province became a war zone, and the strength of the people has not yet been fully utilized. Now that the second phase of the war of resistance is underway, it is necessary to accelerate the implementation of leading the masses, organizing the masses, and training the masses. A draft of the mass training work plan outline and implementation measures has been formulated and issued to the party headquarters of various counties and cities for implementation. The first step is to adjust the original mass organizations in various places, improve their organization, and strengthen their work. The second step is to enrich the grass-roots mass organization, universally establish organizations at all levels of industry, commerce, agriculture, and academia in various counties and cities, in order to go deep into the countryside and effectively organize the masses. The third step is to expand the guidance of various mass organizations, organize various wartime work teams, and undertake wartime service work to meet military needs. The fourth step is to widely implement anti-Japanese resistance and national reconstruction, as well as intellectual and technical training, mobilize party members and intellectuals in various places, and adopt active methods to provide training separately.

### Guilin Headquarters Staff Inspects West River Line, Chicken Cage Island Further Blockaded

(Wuzhou Fast News) The defense of the West River line has been deployed by Bai Chongxi, the director of the Southwest Headquarters. All coastal positions are extremely consolidated. In addition to the completion of the blockade line of the Lingyang Gorge in the upper reaches of the West River, defensive works have been deployed in the Fengchuan Jiangkou waterways on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. In recent days, many elite troops from Guangxi Province have arrived in the vicinity of the two banks to actively increase defense. After Director Bai sent a staff team to Wuzhou to inspect wartime preparations, he went to inspect and deploy military affairs along the Fu River. It was found that the team had returned to Wuzhou yesterday and went to inspect the West River again. Now that the tide is high and the water is rising, the Wuzhou authorities have strengthened the blockade line of the Wuzhou waterway by further blockading the Chicken Cage Island. At the same time, the dangerous points in the Baisha area are also actively completing the consolidation project.

### Rice Prices Soar in the West River Area, Provincial Relief Society Allocates Funds to Organize Price Stabilization, Ordered to be Handled by Commissioner Li and Commander Deng in Counties

(Qujiang Fast News) Since the Japanese invaders invaded the south, rice-producing areas in this province, such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and Zengcheng counties, have been trampled on one after another, resulting in an extreme shortage of inland food and soaring rice prices, causing great suffering to the people, especially in the counties along the West River. The Guangdong Provincial Relief Society has successively received telegrams from Director Bai of the Guilin Headquarters and Deputy Director Xu of the Relief Committee, ordering them to quickly find ways to provide relief. It is believed that the lack of food in the counties along the West River during this transition period is a serious problem, and the method of relief should be to organize price stabilization in order to stabilize rice prices and enrich people's lives. Several measures have already been drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval. It is reported that the association will first allocate 20,000 yuan in relief funds and hand it over to Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Second District, and Commander Deng Longguang to supervise and urge the rice-deficient counties to organize price stabilization, and also write a report on the amount of grain shortage in each county, the current rice price, and the method of organizing price stabilization for approval. As for the method of allocating and transporting rice, it will be discussed carefully before issuing orders to comply.

### Our Army in Hainan Actively Counterattacks, Wenchang XX Surrenders, Weakness of Japanese Troops Exposed, Zhuang Laborers From Weizhou Sent to Hainan by Japanese

(Southern Route Fast News) With the victory of our army's counterattack in northern Guangdong, the Japanese generals transferred troops from Hainan Island to reinforce. Currently, the Japanese troops on the island are extremely empty, and have been repeatedly severely damaged by our guerrillas. According to reliable information, there are currently only more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers, more than 30 airplanes, more than 50 tanks, and more than 100 vehicles (including armored vehicles and automobiles) in the occupied areas of Hainan Island. The Japanese therefore deliberately frequently transfer troops in order to conceal their emptiness. However, because they are repeatedly attacked by our guerrillas, they are extremely panicked, and their war-weariness is also increasing day by day. Currently, the Japanese army in Hainan Island, although occupying the county seats of Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, and Qiongdong, has not dared to advance towards our defense line except for defending several strongholds due to the activity of our guerrillas. The guerrillas in Wenchang County launched a counterattack yesterday against the Japanese army entrenched in Baiyan City, resulting in fierce fighting for two or three hours, with more than half of the Japanese troops injured or killed. The guerrillas launched a counterattack against the county seat of Ding'an a few days ago, once breaking into the city, killing one mid-level officer, and beheading him to show the public, greatly pleasing the people. Liu Cili, the female leader of the Wenchang County guerrilla team, directed the cooperation of the military and civilians to kill the Japanese, and the government gave her a special commendation. It is also reported that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries will send warships to Hainan Island to monitor Japanese military operations. There are still more than 100 Japanese troops in the Weizhou area.

A few days ago, Saito, the newly transferred Japanese commander, arrived in Weizhou. The representatives of the puppet maintenance committee on the island held a meeting, requesting that the Japanese solve the problem of food panic on Weizhou. The Japanese commander actually said that to solve the food problem, the island people could be slaughtered for two or three thousand. The representatives were extremely frightened upon hearing this. After the final decision, the Japanese decided to transfer all the strong laborers on the island to Hainan Island, while restricting the people of Weizhou from going to sea for fishing, limiting them to going to sea at 9 am every day and returning to the island at 5 pm. A few days ago, two fishermen from Dishui Village were a few minutes late returning to the island from fishing, and the Japanese tied their hands and feet, hung them up, tied a large stone around their waists, whipped them violently, and killed them instantly. On the 3rd of this month, five refugees from Weizhou returned to Beihai, including Huang Guicheng, who was 33 years old. Because of his anger at the Japanese atrocities, he volunteered to kill the Japanese to avenge his shame. The Beihai authorities agreed to send him to work in a certain team.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Exempts Camphor Wood Export Ban, Previously Reported Japanese Purchasing, Someone Planned to Manipulate

(Hong Kong News) In the daytime earlier this month, it was rumored that the Japanese were purchasing camphor wood in large quantities from various parts of South China, as raw material for manufacturing tear gas. Therefore, the provincial government had ordered a ban on exports. The Hong Kong Camphor Wood Furniture Merchants Association believed that someone was trying to manipulate the situation, and sent a telegram explaining the details and requesting exemption from the ban. According to the person in charge of the Camphor Wood Merchants Association, a certain camphor wood company had purchased a large amount of camphor wood and stored it in Guangzhou. Because they wanted to manipulate the opportunity, they spread rumors that the Japanese would purchase heavily in South China, and requested the provincial government to order a ban, actually wanting to raise prices and sell after the ban was issued. At that time, the provincial government was afraid that the Japanese were really purchasing domestically, so it ordered a temporary stop to exports. The Hong Kong Camphor Wood industry believed that this order affected commerce a lot, and camphor wood is a special product of our country. Once exports are banned, there would be no business to operate. After verifying that the Japanese were not attempting to purchase, a telegram was sent to the provincial government with a camphor wood board attached, requesting that an engineer be sent to test it. The test confirmed that it could not be used to make tear gas. The provincial government sent the relevant personnel to thoroughly investigate the case last Wednesday and learned that someone was trying to manipulate the facts. Now the order to exempt camphor wood from the ban has been lifted, and camphor wood has been continuously transported to Hong Kong from the mainland. However, the provincial government's reply to the merchants association has not yet been issued.

### Provincial Relief Society Announces Amount of Relief Funds Issued, Hopes All Parties Will Continue to Donate

[Shaoguan Fast News] The Guangdong Provincial Relief Society, in order to accelerate the progress of various businesses, allocated a total of more than 421,000 yuan in relief funds in February and March. It was found that the relief funds allocated in April included 1,000 yuan for the Foshan County Relief Society, 1,000 yuan for the Longmen County Relief Society, 5,000 yuan in subsidies for the Hong Kong Agricultural Arts Institute, 20,000 yuan in assistance for rescue and care for the 64th Army, 6,000 yuan in subsidies for the production team of the New Life Movement Women's Work Committee, 5,000 yuan in subsidies for the youth group of the New Life Movement Women's Work Committee, 10,000 yuan in assistance for rescue and care for the 62nd Army, 1,500 yuan for the Luoding County Relief Society, 1,000 yuan for the Ruyuan County Relief Society, 20,000 yuan for the relief of Guangzhou refugees and subsidies for old people's homes, 3,000 yuan in subsidies for the Children's Welfare Association, 1,000 yuan in relief funds for the Taishan County Relief Society, 2,000 yuan for the Hepu County Relief Society, 2,000 yuan for the Wengyuan County Relief Society, 18,400 yuan for the opening expenses of the production business group of the New Life Movement Women's Work Committee, 20,000 yuan in price stabilization funds for the counties along the West River, 3,000 yuan in relief funds for the Enping County Relief Society, 800 yuan in emergency relief funds for machine workers in Jiangmen, Xinhui, and other places, 600 yuan for the opening expenses of the Qujiang First Nursery jointly organized with the New Life Movement Women's Work Committee, 500 yuan in monthly expenses for April, 1,000 yuan in expenses for the Boluo Huang Ma Pei refugee reclamation area, 10,000 yuan in relief funds for Shunde County, 1,000 yuan in expenses for purchasing and distributing lifesaving oil in Hong Kong, totaling 135,800 yuan. The relief funds received included 90,000 yuan from the Central Government, 30,000 yuan from the overseas Chinese in Chicago, USA, 10,000 yuan from the overseas Chinese in Myanmar, 2,500 yuan from the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, 4,780.08 Hong Kong dollars from the overseas Chinese in Suriname, 500 yuan from the Sai Gon cotton pound association, 69.44 yuan from the abbot of Canshan Temple, 11,961.18 yuan from the overseas Chinese in Perak, and 50 yuan from the Siamese overseas Chinese, totaling 145,080.06 yuan and 4,780.08 Hong Kong dollars.

### British Ship Captain Visits Our Military and Political Authorities in Beihai, This Trip Purely to Visit Overseas Chinese

[Beihai Fast News] Before 11:00 am on the 2nd of this month, the British warship HMS Single, arrived in the waters of Beihai and anchored outside Digjiao Wangmen. When the British ship did not dock, the citizens of Beihai mostly suspected it was a Japanese warship. Later, the Fifth District Office received a notice from the British ship and informed the police station to inform the citizens, and the order on the market began to return to normal. Around 3:00 pm, Captain Houlton of the British ship, along with seven members of his staff and several staff members from the British Puren Hospital, went to the Fifth District Office to visit Director Liu. They talked for about thirty minutes.

According to the captain, the purpose of this trip was purely to visit overseas Chinese. He said that this was his first time in Beihai and he was visiting the military and political authorities to express his gratitude to the people of Beihai for their assistance to the British overseas Chinese.

### Celebrating the Success of the Rebuilt "China Travel Troupe"

â€”Su Yi

Before this year, after I learned the news of the "China Travel Troupe" splitting up, I was indeed not only pessimistic about the future of the entire drama industry, but also greatly saddened by the emerging industry of China. At that time, I thought that in China's current difficult environment, we young people with a major mission should unite and cooperate. How could we split up and reduce our combat power! However, unfortunately, the split actually became a reality and could not be reversed. Moreover, they even attacked each other in the newspapers, which was beyond my expectations. This can be proved by several performances of the "China Art Troupe" after the split from the "China Travel Troupe," and the various facts of the "Phoenix City" charity performance, the first performance after the "reconstruction" of the China Travel Troupe. Especially after the "reconstruction" of the China Travel Troupe, not only was Brother Huaiqiu's personal life, which had been criticized in the past, suddenly strictly disciplined, but also the attitude and spirit of work were unexpectedly positive. All the new comrades of the "China Travel Troupe" were also very hardworking and united under a common goal, working hard. I couldn't help but feel that my past sadness was a bit unfounded! Therefore, I came to the conclusion that: individual opinions are not afraid of making a fuss, as long as the fuss is justified; groups are not afraid of splitting, as long as they can work hard after the split.

I have a relatively familiar relationship with the rebuilt "China Travel Troupe," and I often have the opportunity to visit their troupe to see rehearsals and talk with the members. In all these opportunities, I know more details about everything about them. There is no need to talk about how hard their lives are, how their organization is regularized, or how hard they work. Just to give one example, they used all their efforts for half a year as a weaving troupe, spending all the hard-earned money they scraped together, only enough to maintain a night and two meals, to rehearse "Phoenix City," and they were willing to use it to participate in the charity performance held by the Women's Federation. And they also automatically proposed not to take any performance fees: car fare and meals were all self-provided. This kind of enthusiasm and sacrifice, no matter what, is worthy of my utmost admiration!

Regarding the performance of "Phoenix City," although I was unable to attend the charity performance due to a matter, I had seen several scripts two or three months ago, and then I had seen them rehearse twice. I felt that whether in terms of drama level or acting skills, they were quite confident. Sure enough, after their charity performance, I heard comments from friends who had attended from all sides, proving that my estimate was correct.

Now, the "China Travel Troupe" is holding its own public performance again. I believe that they will definitely gain more and better experience from the reviews and criticisms after the charity performance to enrich everything. There is no doubt that the results will be outstanding. I am among those who love drama, and in addition to praying that the performance of "Phoenix City" will have greater gains, I also wish the entire rebuilt "China Travel Troupe" success!

### Husband, Wife, Friend (9)

The listeners were stunned. After the song was finished, everyone applauded, but Jia Aona hurried home.

He understood his talent, which was revealed on the day of his wife's failure, causing her great shame; especially when Miss Kafa also revealed that she had traveled with him, which made his wife even more heartbroken. He saw Doris hurrying home, and therefore felt sorry for his wife again, and also hurried home after Kafa.

As soon as he entered the bedroom, he shouted loudly, "Doris!" But no one answered, and the room was very dark. He felt his way to the table and turned on the light. Just then, Doris pushed him hard from behind. He was caught off guard and fell on the table and the lamp. A light bulb broke, and the bedroom was dark again. Doris was extremely angry and fell on him, and the two wrestled together.

"Oh my god! What are you doing?" Li Aona exclaimed.

Doris punched his shoulder and shouted in his ear, "You treat me like this! You deceive me like this! You go with that woman! Go in front of everyone!"

They rolled around on the floor in the dark, knocking over chairs and lamps. Li Aona shouted, "Stop it!"

Their sudden struggle stopped, and Li Aona, with her arms around Doris, stood up and turned on another light. There was a bloody mark on his forehead, and Doris silently looked at him.

"You little - cat -," Li Aona gritted his teeth and said, throwing her on the bed.

Doris sat up: "Get out! I don't want to see you again!"

"No, my wife!" Li Aona wiped the wound on his forehead and said in a loud voice, "You shouldn't hit me in the dark!" (To be continued)

### Xu He Cup Football Final: South China to Battle Navy; Liang Rongzhao Recovers from Injury and Takes Central Defender Position

[Special Report from This Newspaper] As spring turns to summer and the weather gradually warms, the island's sports scene, driven by the heat, is undergoing a transformation of ebb and flow.

Football has waned, and many athletes are in seclusion. By Causeway Bay, the field is deserted and people are scarce. In So Kon Po, grass buries the traces of battle. This scene truly evokes a sense of elegance and dispersion.

However, the Xu He Cup competition has not yet ended. It will take tomorrow's decisive battle to complete the mission. This is also the finale of the six major championship competitions.

In this competition, our China team has won five championships one after another, with only the Xu He Cup yet to be resolved. It is truly eagerly awaited. Now the auspicious date is set. Let's see who will ultimately claim victory.

What a beautiful silver cup, shining before our eyes, making our mouths water. I hope that the South China athletes will work hard and complete this final masterpiece. I sincerely wish them well.

However, the South China players are now fatigued. The team lineup is quite hesitant. The person in charge of selecting the players cannot help but have a headache. Fortunately, South China has a large number of talented players who can be utilized. Yesterday, a battle line was determined, which is considered satisfactory under the circumstances. The lineup is as follows:

Zhang Rongcai, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Xie Jinhong, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Yang Shui, Ying Qi, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, Deng Guangsen

Substitutes: Luo Douwen, Tan Zhenhui, Lin Depu, Yang Genbao (Tai Sui)

### Yesterday's Basketball Game: Star Island Almost Failed Due to Underestimation; Guangda's Late Weakness Leads to Loss

In the public men's basketball game last night, Star Island played Guangda. Star Island is a strong team in this competition. Since the start of the competition, except for one loss to Chung Sing, they have swept all other opponents and their momentum is loud. They have already regarded the championship as within their grasp. Although Guangda is not a strong team, their fighting power should not be underestimated. Yesterday, when they met Star Island, there was a clear difference in strength. Failure was expected. However, at the beginning, Star Island underestimated their opponents and performed poorly. Guangda, on the other hand, fought with all their strength. From the first half to the last six minutes of the second half, they still had the advantage. At this time, Star Island was besieged on all sides and exhausted. As a result, excessive actions occurred frequently. Li Peichi and Li Peiyan were fouled out after four fouls. However, when Guangda was forced to 36-36 by Star Island, the whole team was eager to win and only knew how to move forward, neglecting their defense. This allowed Star Island to take advantage of the opportunity, with three lines of attack, Dai Fucheng, Xin Yalang, and Li Shijie, breaking through from the left and right and gaining repeatedly, thus reversing the precarious situation and finally winning 54-38.

Overall, Guangda was able to advance with three lines and intercept with three strategies, so Star Island's attack was exhausted. Laodong and Wu Xuanzhao's long shots were often intercepted by the opponent and could not be displayed freely. Zheng Yutang played quite pertinently but missed many opportunities. However, he scored a lot of points on free throws. Liang Jiangqiang and Liang Jiefu transported and defended, both of which were able to fulfill their responsibilities, but at the critical moment in the end, their defense was weak, allowing Star Island to take advantage of the momentum and launch a fierce attack, leading to a failed success. Star Island, on the other hand, had the most contributions from Dai Fucheng, Xin Zhongjian, and Liang Guofeng. Li Shijie's sneak attacks under the basket also had unique abilities. Their reversal of defeat was not without reason. However, Guangda's lack of stamina in the later stages was the most fatal flaw. If they could remain calm and composed in the face of danger, Star Island would not have been able to reverse the victory easily.

After the two teams made contact, Laodong took the initiative to show his strength, and Zheng Huangtang also sent troops to ask for directions, each with their own gains. Then, Dai Fucheng succeeded in attacking, and Laodong also returned the favor. As a result, they fell into a fierce battle, which was very tense. After a while, Laodong fired twice and both were successful, leading 10-3. Seeing the smoke of war billowing, Chung Chi Keung, Li Shijie, and Li Peiyan, three new forces, arrived, and the situation changed. Under the fierce counterattack of Pan Yaojun, Li Peiyan, and Li Shijie, they chased back to a score of 11-12. Guangda was unwilling to lose what they had gained, and Wu Xuanzhao and Laodong and others went out of their way to inspire them, so that Star Island's position was in a state of panic. At the end of the first half, Guangda led with a score of 24-14.

Changing sides and fighting again, Liang Guoduo and Chen Shibin joined the battle group, and their prestige was slightly boosted. After a hard fight, they gained a little. Liang Jiangqiang, Wu Xuanzhao, Laodong, and others also fired their crossbows together, holding on to 32-24, and Star Island was still behind. When Dai Fucheng, Xin Yalang, Liang Guoduo, and others made every effort to charge, they chased to a score of 31-32. Unexpectedly, Zheng Yutang of Guangda regained the opportunity and used both shooting and penalties, and Star Island's wind was tight again. Fortunately, Xin Yalang and Dai Fucheng made contributions at the bottom of the basket, and returned the color, which created an extremely tense situation of 36-36. At this time, Guangda, with the sudden change of the situation, the whole army looked forward to fighting on their backs. Liang Jiangqiang and Liang Jiefu only knew how to move forward, and their defense was empty, so Star Island took advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce attack, with Liang Guoduo and Li Shijie flanking from both sides, and the score was thus surpassed. Guangda's general situation was also gone. When the gold was called to collect the troops, Guangda finally lost with a score of 38-54, which was a pity. The results are as follows:

(Guangda) Shots Penalties Fouls Points

Liang Jiefu 1 0 2 2

Zheng Yutang 3 6 2 12

Laodong 4 0 3 8

Liang Jiangqiang 3 1 2 7

Total Points 54

In the current basketball A-League, each team has finished eight games. Star Island has the highest score, with seven wins and one loss for 14 points. However, Star Island's victory over South China is still unknown due to South China's appeal. If South China loses the appeal, Star Island will steadily occupy the championship seat. However, South China is still tied with Chung Sing, and a runner-up battle must be held to determine who belongs to it.

### Philippine Travelogue

â€” Hui Tang

May 1st Travel Log

Yesterday, I twisted my thigh in the game, and the bruise between my thighs was clearly visible. The pain really kept me awake all night. Today is Labor Day, a citywide holiday. The Philippine hosts invited our team to tour the city's famous attractions. All the places such as the aquarium, ancient fortresses, chicken fighting grounds, and Okeer Golf Club were new to the visitors. I was limping, so I stayed behind. In the afternoon, I went to watch the ancient tennis cup selection match at the indoor stadium. The facilities were grand. As the Far East champion, our country's facilities have lagged far behind. The underdevelopment of sports is not without reason. In the evening, I was invited by my friend Mr. Lin Zhuguang to the largest dance hall in the Far East, St. Jena, to dispel my worries. The lights were bright, the wine was green, and the aroma of the ladies' clothes was intoxicating. The friends were all in high spirits, especially Da Gao and Rongzhao, who were elated and forgot to return home. My hamstrings were like bricks, so I could only admire it and not try it. Looking at the fish in the water, I could only sigh.

May 2nd, 1-3 Gerni was already sick, and I felt an even greater shortage of talent. Although Rongzhao's injury had not yet healed, he had to go to the border. I was like A Chi, my hamstrings ached at every turn, and Buddha had to make up for all the deficiencies to barely form an army. During the day, friends from the Chinese community frequently came to inquire or called to ask about the leg injury, and their sincerity and concern made me feel extremely grateful. That night, we played against the LASALLE team, which was very strong. In recent years, they have had a guaranteed victory over visiting teams. Most of their players are current Philippine athletes. We have frequent injuries and illnesses, and our energy is depleted. Although everyone encouraged each other to try their best to avenge their previous shame before the game, I asked myself and knew that my strength was not complete, and I was afraid that I would repeat the shame of the previous night. As expected, we were still able to hold on with all our strength when we took the field. After the change of formation, the plan was revealed. Rongzhao and Zhaorong's old wounds recurred, and their movements were painful, let alone running and shooting. The remaining nine people were in a bitter battle because of this. Before the end of the game, they felt exhausted. As a result, they lost to the young and energetic La Salle team with the same score as last time. Thinking of the third game in the coming days, I don't know how to form an army, and I can't help but worry. Before the game tonight, it rained heavily, and many fans did not come. It is estimated that "more than three thousand fans" were present, which is a world of difference from the shoulder-to-shoulder connection of the previous night. The score was 2-1 in the first half, and the final result was 3-1. Feng Ershu made a contribution on our side. Rong Sheng took on the heavy responsibility for the first time and gave a wonderful performance. Having this new star defender is also a blessing for our Chinese team. Fighting a few against many is the key to our team's repeated failures. All the friends bowed and exhausted themselves, and their fighting spirit is commendable. The players who fought in this battle are listed on the left:

Tan Junqian, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Birudo, Fisuwoda, Hou Chengtuo, Li Zhaorong, Da Gao Sanu, Feng Jingxiang, Yan Bachen

May 3rd, Banquet

Since arriving in the Philippines, we have lost two battles. The ambition we had when we first came here was like winter snow meeting the sun, melting away and disappearing with the shadow. I miss the charming Hong Kong, and I am sure that the news will be shocking and disappointing, and people will compete to ask the reason, or even complain and blame. However, the bad luck our team has encountered cannot be added to. I myself was injured and there was a lot less threat in the front line. Rongzhao and Zhaorong had a recurrence of old wounds, and Niwei was suffering from stomach problems. Among the fourteen generals who could hold a spear and meet the enemy, only two were completely healthy. In addition, the weather was very hot, there was insufficient sleep, more drinking than eating, and fighting with lights on made us feel uncomfortable. Da Gao even had to wear glasses to compensate for poor vision. Under these circumstances, it was difficult to win, and the result, although not what we expected at first, was that everyone fought to the end, and even if they lost, it was not too much to blame. At noon, Consul General Yang Guangzhu hosted a meal at the Oriental Club to treat our team. Leaders of the Chinese community accompanied us warmly, and we were very grateful for their kindness. It is said that the number of Chinese expatriates on the Philippine Islands is about 80,000 in recent years, and their patriotism has always been second to none. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the amount of donations has been second only to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. They have donated their salaries and saved food, and have never stopped. Hearing the rooster crow and dancing, the misers in the country, who lack national compassion, can be inspired. In the evening, the Philippine Progressive Association held a public banquet for the Hong Kong team at the Little Luzon Hotel, with more than 100 guests and hosts, which was quite a grand occasion for a while. During the banquet, the chairman stressed that Hong Kong and the Philippines should have further and better contacts in sports in the future, and said that the Philippine team's advantage in this game was due to the "heat". It is true that the victory of the non-team was due to the weather in many ways, and the chairman's words were not wrong. After three rounds of wine, I and Jian Jin Xiang gave a speech to thank the host for their sincere hospitality. When the meeting was over, each received a souvenir, which turned out to be a Panama straw hat, which was just enough to meet the needs of summer in Hong Kong.

### Xu Brothers Will Compete With Philippine Generals; Philippine Generals Will Arrive in Hong Kong Next Thursday

Philippine Table Cup players Sanjazi and Anbang will arrive in Hong Kong next Thursday (mistakenly stated as this Thursday earlier) on President Biass's plane and will stay for about two days. In order to satisfy the audience's desire to watch, the Hong Kong Cricket Club has prepared a performance match to give the Xu brothers, who are invincible in Hong Kong, a chance to compete with the top Philippine players. At the same time, we can measure the level of the Xu brothers' tennis skills and see how far they have risen. If compared to tennis performances, it will definitely be a sensation.

### Why Doesn't the Mui Fong Basketball Team Participate in the Charity Match?

â€” (Basketball Field Tai Sui)

After a long period of preparation, the deadline for registration for the Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Match has now passed and is about to begin. Four teams have participated: Wah Hung, Southwest, China, and Chi Hang. In the future, good players will gather together to plead for the suffering compatriots, which will definitely be a wonderful contribution and win the sympathy of the audience.

However, there is one thing that makes me feel stuck in my throat and I have to spit it out: Why doesn't the Mui Fong team, which is known as the hegemon of the basketball world and has the highest reputation, participate in this match? The reason is quite puzzling. If it is said that it is because the team will not be able to gather together to play basketball, then why do you see them participating in the charity match tomorrow? This is a charity match, and that is also a charity match. Is it difficult to lend a hand to the Shenbao Cup?

This Shenbao Cup Charity Match is organized by the Basketball Federation, and Mui Fong is also a member of the current staff of the Federation. In principle, since the Federation has this good deed, all staff members should do their best to help so that this good deed can be a grand sight and achieve good results. Those who help respect the Federation on the one hand, and doing good is the greatest joy on the other hand. Even if the championship cannot be obtained, they will have a clear conscience. Moreover, Mui Fong has always had a good reputation. If they are willing to come out and help, it will not only make the competition more interesting, but if they can attract a large number of spectators to the field and increase ticket revenue, the suffering compatriots will be greatly grateful.

Mui Fong's non-participation this time may have other reasons, which are also unknown. However, according to the news that the reporter has obtained from the side, the reason is very simple, especially those that are not considered as reasons. However, the reporter is a close friend with the principal of the school, Mr. Chen Tieyi, and knows that he understands it, but it seems that the goal is mistaken for this charity.

### Yesterday's School Volleyball Game Canceled Due to Rain; Three Games Today

The school volleyball game was originally scheduled to have three games yesterday, but when the time came, it was raining and the court was wet, making it difficult to compete, so the game was postponed. Today (12th) there are still three games in order: Senior Paul vs. National, Junior Deming vs. Yinghuang, held at Blake Garden at 4:30 PM, Children's Grade Huangren vs. Yucai, held at the open-air court.

### I Add A Few Comments

â€” Zou Falu

Mr. Zhuoyue believes that sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers should not frequently publish news about ball games. Instead, they should try to publish articles on sports theories and methods so that compatriots in Hong Kong can understand the true meaning of sports and truly benefit from sports training. This is indeed an important issue that newspapers should actively promote. However, in addition to Mr. Zhuoyue's insightful views, I would like to add a few comments.

The goal of setting up sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers should not only target compatriots in Hong Kong but also consider compatriots in the mainland. During this all-out war of resistance, all of us, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, should not be divided by regional boundaries and should work together towards the goal of resisting the war. This is an unbreakable iron rule. While compatriots overseas should have strong physiques to serve the country, compatriots in the mainland should have even stronger physiques to serve the country. Moreover, the number of compatriots in Hong Kong is, after all, small, and their contribution to the country is mostly indirect. Compatriots in the mainland are the main source of manpower and directly bear the responsibility of killing the enemy and achieving results. Hong Kong's prestigious newspapers have a considerable circulation in the mainland. If they can consistently advocate for the development of sports in the mainland, the sports scene in the mainland will surely benefit greatly. This is my first hope: that sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers should also take into account sports in the mainland.

Hong Kong, due to its favorable environment, has been at the forefront of sports development. In the country, apart from Shanghai, which is now an isolated island, there is probably no place that can compare. It has consistently demonstrated superior sports performance in front of the Chinese people, which is clear for all to see. What about sports in the mainland? Because my homelandâ€”Jiangsuâ€”has fallen, I fled to Guangxi. Having been accustomed to sports in Jiangsu, I was initially disheartened by sports in Guangxi. Sports in schools are merely about training athletes, and community sports are nominal. The authorities are indifferent, and the instructors perfunctorily fulfill their duties. As a result, there is the name of sports but not the responsibility of sports. I fear that this trend will not be beneficial to the future of the war of resistance. This is my second hope: that sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers should assist in the development of sports in the mainland.

Hong Kong is a major port in East Asia, with many ships traveling to and from foreign countries every day. Therefore, imported goods are readily available, and sports equipment is readily available. Any sport can be easily arranged. After the mainland's coastline was blockaded by the enemy and transportation was cut off, the source of sports equipment became scarce, and its value increased several times compared to the past. A ball that could be obtained for three or four yuan in Jiangsu now costs dozens of yuan here, and there are even cases where you cannot buy it even if you have money. Moreover, their traditional bad habit is that "sports is playing ball" and "no ball, no sports." In this environment where all parties are saving for the war of resistance and sports must be popular, easy to implement, and directly helpful to the military, is this aristocratic and entertainment-focused ball game suitable for the mainland? That is a question. This is my third hope: that sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers should promote wartime sports and urge the mainland to eliminate traditional bad habits.

People in the mainland may not recognize the true meaning of sports, so they are shortsighted about sports and not only do not support it, but even obstruct it. All newspapers, limited by their narrow mindset and small scale, do not have time to promote sports and make beneficial publicity for the country and the nation. This is the newspapers' undeniable duty, especially for newspapers in Hong Kong, which are at the forefront of trends, should raise their voices and take the lead so that newspapers in other regions can also pay attention to this direct problem related to saving the countryâ€”sports trainingâ€”and jointly promote its important significance so that the people of the country can awaken and the future of the war of resistance can truly rely on it. This is my fourth hope: that sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers can guide mainland newspapers to jointly promote sports.

In short, what I hope for in sports columns in Hong Kong newspapers is that, in addition to publishing news about ball games and paying attention to the sports problems of overseas compatriots, they must also pay attention to the sports problems of compatriots in the mainland. To enlighten the deaf and awaken the blind, the country relies on Hong Kong newspapers' view of sports as a national affair. Those responsible for editing will probably not dismiss my humble opinion, will they?

### Leading by Example

â€” Chen Kangbai

This is not a popular term, but a code of conduct for those who bear the "exemplary role".

A person who truly matches their "words" and "deeds," whether at home or in public service, will surely handle everything properly. Conversely, if your words and actions are inconsistent, no matter how beautifully you speak or how pleasant your words may sound, once the moment passes, everything is over. Some may even whisper behind your back, "He's just talking."

As a parent, if you can always consider the impact on your children in your diet and daily life, and always base your interactions with others on "leading by example," then your children will naturally be humble, courteous, and willing to sacrifice themselves for the group. In the past, Mr. Fan Xiwenzhen was always eager to help others and generously assist the masses. Therefore, his sons were all able to carry on his legacy and expand their father's career. This is because they were influenced and subtly changed by what they saw and heard.

A civil servant in politics who truly achieves "If it is not mine, I will not take even a single hair." Then his subordinates, without the need for constant, exhausting admonitions, will naturally be honest and self-disciplined. Confucius said, "Wealth and honor obtained unjustly are like floating clouds to me." Therefore, during the three months that he served as prime minister, the state achieved the good political achievement of "no one picking up lost items." Moreover, among his many disciples, there were very few who would take anything they could get their hands on. This is also the effect of "leading by example," not just the result of "fearing the rod."

Zhao Tong became a model guerrilla leader during the War of Resistance. I believe this was mostly due to the influence of his mother, who was rich in nationalistic ideas. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for Zhao Tong to do what he did, because his mother would have risked her life to stop him. In the harsh environment of the Northeast, secretly transporting military supplies and secretly organizing would have been difficult to carry out so smoothly.

Xie Jiyuan fought repeatedly in the Battle of Shanghai, always leading by example. His loyalty, courage, and patriotism could move heaven and earth and impress ghosts and gods. Therefore, his subordinates were also able to regard death as returning home and value the country as much as Mount Tai. The terms "Eight Hundred Heroes" and "Four Lines Warehouse" have now become international terms.

However, since the start of the War of Resistance, there have been many such heroic deeds by Chinese civil and military officials. Anyone who pays attention to newspapers can often see similar records. This is largely due to the inspiration of the central government's major national policies. At the same time, it also teaches the other side that the freedom of the Chinese nation and the territory and sovereignty of the Republic of China are absolutely inviolable and cannot be plundered.

The other side never thought of the saying "Those who commit many unrighteous acts will perish!" They have taught their people to take the consequences themselves, using aggressive and murderous acts and deceptive words. There have been many such precedents in the history of the world, both ancient and modern.

However, I must say that I believe that the four words "leading by example" should not only be clearly written in the depths of our minds during the current National Spiritual Mobilization but also firmly remembered in our hearts in ordinary times in the future. Only in this way can everything be done well! Only in this way can we accomplish anything! Only in this way can we complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nationâ€”

Thisâ€”"leading by example"â€”is indeed not just a current term, but carries the "exemplary role."

### Dream Beyond

â€” Yang Yanqi

Annoying weather, unable to stay in the house; idling, pacing in the garden. Discovering the grass is green, the flowers are red; these are "unexpected discoveries" for the souls of those who are busy all day, like discovering a clear stream in the Han River, nourishing a parched mood.

For the past few days, I have been living a mechanical life, rushing here and there at high speed: other than feeling warm, I hardly knew the change of seasons. It is a special feeling to accidentally gain this in the garden. For example, picking up a fresh and delicate rose on a barren road will surely bring to mind a beautiful story or a moving poem: these are the dreams of my "Dream Beyond," the so-called "Dream Beyond," is the story I made up from the traces of spring I accidentally found in the garden.

The passing of winter is like a piece of ice gradually melting in a warm hand. There may be a lot of black sand in the ice, but after melting into water, the black sand will also leak out in the water droplets. The spring wind is also the palm that blows away the black sand. I hope that the black sand of a season will leak away in the spring, allowing a pure white world to come alive.

Dreams are often the mother of facts, and often the net of this person. I remember once, when I was a child, I took a nap on the green grass and woke up at dusk. I caught a chill and got sick. Now, I'm sneaking a nap on the green grass again.

So, I got this dream beyond the sky, and in the meditative universe, I discovered another beautiful world. When I woke up, the setting sun was infinitely beautiful.

The dream is over, and the story I made up has also come to an end.

Isn't it? Dreams are often the mother of facts; but first you have to break free from this "charming net." Outside the net is living clear water, a free world.

Unconsciously, it made me sing the old tune again.

First movement

I sing lightly the sound of the future,

Rippling in the alcoholic air.

The skirt of the goddess of hope,

Fluttering over my shoulders.

Second movement

What color is hope,

What taste, what appearance?

You turn your head and go to heaven,

Leaving me in a daze.

Third movement

I will no longer look back with nostalgia,

The past is a wisp of smoke.

Flying lightly and slowly with the wind,

Floating to the distant sky.

Fourth movement

Sing, four light sounds,

The low-pitched melody!

Infinite emotions are gone:

A spiritual pearl in my heart.

Epilogue

People traveling far away, in their heartsâ€”

Tears cannot be exhausted, reflecting the shadow of golden spearsâ€”

Perhaps this "Ancient Melody" can be regarded as the dregs of life; I hope this is also a shallow trace brought from the sky, let the endless spring breeze blow it away!

### Hero

â€” Ai Da

A windless night,

Besides the twinkling stars,

The moon still shows a smiling face.

Don't make a sound,

This is a mountain village,

Not ordinary flat ground.

Swift footsteps,

Be light and quiet,

Grip our weapons tightly.

Forward!

Our heroes,

Everyone cheers,

Supporting to the end.

### Paradise for Jews

â€” Xia Luo

Before the first color film "Nocturne" (now renamed "Female Warrior") in the Soviet Union, we saw a rare newsreel: "Jewish Autonomous Region."

Speaking of Jews, we will not forget that they are regarded as inferior races by the Nazis and are being massacred by the Hitlers. This group of people without a country has become accustomed to being insulted and harmed. The destruction of their lives and property has also become "taken for granted," simply because they are Jews.

However, this group of people without a homeland, in a corner of the world, in the territory of the Soviet Union, they have an autonomous region. This autonomous region is our neighbor, just across the Heilongjiang border from us. There, they are allowed to speak their own language. There, they farm, work, and mine gold. They use their labor and intelligence to extract rewards from the earth. They no longer have to worry about being attacked anytime, anywhere, because this is their autonomous land.

What are our thoughts after watching such a newsreel? What are the thoughts of the Jewish refugees who are wandering in various democratic countries in the world and are being sheltered by good intentions? After watching this newsreel, the Jewish refugees in Shanghai expressed their longing in their own newspapers.

I am not a Jew, but when I see those people who are living diligently in the peaceful air (which is protected by the power of the Soviet Union), I can't help but yearn for it. From this, I also think of the reclamation areas in the southwest and northwest that we are currently cultivating and developing. There, our compatriots are also building our paradise with redoubled efforts. In "Four Hundred Million Compatriots" (a newsreel that faithfully records our country's war of resistance) filmed by famous news photographers Zoris and He Lun, are there any of these scenes?

Peaceful and safe people do not forget to build their peaceful fields even in the midst of bloody storms, although they will not forget to use force to defend their fields. The best way to prevent invaders from breaking in is for all peace-loving people in the world to join hands.

Extend our hands of friendship to the other side of the Heilongjiang River, our neighbors, to express our sincere friendship. You have experienced all kinds of oppression, and you understand the cruelty of the fascists the most. The only way to deal with them is to fight back with blows.

### Two Hair-Cutting Girls

â€” Lin Ling

â€”Tragedy in the Occupied Area, Part Two

After the dirty footprints of the X people were imprinted on the sleeping Huiyang, a group of devils with ulterior motives often came in and out of the villages here, diligently like bees collecting honey. What this group of devils collected was food and women.

The most unfortunate women are the young girls and young women with short hair. As soon as the X people arrived, the villagers would receive a difficult-to-handle list, with the most important item listed: "Pretty girls, XX number."

Therefore, when the X people were about to arrive but had not yet arrived, those girls with short hair would actively and passively try their best to escape, digging holes in the ground, falling into manure pits, as long as they could avoid being trampled on by the X people, they were willing to do anything.

Once, when several X soldiers approached a village, they saw two pretty girls with short hair from afar. They immediately quickened their pace and rushed forward, like several mad dogs racing. The two girls ran back to their own village and hurriedly hid. But disaster followed, and the X soldiers pointed their guns at several village fathers and brothers and ordered:

"Quick! Hand over those twoâ€”"

Which two? The old men were so frightened that they were at a loss and didn't know how to answer.

The X soldiers shook their bayonets, stroked their gun barrels, and pretended to fire, then issued another order:

"Quick! Call all the women in the village out for inspection, otherwise we'll kill them!"

Crying and sobbing, rows of old and young women were piled up in the open space in front of the village; the two girls with short hair were also forced to join the crowd. The X soldiers' wolf eyes were sharp, and they immediately recognized them, even though they were wearing black headscarves and covered in soot! Pretending to be old women.

"Haha, pretending to be old women! Hahahaâ€”" The X soldiers laughed wildly and dragged the two girls with short hair to the old fathers and brothers, glaring at them and saying sternly and violently:

"Hand them over to you to take good care of them. We'll come and get them in a while! Otherwiseâ€”" Otherwise, what? They didn't say, but pushed the gun barrels against the old men's chests.

After the X soldiers left, they came again two hours later. A kind of shameful human selfishness drove these old men to send out the two girls. They were wailing and were more pitiful than lambs being led to the slaughterhouse. At this time, blood was constantly pouring out of their mouths. While slamming their skulls against the wall, they stretched their windpipes and shouted wildly to the sky:

"Injustice, injustice!â€¦"

The hardness of the skull was no match for the wall. It broke again and again, and blood spurted like a fountain. Finally, the two of them fainted. The situation was extremely tragic, with their lifeless white eyes protruding and their bloody tongues sticking out between their closed teeth.

The X soldiers laughed a few times and left.

### Manchurian Snow

â€” Shu Qun

The snow outside the window has been falling all night, and it is still falling. Once the snow starts falling in Manchuria, no one can imagine the day it will stop. Even under the winter sun, it is inevitable that it will snow. The sun cannot melt the snow in Manchuria. The snow in Manchuria is certainly cold, but it is not afraid of the sun. The snow in Manchuria is rare in the world. It has a stubborn personality. It strengthens the spirit of struggle of countless rebels in Manchuria. The snow in Manchuria is the loyal and staunch protector of Manchuria.

The outside of the Xian'tai has already been covered with snow, and the accidental glass is covered by more than one-third; so that the inside is in the unknown. Also, some thin and scattered frost flowers are formed. The meaning of the chill felt by the people in the house is passed through those frost flowers.

So, she wanted to light the extinguished stove, but her hands, which had never been near the stove, were not skilled in the technique of lighting a fire; as a result of using many matches, there was only a cloud of thick smoke in the stove, which choked from the stove mouth to her eyes and throat. She couldn't help coughing. With tears streaming down her face, she flashed the stove door in disappointment.

She went to Yuwen, wanting him to do this work.

However, Yuwen was lying on the ground, asleep like the rest of the comrades. Moreover, his neck was swollen due to the knife wound, and there was a kind of corrupt blood flowing out of the bandage. His complexion was particularly pale and haggard, and he already showed the characteristics of a patient. Now, she looked at him and felt sad. The damage she had inflicted on him in a daze was the pain after she became sober. This pain was heavier than his wound. The weak could not bear repentance and self-blame. She tore her hair with one hand and touched his forehead with the other. She unintentionally touched him - he woke up, and before he opened his eyes, he first used his hands to protect his forehead; he said impatiently:

"Who is it? Don't touch my wound!" "Is your injury serious?" This ashamed tone made him immediately realize it was her voice, sat up, and expressed his concern and value for her. She held his head and sent it to a pillow made of shoes and clothes. But he finally got up with the other comrades, "You go to my room and sleep!"
