### The Path Our Nation's Wartime Industry Should Take

— Hu Xishan

Since the start of the war of resistance, now nineteen months, many industries have moved from the war zones to the interior, and new ones have been built in the southwest. This is a good sign in our nation's war of resistance. To strengthen the power of resistance, the most important thing is to increase the total national production. The instruments a government uses to perform its duties are not currency, but material goods and labor. In peacetime, the government can obtain a fixed amount of currency income from the annual national income to purchase the necessary materials and labor. Therefore, in peacetime, the source of national finance can be based on national income, profits, and consumption. But once a country enters a state of war, the amount of materials and labor it needs is several times that of peacetime, and the nature of its needs is even more urgent. Under such circumstances, the government absolutely cannot rely entirely on taxes to deal with these circumstances. It should do its best to use all domestic resources to increase the total national production, in order to obtain a large amount of materials to supply the general needs of wartime.

In our country's current situation, Japan is using both its economic and military power in an attempt to destroy all of our country's economic enterprises. In the war zones, it has seized our country's markets and all resources. At the same time, it uses military force to forcibly occupy all factories in the war zones. Taking the Jinghu area as an example, 70% of our country's newest and largest factories have been destroyed or occupied. All of our country's industrial production machinery, including those in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan and other places, has also been completely destroyed. Japan's only aim is to destroy China's entire production capacity, so that China's material needs for the war of resistance will depend entirely on foreign imports. At the same time, it is also working to destroy and prevent the import of foreign materials, so that China loses its ability to resist for a long time, and everything is under the control of the Japanese. In fact, this is a dreamy policy, but with major cities and economic arteries in China being destroyed and invaded by the Japanese, if our country does not quickly plan for new construction and strive to strengthen its productive capacity, then it will truly fall into the trap of the Japanese.

Therefore, strengthening production is indeed the urgent task of our country. Although our general production has been developing continuously in the rear since the start of the war, according to our country's current economic structure, these are not enough to fully adapt to the needs of the entire war of resistance. Therefore, we believe that the large-scale development of small-unit industries is truly necessary to promote under China's current circumstances. What is large-scale development of small-unit industries? To put it bluntly, it is the large-scale construction of small-capital unit-based production enterprises throughout the country during the war of resistance. The purpose of this policy is to spread the construction of a large number of production units throughout the country to lay the economic foundation for long-term resistance, and at the same time to compensate for all the economic losses suffered in the war zones.

In fact, the reasons for promoting this small-unit industrial production are by no means simply based on the desire to strengthen general production. To expand on this, it is to adapt to the needs of the entire war of resistance in our country. We can discuss this point in detail from the following aspects:

(1) The most valuable point of small-capital industries is that they are relatively convenient to establish. This can be analyzed from two aspects: In terms of capital, based on the general investment psychology of the people, in a state of war, private investors often consider investing in large-scale enterprises as a risk. This is a natural phenomenon, but it is actually more possible to contribute a portion of their funds to small-capital industries. At the same time, it can also guide a portion of the idle funds in society into appropriate production enterprises. Secondly, in terms of establishment, it is difficult to establish a large-scale enterprise even in peacetime, let alone in wartime. Problems such as the design of equipment and machines, the acquisition of raw materials, and the conscription of technical personnel will inevitably be doubled in difficulty, while small-capital industries take simplicity and ease as prerequisites, so it is easy to solve the above-mentioned problems, and local resources can be used as much as possible as the basis for production.

(2) To produce in large quantities to meet huge needs by concentrating large-scale industries in one place creates a target for enemy occupation and bombing, making the organization of such production lose its safety guarantee. And once necessary, it is not easy to move. For example, many factories in Jinghu, Wuhan and other places have suffered huge losses of more than hundreds of millions of yuan due to the difficulty of moving machinery and equipment. Therefore, in order to avoid such damage and maintain production strength, it is better to transform large into small and establish a large number of small-scale factories in various parts of the interior. This can not only maintain the entire productive capacity, but also lay a solid foundation for future development. All financial and industrial organizations in our country have always been concentrated in a small number of cities. Although the interior is rich in resources, the population is sparse and desolate. This imbalance is a major crisis lurking in our country's economy for many years. Today, we can use small-unit industrial organizations to establish a base in these areas that need to be developed. In the future, we can use this base as a basis for development and expansion. At the same time, we can also unite several units and establish a strong industrial center according to their regional distribution. This can not only comprehensively plan everything, but also open up a solid and practical path for future production and construction.

(3) The promotion of small-unit industries can directly support the military because it can supply the needs of the front lines of the war of resistance. The establishment of large-scale industries requires the use of heavy machinery, the employment of a large number of workers, and the construction of large factory buildings to accommodate them before production can be carried out. Therefore, they must be built in safe areas in the rear. In terms of production capacity, such industries can certainly constitute the industrial organizations planned by the government and complete the production of important supplies for various departments. However, they are not as easy and portable as small-scale industries, and can be established in various areas near the front lines. The supply of various materials needed on the front lines of the battlefield is huge, and most of them are urgently needed. However, in fact, it is often difficult to quickly supply the needs from the rear due to transportation inconveniences and other reasons. In this situation, it is necessary to establish direct supply units in the nearby areas of the front lines to facilitate military support. Large-scale industries have difficulty meeting these conditions, and only small-scale industries can adapt to them.

(4) The large-scale promotion of small-capital industries can solve our country's current refugee problem. Since the outbreak of the war in our country, the number of refugees has increased day by day due to the expansion of the war zones. Therefore, the sustenance of refugees has become a serious problem in our country. It is estimated that at least 50 to 60 million refugees across the country are trapped in difficult situations, and their lives completely depend on the maintenance of the government or other social organizations. The existence of such a fact is directly harmful to the government and society. A large number of refugees not only lose their productive capacity, but also waste huge amounts of consumption. Moreover, there is still the possibility of a continuous increase in the number of refugees in the future. If this continues, it will be detrimental to our country's long-term war of resistance plan. With the promotion of a large number of small-unit industries, these wasted labor forces will have the possibility of production. At the same time, the millions of yuan needed for refugee relief every month can also be used for production purposes.

(5) The small-unit industrial system can serve as the center for the development of rural economic organizations. Due to the migration of a large number of people to various rural areas in the interior, various desolate areas have suddenly become densely populated, and the demand for materials has increased sharply. However, where can such a huge amount of materials be supplied in self-sufficient rural areas? Under this situation, the opportunistic import of foreign goods and inferior goods is naturally inevitable, while the distribution of small-capital industries in various places can produce locally and meet local needs, prospering desolate areas, developing markets, revitalizing the rural economy, and at the same time serving as an effective warning line to prevent the import of foreign and inferior goods.

Based on the above points, it can be clearly seen that promoting small-unit industries has great benefits for our country's war of resistance plan, and with the economic functions of various important cities being destroyed by the enemy today, our country feels an even more urgent need for this.

How should this plan be promoted? This is also something we should discuss. To establish a large number of small-unit industries is a great plan that cannot be realized overnight. Therefore, we hope to implement it step by step in sequence. In order to facilitate promotion, a basic organization should first be established as the center for promotion. The first step for this central organization should be to conduct a general survey. This general survey includes two tasks: one is to estimate or investigate the nature and extent of the current material needs. If the needs are not clear, how can we supply them? Therefore, this is a basic goal to determine what should be produced. Based on this goal, we can also determine the types of production that should be carried out, and adjust them according to their importance and urgency. The second is to investigate the distribution of resources in each region according to the regional distribution, and divide the establishment of each unit. With these two specific goals, we have laid the foundation for construction. At the same time, the government should use incentive methods to promote the will of people across the country to expand investment in small-unit industries, and use various positive methods to provide convenience, assistance, and guarantees for their establishment, so that this source of legitimate investment can be smoothly promoted.

With specific goals and a clear implementation plan, there should also be a complete organization in the management of implementation as the central hub for control and guidance, so that each small unit can obtain reasonable and good results under a unified action. I will now briefly express my opinions on the points that should be included in control and guidance:

Control is to fundamentally manage the types and scope of unit activities with the power and methods of a group. If small-unit industries are distributed in various places without control, it will inevitably lead to a scattered and ununified phenomenon. There are two principles for controlling small-unit industries: (1) Production control and (2) Raw material control. Production control is to ensure that the production of each unit can be matched with the degree of supply and demand, so as to prevent unnecessary waste and unbalanced production. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the standardization of unit production. This not only refers to the standardization of each unit, but also to promote the standardization of the entire unit's production. The benefits of standardization can be: (1) Accurate production, (2) Obtaining a large output with a small number of types, so as to adapt to the needs of wartime, (3) The affairs of products can be simplified, and the completion of products can be rapid and excellent, and (4) Due to the standards of production, the waste of raw materials and manufacturing costs can be reduced.

Regarding the control of raw materials, its importance should be greater than production. During wartime, military needs come first, so the first principle of raw material control must be to ensure that the raw materials for the manufacture of military supplies have priority in use. For example, if two factories, A and B, use the same raw material, but factory B is an ordinary factory, while factory A is used to supply military needs. Under these two conditions, factory A should be given priority to use the raw material. If the raw materials for military industries are not controlled during wartime, and important production is given priority in use, it will greatly hinder military affairs. Take the United States during World War I as an example: After the start of the war, the United States designated 60,000 items of military supplies and military raw materials in the eastern industrial areas. Among these huge amounts of items, their military value varied greatly, and their urgency varied. However, due to the lack of control, often those with smaller military value or less urgent needs were produced first, while the urgently needed military supplies could not be manufactured due to the lack of raw materials. As a result, the wartime production in the United States at that time fell into an extremely chaotic state. Therefore, in special periods, our country must not ignore the control of raw materials, otherwise the impact will not be small on military affairs.

Secondly, guidance and improvement are also very important. Guidance is a rational inspiration, and improvement is the starting point for progress. In this wartime state, in order to increase the total national production, the government has the necessity to control production and raw materials, and should also provide guidance and improvement for everything inside production. This can be divided into operation, organization, labor, machinery, and equipment. Regarding operations: (1) Guidance on reasonable operating methods and improvement of production technology; (2) Whether the division of labor and cooperation system of operations is appropriate; (3) Reasonable allocation instructions for work time and rest time should be given; (4) The connection between human and engineering efficiency. Regarding organization: (1) Guidance on the organizational system; (2) The division of labor between industrial and administrative affairs. Regarding labor: (1) Improving the living conditions of workers; (2) Guiding the actions of workers, making the actions of workers simple, reducing fatigue, and seeking to strengthen work efficiency; (3) Discovering the shortcomings of workers' manufacturing and providing methods for improvement and guidance. To sum up, in extraordinary times, strengthening the production mechanism is the urgent task of our country. The large-scale development of small-unit industrial production is as important as large enterprises, and its advantages are better than large enterprises, and it is in line with the wartime environment. Therefore, promoting small-unit industrial production is the path that our country's wartime industrial construction should take today.

[Editor's Note] Promoting small-unit production and construction is indeed a good plan, but there are two points that seem to have been overlooked by the author: (1) Obtaining small and exquisite machines. Small-unit production and construction are designed to prevent large industries from being controlled by the enemy or failing to adapt to the production conditions in the interior. Therefore, its nature is between handicraft industry and machine industry. However, how to manufacture and obtain such machinery is also a prerequisite for small-unit production and construction. (2) Most of the areas occupied by the enemy are cities. Therefore, the industries in the cities are often occupied and controlled by them. If we want to avoid being used by them, we can only move to the countryside. However, building small industrial units in the countryside and protecting and nurturing them depends on the guerrilla army. If the guerrilla army cannot assume this responsibility, the result will still be occupation and control by the enemy. This is also worth considering deeply. Therefore, the responsibility of the guerrilla army is not only to destroy the enemy's work, but also to protect the people's property in the guerrilla area and promote its construction, so as to lay the foundation for the recovery of national industry in the future.

### The New World War (Part 1)

— Chen Youren

Mr. Chen Youren's article discusses the next world war in detail and has unique insights, saying what others have not said. This article was submitted by Mr. Chen to this newspaper and the Chunghwa Times for simultaneous publication. Editor

When British Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London from the "battlefield" of the Munich Conference, he declared to the world with pride that his efforts in Munich had laid the foundation for peace in this generation. A few days later, people in Hong Kong personally heard him request his countrymen to work hard to make Britain fully prepared for war. Since Mr. Zhang made such a request, then the future war, perhaps the "next World War" - is it about to come?

Regarding this question, please discuss it in detail below

(1) A Brewing Revolutionary Movement

When I was about to leave Europe and return to China last year, I tried to find a simple principle to summarize the relationship between the lives of people in the four directions that I had personally witnessed and thought about, and the dynamics of the people in the Far East. I believe that there is a significant "archetype" that is controlling all the changes in the current world, and is dominating the material, spiritual, and social struggles of various nations. I believe that all of this is a manifestation of a revolutionary movement that is brewing. The movement, on the one hand, is a movement of people who are generally dissatisfied with life and demand economic security; on the other hand, it is a movement of other people who demand "social justice" for the poor.

Now this brewing revolutionary movement is like the French Revolution of that year. The French Revolution was encouraged by the revolution that denied the right of emperors to implement harsh government by order of Heaven, so it mobilized the power of the people to change the political organization of European and Western societies, and enabled individuals to enjoy political freedom; now the movement may be influenced by the revolution in Soviet Russia that denies the "sanctity of private property," and its mission will be to cause huge institutional changes in societies in Europe and beyond, and enable individuals to obtain security in economic life.

(2) Wars Launched by Dictatorial Leaders

However, in this huge change that demands economic security, a new struggle is now being discovered. This war is launched from the needs and desires of certain nations, which on the one hand are incited by a consistent ideology that is suitable for war but not for peace, and on the other hand are driven by the ambitions of their leaders to expand their territory. Because the needs and desires of these people are the inevitable result of the existing capitalist system of international society, those so-called "satiated countries" should cooperate with "unsatisfied countries" to re-allocate the world's resources fairly and reasonably. If the economic security of individuals in every nation state needs to be guaranteed, then the economic security of the nation itself clearly needs to be guaranteed even more.

(3) International Cooperation and Economic Self-Sufficiency

Regarding this redistribution of the world economy, not only are the conditions for its implementation now largely in place, but also the central organization for implementing this distribution can be replaced by the League of Nations. But most unfortunately, the major mistakes in the political strategies of Britain and the United States in recent years have enabled those dictatorial leaders who harbor power and territorial appetites and possess the will and tools of war to be in a strategically proactive position in today's international situation. Therefore, it is natural for the leaders of Germany and Italy to reject the proposals for economic cooperation, and to implement their economic mobilization for war under the guise of economic self-sufficiency.

### Artillery Battle at Tongguan Fenglingdu, American Reporter Visually Inspects Shanxi War Situation From the Air, Our Troops Achieve Victory in Longgang, Northern Jiangxi

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] The military focus is still in the Northwest. For a week, the artillery fire at Tongguan and Fenglingdu has not ceased. The enemy attempts to disturb Tongguan, and we retaliate with heavy artillery fire, killing many enemies. It is heard that the enemy commander at the bottom of the town has been driven away. Our troops in Hejin are also engaged in artillery battles across the river.

[United Press Chongqing, 4th] According to reliable military sources, the Japanese troops in various places in northern Jiangsu are busy preparing to attack the Chinese guerrillas. According to reports obtained here, the Japanese army is attacking in the southeast of Shanxi with four divisions, and as a result, they occupied Liaozhou, 70 miles southeast of Taiyuan. The Japanese army's offensive towards the southwest of Shanxi Province failed a month ago. The second offensive has not yet been implemented. On the same day, Shen Fu replied that six divisions of troops in Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar are adopting encirclement strategies in an attempt to "eliminate" the Chinese guerrillas in one fell swoop. According to military personnel, even if the Japanese army pours all its strength into attacking the Chinese guerrillas, they can still break up into smaller units and handle the situation properly without being captured. In addition, the Japanese army fired artillery at Tongguan intermittently for two consecutive nights, but there was no change in the situation. Yesterday, Japanese warships and Chinese troops also had artillery battles in Beihai.

[United Press Beiping, 4th] Hua Lian visited Mr. Chang Feixu, and today took a giant Japanese plane from Ping to inspect the situation in Shanxi Province. He crossed the Yellow River to the southwest to Taiyuan, and then returned to Beiping. In Shanxi Province, Mr. Fei saw vast mountains with people living in them. The food, coal, and cotton and all the necessities were unusually sufficient, and the terrain was rugged and dangerous. The Japanese army obviously had no way to attack them. However, the Japanese commander in Taiyuan ignored these difficulties and said that the guerrillas in Shanxi Province would be resolved soon. His deputy said, "At present, we must station heavy troops in all large and small strongholds. After that, we only need to station heavy troops at key points of transportation." This statement is enough to prove that the Japanese army's repeated attempts to cross the Yellow River have been restrained by the guerrillas and have not been successful. The Japanese army's optimistic attitude is not agreed by the personnel of the puppet "provincial government" supported by the Japanese. Taking the situation in Taiyuan as an example, the Japanese army has been working hard to "eliminate" the guerrillas for 18 days, but their power has not been able to reach beyond 20 miles.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] Our army in northern Jiangxi achieved a great victory near Longgang on the 2nd, killing Japanese Colonel Kiroku and more than 300 Japanese soldiers, and destroying 30 Japanese vehicles. Between Chongyang and Tongcheng, there is a brigade of the Japanese 13th Division. A certain unit of our army attacked near Huanglaomen on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 80 artillery pieces. Japanese soldiers in Xingzi and Dean have increased, and they have been conscripted to repair the highway.

[Special Dispatch from Sihui on the 3rd by this Newspaper] There is no change in the war in Guangdong. Our newly援 troops are advancing in two directions and have arrived at their destinations. More than 3,000 Japanese troops arrived in the streets, and Koukou, and Xinkou, and Pingdi. Another 2,000 troops were sent to Kaihua County and stationed in the Caomeng Village and Longkou areas. In Shenzhen, Taipingchang has a large puppet first brigade, two artillery companies, and 300 cavalrymen. Sanshui has a total of 1,600 Japanese troops, 800 cavalrymen, 30 artillery pieces, and a total of 40 rubber boats and small electric boats, which travel back and forth in the Sanshui area. Heqing and Jiujiang have increased by more than 2,000 Japanese troops. More than 1,000 Japanese troops plan to invade from Fangcheng and Dongxing, and we are currently blocking them.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th by this Newspaper] According to reports, the Japanese troops in Hankou are now parts of the Sixth, Thirteenth, and Sixteenth Divisions, and the Watanabe Brigade of the Marine Corps is in the area. The Japanese 12th Division has also been dispatched from Beijing to Wuhan. More than ten Japanese small warships have arrived in Yueyang, northern Hunan, and Japanese troops have landed. The two railway bridges of Taolin and Pingshui Xiu have been bombed and destroyed by us. It is difficult for the Japanese to repair them for a while, and the Yuehan railway is not open to traffic. There is one Japanese small cruiser and more than 300 motorboats in Diaoyang Lake. Japanese fortifications are heavily fortified along the Yuehan Railway. The Japanese in Mingguang are manufacturing a large number of puppets.

[Central News Agency Hequ, 2nd] A brigade of puppet troops, about 800 people, west of Sa County, Suiyuan, set off for Guyang on the morning of the 30th. The Heijiaotang area north of Guyang has been recovered by our army.

### Our Financial Economy is Increasingly Consolidated, Customs Surplus Guarantees Interest Payments on Public Bonds

[Central News Agency Hong Kong News] Since the War of Resistance, our country's authorities have made the greatest efforts to adjust finance and maintain credit, so the economic situation is becoming increasingly consolidated. Recently, the National Currency Fund Management Committee, in view of the fact that the payment of interest on the unified public bonds guaranteed by the customs surplus has been delayed, with a total amount of 5,128,300 yuan, although the enemy has drastically reduced our coastal tax revenue, it has decided to pay as scheduled. The Central Bank has been notified to find a way to advance the funds. The date when interest payments will begin in Hong Kong is of great concern to people here. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zheng Tieru, the manager of the Bank of China yesterday, who said that payments have already been made in various parts of the country, but the payment method in Hong Kong is divided into six installments, that is, one installment per month. This method is due to environmental reasons and to prevent opportunistic purchases of foreign exchange. In order to implement this method, the Ministry of Finance has specially printed booklets for processing. After the batch of booklets is shipped from Chongqing within a few days, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will begin to pay them immediately.

[Hong Kong News] A certain financial magnate in Guangzhou said that the loss of his industry due to the fall of Guangzhou is no less than that of the foreign goods weaving industry. The total loss of the industry is estimated to be more than one million yuan. Due to the sudden change, many people did not have time to bring their funds with them. Moreover, each bank often stores tens of thousands of yuan of small coins and copper cents to meet the needs of the market due to the daily business operations of each bank. During this escape, these small coins and copper cents could not be carried away. The sheer number of them is self-evident.

### Merchants Reduce Foreign Exchange Settlement; Trade Commission Revises Measures

[Special Chongqing Airmail] The Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, in order to facilitate the sale and settlement of foreign exchange by export merchants, has formulated measures for merchants to reduce the settlement of foreign exchange at [blank] ports. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. The full text is as follows:

(1) If, when exporting goods, an exporter sells and settles foreign exchange to a bank, and the foreign currency proceeds from the sale of the goods, after a 10% discount, are insufficient to meet the amount of the purchased foreign exchange stated in the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" (i.e., 90% of the total [blank]), and the exporter requests a reduction in the settlement of a portion of the foreign exchange, the reduction procedures shall be in accordance with these measures.

(2) If, after the export of goods for which foreign exchange has already been sold and settled, the following circumstances arise upon arrival in [blank] Hong Kong, the exporter may, before finding a buyer and before a formal transaction, request the Hong Kong office of this Commission to handle the procedures for reducing foreign exchange settlement:

(A) The market price in Hong Kong at the time of sale is indeed lower than the estimated price standard used at the time of foreign exchange settlement.

(B) The quantity of goods at the time of sale is indeed less than at the time of foreign exchange settlement due to [blank] consumption or accidental loss.

(C) The quality of the goods at the time of sale is indeed inferior to that at the time of foreign exchange settlement due to changes.

(3) The Hong Kong office of this Commission shall handle the following procedures with respect to the provisions of Article 2:

(A) For the circumstances described in item 1 of that article, it shall first verify the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate." If it is indeed accurate, it shall immediately introduce the exporter to Fu Hua Company to purchase the goods in full at the price quoted by the merchant. However, if Fu Hua Company is unwilling to purchase the goods after the introduction, the merchant shall sell them to the buyer he has pre-arranged.

(B) For the circumstances described in item 2 of that article, it shall [blank] the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and all relevant documents (all of which should have copies), and, if necessary, send personnel to inspect the goods.

(C) For the circumstances described in item 3 of that article, it shall examine the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" and all relevant documents (all of which should have copies), and verify the pre-determined [blank] price reported for the deteriorated goods. If necessary, it shall also send personnel to inspect the goods in detail.

(D) If Fu Hua Company is willing to purchase the pre-determined selling price reported by the merchant for the goods being sold, it shall be introduced to Fu Hua Company for purchase.

(4) After the Hong Kong office of this Commission has completed the handling of the above procedures, the merchant may sell the goods and obtain transaction documents (all of which should have duplicates) and submit them to the office for verification and issuance of a "Certificate for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement."

(5) After receiving the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall immediately fill out and issue a "Certificate for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement" after a thorough review and confirmation.

However, without going through the third step of the procedures, no matter what the circumstances, this explanation will absolutely not be issued.

(6) After issuing the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall extract copies of various documents [blank] [blank] held, and the originals shall be stamped with "Approved for Reduced Foreign Exchange Settlement" [blank] and returned to the merchant at any time. However, if there are no duplicate documents, and the originals cannot be extracted [blank], [blank] the office shall make an abstract copy.

(7) After receiving the above certificate, the merchant shall go to the bank to sell and deliver the foreign exchange obtained within two days [blank] of the date of issuance.

If the above deadline falls on a bank holiday, it will be postponed accordingly.

(8) After purchasing the foreign exchange, the bank shall indicate the certificate number on the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Advice" based on the above certificate for reduced foreign exchange settlement, so that this Commission can verify it.

(9) After filling out the above certificate, the Hong Kong office of this Commission shall immediately fill out a "Report on the Issuance of Certificates for Merchants Reducing Export Foreign Exchange Settlement" in detail, and send it along with a copy each of the certificate and various documents to this Commission for record.

(10) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation [blank].

### ### Booming Export of Southwest Minerals

[Shanghai Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, 4th] According to Hua Fang sources, last year China's mineral exports were valued at $10,650,000, $4,000,000 more than the previous year, and $50,000,000 more than 1936. Furthermore, many mineral companies in the southwestern provinces exported more in the second half of last year, and it is expected that the export volume will be even greater this year. [Blank] The occupation of [blank] near Hankou will not affect this, it is said.

### ### National Government Relief: Those Evacuated from Government Service to be Reinstated; Those in Occupied Areas to Return Home

[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th] The Central Government is promoting an examination system and guaranteeing the employment of those who pass the examinations. Recently, the Central Government Civil Service Higher Examination Comrades Association submitted a request that the National Government issue an order to all ministries, commissions, and [blank] provincial and municipal governments that civil service comrades who have been evacuated should be reinstated, and those in occupied areas [blank] should return to their hometowns to serve, in order to repay the Party. Those whose offices are no longer present in occupied areas should [blank] the relief measures of the Standing Committee [blank].

### ### Chongqing Sources Speculate that Britain and the United States Will Continue to Lend Large Sums; Rumor that Contract with American Company Will Soon Be Signed; Sino-British Loan Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly

[Chongqing Dispatch from Associated Press, 4th] According to reliable sources, an American company will sign a loan of $15,000,000 to China within [blank] weeks for the purpose of purchasing American goods. At the same time, reports indicate that Sino-British loan negotiations are also proceeding smoothly.

### ### American Residents in Kuling Not Evacuating for Now; Have Petitioned Washington

[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai Dispatch: Regarding the evacuation of American residents from Kuling, the American Consulate in Shanghai is now awaiting instructions from Washington in order to make a decision.

### ### Foreign Nationals in Hankou Subjected to ×

Forced to Salute × Soldiers [Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, [blank]th] Hankou Dispatch: The Japanese [blank] authorities recently issued a notice stating that henceforth, foreign nationals passing by places with Japanese sentries should present their identity cards [blank]. If foreign nationals violate this regulation and an accident occurs as a result, the Japanese side will not be responsible. After the issuance of this notice, people here felt extremely uneasy. The consular corps held a special meeting yesterday afternoon [blank], whereby each consul individually notified the Japanese military authorities, explaining that this action could cause misunderstandings [blank] and accidents, and it would be difficult for foreign nationals to be fully responsible. Reporters here inquired with the Japanese spokesperson about this yesterday, and the spokesperson stated that this was a method of maintaining order, and that the order had been implemented since the Japanese military occupied Hankou. When reporters asked whether the so-called salute to Japanese sentries meant removing one's hat or bowing, the spokesperson said that saluting Japanese sentries [blank] countries had such actions.

### ### Foreign Military Experts Observe Possible War Between Soviet Union and Japan; Friction Between the Two Countries Increasing; Great Impact on Sino-Japanese War

[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th] Shanghai Dispatch: At present, friction between Japan and the Soviet Union is increasing daily, and observers here are paying close attention to it, believing that it will have a great impact on the Sino-Japanese War [blank]. In particular, there are rumors that Japan is extremely short of manpower for its war against China [blank]. Therefore, once Japan is forced to shift its domestic manpower to Manchuria, and is unable to increase its strength in China, the Japanese army may be forced to withdraw from some vast areas within China.

Increasing Disputes Between Soviet Union and Japan

Incidents that are intensifying tension between Japan and the Soviet Union are [blank] increasing [blank]. Currently [blank], there are the following articles: (1) Fishing rights issue; (2) Resurgence of border conflicts between the Soviet Union and Manchuria; (3) Continued detention of Japanese ships [blank] within Soviet territorial waters; (4) Soviet authorities protested to Japan that the Japanese government treated Soviet diplomats with a lack of courtesy; (5) Border incidents and mining rights disputes in Sakhalin [blank]; (6) Increasingly active Soviet aid to China; (7) Some members of the Japanese Diet publicly called for [blank], if preparations between Japan and [blank] and other issues were not resolved promptly [blank], Japan should implement [blank] war against the Soviet Union.

International Situation Unfavorable to Japan

In addition, the development of the international situation in the past two weeks may also have a significant impact on Japanese-Soviet relations, such as (1) rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may [blank] normalize diplomatic relations; (2) Hitler and Chamberlain successively delivered speeches, and the tense situation in Europe is clearly easing. According to some interpretations, the speeches of the two men [blank] called for a four-power conference. The results of the four-power conference could change the European situation and implement adjustments. If so, the anti-communist [blank] and the advantageous position of Japan's current [blank] [blank] will inevitably be weakened; (3) The US government's plan to establish defenses on Guam and other bases in the Pacific has aroused Japan's attention. [Blank] In Southeast Asia, Japan's international situation may be even more [blank] unfavorable in the future. Military officials are reckless and disregard the national interest.

Military Officials are Reckless and Disregard the National Interest

However, the national [blank] of Japan, the military officials who talk about nothing but war, [blank] advocate an early [blank] to fight the Soviet Union [blank]. This [blank] [blank] is particularly encouraged by the military, and the reasons they hold are as follows: (1) Japan should occupy Vladivostok [blank] to eliminate the threat of the Soviet air force to Japan; (2) At present, the front line is silent within China [blank], resulting in a significant lack of resources that the Japanese side has plundered within China [blank] that can be used; (3) Once Japan and the Soviet Union [blank] [blank], all the clauses in the National Mobilization Law that have not yet been implemented can be fully implemented. In this way, the de facto military and fascist dictatorship can be established in Japan. According to recent observations of the situation, if this action is taken against China [blank] [blank], [blank] it is unlikely to appear [blank]. Recently, foreigners coming from Japan are increasingly convinced that the Soviet-Japanese war [blank] can break out within six months. It is reported that the Kwantung Army (among which there are some arrogant young military officers) is still eager to resume military [blank] against the Soviet Union. After the Zhanggufeng incident last year, fortunately Tokyo quickly dispatched [blank] military personnel who maintained a peaceful attitude [blank] to the scene of the incident, replacing the representative sent by Kwantung [blank], and [blank] the Soviet side negotiated a ceasefire, which [blank] smoothly promoted, and the sudden end of the world that was momentarily agitated was ended. According to observations by foreign military experts [blank], the current situation on the Soviet-Japanese border is extremely likely to erupt into war.

Bai Chongxi arrived at a certain place yesterday to inspect military education. He will return to Guizhou within days.

Promoting Education to Save the Nation; Saving the Nation to Protect Education: Bai's Speech at the Muslim Welcome Meeting in Chongqing

[Chongqing Correspondence] In this great war of resistance, a unified iron army of the entire nation has emerged. Any divisions on economic, ideological, or religious lines have been completely [blank] broken. What deserves attention is the Muslim community with more than 40 million believers, and because they have a strong and wise leadership, they have emerged even more prominently. Recently, under the slogan of "Promoting education to save the nation, saving the nation to protect education," they have organized themselves, and this is the emergence of the "China Muslim National Salvation Association." On January 29, the association held a grand gathering at the Qingzhen Mosque in Chongqing to welcome Chairman Bai [blank]sheng.

Amid enthusiastic applause from the audience, Mr. Bai [blank] entered the meeting [blank] with everyone in standing salute.

Mr. Bai [blank] in a yellow woolen military uniform [blank], white gloves, and with piercing eyes, inspired awe and respect. He took off his hat to salute everyone, revealing his bright head. Mr. Bai bears a heavy responsibility, handles myriad affairs every day, and has done so for decades. Here we can see how he has been laboring and thinking hard for the country and the nation.

His speech was divided into two parts. The first part was a report on the progress of the war of resistance over the past year and a half. He used precise facts, simple reasons, and sincere words, encouraging the members of the Muslim community as if talking about family matters, urging them to [blank] understand the facts, to cherish themselves, to save themselves, and to save the country. The second part was a description of the situation of religion itself. Here, even more diligently, tirelessly, and repeatedly, he put forward the reasons for intensifying the organization and training of the Muslim community. He had extremely important instructions [blank] enlightenment.

In the first paragraph [blank], he cited facts to prove the failures of the Japanese in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic spheres, and our victory. He said in extremely confident [blank] sentences: "Now I want to honestly tell everyone, I never tell lies, and I would never dare to deceive you. In the year and a half of the war of resistance, we have become stronger with each battle. Our great Chinese nation has not been damaged in the slightest, and is even greater than before. First, in terms of spirit, we have not yielded in the slightest. The soldiers at the front have never surrendered, and the people in the rear, even when displaced, have not complained. This spirit of 'dying [blank] rather than yielding, and not complaining about hardship' cannot be destroyed by the × people. Second, in terms of political power, although many cities have fallen, our political power still exists. For example, Chairman Han of Jiangsu, Chairman Shen of Shandong, Chairman Yan of Shanxi, Chairman Liao of Anhui, Chairman Huang of Zhejiang, ... they exercise their powers without any hindrance. Thus, the Japanese attempt to eliminate us and truly occupy our land is also impossible to [blank] do. The fourth is strength, from the July 7th Incident to the present. Our army has increased by two-thirds. The number of people is more, not less, than before, and the quality [blank] is also better than before. Therefore, the Japanese dream of eliminating our main force is also completely impossible. Therefore, everyone should [blank] [blank] be aware that if we support a protracted war, we will surely achieve final victory in less than three years."

Mr. Bai had been speaking for an hour in this paragraph. The sky was slowly darkening, and then Mr. Bai turned to the second question, "The question of religion itself," speaking even more sincerely, more concretely, and more forcefully. He truly deserves to be an enlightened leader [blank] leader of the Muslim community, just like a parent to his children. He said: "The organization of the China Muslim National Salvation Association is not for finding personal outlets, for seeking personal gain and corruption, or for getting promoted and making a fortune. To save the country is to protect the religion, and all members of the Muslim community must understand this reason and unite to invigorate themselves, and have the common belief to generate strength to save the country, rather than just hanging up a signboard or establishing an organization. The work of this association is 'organization' and 'training.' Religious organization is the most natural and the strongest. As long as it is reorganized and applied with scientific methods, it can become a powerful group for resisting Japan and saving the country." Why organize? Mr. Bai cited an example with [blank] [blank] four seats. He said, "For example, if we are holding a meeting here now, and bandits suddenly attack, everyone will be at a loss, and may even trample on each other to escape. But [blank] if it is a row of soldiers, it is different. Even if there are three or four hundred bandits, they can be repelled, because a row of soldiers has a company commander who can direct the resistance. We want to organize for this reason." "Training is also extremely important. Without training, we will not understand the methods of resisting the war, or the ways to save the country. Therefore, to resist the war and build the country, we must start with organization and training." At this time, the audience went from holding their breath to applauding enthusiastically, as if the path to brightness was opening up before their eyes.

Another very important point is that he taught clearly the relationship between the "front" and the "rear." It is a path to life to go forward, and a path to death to go backward. The backward retreat of the Song and Ming dynasties ultimately led to the destruction of the country. The × people can directly [blank] attack our rear, but we will not let them in. If we resist them fiercely, they will not force us quietly. We should not be afraid of approaching the × people. The more afraid we are, the more [blank] our will will be. Recently, according to Chairman Han of Jiangsu [blank], he has not seen × people's planes for several months at the front, which shows that it is safer than Chongqing. Safe places are everywhere. Whether in the front or the rear, as long as everyone's mind is at peace, they will surely feel at ease, and this is a safe place. Now in the rear of the × people, we still have hundreds of thousands of troops, and they are all the best troops, so I honestly tell everyone that the front is safer than the rear."

He also cared about the cultural and economic lives of tens of thousands of members of the Muslim community. He hoped that they could be gradually improved. He hoped that new talents could be produced from within the Muslim community, who could take on greater responsibilities. He said that "cultivating cadres" and "training young people" are extremely important.

Finally, Mr. Bai also reported on the work of the Muslim community in participating in the war of resistance, for establishing a national salvation organization, going to the Northwest to awaken eight million [blank] believers. The departure of the Near East visiting group, the establishment of the Northwest Public School and the founding of Chengda Normal School, the teachers trained by these schools can serve as principals on the one hand, and can also serve as teachers on the other hand, so as to achieve the unity of religion and education and strengthen the strength of religion. Mr. Bai's earnestness towards young people and his sincere love for the members of the Muslim community touched everyone. Mr. Bai also hoped that the members of the Muslim community who attended the meeting today would pass on what he said today to those who did not attend, or write letters to tell them, so as to make the young people truly generate faith and power.

Mr. Bai finished his speech at 6:10, and then Guang Ke San delivered a reply, urging everyone to promote education and [blank] the country under the leadership of the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek.

### ### Dutch Ship Ada Suddenly Disappears; Reported to Have Been Seized by ×

[Shanghai Dispatch from Reuters, [Blank] [Blank]th] Another incident of Japanese military detention of a foreign ship has occurred here. The Dutch ship Ada reportedly went to Wenzhou on the 22nd of last month and then disappeared. Mr. Ke Mo, the owner of the ship, told a Reuters reporter that after the ship sailed to Wenzhou at 8 a.m. on the 22nd with kerosene [blank] iron cargo, he suddenly received a report from his Chinese manager in Wenzhou that the ship was suddenly detained by a Japanese cruiser when it entered the port of [blank]zhou, forced to fly a Japanese flag, and towed to a destination unknown. At the same time, a report from Wenzhou stated that two foreign ships [blank] confirmed the detention of the Ada. One of the two ships had also been inspected by the Japanese military, but was not detained. Afterwards, a report from a Wenzhou civilian ship crew stated that the Ada had also been seen being towed by a Japanese [blank] a few days later. [Blank] The Consulate General is currently investigating and has protested to the Japanese Consul, but it is difficult to find out where the Ada is currently.

### ### Details of the Detention of British Ship in Qingdao; Foreign Merchants Extremely Indignant

[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd Shanghai Dispatch: The Yongzhen and Haisha, two British and Norwegian merchant ships forcibly detained by the Japanese side, have been released and returned [blank] one after the other. [Blank] Haida is also on the way to Shanghai. Foreign merchants are deeply indignant at this kind of atrocity by the Japanese military [blank] and have petitioned the government to lodge a strong protest. Furthermore, according to the Yongzhen passenger who reported the detention situation, when the ship was unloading cargo in the port of Hexingzhen on the morning of January 24, three Japanese [blank] planes suddenly flew over the area to reconnoiter. The ship set sail on the morning of the 26th, and when it arrived at sea, six Japanese [blank] blocked the road and ordered it to stop, and sent marines to board the ship to inspect [blank], but found nothing. At noon on the 27th, they forced it to sail to Qingdao. Later, it was searched by the Japanese puppet army, and the silver coins held by the passengers were confiscated. The shipowner asked the British Consulate to negotiate, but the Japanese puppet and the customs authorities shirked responsibility to each other, and there was no result. The British Consul immediately telegraphed the British warship stationed in Wei to sail to protect it. It set sail and left Qingdao on the morning of the 29th. At that time, the Japanese warship was still trying to stop it and sent planes to threaten it, but fortunately the British warship followed and no incidents occurred, and the passengers were also safe.

### ### Japanese Planes Bomb Guiyang and Wanxian

[Chongqing Dispatch from Associated Press, 4th] Wanxian and Guiyang were bombed by large formations of Japanese planes at noon today, the most intense since the outbreak of the war. Hundreds [blank] of incendiary bombs were dropped on both sides, with the apparent aim of burning down commercial districts. Wanxian lacked rescue [blank] equipment [blank], and it is difficult to accurately estimate the extent of the fire and the casualties [blank]. Guiyang suffered lighter damage with more than 400 casualties. At the same time, Chinese planes fought with Japanese planes in Wanxian and Chongqing [blank] and shot them down.

### ### Representatives from Various Airlines Go to Chongqing to Negotiate Air Service

[Chongqing Dispatch from Associated Press, 4th] According to an aviation [blank] told the Associated Press reporter here that representatives of British and French airlines will arrive in Chongqing tomorrow to discuss with the Chinese side the establishment of air routes between China and Burma, and Annam. It is said that according to the contract signed between the Chinese government and British Airways half a month ago, [blank] the British airlines flying from Hong Kong to the West [blank] are allowed to stop over in Kunming, while the British allow the Chinese [blank] planes to fly from Kunming across the border into Saigon. The current meeting is to discuss [blank] technical and business issues.

### ### Old Mrs. Zhao Gives Speeches in Yunnan

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Kunming, 4th] Old Mrs. Zhao recently arrived in Yunnan and gave speeches about her experience with the guerrilla forces. She will go to Chongqing within days.

### ### Our Army in Southern Shanxi Captures Two Japanese Pilots Alive; They Have Now Been Escorted to Luoyang

[Xi'an Dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th] At 9:30 a.m. on the 28th of last month, five Japanese [blank] planes bombed Huixing [blank] Hejia Village. One Type 94 easy bomber No. 3016 was shot down by our army's machine guns [blank] in Pinglu, where our army visited the site. Two Japanese pilots set fire to destroy the plane [blank], prompting our army to mobilize the local [blank] populace [blank]. Half of the plane's body was destroyed. The plane is worth about 400,000 Japanese yen. The engine is still in good condition. The two pilots were also captured alive [blank]. One is an air force lieutenant named Yamada Kiyoshi, and the other is named Omori [blank] Kiyoshi [blank]. The one prisoner, Lu Jingyuan, volunteered to surrender. That night, our army gathered more than a thousand soldiers and civilians to hold a meeting and perform plays to welcome him. Yamada Kiyoshi used Japanese to tell the public how the Japanese warlords deceived their national army and people, saying that attacking China was to prevent China from becoming communist. After he was captured, he saw that the Chinese soldiers [blank] were spirited and the people were heroic, and he began to believe that it was entirely the strength of the Three Principles of the People, and had nothing to do with communism. [Blank] He later expressed his willingness to work under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People to save Japan and save the world [blank]. Then Omori Kiyoshi Zang will have the Prime Minister's [blank] instruction translated into Japanese, and read it once. According to the two prisoners, the Japanese forces in southern Shanxi are weak and are building strong fortifications. They have no strength to cross the river. The Japanese bombing of Shaanxi and Henan is a bluff [blank], [blank] suspicious [blank], fearing that we will attack. It is heard that the two prisoners have now been escorted [blank] to Luoyang.

### ### Japanese Parliament Discusses Diplomatic Issues; Replies to Britain, the United States, and France to Be Issued Soon

[Tokyo Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, 4th] According to [blank] Tong sources, the results of the Japanese Parliament's discussion of the Far East situation can be summarized as follows: (1) Continue to invade China and form a "New East Asian Regime," as stated by former Prime Minister Kondo [blank] Ming last year. At the same time, the Japanese Navy will continue to blockade the Chinese coast, and the Japanese Army will prepare to fight against the Soviet Union in addition to invading China. The Japanese Navy [blank] has more than enough power [blank] [blank] to defend the Western Pacific and protect Japanese territory. (2) The Japanese government will never [blank] negotiate peace with China, and is willing to buy over traitors to organize a puppet regime. Japan, "Manchukuo," and "China" will also closely cooperate economically, militarily, and politically. (3) The Japanese government declares that this economic group of three East Asian countries does not monopolize the Far East market. It welcomes individual countries to provide assistance, except for political or military [blank] or interference in internal affairs. Also, after the [blank] regime is established, it will automatically abolish the concessions and extraterritorial rights, the Nine-Power Treaty, and various guarantees, as they have lost their timeliness.

[Tokyo Dispatch from Associated Press, 4th] "Kokumin Shimbun" predicts that the Japanese government will reply to the notes from Britain, the United States, and France to Japan within this week. The newspaper predicts that the contents of the Japanese government's reply will be as follows: (1) Reject the suggestion to convene an international conference. (2) Reiterate Japan's policy toward China, and [blank] respect the interests of foreigners except where "militarily necessary." (3) Declare that Japan's [blank] settlement of East Asia is a great contribution to "world permanent peace." (4) Deny that Japan is destroying [blank] the Nine-Power Treaty.

[Chongqing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd] Tokyo Dispatch: Foreign Minister Arita spoke again at the Diet meeting today about the possibility of Tokyo convening an international conference to seek to explain the misunderstandings of various countries about Japan. Arita said that Japan is fully prepared to repel attacks from the Soviet Union and other countries. Regarding the anti-Japanese problem in the United States, Arita hopes that Japanese people will not make meaningless provocations regarding American arguments.

### Roosevelt's Talk: US Policy Unchanged; Note to Italy on Public Opinion; Pittman Stresses Military Balance

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] President Roosevelt today sternly refuted various rumors concerning the US defense and foreign policies, stating that "such rumors are completely unfounded. The current government's policies are fully encompassed in my message to Congress, and there are no other new matters in policy. Regarding the secret meetings I held with various committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the only secret item was intelligence transferred from intelligence agencies. If this intelligence were to be announced, it would be difficult for the aforementioned sources to continue providing intelligence." When answering the question "America's front line is in France," President Roosevelt smiled and said, "Not only did we not say such a thing, but it is also inconsistent with the facts. After this rumor was published, Britain and France expressed welcome, while Germany and Italy attacked it incessantly. Whether it is welcome or attack, it is based on reports that are inconsistent with the facts."

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Senator Pittman declared today that "We should completely dispel the fear of the President [leading us] to the road of war from President Roosevelt's foreign policy speech. The desire to maintain political, economic, and social independence with other countries applies to both totalitarian and democratic countries. I believe that the only way to avoid a European war (which has the possibility of extending to the United States) is to balance the military strength of all countries, because neither side is willing to engage in a war that may result in failure."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] Roosevelt, when meeting with reporters yesterday, stated that rumors circulating that he had declared during a meeting with members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee on the 1st that "America's defense front line is in France or on the Rhine" are deliberately misleading. President Roosevelt then listed the four major points of his foreign policy: (1) The United States opposes forming alliances with foreign countries; (2) The United States advocates maintaining trade between all countries in the world; (3) The United States expresses sympathy for all efforts to reduce or limit armaments; (4) The United States expresses sympathy for maintaining the political, economic, and social independence of all countries in the world by peaceful means, with the United States as a member of the international community. Roosevelt firmly insisted that US foreign policy has not changed in the past and will remain the same in the future, but some members of Congress and biased newspapers still deliberately distort it.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 3rd] The American Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, recently sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling Foreign Minister Ciano's attention to the criticism of President Roosevelt in Italian newspapers and requesting an explanation. According to the semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia*, President Roosevelt is "suffering from hysteria and has gone mad." Other newspapers said that President Roosevelt intends to subvert the political systems of all-powerful nations, incite Latin American countries to resist all-powerful nations, and initiate an arms race.

Hess Issues a Frenzied Warning to Britain and America

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Hess, a leading member of the German Social Democratic Party, stated in a speech in Berlin last night: "Our front line is the bulwark of the West, not the Rhine. Our front line has been determined and will not allow any foreign soldiers to cross it. If Britain and America want to move their front lines, we will let them do so. National Socialism cannot be changed by debate, preaching, or lectures. The policies of the National Socialist Party cannot be changed by Western agitators or democracies across the Atlantic, even if speculative and arms businesses suffer losses as a result."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, recently proposed that the government should publicly release all documents related to the French purchase of aircraft. Ten members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee have expressed their support for this proposal (the Military Affairs Committee has a total of eighteen members), so Clark's proposal may be realized today. According to Clark, if the Military Affairs Committee rejects this request, he intends to submit it directly to the Senate. It is reported that the documents state that the Army authorities originally opposed selling the latest fighter jets to foreign countries. A minority of members of Congress are stepping up their attacks on government policy, hoping to end secret diplomacy. It is believed that unless President Roosevelt clearly explains his foreign policy, a number of members of Congress will oppose all legislation related to foreign relations. If Clark's proposal ultimately succeeds, then regarding the issue of expanding the air force, it will be easier to determine which of the proposals of Johnson (Republican Senator from California) and Woodring, the Secretary of War, will prevail. It is rumored that Johnson advocates that the United States add 13,000 aircraft, but the total number of aircraft in Woodring's phased plan submitted to President Roosevelt is only one-third of Johnson's plan. It is rumored that many non-military officials within the Department of War support Woodring's proposal.

### British Foreign Secretary Delivers Speech: Praises Chamberlain's Policy; Military Expansion Sufficient to Cope with War; Attaches Importance to Italian Guarantees on Spain

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The British Foreign Secretary, Halifax, delivered a speech on the achievements of Britain's military expansion at the City Hall here yesterday. He said that "In the past two or three years, as a result of our small-scale promotion of the navy, army, and air force, our country's strength has not yet reached its previous strong position. Therefore, if some people believe that once something happens, our country will be unable to cope, this view is wrong. We must endure the cruelty of modern warfare, but we also have the right to avoid it. The British people are unwilling to quarrel with others, but once forced to do so, I believe they will not hesitate, and the result is also expected. The relationship between our country and individuals is firmly based on human respect for freedom, while in some other countries, it is based on concepts that are contrary to ours. This conflict of concepts, coupled with the disputes left over from the Great War, is creating the main cause of the current chaotic emotions. In the current emotions, violence is regarded as strength, and tolerance is regarded as weakness. Therefore, our country is determined to work hard to establish true peace. It would have been easy for Mr. Chamberlain to abandon his efforts to mediate European peace, and others may have done so long ago. Mr. Chamberlain's perseverance has been severely attacked, but as far as I know, Mr. Chamberlain's composed and undaunted spirit is unparalleled. Mr. Chamberlain and other members of the government have never underestimated the difficulties of the current dangerous national situation. The Prime Minister's greatest advantage is that he has not surrendered to critics (as you often know, there are very few overseas critics) and abandoned his efforts for true peace. Even if Mr. Chamberlain's efforts completely fail and our country is forced into war, I will still firmly believe that these efforts are completely correct and of great benefit to Europe. Because during this period, the entire people of the country will be united and firm, regardless of party affiliation, and strive for peace with the greatest confidence. They themselves may not realize the immensity of their own strength, but its impact on world moral opinion is inestimable." Halifax also stated that he does not believe that a major war is inevitable. He then spoke of Italy's guarantees to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean and have no territorial ambitions in Spain, saying, "For two years, Spain has been the main factor in European disputes, and France and here are deeply concerned about it because the power of the two countries is threatened. We should attach importance to the guarantees given by Mussolini this time."

Britain Has Not Discriminated Against German Trade

Halifax, after defending Britain's policy of non-intervention, said, "In today's world, international contact is often fraught with friction, resulting in frequent rumors. Several central factories must work overtime to increase production. Although I sympathize with this unnecessary panic, I have seen the increase in British unity and the people's resolute calmness. More than one million people have voluntarily participated in air raid prevention services. In short, the British people are those who love Britain and are prepared to obtain what they consider important rights and interests. Although the British people love peace, they are willing to fight for things that make life worthwhile, and peace also has its reasons. In his speech a few days ago, Hitler said that Germany must develop its export trade, or it will die. Germany's situation is indeed like this, and Britain is also like this. Hitler also said that the last World War was an attempt to exclude Germany from world trade, which is not true. Before the European War, Germany and Britain were the best customers, and the commercial and financial relationship between the two countries was closer than that of any other country. Would we have wanted to exclude Germany from world trade at that time or now? We will never believe that competition can exclude other countries and monopolize it." Regarding Hitler's prediction that there would be a long period of peace, he said, "I hope to fulfill this prediction more sincerely than anyone else. After the world has been guaranteed peace, trade can be revived and economic development will be possible. Everyone will benefit from peace. This achievement is far superior to the achievements of the last century. If the world remains an armed fortress, the existing difficulties will continue to exist. If the countries of the world do not work together for the common good, then basic economic standards cannot be improved. The fact that Britain and Germany have a good relationship, so we are always prepared to cooperate with other countries in practical contributions and will continue to cooperate to achieve this goal, is a symbol of good relations between Britain and Germany."

### The Dismissal of Schacht

— Shu Di

(Special Dispatch from London)

In the previous dispatch, the reporter pointed out the significant impact of the behind-the-scenes financial negotiations conducted by Schacht and Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, over the past month or so, on the development of the entire European situation. Now, the news of Schacht's dismissal by Hitler has suddenly appeared before the people of the world.

Needless to say, Hitler's move is a serious demonstration against Britain, causing shock in all aspects of Britain. All British newspapers that appeared today and last night have placed this news in the most important position, and most of them have detailed editorials. However, looking at the general tone, it is still attributed to Germany's domestic financial reasons, and the significance of this move in international relations is cleverly omitted; but the feeling of unease is clearly revealed in the lines.

According to today's news here, Schacht has been removed from his position as President of the National Bank; but he still retains the status of "a member of the German government." This means that here, Hitler is still leaving a path for negotiation and compromise with Britain; at any time, negotiations can still be carried out. If Britain cannot withstand Hitler's loud intimidation and is willing to make financial concessions to win Germany's favor in order to temporarily seek safety, then she can still do so through Schacht. However, looking at the recent developments, Hitler's dream is highly unlikely to be achieved.

When Schacht's trip to London at the end of last year completely failed to achieve his expected goals and he returned quietly, some radicals within Germany were very dissatisfied with him; but at the time, his explanation was: Although this trip was fruitless, hope has not been cut off. Because he had already agreed with Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, that negotiations could still be carried out in the near future. Then, he drafted various plans regarding the maintenance of German finances, the most important of which was the so-called demand for Britain and France to return the German reparations after the European War, as a powerful argument for future negotiations. Sure enough, Norman's trip to Germany was realized ahead of schedule. However, during the process of this negotiation, other complications arose. At this time, the British government suddenly learned of Hitler and Mussolini's joint plan with Japan to expand this year; at the same time, the British Foreign Office received intelligence that even if Franco won in Spain, the Italian troops would never withdraw. In the same situation, it is said that the negotiations conducted by Germany with Dr. Schacht as its representative have no restraining effect on Germany's ambitions. Therefore, in order to prevent Norman from making concessions too quickly, the British government immediately took several steps: First, British Foreign Secretary Halifax quickly notified Norman, informing him of Britain's temporary decision regarding German strategy, hoping that he would not make specific concessions, and at best, could end his trip to Germany in the name of a private trip; secondly, the British government immediately issued a notice prohibiting any direct or indirect easing of restrictions on Germany; the last and most powerful move was to immediately announce that, starting today, approximately 290 million in gold would be transferred from the Bank of England to another national financial institution. With these steps, the negotiations between Norman and Dr. Schacht, which were in progress, were immediately shelved and became completely meaningless.

Britain's actions naturally aroused Hitler's great resentment, and he decided to retaliate. As a result, there was the sudden dismissal of Dr. Schacht, who was labeled as a "moderate," and his successor was the person who had made contributions to the rapid expansion of economic power abroad.

Speaking only in economic terms, Germany's move actually has no intimidating effect on Britain at all. Even if the currently noisy German market expansion plan is accelerated, even if all the economic plans that Germany is currently planning are implemented, British economic experts firmly believe in a number of facts: Germany's economic situation has indeed reached its limit; as for the future, if it does not give up its arms race with Britain, then the fundamental collapse of its economy is inevitable.

However, the greatest significance of Schacht's dismissal lies in the political aspect. Continuing along this path, the long-brewing intimidation of prohibiting the expansion of British and French armaments will probably be presented soon. [1, 27]

### Various Countries Expand Their Navies: Germany Builds Submarines; France Pays Close Attention; Soviet Union Will Follow Germany in Building Cruisers

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement allows Hitler to build 80 to 90 submarines. France is very alarmed by this. Naval Minister Campinchi has been ordered to immediately report to the Naval Committee, informing Britain that after Germany builds submarines equal to France according to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, France's navy will be in a clearly disadvantageous situation, because the French fleet needs to cope with the German and Italian fleets simultaneously. France has 76 submarines (including the largest in the world), and 22 are about to be built, for a total of 98. This number will be equal to Hitler's submarine fleet. However, France is well aware that Italy has 101 submarines, so the strength of France's submarine force is two to one compared with the two totalitarian countries. This will cause serious danger to France's defense and communication lines in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. France has no treaty or agreement restricting the construction of submarines, so it is concentrating its efforts on building ships to compete with Italy. France is now accelerating the completion of two 35,000-ton battleships to resist Italy's three newly built battleships.

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] German requests to increase submarine tonnage and increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers have been commented on by British naval officials, who said that as far as the submarine part is concerned, it will take Germany four years to achieve its goal if it wants to bring its total tonnage to the same level as Britain. This will be a different matter if Germany can greatly increase its construction rate. The existing submarine tonnage of that country ranges from 250 tons to 600 tons per ship. According to confirmed information, the country plans to build large submarines ranging from 800 tons to 1,500 tons, whose cruising range is far beyond that of existing submarines. Regarding the cruiser part, Germany is requesting to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven, the reason for which is that the Soviet government is building seven such cruisers, but they have not provided concrete evidence. According to the Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreement, it was stipulated that if Germany built five Class A cruisers, the Soviet Union could build seven. Now that Germany has increased the number of such cruisers, the Soviet Union will inevitably follow suit in accordance with the guarantee clauses contained in the naval agreement, and the impact of this will inevitably lead to a competition in shipbuilding.

### German Air Force Reorganized into East, West, and North Commands; Promotion of Young Officers; Milch Appointed as Inspector General

[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th] According to the announcement here last night, Hitler reorganized the Air Force at the suggestion of Aviation Minister General Goering, and replaced a large number of senior officials. After this change, all German air affairs are under the command of the Supreme Air Force Commander, and a large number of young aviation personnel have been promoted to generals. Most of these personnel were pilots during the European War, and are between 40 and 45 years old, and most of them have not held any positions. Those who were lieutenant colonels or colonels have been promoted to generals. This plan is unprecedented in German history, which shows Hitler's emphasis on the Air Force. In addition, Hitler appointed General Milch of the Political Office as the Inspector General of the Air Force, under whom are four departments: Air Defense, Training, Aircraft Manufacturing, and Air Machinery. Udet, a famous pilot during the European War, was appointed as the Director of the Machinery Department, so that strategic cooperation plans could be made. The Army, Navy, and Air Force will each send Air Force generals to be advisors to the Supreme Commanders of the Army and Navy. The Air Force itself will also be extensively updated. The entire German Air Force will be divided into three major commands: East, West, and North. Each command will be divided into several Air Force divisions, and each division commander will be a young Air Force general. Each command will have a Commander-in-Chief. In addition, the Air Force in East Prussia will be under the jurisdiction of the Air Force Commander in that area.

### House of Representatives Passes Bill to Protect Territorial Integrity

### Support Our Country's Currency with Loans; British Parliament Will Discuss; Our Country Purchases a Large Number of Automobiles from Britain

[Reuters, London, 4th] The economic editor of the *Financial News* stated, "According to my knowledge, there has been no further news recently regarding the British loan to China. British businessmen are quite in favor of giving China proper economic assistance, and the British government is also quite sympathetic to China. Whether China can obtain British economic assistance depends on whether it can continue to repay its customs debts. China has made considerable progress in managing its currency in the past six months, so recently, British proposals to support Chinese currency with loans have become more powerful. The British Parliament will discuss this issue further when it discusses the export credit loan plan in the future. Some opinions believe that British loans to China will be guaranteed by the government, and private banks will make the loans."

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Reuters reports that the Chinese government's purchasing committee is likely to sign a contract with a British company in the near future to purchase 300 heavy-duty trucks for the Burma Road. The funds required will be deducted from the export credit guarantee loan granted to China by the British government in November of last year. It was previously rumored that the roadbed of the Burma Road would be difficult for heavy-duty trucks exceeding one ton to pass, but with the strengthening of the roadbed project, the current progress is going smoothly. When the trucks arrive in China, trucks weighing 7 tons will also be able to pass without obstruction. It is reported that China and Britain have begun preliminary talks on China using part of the additional British loan funds to purchase railway and telegraph materials. Some sources say that the amount is approximately 4 million to 5 million pounds, but this has not been confirmed. According to sources here, the current Sino-British negotiations are still preliminary in nature. It is widely rumored here that the British are planning to grant loans to China, and the loan is planned to be in the form of stabilizing the Sino-British currency system, but it is said that these negotiations will take a considerable amount of time to conclude, so there are few concrete results at present. According to reports, the United States is also considering similar measures to consolidate China's currency system, but it is unlikely that anything will be announced. It is also reported that China and Britain are actively negotiating on the issue of China repaying loans secured by tariffs.

### Short Commentary: Wang Jingwei Goes to Europe

According to a Chongqing dispatch, Wang Jingwei has regretted his "suggestions" and recently decided to reside in Europe, with Paris as his primary destination. The Central Government is being extremely generous to Wang, providing him with travel expenses, and so on.

If the news of Wang Jingwei going to Europe is true, it would be a welcome development. This is because it would prove that the public will of the entire nation has finally prevailed, and any pro-Japanese elements, defeatists, and surrenderists will be submerged by the people's surging tide for freedom.

If Wang's departure to Europe becomes a reality, we must have a few fundamental understandings:

First, Wang's departure to Europe absolutely cannot represent any activities of the Chinese government or the people. We must also urge all sectors at home and abroad to closely monitor his words and actions. If he does not repent and atone for his sins, and if he does not abandon his views, then he cannot wash away the shame of his [censored] face.

Second, even if Wang goes to Europe, it cannot be said that Wang's betrayal of the party, selling out the country, and surrender is over, because defeatists are still singing the tune of "peace" and "anti-communism," willingly acting as a special task force for the Japanese aggressors. Moreover, lurking pro-Japanese elements are taking advantage of various clever disguises to seek opportunities to act. We cannot ignore or relax our work against traitors because of Wang's distant retreat.

Third, even if Wang goes to Europe, his propaganda apparatus and his personal lackeys are still scattered throughout the country and abroad, and may even change their methods of operation to carry out their conspiracies. This is something we cannot ignore.

However, Wang's failure is already certain. Any future actions by Wang will not be successful, and he will not even be able to restore his old political status of "selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head"! We hope that all pessimists and defeatists will take Wang as a lesson. We also hope that the small number of people who blindly echoed Wang in the past will take Wang as a warning and actively support the Central Government, strengthen unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation's liberation!

### [Censored] Efforts to Seize the Nanyang Market Heavily Impact Hong Kong's Nanyang Trade; Volume of Goods Exchanged Declines Daily Over Several Months; [Censored] Goods Change Labels and Flood Southward in a Continuous Stream

Since the change in the situation in South China, [censored]'s promotion of its southward advance plan has become increasingly acute. In the occupied areas, it actively manipulates and monopolizes any business operations. Towards the markets in Hong Kong and Nanyang, it takes advantage of the military expansion period to urgently seek to seize control, hoping to obtain substantial economic assistance from this and enhance its aggressive power. Among them, the Philippines, Laos, Annam, and [censored] India are particularly active. The ambition is not only to defeat the economic status of overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned regions, but also to occupy the markets of goods from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Therefore, [censored] goods are shipped to various parts of Nanyang via Hong Kong after changing trademarks and labels, and are sold at extremely low prices. The numbers are increasing day by day. According to sources from a certain trading firm, in the past three months, almost every liner transporting [censored] goods via Hong Kong to Nanyang has been filled with them. Because it is a secret operation, it is difficult to obtain statistical figures. However, based on observations of the situation, it is believed that it has greatly increased compared to before. However, in this situation, the most obvious fact is the drastic shrinkage of the business of Hong Kong's Nanyang trading firms. Since the outbreak of the Guangdong war, the business of Hong Kong's Nanyang trading firms has been declining day by day. On average, the volume of goods exchanged each month has decreased by about 20-40% compared to the past few months. The biggest reason for this is, on the one hand, that transportation is interrupted. The various goods that the Nanyang trading firms used to procure in the interior and ship south are now blocked. On the other hand, [censored] merchants are stepping up their activities in the south, actively seizing local markets, and providing various inducements to local natives to help them sell [censored] goods, causing the sales of our country's goods to be increasingly obstructed. The goods shipped by various Nanyang trading firms have gradually decreased. At the same time, because the domestic market has been destroyed by the war, the import of local products from various parts of Nanyang has almost completely stopped. Therefore, under the above circumstances, the business of various Nanyang trading firms in Hong Kong has suffered a major blow.

### Last Year's Treasury Revenue Increased by More Than 3 Million Compared to the Previous Year, But Expenditures Increased More Than Revenue; Total Deficit Exceeds 400,000 Yuan

According to yesterday morning's Hong Kong Gazette, the total actual revenue of the Hong Kong government last year was $16,735,854.68, an increase of more than $6 million compared to the original budget of $30,254,920. Compared to the actual revenue of $33,196,368.10 in the previous year, it also increased by more than $1 million. As for the expenditure direction, the actual expenditure last year was $37,175,897.82, exceeding the original budget of $33,337,9549 by more than $3 million, which is also an increase of more than [censored] compared to the actual expenditure of $32,111,222 in the previous year.

Increased Revenue, Even Greater Expenditures

Dividing the above figures for analysis, the increase in revenue is not as much as the increase in expenditure. Comparing revenue and expenditure, the deficit is nearly one million yuan. If we look at December alone, the revenue reached $3,199,514.11, an increase of more than $200,000 compared to the revenue of $2,921,219.76 in the same month of the previous year. As for expenditure, that month actually spent $5,982,720.73, an increase of more than $2 million compared to the $3,196,773.16 in the same month of the previous year. Comparing revenue and expenditure, the deficit reached more than $2 million.

Tax Revenue Increased by Hundreds of Thousands

Looking at last year's financial revenue and expenditure situation, the increase in revenue mainly came from the increase in the following items: (1) Tax revenue increased by $1,479,713.30 compared to the original budget; (2) License fees and other unclassified internal revenue reached $900,635.31; (3) Litigation fees and others reached $127,411.43; (4) Revenue from the Kowloon-Canton Railway reached $484,347.45; (5) Revenue from government properties reached $173,366.58; (6) Miscellaneous revenue reached $114,572.88; (7) Revenue from the sale of public land reached $671,046.15.

Expenditures Exceeded Budget by a Large Margin

As for the items whose expenditures increased compared to the original budget, the most noteworthy are: (1) Postal expenditure increased by $154,960.94; (2) Wireless communication expenditure was $211,020.71; (3) Port expenditure reached $210,886.09; (4) Fire department expenditure reached $71,376.49; (5) Police expenditure was $179,794.14; (6) Health department expenditure reached $389,210.48; (7) Education department expenditure was $100,467.01; (8) Kowloon-[Censored] Railway Bureau item $332,485.24; (9) Military expenditure item reached $1,294,308.47; (10) Miscellaneous expenditure reached $1411,942.84; (11) Public Works Department extraordinary expenditure item $389,604.33. From the above revenue and expenditure situation, it can be observed that if Hong Kong's finances are to be sound, there is still room for improvement. However, this is only a temporary observation. If we look at the balance sheet as of the end of last December, there is still a surplus of $13,562,234.97.

### Rumor Has It Germany Will Abandon The Huge Trade Agreement; Original Barter Target of 100 Million Yuan; Hong Kong Foreign Firms Actively Seek To Obtain Market Share

Two years ago, our government signed a reciprocal agreement with Germany, in which our country would exchange tungsten ore, tung oil, etc. for German machinery. The value of both parties' goods was set at 100 million yuan. The company managing this matter was the Sino-German Trading and Credit Company, a semi-official German entity. After the agreement was signed, the above-mentioned products were gradually placed under control, and German and other foreign firms not only despaired of attempting to monopolize them, but even trying to get involved in them was impossible. Now, according to news from London, the agreement seems to be on the verge of being abandoned. Since the German government withdrew its German advisors, this agreement has suffered a major blow. Although the trade between the two parties has not reached the specified amount of 100 million yuan, it has already begun to be settled. Hong Kong [Censored] foreign firms, upon hearing the news, have been actively seeking to obtain a share of the pie, because tungsten and tung oil are both products that various countries are eager to acquire.

### Authorities Prohibit [Censored] From Selling Old Lottery Tickets

According to the Gazette, the Legal Secretary recently issued a new regulation prohibiting shops and hawkers from selling lottery tickets on behalf of others. This regulation supplements the 1931 Betting Tax Ordinance and will be submitted to the Legislative Council for approval. The amendment to the ordinance stipulates that no one can sell betting tickets, receipts, or substitutes thereof on behalf of others, except for those who have obtained permission from the police authorities to sell them, and the organizations that issue the tickets. It is an exception. It is noted that the Hong Kong Jockey Club holds a one-dollar grand lottery every year. Those who act as agents to promote lottery tickets receive a 10% commission. Many people in Hong Kong receive the lottery from the association to promote and profit. In the future, after the new regulations are passed and implemented by the Legislative Council, those who sell lottery tickets in small amounts will be in violation of the regulations and will be subject to legal sanctions.

### Promoting Vocational Education; Education Figures Sponsor Hainan Vocational School; Includes Agriculture, Drama, Journalism Departments; Provides a Learning Environment for Talented Youth

The phenomenon of surplus university education in our country is becoming increasingly serious. After the War of Resistance, the number of young people who are out of school, unemployed, and displaced has increased. The promotion of vocational education is most important at this time. Recently, Fang Xiaoyue, a well-known figure in academic circles, has specially joined forces with a group of experts and scholars in Hong Kong to establish a Hainan Vocational School, following the vocational school regulations of the Ministry of Education, and specially creating a special learning environment for talented young people, shortening the overall learning process for young people, and cultivating specialists in various social undertakings in a shorter period of time. It is reported that the school currently offers three departments: Agriculture, Journalism, and Drama. The professors and instructors who are in charge of teaching include Jiang Kanghu, Chen Yushan, Ouyang Yuqian, Xu Peikun, Hu Chunbing, Chuan Buwei, and Li Ding, all of whom are well-known in society. Their thoughts and careers are all very progressive and profound. The school's purpose is to emphasize practical work. The agriculture department is equipped with a practice farm located in Pingling, Yuen Long. Yesterday, I passed by the New Territories and passed by the farm. The person in charge of the school guided me to visit. I saw that the farm was located at the foot of Pingling Mountain, surrounded by a large stream. The planting and transplantation techniques were excellent, and the students were developing a solid academic style based on farming and reading, which is very promising. In addition to workers working, it is said that there are plans to use refugees to engage in reclamation work using the work-for-relief method. The school buildings for the agriculture department are temporarily located in the village houses of Zhongwu Village in Yuen Long. The new school site is located on the highway in the village and is currently being planned and built. In addition, the journalism department emphasizes practical training in interviewing and writing. It is in contact with newspapers and can conduct on-site experiments at any time. The drama department also has various guidance facilities for practical performances. In addition to the regular courses, there are also special classes, many of which are special lectures to supplement and deepen the knowledge of current professionals, or to tutor ordinary people in applied skills. For example, the journalism department offers special classes in drama, basic English classes (using Walker's 850-word teaching method), and basic Chinese language, etc., and new subjects can be added at any time. The school is located at 39 Jiupo Road, Kowloon, and has begun accepting students. Classes are scheduled to begin in early March.

### Treasury Secretary Issues Statement Strictly Prohibiting Discrimination Against Old Nickel Coins; Cannot Refuse to Accept Before Official Announcement of Abolition

After issuing new nickel coins, the Hong Kong authorities planned to gradually recall the old nickel coins and dime coins. Approximately 70% of the total have been recalled. The authorities originally intended to announce the abolition of old coins at the end of the Lunar New Year this year. Afterwards, [Censored] New Year's Eve was approaching, and auxiliary coins were urgently needed for circulation, so the date was repeatedly changed. It is planned to notify the abolition after the New Year. However, during this transitional period, incidents of people refusing to use [Censored] coins ahead of schedule have been discovered in the market, causing financial fluctuations due to this impact. Treasury Secretary Buckley, for this reason, specially met with reporters yesterday morning and issued an important statement, saying that he saw a report this morning that China Motor Bus had refused to accept old coins. He hereby solemnly declared that from now on, no matter who it is, before the government officially issues a notice announcing the abolition of old nickel coins and silver dimes, they cannot refuse to accept them, because old coins and silver dimes are still in circulation in Hong Kong and have not lost their currency value. Residents must continue to circulate them until the government issues a notice abolishing the old coins and cannot discriminate against them. If [Censored] violates the discipline and refuses to accept them, they will be punished severely according to the law for disrupting financial order.

[Censored] ships disregard international law and specialize in wanton acts of burning and looting against our unarmed ships. These incidents continue to occur.

### Remembering Mr. Xu Chongzhi's Arrival

— Falling Sunset

The National Policy of Resistance is My Consistent Stance

Mr. Xu Chongzhi, a senior member of the party and state and current vice president of the Control Yuan, recently received a telegram from the central government to return to Chongqing to take on an important position. He boarded the American President Lines' President Coolidge to rush south towards Chongqing. Yesterday, the steamship carrying Mr. Xu safely arrived in Hong Kong. As a reporter, I rushed to the steamship to interview him. Here is a brief record of my observations:

At noon, I took a ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui. In the middle of the river, I could already see the black body and red smokestack of the President Coolidge slowly approaching in the green waves. When it arrived at the Kowloon Wharf, it was already crowded with black [censored] people. Mr. Du Yuesheng, wearing a black coat, [censored] long gown, and black satin shoes, and celebrities such as Kong Lingni and Mao Yuanhe, stood aside, chatting leisurely, occasionally looking up at the approaching steamship.

As soon as the President Coolidge docked, the iron [censored] steamer [censored] blew its departure whistle. The bridgehead was full of people who were reluctant to see them off, while the bridge tail was full of guests who were happily receiving the steamship. After the send-off people passed by, the pick-up people ran forward in a commotion. When I arrived at the ship's office, I picked up the passenger list, but there was no Mr. Xu's name on it. This was quite a surprise. Several colleagues and Mr. Xu's relatives searched separately. Some people who came to pick up the ship said, "Mr. Xu didn't come!" After all, Mr. Du Yuesheng and his party led the way and found Mr. Xu at a stairwell.

The people who came to pick up the ship rushed forward to shake hands and exchange greetings. Mr. Xu stood very excitedly and sincerely among the people, returning the courtesy one by one and thanking them. Hope you are doing well. Mr. Xu was wearing a beige suit. He was extraordinarily energetic, and fully revealed his decades of experience and perseverance in running for the party and the country.

He spoke Shanghainese with the people he was socializing with, but when he met a reporter, he switched back to his [censored] fluent Cantonese. He always had a smile when he spoke. When the reporter began to talk to him, he nodded repeatedly as soon as he heard that it was a reporter and said, "Ah! Please wait a moment." Then he quickly taught his entourage to take out his written statement. The written statement said: "Since the central government has solemnly declared the national policy of resistance, Chongzhi has always consistently advocated nothing more than this. However, I hope that the people of the country will unite and go to this goal together. Chongzhi will definitely devote his meager strength and respectfully follow the people of the country. Chongzhi belongs to the military and has little to say about politics, but he will serve the Three Principles of the People of the Prime Minister for life, and strive to maintain our national rights and make our people stand on an equal footing in the world." Although only a few words, Mr. Xu's patriotic enthusiasm has been fully expressed!

When asked how long he would stay in Hong Kong, he said it was uncertain.

According to a certain related party, Mr. Xu's trip to Chongqing is to participate in the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council organized by the Fifth Plenary Session to jointly formulate plans for the war of resistance.

### Tens of Thousands of Refugee Children Await Assistance! Refugee Children's Free School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday, Appealing to Overseas Compatriots for Sponsorship of Refugee Children's Education

— Qi Zhuo

The bombs of the [Japanese] devils have created a scene of displaced refugees. What particularly breaks my heart is the sight of the elderly, weak, and young, unable to withstand the drastic changes in their environment. Seeing the children's cries, hunger, and cold truly makes us worry about this group of future masters!

The Kowloon Victoria Refugee Children's Free School in Hong Kong is extending warm and loving hands to rescue a portion of the school-aged children who have lost their opportunity to learn. In these difficult times, the spirit of "cherishing one's own young, and extending that care to the young of others" is truly even more precious.

Yesterday at twelve noon, the school held its first graduation ceremony at the Confucius Hall.

"Today's children are the masters of the future," "Rescue children from hardship," "Refugee schools are schools of society," "If the national crisis is not over for one day, the national responsibility is not completed for one day," "..." Alerting slogans were plastered all over the hall, explaining the school's motivation and purpose in establishing the school. In conversations with reporters and receptionists, we also learned about the general situation of the school.

Most of the school's students are poor, out-of-school children who fled to Hong Kong and Kowloon under the Japanese army's artillery fire, and local poor children who are unable to attend school. The total number is about four hundred, divided into six areas for instruction. They are: Hong Kong District, located at 24, 3rd Floor, Po Hing Fong, Central. 152, 1st Floor, Third Street, Sai Ying Pun. 86 Wanchai Road, Kowloon District is located at: 676, 1st Floor, Shanghai Street, Mong Kok. 150, 2nd Floor, Woosung Street, Yau Ma Tei, and 161, 3rd Floor, Tai Nan Street, Sham Shui Po.

This refugee children's school was expanded from the tea house workers' volunteer school. The funds are generally donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and the school's board members, such as Wen Dongxuan, Wen Yaoyang, Ling Kangfa, Liu Chongqi, and Ling Shudong, have been particularly helpful. The current monthly expenses are around one thousand yuan, and the teaching staff consists of approximately thirty people. Students are admitted free of charge, and books and supplies are also provided by the school.

Since the school's opening six months ago, the organization has been divided into senior and junior levels. The senior level is equivalent to grades three and four, and the junior level is equivalent to grades one and two. Classes are held in the evening, and the curriculum is similar to that of ordinary primary schools, with the addition of wartime knowledge, emphasizing the training of resistance awareness. After the graduation of the senior class, they plan to recruit new students again and hope to train them in more livelihood skills.

According to the principal's report at the meeting: "The number of refugee children in Hong Kong is estimated to be over tens of thousands. Please, overseas compatriots, sponsor the education of refugee children." We also sincerely pray that this kind of voluntary education can be widely expanded with the support of philanthropists and enthusiastic people. This is not only a charitable cause but also lays the foundation for the revival of the nation.

Three Major Qualities

Hu Chunbing: The so-called criticism has a different meaning from the commonly misused one. In the past, criticism could be roughly divided into two types: one was the old-fashioned, dogmatic preaching of the old gentlemen, using the ruler like those so-called progressive criticisms of the past few years. The other is abuse and attacks, which can only lead to anarchic chaos in the art world, such as the articles in Shanghai and Hong Kong tabloids, which are almost all personal attacks. The criticism we want to establish is to build theory in action. We can say that progressive criticism itself has three characteristics: (1) Progressive criticism is a review of work. Our era does not need (and cannot produce) detached critics who have no relationship with the actual work of the art department and only know how to quote scriptures and make judgments. Our critics must come from among the workers themselves. Criticism is self-criticism, a review of work, and an important program in the self-education of the entire art world. To faithfully report the actual work situation, to systematically investigate and organize the material conditions of the entire activity, and to indicate further work routes and methods from overcoming the difficulties and shortcomings of the work. To mobilize the first workers to participate in criticism activities and make criticism an organic part of the entire art activity. (2) Progressive criticism is constructive. It is itself a kind of work activity. Criticism is not a repetition of golden rules, but the inevitable accumulation of activities – work experience, recreated through the critic's thought system. It is indeed a kind of creation. This creation is not destructive but constructive, not abusive but kind, not rigid but active. This kind of criticism is not only an objective critique of artistic activities but also an effort of subjective activities. (3) Progressive criticism activities are an extension and in-depth growth of basic theory, and at the same time, they are the cornerstone and Originalaerm (seed) for establishing the guiding theory of artistic activities. Film and drama criticism cannot be separated from social life, so the progressive thinking methods and realistic materials of society will be the 'backstage' of criticism, but this kind of criticism is not just to end the old reality, but to build a new reality. Guiding theory is the guide for creating a new reality. Therefore, criticism activities must also be organizational activities.

There has not yet been established film and drama criticism in Southern China. We must use criticism activities to strengthen the effectiveness of our work, promote the unity of workers, and strive to have a broader group understand, accept, and support progressive drama and film!

Standards Should Not Be Too High

Fei Mu: Regarding film and drama criticism, I think it's very simple. I don't want to talk too much about theory, just to say a few honest words. Criticism is review, and the work of review is something we must actually do, but don't set too high a standard. For criticism of toxic works, I don't think we need to adopt an attacking attitude too harshly; sometimes we should forgive their difficulties.

The subject of this discussion is the upcoming performance by the China Art Troupe. I think we should focus on discussing that. The China Art Troupe's performance this time is technically superior to its content, which is really worthy of our respect. I would also like to propose that we ask the China Art Troupe to report on how they performed this time so that everyone's criticism has a basis.

Avoid Generalized Criticism

Situ Huimin: I think the problem of film and drama criticism is not as simple as Fei Guangsheng said, especially film criticism, because I am a film worker. Since the War of Resistance – especially after the Japanese army invaded the south – I feel that various problems that should be solved in my work should have an inseparable and close relationship with film criticism. On the surface, the issue of film and drama criticism seems simple, but in reality, there are many differences in the film and drama work here. For example, in terms of content, it is very obvious from many public performances recently that drama is not as strict as film in terms of examination and approval. Many more meaningful and positive works can be performed, but film is very difficult. In the past few months, all I have seen are things that have nothing to do with the War of Resistance or even are detrimental to the War of Resistance. On the other hand, after the war moved west, the domestic market shrank. Most producers take this as a reason for switching. So we must quickly decide what kind of works to do at this time. On the one hand, in order to make it meaningful to the War of Resistance, and on the other hand, we must strive for public screenings in various places. To achieve this, film criticism must play a great guiding role. This is very important.

What should also be specifically pointed out is that I believe many of the film and drama criticism issues that have been noted are generalized and do not pay attention to film and drama criticism under the confrontation with the Japanese devils, especially film and drama criticism in Hong Kong under foreign rule, where the Japanese devil's cultural offensive can occur at any time, and various restrictions can be added at any time, so our work has also become wartime, attacking in various ways at any time, and can also change our strategy due to restrictions. Film criticism is inseparable from our work, and in order to cooperate with the War of Resistance, it should not be as rigid and formal as general criticism. Regarding Ouyang Yuqian's views on overcoming the formulaic nature of film and drama, in addition to agreeing with Mr. Cai Chusheng's opinions, I would like to add something: sometimes, the performances in film and drama are more effective when they go in a curve than in a straight line, and more effective on the side than in the front, so that after the audience sees it, they have a feeling and think of a certain place. Now, in the process of resisting Japan and building the nation, all the activities of struggling hard in various fields, such as reading in caves, building roads, fighting with the Japanese devils in the snow... are all film and drama materials. It is not necessarily mechanical to pull out a Japanese devil and beat them up to our satisfaction, or to have a guerrilla team to be called a national defense drama. Soviet films are popular all over the world. Their films do not mechanically mark class struggles, but the audience naturally develops a sense of human justice. This is a clear example. Now, all those who expose the sins of decadence and corruption, making the audience feel related to themselves, are also drama materials. Just don't go beyond the biggest goal of 'resisting Japan and building the nation.'

Why use curves and take side approaches? Because art itself has its entertainment value, attracting people with elements of art such as sound, music, color, and twists and turns in the story, so that the plot and theme can be understood by the audience, establishing a close relationship.

This is the path we should take. If we don't succeed, we can try again. The path is made by people.

Strive for a Wider Audience

Tan Youliu: Regarding the discussion of establishing correct criticism of film and drama, many gentlemen have already expressed complete and valuable opinions. What I can offer now is just some supplementary material. We know that if a piece of work has not undergone criticism, it will not be improved and progressed; film and drama, of course, need sincere and earnest criticism to increase its later achievements and life. Among the producers of films and dramas (including writers, directors, actors, and talents in other departments), we can divide them into two parts: one part is 'upward,' they are never satisfied with their works and are always seeking progress; the other part is 'complacent,' they arrogantly believe that their works are 'perfect' and no one can compare with them. The former are 'thirsty for knowledge.' If there is no criticism after their works come out, they will feel frustrated and sad. They will try every means to find out the opinions of the audience and seek advice from like-minded people; but the latter are not. No matter how sincere criticism appears, making endless contributions to their works, they will 'disdain it' and even scold the critics aggressively for being 'busybody' or 'trying to get something'—Based on the attitudes of the above two types of producers, I believe that correct criticism should not only be established to discuss with the 'upward' and give lessons to the 'complacent,' but also, when necessary, attack them without hesitation. At the same time, it should also be written in various ways to interest ordinary audiences. Because film and drama cannot do without an audience, and among the audience, especially in South China, many people simply follow what others say, and they are even confused and do not know how to distinguish the quality of a work. If the writing and content of the criticism are lively and interesting instead of being rigid and only discussing specialized technical issues, then its effectiveness can naturally spread to the general audience, imperceptibly instilling in them knowledge of appreciating films and dramas. Since the audience has the knowledge of appreciation, they will naturally flock to carefully produced works. On the contrary, shoddy products will inevitably be rejected by customers and cannot continue to appear. In summary: We want to establish correct criticism, and this correct criticism must be written in various attractive ways, so that it not only makes contributions to film and drama itself, but also must strive to win more audiences for good works.

Coordinate with the National Struggle

Lian Guan: From the perspective of the entire cultural movement, our struggle should be continuously strengthened. As a department of the cultural movement, the film and drama movement, it is indeed very necessary and urgent to establish correct criticism today, because criticism is a weapon of struggle. We should use it flexibly in our own education, point out our direction, determine our steps, review our own weaknesses, correct general errors, expose all ugly postures, and combat and eliminate all slavish poisons that harm the nation. I think we should not regard this work as a small matter, nor should we think it is a simple problem. In fact, in the national liberation struggle, all work is difficult, but only if we persevere with a spirit of not being afraid of difficulties can any difficulty be overcome. We must recognize that the Japanese devils are using various conspiracies to hinder the progress and improvement of our culture, attempting to eliminate our national existence. At this time, there is a part of the backward and mediocre elements in the film industry who are helping the work that the Japanese devils want to do. Therefore, we must raise our political vigilance, and at any time and in any place, we are consistently fighting on the opposite front. We will mercilessly strike the Japanese devils. The Japanese devils will be defeated. This is a very obvious fact. First of all, we must unite and concentrate our own strength, strengthen and promote the development of this struggle, and coordinate the film and drama movement with the entire national liberation movement.

Three Important Conclusions

Lu Fu: On the issue of establishing progressive film and drama criticism, everyone has expressed so many valuable opinions. To sum up, we have already reached several important conclusions: First, the basis of our criticism should be established on the national liberation struggle. We must determine our needs based on the shift in the situation of the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must coordinate with the local environment and the opposing forces. Our standards should be broad, vivid, and not rigid slogans. Second, our attitude of criticism is constructive and creative. It is a rigorous review, not malicious attacks. It is sincere correction, not high-sounding talk. We must firmly support all progressive films and dramas, and at the same time, we must use our sincerity and kindness to encourage and awaken all backward film merchants and film workers. Third, the guiding principle of our criticism is to do our best to overcome all difficulties and shortcomings, to indicate a further work route and method, and at the same time, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of our work, we should strive to win over the broadest audience, so that every knowledgeable audience understands how to choose good spiritual food, so that our critical work plays a role and exerts a great power among the audience. These three conclusions can be said to be the practical gains of our first symposium—Because of the time, we can temporarily end this issue here. Later, we will need to practically implement this critical work!

(Note: The discussion on this topic has temporarily ended—The collective criticism on the performance of the China Art Troupe will be described in another article due to space limitations. End)

### National Films of 1939 and "Human Voice"!

— Jian Xin

Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" battle, Shanghai, where the main force of the Chinese film industry was located, completely entered a state of stagnation in the last few months of 1937 due to the lack of overall planning after the incident. It was also because of this sudden shock that workers in Shanghai had the opportunity to spread to various parts of the country, and some people came to Hong Kong one after another—to find new materials and a new working environment. By the beginning of 1938, the Shanghai film industry gradually awakened from its sudden stagnation, but unfortunately, this awakening was even more intensified, almost on par with the so-called "Cantonese films," competing with each other. However, several directors who came to Hong Kong were able to take things seriously and prepared and waited for the opportunity for a long time for each of their films. 1939 was the time for them to move. In addition to Situ Huimin completing his glorious "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" and "Guerrilla Warfare March," and he and Tan Youren are already preparing for this year's new films, and those that will start in January next year include Cai Chusheng's "Orphan Island Hall," "Clouds of the South China Sea," and Fei Mu's "Human Voice."

This journal has already introduced "Clouds of the South China Sea." As for True Light Company's "Human Voice," it is a film with absolute contemporary significance. It requires great courage and the gathering of top-notch material resources, human resources, and financial resources to complete this grand plan.

Its screenwriter is Zhong Shigen, the author of "Humanity" and "Family Ethics." The director is Fei Mu, and the cast includes Zhang Yi, Li Zhuozhuo, and Li Keng from Shanghai, and Wu Chufan and others from Hong Kong. This is just a list of the main roles. A large number of other excellent actors are being recruited. The first-class cinematographer Zhou Daming is in charge of photography, and the other staff members are also selected talents, preparing to create this special film over a longer period of time.

We are not only saying that we can see many more conscientious and excellent films in 1939, but what is even more noteworthy is that this good force will give a great influence to the good forces of the film industry in the mainland, creating a new awareness and enabling another part of the film force to discover a new path and move forward together.

Finally, we must declare that we will not hesitate to publicize the new, conscientious, and responsible things because publicity is the task of the newspaper, and we feel even more honored to contribute to the power of publicity for good things, and hope to produce more things that can be publicized.

### "Era" Theatre Troupe's Recent Work

— Huang Yun

——Grand public performance to be held from the 10th of this month——

Since the start of the War of Resistance, Hong Kong's drama movement, through the hard work of general drama workers and influenced by foreign drama troupes, seems to have gradually embarked on a path of development. The performance achievements of the past year can be regarded as the prelude to the future development of the Hong Kong drama movement.

The beginning of 1939 has been formed by the second public performance of the 'China Art Troupe' and the joint grand public performance of amateur youth drama troupes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The atmosphere of the Hong Kong theater scene in 1939 is tense. Various theater troupes are also busy preparing for public performances, which is really a good phenomenon for the emerging art community.

The 'Era Theatre Troupe,' led by the famous dramatist Ouyang Yuqian and performing in Cantonese, is organized by Lu Dun, a former member of the local youth drama troupe. They have been able to work hard in the past, and their past achievements have also been very good. It is said that after the completion of the fifth performance of their first phase of work (regular public performance), Mr. Ouyang came to Hong Kong, so they planned the second phase of work again. Led by Ou Chongyuqian, they started rehearsing in February last year! Their first performance was held in Macau this January, and they performed for five consecutive days. It is said that the results were very good and the income was not small. Since they returned to Hong Kong, they have been preparing for a grand public performance in Hong Kong. Recently, I met a comrade from 'Era' who said that they have been rehearsing new plays day and night in the past few days, and they decided to perform at the Kowloon Popular Theatre for four consecutive days from the evening of the 10th of this month as the second phase of the ninth enlarged public performance. The plays performed in the four days are also different, and three of them are new plays, which they have recently rehearsed.

The play performed on the first day is Mr. Cao Yu's "Wilderness." This play is being performed in Hong Kong for the first time, and no other theater troupe has performed it in the past. Moreover, they adapted this script into a movie script last year called "Generations of Grievances," which is now a good script and is also being publicly performed recently. The characters performed this time are also the same as in "Generations of Grievances," and the directors are also Li Qing and Li Chenfeng. The performance results should not be weak, because they have been studying the script for more than a year.

The play on the second day is "Wilderness" in the afternoon and Cao Yu's "Sunrise" in the evening. This script has already been performed in Hong Kong by the "China Travel Troupe." However, it is still the first time to perform this play in Cantonese in Hong Kong, and it is also the first time for "Era" to perform this play. The director is Mr. Ouyang Yuqing, and he has also added the Southern actor Wu Chufan to participate in the performance.

The play on the third day is "Sunrise" in the afternoon and a very meaningful satirical comedy, "The New Official Takes Office," in the evening. This play was the most popular among the general audience when 'Era' performed it in Macau, and we introduced it in an article in the previous issue. It is said that this play is considered by the 'Era Theatre Troupe' to be their proud work. After Mr. Ouyang painstakingly rehearsed it for more than two days, it seems that this play is of course their best, right?

What will be performed on the fourth day is the 'Thunderstorm' that they have performed several times. The performance results in the past were not bad either. Perhaps it was because they wanted to complete the performance of Cao Yu's three complete works that they chose this play.

We admire the 'Era Theatre Troupe' for being able to continue to work hard in this spirit. However, we strongly hope that they will not only perform plays for the sake of drama but also perform more dramas for saving the nation, and perform drama for the sake of saving the nation. In particular, I hope that 'Era' will take on your responsibility as a sentinel and open up a new path for the Hong Kong drama movement in 1939.

Drama Movement Status

### Yu Jing's New Work - "Tears on Flowers" Being Rehearsed by the China Travel Theater Troupe

In the production of anti-Japanese war dramas, Yu Jing's works, whether in terms of quality or quantity, are quite abundant. The most famous, such as "Night Light Cup," has been widely rehearsed by theater troupes across the country, and has also been performed many times in Hong Kong. Everyone believes that the playwright's consciousness, technique, and rhetoric are all very well-rounded and superior.

"Tears on Flowers" is Yu Jing's latest work, published in Shanghai under the pseudonym "Gan Ling." The content depicts the suffering of dancers, exposes the causes of urban sins, and points out a proper path for young people. It is a fine work that suits the demands of the times and is suitable for performance.

Naturally, due to environmental constraints, some places are not fully written. As he himself reported in the preface: "In some places, I was too timid, and the language was not detailed enough, which is very unpleasant!" However, there is no way to avoid this. In addition to regretting for the comrades trapped in the "isolated island," we can only hope, as the author does, that "the time when we can speak in detail, painfully and happily, will not be far away!" The same wish!

It is said that after the China Travel Theater Troupe "separated" and was "reconstructed," it began to process and rehearse this brand-new "Tears on Flowers." It is heard that the head of the troupe and the director of the play, Huai Qiu, is quite confident in its performance, believing that Carl is well-organized and full of "gimmicks," and will definitely be more interesting than "Night Light Cup." In that case, it should be able to achieve better results.

After reading the script, the writer felt a strong interest and would like to make a simple report like this first.

The Newborn Iron Current Theater Troupe

Since the War of Resistance against Japan entered a brand-new second stage, it is reflected in the theater, a part of the salvation culture. In Hong Kong, there has also been a rapid development and an excellent work record. Recently, young theater workers in the Kowloon Peninsula have formed an "Iron Current Theater Troupe." It was born under the principle of integrating with "harmony and life," and being loyal to the War of Resistance. In the recruitment column of various newspapers these days, you can see the "Iron Current Theater Troupe's" advertisement for comrades, which fully demonstrates that their work is not closed, but attempts to widely gather all loyal theater workers to jointly create a brilliant theater movement. According to Jiu Jijiujiu, the head of the troupe, "Iron Current" has already started rehearsal work, and the plays scheduled to be performed in the near future are: "Long Live the Nation," "Women's Apartment," "Our Hometown," and "Sunrise."

### A Conspiracy to Destroy My Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

I. Talking about the Past and Two Premises

Since the National Army moved west, the Zhejiang area, which has been known as the center of China's silk industry, has successively fallen. At that time, due to the urgency of time and the lack of preparation by the authorities, many silk companies that should have been moved inland were left in the war zone. Among them, in addition to silk factory industries, the most important thing to mention is of course the silkworm seed manufacturing plant. We know that many of the silk brushes remaining in the war zone, under the threat of the Japanese and the flattery of several silk industry traitors, are already officially acting as slaves to the Japanese economy under the name of "cooperating with the China Central Silk Company." For example, silk factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou are now in operation, but this only shows that the oppression of the Japanese is increasing and the exploitation is deepening. What benefits have many traitors and scum ultimately obtained from the Japanese, whether in terms of , or in terms of reputation, I am afraid no one can say. We can understand this even more from the various harsh conditions and painful experiences of the silk factories in Wuxi after the so-called "cooperation." However, during the past year, the species circles in the war zone have been busy making the "China Central Company" because the Japanese are constantly busy. [Unfinished]

### Today's Special Silver Plate Game Eastern and Southern China Re-settle the Disaster Relief Account The First Final of Group C is Held at the Kowloon Venue

[Report from This Newspaper] Sanyang is biased against Zhao Tai, and one Qi is opening up Yin. Today, on the one hand, we welcome the arrival of the Spring Festival, and on the other hand, we sigh at the easy passage of time. As the poem says, "Willow colors are tied to restrain the beautiful time, and then plant two rows towards the riverbank." Can young people in general not feel something after reading these two sentences?

However, since our country implemented a long-term war of resistance against Japan, we are absolutely confident in winning the final victory, because "time is the enemy of Japan." The more we endure during the War of Resistance, the closer the collapse of the invaders is. Therefore, in the sorrow of the passage of time, I find a little comfort instead.

The Spring Festival is a good time, and the unlimited scenery, the national soccer team, is just right to take advantage of the time to have fun. In today's soccer events, there is a special silver plate game, and there are leagues, all of which are very important and not trivial. I believe the performances in each game will definitely be pleasing to the eye.

The Silver Plate is Eastern against Southern China. This soccer debt, because it was not settled in the previous calculation, resulted in the battle to determine the winner again today. Moreover, the result of the battle is who will be eliminated.

I remember in the previous match, Southern China scored two goals first, taking the lead. Unexpectedly, Lin Depu was injured and unable to walk, and he lost the pillar of the river. The battle situation changed accordingly. Eastern took the opportunity to recover the lost ground and tied the score at 2-2, creating a war situation with no conclusion. At that time, the two teams were too eager to win, and the performance was out of shape, leaving a very deep impression on people. I hope that today, the players of both teams will adhere to the spirit of sports, and not have the excessive behavior of that time. It is very fortunate.

Today, Eastern will still field the same lineup as the one that defeated Southern China last time. As for Southern China, there are slight changes. Lin Depu, who was injured in the previous battle against Eastern, has not fully recovered and will be replaced by Yang Genbao as the center. Also, Qu Shie will replace Li Shuoyou, who was penalized in the previous battle against Eastern. Therefore, the entire lineup is not as perfect as the last time.

Regarding the issue of winning or losing, I do not want to make a conclusion in advance, because both are Chinese teams. No matter who wins, they are treated equally. The goal is to develop pure technology to win. This is good ability. A victory that is not moral is not worth taking.

The league between and Scott is also very important, but it is not known whether Scott's performance will be like last time. If they take one point from each army again, Southern China will indirectly benefit from it. The battle between Guanghua and St. Joseph is also a battle of equal strength.

The first final of Group C will be held at the Kowloon venue today, which is quite important. It is a battle between the Aircraft Team and the Scott Team, which is also a very stimulating war.

### Southern China Cannot Settle Clearly Due to the Authorities' Order, Still No Winner After Re-battle, Southern China Wins First Liao Yachen Sends a Life-saving Soup

[Report from This Newspaper] Southern China's game against Kowloon Society's special silver plate soccer game was re-battled yesterday, and another draw was achieved. After fighting each other twice, there was no conclusion. It was really a muddled account.

Judging from the lineup of Southern China yesterday, it can be considered complete. Zheng Longxiang, who replaced Liu Qingcai, was always working hard and did not show any flaws. The most abnormal person was Luo Douwen, who lost opportunities frequently, ran weakly, and passed inaccurately. Guo Yingqi's dribbling was robbed, cutting off the traffic on the left. However, Yingqi still worked hard, and the performance was slightly better than the one last week. Since Douwen did not have a good foot, he made Deng Guangsen on the right wing transport alone, panting and sweating. This kind of deformed attack greatly affected the chance of winning the ball. Carefully observing the reasons why Southern China failed to win, it is not entirely due to the deformed development of the front. The only weakness is that the forwards have no grasp of shooting. It is said that the greatest opportunity to penetrate and take it has been two or three times, but both Li Zhaorong and Guo Yingqi missed it. As for long shots, none were seen in the entire game. The responsibility of being a forward is to break the enemy's goal. If they do not learn shooting skills, it is useless to just focus on developing transportation skills. I believe that Southern China has hopes in this competition and the league. For the sake of great achievements, their front line will not be successful without Li Hui coming back. If the does not allow force, then their original should work hard to practice shooting, otherwise the future is dangerous.

Liang Rong , who is in the center, is getting better and better. The backbone of the whole team is thus supporting effectively, which is gratifying.

Yesterday, Kowloon initially used Bell, the former Shanghai inter-port representative, as the center , but there was no wonderful performance. Although this gentleman is young and energetic, he has not mastered the skills that a forward should have. The head went to work, which was lacking. Dribbling skills were rarely seen. There was no way to break through the center. The writer believes that Bell's footwork is purely a midfielder style , and it is not normal to be a forward .

Kowloon was able to draw entirely due to Helly's human-saving skills. In the 23rd minute of the second half, was inspired by Rong's wonderful pass and shot a corner kick from the front of the goal (about three feet high). The audience thought it was a sure win, but Helly twisted his long waist, leaped and pounced, saving the dangerous ball. The posture was wonderful. If Southern China had benefited from this ball, it would have been able to maintain the victory.

Referee Ge Ximing blew his whistle, and the battle broke out. Kowloon attacked first, deeply and not by hand. The five forwards were very active. In five minutes, they forced two corner kicks, and the audience was alarmed. When the battle reached ten minutes, Southern China suddenly broke out and began to counterattack. Douwen forced a corner kick. After kicking it out, Helly pounced to seize the danger, but was blocked by the Southern China forward. He lost the and fell, and Guangsen happened to be standing in an empty space, greeted the ball, and shot towards the empty goal, stopping in the red heart. He couldn't turn back and lost a goal first, 1-0, Southern China took the lead. After a while, Jingxiang and Zhaorong advanced together, and Guangsen forced a corner kick. After kicking it out, Yingqi jumped up and headed it, but was caught by He. In the 25th minute, Feng Shen legs, in the chaotic army, even passed the defenders and handed it to Yingqi to shoot, but the ball was powerless and was once again caught by's wonderful hand. The horn of the half-time sounded.

Changing sides to fight again, Bellis made a cold shot in the ninth minute, almost hitting the target. In the twelfth minute, Douwen passed a ball, but Zhaorong was not in a good position, and the ball slipped from the instep of his foot , He saved it, missing a chance to win. In the fifteenth minute, Kowloon attacked, and the momentum was turbulent. Bell seized the opportunity to shoot , and in the midst of the crowd, the ball rebounded, and Liao Yachen stepped forward to snatch the shot, hitting the target, tying the score 1-1. In the 23rd minute, Yingqi got the pass from Fei Rong and showed his power in front of the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow , but it was saved by Helly , and there was a sigh. After playing for 70 minutes, the two teams were still tied. The extra 20 minutes, in turn, was the winner. The members were all tired , and there was no gain. The third confrontation will be the next victory . The battle lines of both sides yesterday are as follows.

### Shanghai Student Tennis Team Wins First Victory: Doubles and Singles All Win Against Hong Kong University; Today's Match Against South China Team at the Hong Kong Cricket Club

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Student Tennis Team has been in Hong Kong for several days. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, they faced the Hong Kong University team for the first time at the HKU Sports Ground. The competition consisted of three singles and two doubles matches. The fierce battle lasted until around 6 PM, and the result was that all five matches were won by the student team. A brief account of each match is given below:

First Singles

Shanghai's Tang Baojia versus HKU's Wang Jinxi. Tang is this year's Shanghai Chinese singles champion, with extraordinary strength and excellent skills. Wang is the top player at HKU, skillful but ultimately not a match for Tang. After the start, Wang only managed to win the first game of his serve, after which Tang won five consecutive games, then added one more, making it five to two. Tang then won the first set with six to two. In the second set, Tang, riding the momentum of winning the first set, won the first two games. Wang struggled to catch up, tying the score at two all. At this point, Tang showed no mercy, unleashing powerful shots and winning six consecutive games, securing the second set with two to zero. It only took half an hour.

Tang Baojia Six-Two Six-Two Wang Jinxi

Second Singles

Shanghai's Li Guopan versus HKU's Ma Chaozhuang. Li is also a well-known Shanghai Chinese player, often compared to Tang Baojia. Yesterday, Li was not accustomed to the ground, so he was unable to fully demonstrate his strength. In the first set, HKU's Ma Chaozhuang seized it with six to four. At the start of the second set, Ma won the first game, and Li made it two to zero. Ma tied it at two all. Li suddenly unleashed his power, winning four consecutive games to reclaim the set with six to two. The third set was the final decider. After the start, Li continued to lead, with Ma chasing closely, from two all to four all to five to four, with Li taking the lead by one game. Ma then caught up to tie it at five all. Li seized the opportunity to win the next two games, ultimately winning the final set with seven to five.

Li Guopan Four-Six Six-Two Seven-Five Ma Chaozhuang

Third Singles

Shanghai's Wei Zhenxing versus HKU's Wang Xianbi. The skills of both players were comparable, and the match was very close. In the first set, both players won based on their serves. Wei took the lead and won the set seven to five. The second set was equally close, with multiple ties. At four all, Wei intensified his pressure, cleverly winning the set six to four. In the final set, Wang appeared slightly fatigued, while Wei became increasingly courageous, leading all the way and securing the victory with six to four.

Wei Zhenxing Five-Seven Six-Four Six-Four Wang Xianbi

First Doubles

Shanghai's Tang Baojia and Li Guopan versus HKU's Wang Jinxi and Ma Chaozhuang. The match was hard-fought. In the first set, after a grueling eighteen games, Tang and Li narrowly won with ten to eight. In the second set, Tang and Li were slightly careless, allowing Wang and Ma to tie the match with six to three. At the start of the third set, both sides were exhausted and struggled to cope. Tang and Li ultimately prevailed due to their superior skill and physical strength, completing the match with six to three.

Tang Baojia Li Guopan Ten-Eight Three-Six Six-Three Wang Jinxi Ma Chaozhuang

Second Doubles

Shanghai's Wei Zhenxing and Cai Guoji versus HKU's Wang Xianbi and Lin Jun. After the start, HKU's Wang and Lin had strong momentum and won the first few games. Wei and Cai worked hard to catch up and tied the score. The HKU team then made it four to two, but Wei and Cai accelerated their efforts, winning the first set with six to four. In the second set, Wang and Lin once again took the lead, initially leading four to zero. Wei and Cai then tied the score at four all. From then on, the two sides battled fiercely, four to four, five to five, six to five, all the way to eight all. Finally, Wei and Cai won two consecutive games to win with ten to eight.

Today's Schedule

The Shanghai student team is scheduled to play the South China Athletic Association team today at 2:30 PM at the South China Athletic Association tennis court at King's Park.

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment—The Rich Girl's Secret

There Goes My Heart

Is an American comedy film. The story and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and winning techniques have created a lot of fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The crazy and humorous plot also has a great power to attract people.

The film depicts the escape of a naive and freedom-loving rich girl, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.

Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not very good comedians. They didn't achieve much in the film, and their performances were mediocre. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful, and has a very good performance. She is a cute clown. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous saleswoman, which is her second performance since returning to the screen, and the results are not bad.

Queen's Weekly Screening……

Peace……Sixty Glorious Years

Sixty Glorious Years

This film also depicts the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her sixty years in power. In order to be solemn and true, it was filmed by the British Royal Company, but it is somewhat colored by propaganda of British Queen's history.

Because the material is particularly rich, and those materials are all treasures, and cannot be discarded or deleted, under this situation, the director is not easy to please and handle properly. This film has made this mistake. Except for the first half of the play that describes the Queen's life after marriage, which is slightly lively and vivid, the second half is simply a fragmented history, used as an institutional introduction. It cannot be blamed on the director's skills.

The whole play has several very excellent scenes, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the charge of the British Royal Army, the Queen's Jubilee celebration, and her visit to her old palace maids, which are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there is not much change from the previous "Queen Victoria". Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, gives an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Walbrook, who plays Prince Albert, is also very good.

Oriental……And That Certain Age

That Certain Age

What is depicted here is a precocious girl who falls in love with a reporter twice her age. He didn't know it at first, and after discovering it, he tried his best to make her give up, but it didn't work. In the end, another woman came to the rescue.

Undoubtedly, Deanna Durbin is even more beautiful in this film. Not only is her performance delicate and lively, but she also has made significant progress. Melvyn Douglas, the male lead, is very competent, like Mabel Hersch in "Merry Go Round". Jackie Cooper still reveals a naive acting skill.

The four new songs inside are also very beautiful.

Great China……Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

The second to last comedy film of the old Laurel and Hardy era. The story tells the story of two ice cream vendors (Laurel and Hardy). Once they went to Switzerland to do business. The two self-righteous fools made a lot of jokes. Some places are indeed lacking, but it is precisely because it is a comedy.

There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing is very good. The performances of the two ice cream vendors are the same as always.

New World……Modern Woman Seeking Husband

Cantonese Film

It is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking Husband". The plot tells the story of a millionaire with millions of assets, who is extremely stingy. He is unwilling to contribute a penny to all public welfare undertakings, and even tries to take advantage of others. At this time, because all sectors launched fundraising to establish a Chinese industry, they wanted to ask him for help. However, not only did he not take out a penny, but he even grabbed a few snacks at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised this "Modern Woman Seeking Husband" plan to trick him and then use female beauty to lure him.

The main performers are the stage stars Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanqing. It is also a family business of the film company.

The director's technique is quite clear.

Central……Black Shirt Team

Cantonese Film

What is shown in this film is the two disparate classes in society, on the one hand, the hard-working masses of women, on the other hand, some idle class pretentious and lewd masters and young masters, but the director's depiction of each plot is inevitably too much to achieve the goal of "fragrant" and ignores the reality of the performance, but also for the sake of too much "sensual", the film is full of low-level vulgar, flirtatious nonsense,

The plot depicts a weak woman whose husband goes abroad to make a living, and her family is bad, forcing her to work as a maid, and suffering all kinds of insults and oppressions, and when her husband returns home, all kinds of misunderstandings occur.

Half of the plot is loose, and most of it is performed in the form of opera, trying to cover up the emptiness of the content, and the director's technique is not refined enough, but the heroine Huang Manli's outstanding performance in this film cannot be buried and is worth reading.

### Overexertion and its Prevention

— Wang Xuezheng

(A) Heart racing, dizziness,

(B) Difficulty breathing or panting,

(C) Trembling in the body or limbs,

(D) Stinging pain in the chest or ribs,

These situations are all signs of excessive exertion. If you continue to force yourself, it can cause harm due to overexertion.

Although the methods for remedying overexertion are very simple, it is always easier to prevent than to remedy. Moreover, it is too late when you need to remedy it, and our body has already suffered considerable harm.

The methods to prevent overexertion are listed below:

(1) When exercising, limit yourself to 60% to 75% of your full strength. However, this only refers to regular practice. During competitions or approximately every two weeks, you can exercise with full strength once.

(2) Do not force yourself to exercise when you are not feeling well.

(3) The exercise time and exercise procedure should have certain regulations.

(4) The posture should be correct and the movements should be thorough when exercising. If the exercise is too strenuous, it will affect the posture and movements.

(5) Do not hold your breath while exercising.

(6) People suffering from neurasthenia, heart disease, anemia, insomnia, indigestion, constipation, and other symptoms should not do strenuous exercise, or must completely stop exercising.

In addition to rest and correcting exercise errors, deep breathing exercises and water baths or hot water baths are also very effective for remedies. Deep breathing exercises can both inhale a large amount of fresh air and completely expel "acid gas", making the blood clean and the circulatory function normal and active, so that the heart and other major organs become strong and our body is easier to recover. Warm water or hot water baths can relax the body and are very helpful for people suffering from insomnia and anemia. However, hot water baths should not be excessive, otherwise the body will be weaker. Cold water baths have a great stimulating effect on the body and cause a great reaction, so they are very unsuitable for people with weak bodies. In addition, relaxation exercises (Relaxation Exercises) are also very beneficial for those suffering from overexertion. In short, the main way to remedy overexertion is to strengthen the heart and nervous system and make circulatory breathing, digestion, and other functions normal and active. (To be continued)

### On Overcoming Work

Youqiu

In an era of revolution, an era of progress, on one hand, the revolutionary ranks advance valiantly; on the other hand, "the dregs rise up." This dawn of a new era, the torch of truth has not yet illuminated everything, and some people will lack their due awareness, even among the revolutionary ranks. "People will always desert, flee, become decadent, or betray." (Lu Xun). It is certain that in the general flow of progress, there will inevitably be remnants of regression and darkness, and in a particular department, there may even be a shrinkage, a reversal. However, this is an unbreakable truth: all things always follow "the infinite process from the lower to the higher," "before which nothing can resist"; "although there are sometimes superficial coincidences and temporary regressions, in the final analysis, it still develops forward," these are Engels' words.

The question is whether this "regression" will affect the upward movement? Undoubtedly, it will delay this movement. When we return to the realistic subject of the War of Resistance, it is even clearer that the "regression" in each sub-department not only affects itself but also affects the progress of the overall movement of the War of Resistance, causing it to be more or less delayed.

The question is how should this "regression" be overcome? Reality urgently demands this overcoming. When we carefully examine it, through the appearance of "regression," we will inevitably discover the driving force for forward development. To discover the upward quality and to defeat the regressing quantity, a process of "qualitative change" must be created. Here, I want to emphasize the significance of overcoming work. "Upward" and "regressing" are opposing and competing processes. We can break the basis of "regression" and seize its base, building new structures on the ruins. Only by overcoming it through work can we enable the "dregs" to lose their weapons and sink back into the riverbed of time. Only then can we enable those who lack awareness to gain their new life!

The above is a general exploration. Let us take reality to analyze. In the various departments of art, literature, music, drama, film, etc., there is a specific new quality of upward movement. However, we can easily find a phenomenon of regression in the film industry. As Mr. Cai Chusheng pointed out: "Except for the China Film Production Studio of the government and the Central Film Studio, which are bravely shouldering glorious tasks, the film culture movement, which was booming for a while, has all entered the path of destruction, regardless of the north or south." Everyone can feel this. However, we should analyze this "regression" phenomenon. We can only admit that it is "superficial, temporary, and accidental." The film culture movement has a new quality of forward development. The progressive films after the January 28th Incident were due to the competition and struggle of work that pushed back the regressive films of gods, monsters, and chivalry; however, for the drastic change of the War of Resistance, the films of gods, monsters, and chivalry used folk stories to revive themselves, doing the "regression," and the progressive films shrank back due to the objective environment. To overcome this "regression," we still have to restore the previous work competition and struggle! This means striving for the audience, cultivating the audience's correct discernment of beauty and ugliness, so as to shatter the foundation on which the dregs stand and enable the unconscious to accept the lessons of reality and awaken "self-criticism." Overthrowing toxic films, of course, starts from criticism, but needs to be completed by producing progressive films! This overcoming of work is just explaining "the unity of theory and practice."

### Talking About "Good Reportage"

— Qin Lao

Several years ago, some critics once advocated that writers could fire a gun in one hand and write a novel in the other. But later, it turned out that there were no such geniuses, which proved that it was just critics dreaming. Naturally, there were writers who wrote poems on horseback in legends, but writing poems is possible, writing novels is impossible, and even the poems written would not be "great" poems. The reason is very simple: novels most need "artistic description," and writers who really want to do the work of "writing" need to have some factual conditions.

Barbusse's "Under Fire" was not written during the Great War; Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" was not written during the Great War. Taking the current Spanish War as an example, the writers who have always stayed in Spain have not seen the writing of "No Pasaran" that kind of "reportage masterpiece." Dutch famous writer Jef Last went to Spain to participate in the war, but only wrote a few letters—naturally, that can be said to be "good reportage," but it is not "No Pasaran" that kind of "reportage masterpiece."

Even if it is not "great" reportage, it still has to go through the two ladders of general writing: First, there must be a reportage material: currently, the materials are naturally everywhere, but what is lacking is a little time to sit down and write a piece of literature, in other words, a little time to "write straight with a pen." If literature can be written without a little time to sit down, then that is truly a "mysterious thing." There are some writers who now live in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and they may have time to write with peace of mind, but they are, after all, a minority, and not all of them have always specialized in "writing literature." In my opinion, a literary writer who has "honestly participated in the war for eighteen months" will certainly have inexhaustible materials, but the time to sit down must be very short.

I am not saying that the current reportage should be like a running account, lacking artistic description and lacking the power to move people. I am just saying that we should not be too strict with the writers who are running on the front lines of the struggle. It is naturally best to have a "reportage masterpiece" like "No Pasaran," but if not, as long as there are true letters, true chronicles, as long as they still use literary techniques, and are not considered bad works, then it is okay to temporarily recognize them as passable reportage. Those works that are vivid and colorful, that are "brilliant," are naturally also the best. But here, however, old writers are often unwilling to go to the front lines like them, there is a factual problem. Most of those who have participated in the war for eighteen months are young writers, so their techniques are probably inevitably worse. Or because they want to prepare for future "masterpieces," they are unwilling to write those letters and chronicles, which is something that cannot be helped, so we can only temporarily satisfy ourselves with those works that are not "vivid and colorful" and not "brilliant." In other words, but this is only temporary: those writers will soon use their moving lives to transform their "stories" under their "pen tips" into "vivid and colorful" and "brilliant."

Therefore, I think that if you "cannot help but feel a little ashamed" because you "simply see very little good reportage," then it should not be "ashamed" for general writers in general, but should be "ashamed" for a few backward writers (here, let me leave a word in advance to answer other counter-questions: if I am also a writer, I admit that I am also one who cannot be let go).

As for saying that there are too many "generals' interview notes, etc.," I think that is a true statement. Taking a photo with a general, asking the general to inscribe a word or a poem, and then also writing a poem yourself. Re-producing it carefully with copperplate is ultimately irrelevant to reportage. "Interviews" are naturally important. But I think it is best to interview the soldiers more. From the soldiers' surroundings, we can certainly get more important materials, and those materials will certainly enable the interviewer to write "good reportage," although it is not necessarily "great reportage."

### Crossing the Wo River

— Li Qiao

——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou——

In the sky, a few stars were scattered sparsely. A crescent moon rose from behind the trees, casting a mercury-like radiance over the ground. The wheat seedlings had lost their tenderness and vitality, lying still in the fields. Treading on the tree shadows, which looked like light ink stains on the road, the队伍 moved silently and quickly forward. In the distant villages, there were occasional barks of dogs, as if "bandits" had passed through there.

With a tense heart, always ready for a bloody battle, I followed excitedly, unaware of when we had safely passed the small villages scattered along the road where it was said that "bandits" were lying in ambush.

The next morning, as the sun emerged with golden rays, the队伍 reached the Xin Ting road. To prevent "bandits'" tanks from rushing in, the road had been dug up section by section. At this time, several civilians, hearing that our队伍 was going to take this road, were voluntarily filling the dug-up pits with earth.

Moved by this rare enthusiasm, Commander Zhang took out thirty dollars and handed it to them:

"You have worked hard. Take this small amount of money and buy something to eat."

"You are helping us fight the bandits, how can we take your money?" The civilians, gripping their hoes, declined with smiles.

"Don't be polite," Commander Zhang put the money in the hand of an old man. "Hurry up and dig, our heavy artillery will be coming soon."

"Yes, yes." The civilians nodded and raised their hoes to dig.

Not far from those civilians, one or two vendors were selling things like cigarettes by the roadside. At this time, the brothers who had withdrawn from southern Shandong, having not seen a civilian selling anything for a long time, seemed to have found some treasure, and they surrounded them layer upon layer, competing to buy. The rare excitement would probably surprise even the cigarette vendor!

Climbing over Longshan, which lay abruptly in the fields, we arrived at Longshan Town. The civilians standing by the street looked at us with frightened faces, as if asking if we were "bandits."

"Folks, don't be afraid! We are here to fight the bandits."

"Oh, you've worked hard!" A middle-aged man turned his head and shouted to his family: "Don't be afraid, they are our troops, here to fight the bandits for us, quickly bring tea!"

"No need for tea, folks, just give us some cold water to drink!"

"Okay, bring out a bucket of cold water!"

Two tightly closed doors were opened, and a little girl came out carrying a bucket of cold water. Then, this family and that family also opened their doors, fetching water to comfort us.

Just as I was sitting in front of a house drinking water, suddenly, a "bandit" plane flew over and circled above. The people and horses standing on the street quickly hid in the houses. The "bandit" plane strafed with machine guns for a while, and then flew away on its own without any result.

After resting for a while in Longshan Town, in the scorching sun, the队伍 set off again. There was no wind at all, and people were sweating profusely, even their clothes were soaked with sweat.

Dragging my feet, which were blistered and oozing yellow fluid, I struggled to walk on the terribly hot highway, longing to finally satisfy my hunger of more than ten days when we reached the Wo River. But upon reaching Woyang, tens of thousands of houses had been bombed into scorched earth by "bandit" planes. Some houses were still smoldering with residual smoke. The scene was filled with ruins and broken wood that made people want to weep, and there wasn't a single civilian to be seen. Oh, what shall we use to repay our "bandits" for this great destructive achievement?

Suddenly, machine gun fire rang out from behind. No need to be told: the brothers behind us must have come into contact with the "bandits" again.

The people who had just arrived at the Wo River jumped into the turbid Wo River one after another, soaking their clothes in the water, wading across the river, and quickly dispersing into the trench on the high ground outside the city...

Strangely, the gunfire suddenly subsided again.

### The Enchanted Forest

— Zou Xiao

——Talking about Ethnic Novels

"The Enchanted Forest" was written by Li Baichuan of the Qing Dynasty. There is an old manuscript copy kept in the Yenching University Library, with the author's own preface. Other versions only have the Tao preface of the twenty-ninth year of Qianlong and the Hou preface of the thirty-sixth year of Qianlong. Now it is only known that Baichuan was from Jiangnan, but his name is unknown. (See Sun Kaidi's Bibliography of Popular Novels, page 249)

Chapters 54 to 59, these six chapters, are about suppressing bandits in Zhejiang. Historical figures include Yu Dayou, Lin Run, Zhang Jing, Yan Song, Zhao Wenhua, Hu Zongxian, Hai Rui, etc. Fictional characters also include Zhu Wenwei, Lin Dai, etc. About one part of the characters are true and five parts are false. The truthful parts are mostly specifically pointed out in the book. For example, Hai Rui's memorial to the emperor can be found in Ming History, Volume 226. Chapter 56, which describes Wenhua presenting wine, is based on Ming History, Volume 308, the biography of Zhao Wenhua: "Wenhua wanted to win the emperor's favor and presented Hundred Flower Immortal Wine. He falsely said: 'Your minister shuai Song took it and gained longevity.' The emperor drank it and found it sweet, and softly asked Song. Song secretly said: 'How could Wenhua have done this?' He then indirectly reported: 'Your minister has never been fond of medicine. How could this old horse know why?' Song hated Wenhua for not telling him first, summoned him to his place and scolded him. Wenhua knelt and wept, not daring to get up for a long time. Xu Jie and Li Ben saw this and mediated, and then let him leave. When Song returned from his leave, the nine ministers came to pay their respects. Song was still angry at Wenhua and ordered his followers to drag him out. Wenhua was greatly embarrassed and bribed Song's wife to intercede for him. Wenhua immediately came out to pay his respects. Song then treated him as before."

The novel Xiaohua says: "In the book, the criticism of Hu Meilin is without reservation, I don't know what is meant by this? Although Meilin's achievements are not enough to be admired, his merits and demerits are enough to offset each other. Among the Jiedushi at the time, he cannot be said not to be outstanding, and it is not right to obliterate him with a single stroke." It is guessed that Hu Zongxian cooperated with Yan Song and was considered a member of the Yan faction. "The novel repeatedly criticizes him" is due to this. However, Hu Zongxian employed Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou, which can also be said to be knowing people and being good at employing them.

The chapter "Suppressing Bandits, the Three Marshals Achieve Great Deeds" is largely fictional. In this chapter, Lin Dai leads more than a hundred generals outside Jiangning City and kills the Yi leaders Miao Mei, Xu Hai, Wang Zhen, etc. in the midst of fifty to sixty thousand troops, which is obviously inconsistent with historical facts. The so-called three marshals refer to Yu Dayou, Lin Dai, and Zhu Wenwei. According to the biography of Yu Dayou in Ming History, "He defeated Zhou Yude's troops of thirty warships, the Nanjiang Metropolitan Commander." In this way, the governor Lu Fengyi, who guarded Nanjing, was also somewhat unreliable.

But the stories in these six chapters are generally correct. For example, Zhang Jing being wronged and Lin Run impeaching Yan Song are famous historical facts.

The book describes Zhao Wenhua bribing the bandits with six hundred thousand taels of gold, asking them to pretend to be defeated in order to claim credit, which can be said to be scolding this traitor severely. And the description of the three marshals eradicating the bandits is also extremely satisfying: "The officers and soldiers killed them scattered and disorganized. After running five or six miles, seeing that the soldiers were gradually far away, they each found the riverside, with only two or three seagoing ships. The bandits fought to cross, killing each other. The sound of weeping shook the heavens and the earth, but there were too many people for the boats, and many ships sank. Some bandits were starving and fell along the way, or those who could not move were all beheaded by the officers and soldiers, no less than four or five thousand people. At dawn, the pursuing soldiers arrived again and searched everywhere. As the bandits in the ships were trying to escape, they suddenly heard the river shaking, a thunderous cannon, the river was full of warships, and cannons and rockets rained down, and those who were hit by arrows and cannons were wounded and damaged, losing nine out of ten. When they arrived at Jiaoshan, they were shattered by Dayou's cannons, and not a single ship escaped in the waterway, nor a single person survived. Dayou had ambushes at the entrances of the seas, killing many escaped bandits." (Excerpt from Chapter 55) (This great defeat is no different from Cao Aman's great defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, which makes people excited.)
