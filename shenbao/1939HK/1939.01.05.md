### Analysis of the Japanese Coup and Its Trends

According to today's newspapers, the Konoe Cabinet, which had been struggling for days, finally submitted its resignation, and it is said that the Emperor has approved it. Minister of the Imperial Household, Yuasa, will visit Duke Saionji in Okitsu tonight. After returning to Tokyo at 9:00 PM, the successor to form the cabinet and the cabinet members can be determined. The question now is, will Konoe remain in office for another reshuffle? Or will someone else be chosen to form a new cabinet? There are varying speculations from all sides, but in our observation, Konoe may not do it again this time. Because the current problems are, firstly, to suppress political parties and parliament so that this year's huge budget and the National Mobilization Law Implementation Bill can be passed by parliament; and secondly, to bravely organize a new one-country, one-party party. Japan now objectively needs a more fascist government, but Konoe can no longer cope with this situation, and he is unwilling to serve as the leader of the new party. The fascist military no longer wants to use him, as can be seen from Suetsugu's strong demand that Konoe resolutely dissolve the parliament. However, the successor may not necessarily be Suetsugu, the leader of the fascists, to form a cabinet. The reasons are: (1) Suetsugu's sharp edge is too exposed, and his reputation is not enough; (2) Although Suetsugu is ostensibly the leader of the fascists, he is not supported by the elders, senior officials, and financial groups. Today's Japanese political situation still needs the coordination of financial, political, and military forces. In addition, although people speculate that Terauchi, Yuasa, and Minami and others may be the successors to the prime minister, they are even less qualified than Suetsugu. The more hopeful person is probably Hiranuma, because he has a higher reputation, and he has the support of the right-wing fascists in peacetime, and it is easier to exert influence in coordinating the military, political, and financial circles. As for the departure and retention of his cabinet members, according to my speculation, Ikeda, Suetsugu, Yonai, Kido and others may have to resign, while Itagaki, Arita, and Araki and others may return to power again. It can be asserted that the Japanese government will actively promote fascist rule to the extent possible under the conditions of coordinating the forces of various factions.

However, many problems lying before the Japanese government cannot be easily overcome.

Japanese Prime Minister Konoe is busy running around to senior officials, cabinet members, political parties, and financial groups, but in the end, he still cannot reconcile the internal conflicts of the cabinet, and still cannot avoid resigning en masse. His movements are worthy of our attention. At the moment when the 74th session of the Japanese Parliament is about to be convened, when Japan is embarking on the grand work of "reforming the Far East," especially in these days when Mr. Wang Jingwei's actions and remarks are bizarre, we should have an analysis of the serious situation of the Japanese political situation and the latent contradictions that follow. Here, we specifically analyze it to see the trend of the turbulent Japanese political situation in the future:

(1) The reorganization of the Japanese cabinet in the future can only change people but not strengthen its function, and it will only deepen the contradictions in the political circles. It seems impossible for the Japanese government to change and hope to have another major reinforcement as in May last year, because Japan's war of aggression against China has reached the "next stage," which is completely different from the previous situation. At this time, the internal contradictions in Japan are not only greatly complicated, but also various contradictions are gradually deepening to the point where they cannot be reconciled. For example, the contradiction between military expansion and financial contraction, the contradiction between monopolizing Chinese rights and interests and adjusting diplomacy, the contradiction between ending the war against China and disturbing the order in China, the contradiction between developing Chinese resources and the shortage of Japanese capital, and even the contradiction between wooing Germany and Italy and pleasing Britain and the United States, are the most serious problems at present.

(2) At present, the consciousness of the Japanese military and the national financial resources have embarked on the development of the "previous situation." Although Japanese Vice Minister of the Army, Tojo, demanded that military industry manufacturers double their efforts in production and declared that they were prepared to fight China and the Soviet Union at the same time, and Konoe's declaration on December 22 also stated: "The Japanese government has decided to continue its military operations in order to completely eliminate the anti-Japanese Kuomintang government," the prudent advocates of the Privy Council seriously questioned Konoe: "When will the war end? Where will it end?" Their worries and opposition to the continuation and expansion of the war are expressed in words. The financial community also responded to the warmongers with the trend of stock market crashes. Expanding the war requires more military spending. The general accounting of Japan's budget for the next year has increased a lot compared with this year. Calculated together with the military expenses for the invasion of China and the administrative expenses for the occupied territories, it is close to 10 billion yuan. At a time when the ability to digest public bonds has reached saturation and the import surplus has increased sharply, I do not know where Japan will seek such a huge source of financial resources. If Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law is seriously implemented, and even private property is requisitioned, this is not tolerated by capitalist society, and it is even less tolerated by the financial groups who sit high on the ruling chair. I don't know what magic Konoe has to regulate this contradiction? Completely sacrifice small and medium-sized industries to preserve large industries, especially military industry families? Japan's economic structure is bound to collapse completely.

(3) Judging from the recent situation in the Far East, Japan subjectively wants to monopolize China's rights and interests, but objectively Japan seems to have to adjust its diplomatic relations with various countries. Japan's arrogant declarations and attempts to monopolize China's rights and interests since the post-Guangdong-Hankou War have hit hard nails from Britain and the United States, and Britain and the United States have responded with practical measures to aid China and contain Japan. Therefore, Japan not only has calmed down the military operations in South China, but also Konoe's declaration on December 20, which comprehensively expressed Japan's current China policy, also reiterated his deceptive rhetoric, saying: "Regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Japan has no intention of monopolizing China's economic rights, and it does not want to ask China to restrict the economic interests of third countries," and so on. In terms of Japanese-Soviet relations, the Konoe government also feels helpless. Not only has the Japanese army's attempt to attack the northwest and cut off international transportation routes not made any progress, but it has also recently had to busy mobilizing a large army to go out and set up defenses. Not only has the so-called revision of the fishery treaty strongly proposed by the Soviet Union not been signed by the Soviet Union, but it has also been embarrassed by Litvinov's question about the anti-communist agreement challenging the Soviet Union, and had to sigh and say: Wait until next spring to negotiate! Sincerely and sincerely reconcile with Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union? The ambition to conquer China does not allow it, and the military does not agree. Is it possible to play "fire" with the above-mentioned countries, but it is strictly restricted by its strength. I don't know how the Japanese government will enable "military and financial authorities to work together with those responsible for diplomacy"?

(4) Japan's current policy towards China is to end the war and use means to disrupt China at the same time. On the one hand, it attempts to end the Sino-Japanese War, as reported by the Japanese newspapers that Konoe is running around to "terminate the process of the war against China as soon as possible." On the other hand, in its recent declaration, it stated that the Japanese government has decided to continue military operations. This is not surprising. The former refers to the Sino-Japanese War, and the latter is obviously drawing a cause for the Chinese civil war. Japan's conspiracy is to replace the Sino-Japanese War with the Chinese civil war (see, "Japan's Reply to Peace Advocates" in the February 6th issue of the newspaper). The reason why it is eager to put Wu Peifu forward is precisely for this reason. However, Japan's attempt has completely fallen into distress. If the Japanese army does not withdraw from Chinese territory, China's war of resistance against Japan will not end. The situation in China today is no longer comparable to what it was before. The common hatred of the enemy outweighs other desires, and Japan's attempt is not easy to achieve. Even if there are Wang Jingwei's crazy words and deeds recently, in fact, they still cannot affect the overall situation of China's war of resistance.

(5) Japan is currently concentrating on developing Chinese resources to remedy its own anemia. Even the warmonger Itagaki stated in a conversation after the Guangdong-Hankou War: "From now on, the policy in the occupied areas of China has changed from military firstism to security firstism." However, the first condition for developing resources is a huge amount of capital. Japan's own capital is not sufficient, and it is unwilling to allow Britain, the United States, and France to invest freely, so the development work is bound to hit a wall. The failure to decide on the development funds in Central China is a clear confirmation of this. The Japanese government may apply Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law to prohibit capital from investing in industrial sectors that the Japanese government considers non-urgent, and force financial institutions to invest in emergency projects. However, the opening of new enterprises in China is no more urgent than the relief of bankrupt enterprises in Japan. In recent months, has the issue of relief for small and medium-sized industries in Japan not become a major issue in the Japanese political arena? The Japanese government is preoccupied with one thing and loses sight of the other. I don't know how it will solve this contradiction?

(5) Since the "September 18th Incident," Japan's wooing of its two accomplices, Germany and Italy, has indeed been very rapid. Germany and Italy are also happy to collude, so from the Tripartite Anti-Communist Pact to the Cultural Agreement, and even the brewing military triangular alliance, German artillery was exchanged for soybeans in the three northeastern provinces. From Hitler's recognition of the puppet Manchuria to the Japanese recognition of Germany's trade privileges in North China. (According to the Osaka Mainichi on November 25) Italy is also following the same steps. The German newspapers even celebrated, saying: "Foreign trade with China should be completely changed, and the three countries of Japan, Germany and Italy should be in a controlling position, and the existing forces of various countries should be overthrown." The People's Observer, the organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party, even stated: "Tokyo has recently talked about Chinese iron ore, and all those under Japanese control can be jointly developed by Italy." Japan's temptation to Germany and Italy has been extremely strong, and Germany and Italy have also greatly supported Japan. Germany secretly disturbed Ukraine. The arrogance of Goebbels' speech, and even Italy's threat to France and its restraint on Britain, are all manifestations of the collusion and progress of the fascist group. However, this practice of Japan's conflicts with the need to ease Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union. If the Japanese aggressors do not have the determination to expand international adventures, as the Japanese anti-war writer Mr. Kajide said, "they may become tougher in the future, completely seal off the coast with the navy, cut off international highways with the army, and finally declare war on China" (see the newspapers on December 27), then the Japanese government will never be able to break this diplomatic deadlock. No matter whether Konoe gets back on his tongue or someone else forms a cabinet, this problem cannot be solved.

1939 has arrived, and the difficulties of the Japanese political situation are increasing year by year. The 74th session of the parliament is the first to lie in front of us. I don't know how the new Japanese government will overcome these heavy reefs?

Travel

### Traveling in Nanchang in the Dark Night

— Wang Fen

I never thought that our footprints would be left in Nanchang.

On that night in late autumn when the night wind gently swayed the sky full of stars, our family of refugees was carried by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to an unfamiliar city. This is Nanchang, this is a new city; the tall station stands before our eyes, and we stepped into this city for the first time, rejoicing on one side, but also inexplicably afraid. Rejoicing that we were able to safely get out of the car; but afraid, how are we going to live in this unfamiliar city? However, what made us more unbearable than joy and fear was fatigue! Although it only takes a day or two to travel from Tonglu, Zhejiang to Nanchang in normal times, we spent more than a week. If we dragged on the itinerary for half a sightseeing trip, it would of course be a very leisurely journey, but we were all anxious, starving and freezing. In the rapids of the Zheng River, we sat on a small boat, sweating profusely, watching the boatmen pull and support the poles in the rapids, and several times we were frightened and trembling, which was not timidity. This water trip was really too dangerous. At the Longyou train station, we sat for three nights, unable to catch a train, watching the trains rush by, all so-called passenger cars that were already crowded with wounded soldiers. Even if they stopped by the platform, we still had no way to hitch a ride. In this way, we actually stayed in a small thatched house for three nights. Good luck finally gave us a ride on the train on the fourth night, and on the train, we sat so miserably for another night, so when we arrived in Nanchang, we really couldn't bear the fatigue we had gained along the way.

As soon as we got off the train, the first thing we did was to find a hotel. However, dark alleys, unfamiliar roads, and such a late hour, where could we find one? I took the luggage out of the station, holding the smallest child, and called the family to get on the rickshaw, and let them pull us to wherever they wanted. After passing through a quiet field, we saw a neat avenue, and the first hotel sign that caught our eyes was "Hua Zhong". Okay, let's go in and ask. The accountant replied that there were no rooms, and said that all the hotels were already full. I began to worry again. Were we going to sleep on the streets? Although I heard that people who encountered this kind of disaster were everywhere, we had never encountered it. And we had old people and children, how could we bear to sleep on the streets? A shiver ran through my body, and I couldn't help but tremble slightly. Looking at the old people and children piled up with luggage and everything in the car outside the door, I couldn't help but plead pitifully with the short and fat accountant. The accountant understood my background, and unexpectedly helped me find a small room. It was a room they occupied themselves, and it was never rented out. Now, they only charged me a very low rent to let us stay here. We were really grateful for this friendship. I didn't have time to look at the room, and hurriedly ran outside to call them to get off the car, and deposited the luggage in the storage room next to the accounting room. I excitedly supported the old and carried the young, and followed the hotel clerk through the narrow room, not caring about the narrowness, and not waiting for the beds to be enough, I opened two quilts and spread them out. The children had not washed their faces, and were already snoring and falling asleep, uttering not very clear dreams.

That night, we all slept very sweetly, without looking back on the past, or looking forward to the future, just sleeping sweetly; because the fatigue of the past few days had really tormented us enough.

### Navigation Conference Held in Jinhua. Maritime Transport in Eastern Zhejiang Will Be Effectively Adjusted. Direct Shipping Between Shanghai and Ningbo Has Been Wired to the Military Commission for Approval. 34 Ships Approved to Navigate the Ou River. Haimeda, Tangbei, Tangsai Shanghai-Ningbo Intermodal Transport

[Shanghai Correspondence] The Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group convened a navigation conference to adjust maritime transport in eastern Zhejiang. The case ended on the 28th. The results of the meeting will be announced within days. There is also talk of hope for the resumption of direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo. After re-registration, ships sailing in Wenzhou have been approved by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command. The province of Zhejiang will moderately allow the export of tung oil and tea. The details are as follows:

Navigation Conference Ends Successfully

The headquarters of the Tenth Army Group convened a navigation conference in Jinhua on the 27th to effectively adjust maritime transport in eastern Zhejiang, inviting the military chiefs in charge and relevant parties to participate in the discussion. Yesterday at 6 p.m., the shipping department of Lihe Foreign Firm in this city received a telegram from Ningbo reporting that the Jinhua navigation conference ended on the 28th. Mr. Shi, the representative of the Ningbo Shipping Industry Association, and Zhang Guilin, the deputy commander of the Ningbo Garrison, returned to Ningbo after the meeting. The results of the meeting were quite satisfactory. A detailed discussion has been held on the shipping in eastern Zhejiang, and the detailed measures will be announced within days.

Shanghai-Ningbo Can Be Expected to Resume Direct Shipping

The reporters of the Modern News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the direct shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo has been banned by order of the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group. All parties have repeatedly telegraphed to request its opening, but it has not been approved due to the orders of the Military Commission. The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai and relevant parties believe that the Yong River is now an important port for the import and export of local products from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces. If it is closed for a long time, it will have a profound impact on the sales of local products and the rural economy. Therefore, they have re-stated their reasons and telegraphed to the Military Commission and the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group, requesting approval for its resumption. It is now learned that the case has been discussed in detail at the Jinhua navigation conference, and opinions have been signed and submitted to the Military Commission for approval. It is likely that it will be possible to resume it.

34 Ships Approved to Navigate the Ou River

Yesterday, the Shanghai shipping companies received a notice from the Wenzhou Shipping Industry Association, which stated that according to the instructions of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command, the ship registration forms previously submitted by the association have been reviewed and approved for registration. The approved ships include Bo, Deping, Anping, Anna, Hailong, Peile, Baoli, Moufu, Haiyang, Haicheng, Heguang, Niuzhuang, Lisheng, Baobei, Shifei, Sheng Luosha, Sanma, Chongqing, Dade, Minhe, Feiyun, Meifa, Meida, Fade, Wanguo, Xinde, Kangshayi, Tanglu, Tangsai, Zhiduo, Keleming, Shenganna, Luqin, and Hailer, a total of 34 ships. In addition to the registration forms, they are stored and forwarded separately. Please inform them accordingly.

Unapproved Ships Are Strictly Prohibited from Sailing

The re-registration of these ships was instructed by this headquarters in the instruction No. 292, dated December 2. The registration period is from December 3 to December 23. The registration period has now expired. All ships that have not been approved for registration this time are not allowed to enter or exit. However, ships that were registered in the previous registration but have not been approved this time, and are in transit or have been imported, are allowed to enter and exit once to be consistent with the facts. Please instruct all shipping companies to comply with this order. In addition to notifying them separately, this order is jointly issued to the manager for notification. The reporter learned that the above-mentioned 34 ships include those sailing in the inner harbor.

Zhejiang Province Moderately Permits the Export of Tea, Tung Oil, and Tea are the main export products of our country. Every year, the sales to foreign countries account for the top spot in foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, tung oil has been an important raw material for military use, so the military authorities in Zhejiang Province have prohibited its export. The transportation and sales of tea leaves also require the purchase of foreign exchange before they can be shipped to Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to the authorities in Zhejiang Province, requesting them to moderately allow the export of tung oil and tea under the principle of not hindering military affairs. Zhejiang Province has ordered the Trade Adjustment Office to handle the matter in accordance with the Ministry's intentions.

Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Intermodal Transport is Implemented Again. After Shanghai South prohibited direct shipping, a certain Bao ship of the American Huamei Company, which runs the Taizhou-Ningbo line, and the Tangbei ship of the same company, which runs the Shanghai-Taizhou line, handle passenger and cargo intermodal transport. The unified cabin fare is 8 yuan, the room cabin fare is 16 yuan, and the official cabin fare is 20 yuan. The Meda ship of the Portuguese American Company, which runs the Taizhou-Ningbo line, and the Haifu ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm, which runs the Shanghai-Taizhou line, handle passenger and cargo intermodal transport. The unified cabin fare is 8 yuan, the bunk is 12 yuan, and the room cabin fare is 16 yuan. The Shanghai-Ningbo intermodal transport has begun to be sold.

A Pilot Office is Established in Langzhou

In view of the fact that Wenzhou is at the forefront of national defense, and in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the blockade and maintain sea traffic during the blockade, the Wenzhou Garrison Commander specially organized the Wenzhou Pilot Office to handle pilot affairs in this port. In the future, ships entering and leaving the port must report to the office for guidance before they are allowed to sail. Weng Jiqing has now been appointed as the director of the office. The office is located at No. 20 Siying Lane, Wenzhou, and the branch office is located at Yueqing Huaguan. As for the pilots, they will be selected from among those who have held important positions in navigation in accordance with the promulgated pilot examination regulations, in order to show fairness and solemnity. The office has been officially established.

Large Ships with "Ding" Not Approved Yet

The Nana, Shantay, Haifu, Tangbei, and Gaodeng ships that sail the Shanghai-Taiwan line, and the Meifa ship that sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and Wandinghai, have not been approved for resumption of sailing since the Ningbo City Defense Commander notified them to stop sailing to Dinghai. Therefore, they are temporarily dedicated to sailing the Shanghai-Taiwan line. Meifa directly sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As for the Meda and Tangsai ships on the Taiwan-Ningbo line, they have requested the Standing Bureau to make accommodations for fuel problems, but no reply has been received. However, it is heard that the Tenth Army Group has decided to follow the previous order and not make accommodations for the two ships to load coal in Shanghai, as it violates the ban on direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo.

### Travel Diary of Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan

— Chen Zhixiong

Yuanling—Huang County October 18th. This morning, before the dogs barked and before dawn, I got up. The weather was cool, and the wind blew in my face, making me shiver. The waiter had already prepared tea and water, inviting guests to have a meal. After finishing the meal, I got on the bus. It was exactly eight o'clock, the bus drove very slowly, and it was very stable, without any bumps. Yuanling is also known as Chenzhou, famous for producing cinnabar. According to the locals, Chenzhou talismans are good at treating people's illnesses, but the technique has been lost to this day, whether it is true is yet to be confirmed.

The bus left Yuanling soon, and had to climb a mountain again. When going down the mountain, it was necessary to cross the water. After about 20 minutes, the bus arrived at Suhanpu, and then climbed up the mountain again, first large and then small. At this time, several workers were quarrying and opening roads. Mountain stones were piled up in the middle of the road, and the bus could not move forward. After the road workers moved the stones away, it could continue to drive, but half an hour had passed. The bus went up and down the mountain for a long time before reaching Chuanxi Post. The mountains became more winding and dangerous, so I dared not drive fast. At 9:25, the bus arrived at Chenxi, and coal miners were mining nearby. From Yuanling to here, it is a total of 65 kilometers. This place is 446 kilometers away from Changsha. From here to Zhijiang, it is still necessary to travel 109 kilometers. After the bus arrived at Chenxi River, it crossed the river again. This place has clear mountains and waters, and the scenery is pleasant. After crossing the river, it arrived at Huatangping. At 10:15, the bus started again. Looking down the mountain, the scenery was quiet and secluded, without any worldly atmosphere. After arriving at Baliping, there was a small stream flowing through it, the water was turquoise, and it went straight up along the Caojiaxi River. The scenery along the way was like a painting. There were green mountains in front and green waters on the side. When I arrived at Huang County, it was already after 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I found a hostel to stay in. The military police checked at night, and I rested very early after dinner. I heard from passers-by that a car going to Guiyang was robbed of more than 3,000 yuan on the way. We all had a sense of vigilance.

We stopped at Dongshigu in Huang County and stayed at a small hotel next to the station. Because the bus to Guiyang departs from the West Railway Station, we crossed the river after breakfast the next morning. At that time, the fog was very heavy, and people could not be seen within a short distance, and the weather was very cold. After crossing the river, I learned that the bus had not arrived yet, and I had to stay in Huang County for one or two days before I could leave.

Huang County is divided into two cities, new and old. The new city is three or four miles away from the station. I and three others, including Mr. Zhang, went to the new city. After passing the wooden bridge, we went to Zhongshan Street. The so-called new city only has one street, where foreign goods stores and vegetable markets are located. The road is quite clean, and there are many pedestrians. The market is full of pomelos and persimmons. You can buy three pomelos for one dime. Every family dries peppers in front of their doors. I saw a mother feeding her child with county ginseng rice. I heard the market people say that they still have this thing at home, dry it, and use it to help with meals. People in the market, regardless of men or women, wear black or white cloth on their heads. I heard that the people's superstitious customs are very strong.

Huang County—Huangping October 20th. There are very few buses from Huang County to Huangping, and there are many people. Without a division, a certain gentleman suggested drawing lots. I and Mr. Zhang both drew to go. I packed my luggage that night and got up at 6 o'clock. When I arrived at the station, it was already crowded, and there was no room for those who arrived later. After the bus left Huang County, it climbed up the mountain. The first stop was Mao Yupu, which is the border between Hunan and Guizhou. The second stop was Nanning Fort, and the third stop was Shanmudun. After a short drive, the bus arrived at Yuping, which is famous for producing bridges, especially the cigarette pipes made there, which are unusually elegant. The materials used are all thin bamboo, and the carving is quite exquisite. Those who pass by this place will buy them to keep as souvenirs. The sentences carved by Xiao Shang are mostly "Only people who know the sound of the flute know," or "On a moonlit night, it is good to listen to Xiao Shi," "Only jade-like people know the fairy sound" and other sentences. The bus stopped in Yuping for about four or five minutes before leaving. After climbing two mountains, it arrived at Dongjing Bridge. Then it climbed the mountain again. The mountain road was winding and dangerous. Sometimes the bus drove to a very high and deep place, with no obstacles on either side. Looking down at the deep mountains and valleys, they were all thousands of feet below. The bus was driving in it, and it was very necessary to be cautious, especially when turning corners. When the bus arrived at Sansui Station, it stopped for a while, and everyone got off to buy sweet potato flour to fill their stomachs. Soon, it arrived at Magun. After passing Xiangshui, it arrived at Panshan. The top of the mountain stood in the clouds, thousands of feet above sea level. The bus circled around the mountain, and everyone sat upright, not moving around. Looking out from the window, the mountains glared, and the figures below the mountain were like ants, almost indistinguishable. After passing Xiangziling, it arrived at Zhenyuan. Then it climbed the mountain again and passed Yingxian Temple. Looking far away at thousands of mountains and ridges, the peaks looked at each other. The mountain road was rugged, and it circled to Goose Wings, which is the highest point of the mountain. Looking far away, the river flowed quietly down. The bus entered through Dongmen, climbed Goose Wings, and then wound down the mountain. The scenery can be called amazing. After the bus passed Liujiazhuang and Shibing, the speed increased. It passed Gandiping, Lanqiao, and Chatingao in a hurry, and arrived at Huangban, it was already after 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Huangping City is located high on the mountain. I stayed at the Qiandong Hotel. After a short rest, I went to the city to sightsee. I was very disappointed. There was not a single complete house in the city. There was nothing like a restaurant or department store. There was not even a canned food to buy. As for the public education center, it was unusually simple, which shows the low level of public knowledge.

Since August 13th, almost all factories in the suburbs of Shanghai have been destroyed, but Yufeng Yarn Factory, a Japanese-owned factory in Yangshupu, was spared. Internal and external yarn factories in the public concession area are even more intact. Now, the destroyed factories have also been roughly repaired and expanded. Therefore, according to a survey by the Japanese Yarn Factory Association in China, at the end of August this year, the operating rate of each Japanese-owned yarn factory in Shanghai is as follows:

### Further Control of China's Flour

After the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japanese goods followed the army and were sold in large quantities in China. The prosperity of flour imports into China is particularly noteworthy. However, in recent months, there has been a sharp decline. Taking the import of Japanese flour into "North China" as an example, imports in March this year were more than 960,000 bags, which decreased to 720,000 bags in May, and only 130,000 bags in September. There was no improvement in October. Why is this? According to the Japanese, there are two reasons for this:

[1] The sharp decrease in the domestic flour inventory in Japan and the decline in rice and wheat production this year.

[2] Australian flour prices are much lower than Japanese flour prices, so exports to "North China" have been increasing. For example, in April and May this year, there were 500,000 bags of imports, and in September, the record of 1 million bags was broken. It can be said that Japan's position has been replaced by Australia.

These two points are indeed facts, but in our opinion, the most important thing is the extremely chaotic result of Japan's trade policy towards China. Because Japan has forcibly pulled "North China" into its so-called "Yen Zone," Japanese goods exported to China are no longer included in foreign exchange income. This has greatly affected its ability to purchase military resources from third countries. Therefore, the Japanese government has had to come forward to limit exports to China of goods sold to other countries, and flour is one of them. (To be continued)

### Overseas Chinese Should Rise Up Vigorously; The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Fund-raising Committee Actively Promotes the One-Dollar Movement; The Results of the Event Are Not Good, Only More Than 1,000 Yuan Raised; Committee Members Immediately Donate and Send Letters to Various Organizations to Promote

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Fund-raising Committee held a meeting of the standing committee at 3 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Chairman Li Xingzhou, Vice Chairman Huang Maolin, Committee Members Lei Yinshun, Lu Guomian, Chen Zhongchi, Zhou Xingchi, Cao Fuzhao, Su Chaolian, Huang Lianfu, Liu Jingqing, Liu Yuyun, Xi Peikun, Wu Shipu, Pan Fan'an, Xin Yuming, Li Bingsen, and Jian Chinan, totaling more than 20 people. After the meeting, Secretary Cao Xueyu reported on the committee's affairs: (1) To accept the case of rescuing refugees in Yubei, send a letter to the Yubei Relief Committee to inquire about the disaster situation, and send a letter to the Panyu Chamber of Commerce to inquire about how to provide relief, and then consider allocating funds. (2) To report on the one-dollar debt repayment movement, which has received a total of 1,002 yuan in national currency in recent days. After the various reports were completed,

Chairman and Vice Chairman Actually Resign; Chairman Li Xingzhou and Huang Maolin took the excuse to leave. However, the committee members present unanimously agreed that the one-dollar debt repayment movement, which was accepted and carried out by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, should be promoted by the committee. Now that it has been held for several days, the results are still not good, and we should find ways to raise funds. First, Cao Fuzhao suggested that we should follow the example of promoting national salvation bonds, and send teams to solicit donations. The committee members expressed their opinions one after another. Because the chairman and vice chairman had both resigned, it was like a group of dragons without a leader. Therefore, Lei Yinshun was elected as the interim chairman to continue the discussion, in order to obtain a good method for promotion.

Lei Yinshun Gave a Generous Speech; Lei Yinshun stood up and clarified the significance of promoting the one-dollar debt repayment movement, saying that since the committee has followed the approval of the board of directors and sent letters to all industries and chambers of commerce in Hong Kong to carry out their own activities, whether the results will be good in the future is not predictable. However, in theory, since this chamber of commerce is in a leading position, it should take the lead in initiating and implementing it, so as to avoid outside criticism. As for how much to donate, it is not a problem. Secondly, there are many members of the chamber of commerce. If we hold individual donations from members, the amount should not be small. If we do not do this, it will be the same as all industries and chambers of commerce in Hong Kong and this chamber of commerce. How can we achieve good results? I hope everyone will express their great opinions.

The Committee Members Present Expressed Their Deep Approval; After the chairman finished asking, Xin Yuming, Lu Guomian, Chen Zhongchi, and others expressed their opinions one after another. They all agreed that the one-dollar debt repayment movement can enhance national strength and create a new international perspective. The committee is in a leading position and should work hard to promote its success. Therefore, it was decided (1) to immediately recognize donations and ask representatives of all industries to actively carry out the movement; (2) to send a detailed letter from the manager of the chamber of commerce on the important significance of the one-dollar debt repayment movement; (3) to send letters to non-chamber of commerce member organizations, saying that it is to promote the movement. At this point, the case was resolved.

More Than 400 Yuan Donated on the Spot; After the discussion, an immediate donation was held, resulting in a total of 400 yuan in national currency. Lei Yinshun, Lu Guomian, each donated 50 yuan; Chen Zhongchi 20 yuan; Liu Jingqing 25 yuan; Jian Chinan, Liu Tongyun, Zhou Xingchi, Su Chaolian, Zhang Lanzhou, Cao Fuzhao, Xin Yuming, each donated 20 yuan; Wu Shipu, Li Binglin, Pan Fan'an, Huang Lianfu, and Xian Peikun each donated 10 yuan; Huang Mianying donated 5 yuan, all in national currency. In addition, Wu Hanzhen of the Chinese Amateur School sent a letter to initiate overseas Chinese schools to oppose Wang Jingwei's sensational telegram. After discussion, it was rejected.

### The Student Relief Association's Service Corps Goes to Xijiang via Macau

The third group of more than a dozen members of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's return-to-China service corps departed for Xijiang via Macau yesterday. Together with the two batches that had already departed, a total of 65 people have served, of which 40 are serving in the Xijiang area and 25 are serving in the Lianjiang area. In addition, there are 40 more members who are scheduled to depart for a training camp in Xijiang on a given day.

### The Number of Foreign Goods Detained in Hong Kong Has Been Reduced; The Current Inventory Is About 5 Million Yuan; Foreign Firms Have Slightly Relented in Handling

After the fall of Guangzhou, import merchants in Hong Kong were unable to transport goods into the mainland. They requested the Western Chamber of Commerce to postpone delivery, but there was no result. Recently, they appealed to the four Chinese representatives, asking them to request the authorities to come forward and maintain the situation. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Chinese representatives, who were willing to do their best to request the Western Chamber of Commerce to postpone the delivery. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. According to the leader of the textile and foreign goods industries, the matter has now improved because the total amount of goods stored in warehouses is no more than 5 million. Recently, they have been continuously leaving the warehouses and entering the mainland through Guangzhou Bay and other places. It is believed that another 2-3 million yuan can be sold before the end of the lunar year. Seeing this, foreign firms have slightly relented in their handling, and are no longer as insistent as they were a few days ago.

### The Chinese Arts Association's Cadre Training Class Opens; Tao Xingzhi Will Speak Tonight

In order to train members and improve the cultural level of young people in general, the Chinese Arts Association has opened a "Cadre Training Class." The class will start at 7 p.m. tonight at the association. Mr. Tao Xingzhi, a member of the National Political Consultative Conference and an expert in mass education, has been invited to give a lecture on educational issues during the war. Members and other cultural youths are welcome to participate.

### Ye Lanquan and Others Plan to Establish an Orphanage

Since the War of Resistance Against Japan in South China and the fall of the war zones, the number of war-stricken compatriots who are displaced and have nowhere to turn has been increasing day by day. It is heartbreaking and pitiful. If we do not find a way to nurture and educate them, these orphaned children will not only fall into depravity, but also have no way to survive. Famous figures in Hong Kong, such as Ye Lanquan, Cai Chaoqun, Li Yunai, Cai Baotian, and Lu Hansheng, have seen this and organized the Orphanage for Handicraft Education. The purpose is to take in orphans and teach them handicrafts, so that they can serve the country and society in the future. The orphanage is currently in active preparation and is expected to be established soon.

### The South China Morning Post Publishes an Editorial Denouncing Wang Jingwei, Saying That Wang's Views Have Never Been Firm and Guaranteeing That Wang's Attempts Have Failed

Since Wang Jingwei's sensational telegram advocating peace was published, our government authorities and compatriots at home and abroad have denounced it in unison, and friendly countries that sympathize with our resistance and nation-building have also criticized it. Yesterday, the English-language South China Morning Post published an editorial entitled "The Failure of Wang Jingwei," severely criticizing Wang's absurd move to advocate peace. First, it discussed the firm belief of the Chinese people in resisting Japan and building the nation. Then, it analyzed the peace proposals put forward by Wang and believed that if Wang's proposals were followed, how could China avoid losing its territory and sovereignty? Wang did not explain. He seemed to have a new concept of the value of the promises offered by the Japanese. This may also be a new perception of the mediocrity of the Japanese. Wang's views have never been firm and consistent. This time, his advocacy of peace has been strongly criticized, which is the greatest manifestation of the general loss of faith in him. If Wang's proposals are followed and the desires of the Japanese are satisfied, they will expand their aggression, and China will not only turn against the aid given by its former allies, but also suffer a dishonorable failure. Finally, it said that we dare to guarantee to all friends of China that Wang's attempts have failed.

### Kuang Guangyin Will Leave Hong Kong for the United States Tomorrow; He Hosted the Press Yesterday to Report on the Process of Collecting Exhibits for the Golden Gate Exposition; More Than 40 Countries Are Participating This Time; China's Exhibits Include National Products, Skills, etc.

Mr. Kuang Guangyin, director of the General Company of the Chinese Merchants' Exhibition Hall at the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco, USA, and general manager of the China Morning Post for Youth, returned to China this time to collect Chinese merchants' goods for exhibition for more than two months. Many goods have been collected and sent to the United States in four batches. The first two batches have already been sent, and the third and fourth batches are scheduled to depart on the 13th of this month. Mr. Kuang held a reception for the local press at the Datong Restaurant at 4 p.m. yesterday, attended by editors and general managers of various newspapers. Mr. Kuang reported on the preparations for his return to China, which is recorded as follows:

More Than 40 Countries Participate in the Exhibition; The Golden Gate World Exposition is held to commemorate the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, to arouse the world's attention to great buildings, and to promote greater prosperity in the future. The scale is grand and the intention is far-reaching. All countries in the world attach great importance to it, and more than 40 countries participate. However, our government is not able to do so during the difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. For the sake of the country's image and for the sake of developing business, our overseas Chinese do not allow us to neglect this great exposition. Therefore, a company was organized to participate in the capacity of Chinese merchants. A "Chinese Village" was built in the exposition site, and I was sent back to China to be responsible for contacting manufacturers, selecting national goods, and collecting personnel to participate. I arrived in Hong Kong by Pan American flight on November 2 last year after being assigned.

Our National Goods Are Available in All Styles; After returning, due to the fall of Guangzhou and the obstruction of inland transportation, the progress of various matters was not without impact. Fortunately, our press colleagues did their best to promote it, and all sectors of commerce and industry provided enthusiastic assistance. The national goods that have now been purchased include tea, silk, porcelain, lacquer, jade, drawnwork, silverware, ivory, embroidery, calligraphy and painting, gold dragons, yarn dragons, and yarn lanterns, Autumn Scenery, etc. The skill aspects include national skills, martial arts, Cantonese opera, Peking opera, stilt opera, and hand-held opera. All facilities are based on the national standpoint, introducing national goods, and promoting culture is the sole purpose of the company. I sincerely hope that all sectors will cooperate to develop Sino-US trade and enhance China's international position. It is noted that Mr. Kuang was originally scheduled to take a Pan American flight to the United States on the 5th, but has now been rescheduled to take off on the 6th.

### The Lamzhen Association Has Suspended the Horse Ticket

The Hong Kong Lamzhen Association has always held the sale of one-dollar horse ticket lotteries every year, which are allocated to the charity department to be used as charity funds. There have been 12 sessions. According to the reporter's investigation, the association's one-dollar lottery ticket was decided to be suspended by the board of directors on the evening of the 2nd. The 28th annual inauguration ceremony for the new board of directors and department staff was held on the same day.

### Remarks by US Congressman Dawson: England and America Should Actively Assist China; Economic Aid to China Can End the Far East War; × Finances are on the Verge of Collapse and Cannot Be Sustained for Long

Mr. Dawson, a member of the California State Assembly, chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, and expert in finance, recently arrived in Hong Kong. The other day, he attended a meeting of the Hong Kong Rotary Club and gave a speech on Anglo-American relations. He also touched on the Far East issue, advocating that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate to deal with it. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to ask for his specific opinions on the Far East issue. After conveying the intention to Mr. Dawson, he smiled and told the reporter that what he had stated yesterday (the day before) was just a general overview of the issue. He then said that as of today,

The situation in the Far East is indeed extremely serious. The United Kingdom and the United States should take joint action swiftly to cope with it. The disputes caused by × people in the Far East, in fact, involve China's internal affairs, such as the establishment of pseudo-organizations. The unilateral actions of × people are difficult for all countries to accept. The aim of such actions is to exclude the interests of all countries in China and implement a monopoly. This is absolutely incompatible with the Open Door Policy. The joint action advocated by him between the United Kingdom and the United States is to maintain this policy and find ways to end the war. However, it should be pointed out here that the vast majority of the American people are deeply sympathetic to China's current

Suffering from aggression. The friendly relations between China and the United States will be maintained without pressure. The various hypocritical propaganda of × people is never believed by Americans. No matter how much they exaggerate their victory, the general American people greatly discount it. Therefore, if the United States participates in any steps to end the war, it will definitely stand on China's side. At this point, the reporter asked whether insisting on the Open Door Policy, which presupposes the integrity of China's sovereignty, urgently requires the active action of the United States, but is this consistent with the "isolationist policy"? Mr. Dawson replied that, indeed, this principle does have its limitations, but due to the lessons of reality, many Americans feel that there is a need for adjustment. In other words, if it is necessary in fact,

The isolationist policy, although not completely abandoned, is also revised to adapt to the reduction in the barriers of time and space due to scientific development. Absolute isolation is practically impossible today. Mr. Dawson continued that, in his personal opinion, a concrete way to end the Far East war would be to actively assist China economically. This alone would be enough to give × people a serious blow, without the need for any military action. Now × people are on the verge of collapse. Their economy is exhausted and they are in a desperate state. Although they are struggling, it is difficult to break through the difficulties. Their access to borrowing in foreign financial markets has been completely cut off, so it is difficult to maintain for long. Regarding the Anglo-American loan, Mr. Dawson said that this is a symbol of joint Anglo-American action. In his personal opinion, this kind of economic assistance can be expected to continue to be provided by the United States.

British people probably feel the same way. Sponsoring China during this difficult stage is indeed the easiest way to end the war and realize the above-mentioned Open Door Policy. Finally, Mr. Dawson asked the reporter if he had read in the newspaper recently that Mr. Wang Jingwei advocated a compromise with × halfway through, but he did not know if it was true. The reporter told him that Wang's move was purely his personal arrogant act, and the highest authorities and all the people of the country expressed their utmost contempt and were determined to resist to the end. At this point, Mr. Dawson said that it would be too ridiculous for China to compromise halfway after fighting hard for more than a year. He knew that Wang's proposal would not have any impact.

### School News

South China College: South China College, located on Lion Rock Road, Kowloon, was established by a group of celebrities and scholars in conjunction with wealthy Chinese businessmen.

After returning to China, he served as the dean of the Faculty of Arts at National Tsinghua University and taught at Shanghai University, Xiamen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Xiangqin College, and other schools for many years, and has rich experience. The professors are also all specialized scholars, including Zeng Youyi, Lei Tongqun, Cheng Jiyuan, and more than ten others. It is reported that since the school was permitted by the Chinese education authorities to operate in accordance with the regulations, it has been working hard to expand its school affairs, in addition to raising funds to add departments, adding affiliated middle schools, and reporting for registration in accordance with the law. Recently, it has also selected a newly built Western-style building at 27-29 Lion Rock Road as the school building. The building has a total of eight floors, and all styles are built according to the needs of the school. Moreover, the location is quiet and the scenery is pleasant, making it a good place to study.

### Passing off Fish Eyes as Pearls

— Huiren

Starting from × Goods Posing as National Goods

Passing off fish eyes as pearls, using the fake to confuse the real, those who are not knowledgeable are easily fooled and deceived. However, a fish eye is still a fish eye, no matter how cleverly it is made, it will eventually not be able to hide from the eyes of connoisseurs. The same is true for × goods.

, almost every Chinese person has two beliefs: first, to accelerate the economic collapse of the enemy; second, to complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country. After the war of resistance, × goods in China can be said to be like the sun setting on the river, no longer what they used to be; except for a small part that is smuggled in and is difficult to prevent, openly imported goods are no longer seen in the mainland. Even in Hong Kong, the sales of × goods have also sharply decreased as a result. However, "sharp decrease" is only "sharp decrease," not "disappearance"; even in recent months, it has been seen to "increase." What is the reason for this? The natural reason is that it is also deceived by the "passing off fish eyes as pearls" trick. In the past, the method of passing off × goods as fish eyes and pearls was simply to repackage them and import them. Even if one did not have enough knowledge, one could still question them carefully, and the result would always be easy to determine whether it was a "pearl" or a "fish eye"; but it is pitiful that some of China's factories today have become institutions for manufacturing × goods, and identification is even more of a headache.

Originally, after Shanghai fell into the hands of ×, although most of the Shanghai factories followed the orders of the National Government and moved, no less than twenty moved to the mainland, and seventeen moved to Hong Kong. However, there is still a part that is within the sphere of influence of × people and cannot be evacuated in time. It is inevitable that × will use them. After × people occupied it, they produced goods in a continuous stream, and transported them to Hong Kong under the name of Chinese merchants. In this way, not only do people not know that they are × goods, but they are promoted as national goods. Why has the number of repackaged imported × goods suddenly increased in recent months?

Last year, the incident of ×× Company being plastered with slogans caused a stir in the city. It is worth mentioning again at this time. Those who buy × goods are not because they are, but because they "do not have enough knowledge"; those who know the goods are the sellers, who knowingly pass off fish eyes as pearls, using × goods to deceive customers, and should be punished to the fullest extent! Yesterday's newspaper reported that the central government's regulations on banning × goods stipulated that those who pass off × goods as national goods would be sentenced to death. Strict laws and severe punishments can be said to be appropriate.

Not long ago, the Shanghai Vocational Circles Federation made two points that are most noteworthy: one, to actively promote the movement by using the power of society, and to strive for universality, depth, and effectiveness; two, to be absolutely impartial and not to show favoritism. Indeed, as long as the power of society can be used, it will be more effective than any other power. Isn't the incident of ×× Company a manifestation of social power! The compatriots in Shanghai, in such a special environment, did not hesitate to do such sacred work.

In front of a cloth shop, a couplet was erected, with large characters: "How to distinguish between native and foreign goods, carefully evaluate pearls and fish eyes." Although it is not fluent, it is very innocent.

### On the Sea near Mangjing: Masked Bandits Rob Grain Ships; A Gang of More Than Ten Bandits in Two Boats Robbed Grain and Silver Items Worth More Than One Hundred

At 7 pm on the 3rd evening, on the sea near Mangjing, which is adjacent to Hong Kong waters, a grain cargo ship registered in Hong Kong was robbed by two bandit boats. The stolen goods amounted to 790 yuan. The registered number of the boat was 679, and the boat owner was Chen Ba, 39 years old. According to his statement to the Au Tau Police Station, at 7 pm that evening, when he was sailing to the sea near Mangjing, which was close to Hong Kong waters, he suddenly saw two bandit boats approaching. The two boats were carrying more than ten bandits, four of whom were masked with black cloth. Among the rest, seven were carrying guns. When the bandit boats approached, they shouted at the grain boat to stop. The people on the grain boat knew that they had no guns to defend themselves, and that the two bandit boats were no match for the crowd. Knowing that they could not resist, they allowed the bandits to board the boat and loot. In total, the bandits looted 115 sacks of grain, worth about 500 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, all the tinware, white rice, cash, and clothing on the boat were also looted. The total loss was about 790 yuan. After the bandits finished looting, they turned around and fled towards Mangjing. Later, Chen Ba continued to sail to Hong Kong, and arrived in Yuen Long, New Territories yesterday morning. He then went to the Au Tau Police Station to report the case. The police are now making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. Because four of the bandits were masked, it is clear that the victim had met or knew them, and was afraid of being recognized, so it would be easier to solve the case, so they covered their faces with black cloth.

### Zhang Yijun Talks to Reporters: Will Convene Hong Kong-Based Councillors for Talks; National Political Consultative Conference May Be Postponed

Among the members of the National Political Consultative Conference currently in Hong Kong are Zhang Yijun, Hu Jingyi, Wang Yunwu, Gan Jieshou, Wu Zhimei, Tao Xingzhi, Chen Shouming, and more than ten others. Since Wang Jingwei issued a telegram betraying the country and the party, all of them have been indignant. Councillor Zhang Yijun told reporters yesterday that there are many councillors staying in Hong Kong, and he intends to convene a meeting of the councillors to exchange views and communicate news from all parties. The third Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Chongqing this month, but the date has not been set. Now that the Speaker has left, the central government must appoint a capable person to succeed him. The candidate has not yet been determined, and the date of the meeting may be postponed to February. Councillor Hu Jingyi, a business magnate from Sichuan, has been in Hong Kong from Ningbo and Chongqing for many days. He plans to take a ship to Singapore on the 6th of this month. If he can make it to the third Political Consultative Conference, he will pack his bags and return to the country. This trip is to investigate the situation in Nanyang in order to develop domestic industries.

Naval Review: Rear Admiral Nugent Encourages Troops to Work Hard Due to the Seriousness of the Situation

The citizens of countries with backward navies cannot help but feel infinitely ashamed when they visit the advanced naval reviews of friendly nations.

However, thinking back to our sacred War of Resistance that has already begun, the future of the New China has already revealed a glimmer of dawn in the long night: our "tomorrow" is about to arrive, and the advanced phenomena of friendly countries today may not be a good example for our nation-building tomorrow. The reporter finally replaced his feelings of shame with excitement, and yesterday morning, he hurried to Happy Valley to watch the annual review of the British Royal Navy's squadron stationed in Hong Kong.

The review was originally scheduled for 10 am, but the personnel had already gathered several minutes earlier. Sacred time is naturally a good phenomenon.

The vast racecourse was like being covered with a yellow-green carpet. Thousands of sailors, divided into nine squadrons, stood upright, motionless and silent. This silent picture only had the tails of the horses that the reviewers were riding on flicking up and down and left and right very vigorously, attracting the attention of countless spectators around, which was quite interesting.

Those who were invited to watch the exercise this time included: General Jia Naixi, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in China, Deacon, Commander of the Hong Kong Navy, Burke, Commander of the Air Force, Mackland, Army Officer, Ewen, Chief of Staff of the Army, and hundreds of other people, including the captain of the French warship stationed in Hong Kong. Many other heads of various institutions and Chinese and Western merchants were also invited to watch the exercise, numbering about a thousand people.

The large clock on the podium struck exactly 10 o'clock. The commander standing at the highest point of the podium gave a flag signal, and all the sailors on the field stood at attention very quickly and neatly, and hoisted their guns. The collective action was simply the action of one person, and discipline showed its great role in the group.

The melodious and majestic music then played, stirring the silent air, and the review ceremony officially began.

First, the troops saluted Rear Admiral Nugent with the military salute. Commander-in-Chief Buguan immediately rode his horse in front of the podium and asked Rear Admiral Nugent to review the troops. The reviewing officers included Admiral Nuyer, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, Brann, Commander of the British warship Birmingham, Vice Commander Jikitono, Commander of the British warship Birmingham, etc., a total of six officers. They rode slowly in front of the nine squadrons, reviewing.

Then the reviewing officers pulled the reins and stood under the flags in the middle. The nine squadrons turned into a straight line and advanced, passing in front of the reviewing officers one after another.

In addition to the British Royal Marines stationed in Hong Kong, the main body of the review also included two naval teams, who accompanied the performance. Their spirit was particularly heroic.

The most interesting thing was that the leather shoes, black velvet clothing, green leggings and belts, and the white-topped uniform hats and "naval-style" turned-down collars were exactly the same and looked like patterns with very obvious lines.

Every soldier on the field was carrying a long gun, and the bayonet flashed. This is a terrible weapon, but "peace" depends on it to guarantee it. Such guns and knives have become "artistic guards" that constitute the pattern in this great and solemn square.

When the guns were hoisted, lowered, turned left, turned right, advanced, and stood at attention, the uniform steps and the up-and-down wrist movements...were simply the same action, which was also very interesting. The lack of individual freedom in a group is also shown here.

This vast and mighty army advancing made us associate with the heroic soldiers of our motherland, who are just like this galloping on the battlefield. While praising the navy of friendly nations, we also thought of the greatness of the loyal and brave soldiers of our motherland.

Then, Rear Admiral Nugent delivered a personal speech, which was broadcast by a radio, and everyone on the field heard it. The clock pointed at 10:45, and the solemn ceremony was declared closed.

When leaving the field, six senior officers led the way on horseback, the military band was in the middle, and the entire navy formed a neat team and marched back to the barracks or ships from the city. Everywhere they passed, every household came out to watch the fun. Some sighed that "China is not as good as Britain" — others believed that we would also learn from the example of friendly nations tomorrow.

Regarding Rear Admiral Nugent's speech, he encouraged the troops to work hard due to the seriousness of the situation. The original text is as follows:

"Dear colleagues, I believe that only today in the year do I have the opportunity to address many colleagues: I believe that today's grand review is the most valuable." The first point is to make you organized, and the second point is to make you cooperative. Many colleagues are exercising together. It is commendable that you can gather all units to form today's grand exercise, which is a manifestation of cooperation. At the same time, it also gives the officers the opportunity to command their subordinates, and the soldiers have the opportunity to raise their guns. I think the most important point is that the soldiers have the opportunity to raise their guns. We naval personnel must know that the preparation and training of the navy is a huge responsibility; especially our navy stationed in China, that is, the ships of our navy today, are always ready to protect the lives and property of our British people. I remember that on July 1 last year, we sent 110 naval personnel to Hankou by land. Although they were in a difficult environment, they were able to do a satisfactory job; in the Mediterranean, our navy cooperated with the army to quell the riots in Palestine; it seems that the training of the marines is very important. I am very impressed by what you have shown today. I also know that you, dear soldiers, should use the spirit of continuous and indomitable spirit to develop good skills. Although we are in a time of world events, I dare to boast of you and have confidence in the British monarch. Even if any event occurs in the future, you will definitely do your best and do not let the fleet of our countries stationed in China feel inadequate."

### Book Hermitage

— Zou Xiao

——National Tunes Talk

Zhang Shengjie of the Qing Dynasty wrote a zaju opera "Painting Hermitage" about the painter Zhao Zigong and his follower Zhao Mengfu. Both of them were members of the Zhao clan, and after the Song Dynasty fell, Zigong remained in seclusion and did not serve, while Mengfu shamelessly served the Yuan Dynasty. Mengfu came to visit Zigong, and Zigong ridiculed him for a while. This is based on the following two anecdotes:

"Zigong bought a boat under the lake, drank heartily, and dried his hat with wine in the evening. At dusk, he entered Xiling, swept across Gushan, moored his oars among the lush trees, pointed to the most secluded place in the forest, stared and shouted: 'This is truly the idle brush of Hong Guizi Dong Beiyuan!' Several neighboring boats were all shocked and sighed that he was a true banished immortal!" (Song Zhou Mi Qi Dong Ye Yu)

"Zigong entered this dynasty and did not like to serve. He lived in seclusion in Guangchen Town in the state. His follower Mengfu came to visit him, but the Duke refused to let him in. His wife persuaded the Duke, and he finally let him in through the back door. After sitting down, he asked: 'Are the Bian Mountains and Lakes still beautiful?' Mengfu said 'What?' The Duke said 'What can my brother do if the mountains and lakes are beautiful?' Mengfu left. He ordered someone to wash the seat." (Yuan Yao Tongshou Lejiao Siyu)

This play writes about Zigong's anger after hearing that his follower had responded to the Yuan Dynasty's call for talented scholars. He angrily sang the "Yellow Orioles Listening in Jixian Pavilion": "Going to court, the jade pendants chime, talking about the Sage Dynasty's favors. They do not think about who broke the rivers and mountains of the old country. They dance and sing in the palace! (I think the country has supported scholars for three hundred years, and only got a few loyal ministers like Wen Tianxiang! Liu Mengyan, as the Number One Scholar and Prime Minister, and Mengfu, as a member of the imperial family, still shamelessly lost their integrity. What else can be asked!) They cannot bear to starve in Shouyang, and cannot learn to lie high in Liaodong. Who would be willing to worry about the royal family early, and the bronze camels weep in the thorns!"

Later, the boatman saw Zigong painting and lying down, and mistakenly thought that Zigong was Mengfu, so he said: "What a pity! He shouldn't be an official. Since ancient times, the enemies of parents cannot live under the same sky. For example, if your ancestors' property is taken away by someone, you should fight to the death with him—why should you become obedient to him!"

The mockery of Mengfu by the servant is also very interesting. The servant heard that Mengfu was only allowed to enter through the back door, and said: "A dignified scholar is not allowed to enter through the front door. He looks like a ghost sneaking in through the back door. If there were no back door, he would have to crawl through the dog hole!" Mengfu was ridiculed by Zigong at the beginning: "After being separated for several years, I didn't expect you to become so successful!" When he left, he was in a bad mood, and the servant said: "Master, don't be angry, don't go back to the sea. I have two sayings, let me tell you: let them laugh and scold, I will still be a good official!"

I don't know whether it was out of cherishing Mengfu's talent or because the author himself was also a minister of a foreign dynasty, Jiang Shiquan's "Winter Green Tree" did not have much derogatory words for Mengfu, but rather seemed to praise him. This point seems to be inferior to Wu Weiyao of the late Qing Dynasty, the author of "Painful History," who gave more sympathy to Zigong. However, the kind of thorough mockery of traitors like Zhang Shengjie's even Wu Weiyao would have to admit that he was inferior.

### Literary Criticism in 1938

— Lin Huanping

Three

Regarding general discussions of wartime literature, the main focus is on discussing the creator's direction because this is the fundamental issue of wartime literature at this stage.

On the issue of direction, Mr. Mao Dun expressed very correct and valuable opinions in his article "Thoughts of August—A Review of a Year of Wartime Literary Trends" in the first volume, ninth issue of "Literary Front." He also consistently provided us with the most practical and profound instructions in the "Book Review" section of "Literary Front" with a sincere attitude. In the thirteenth issue of "Wartime Literature," he also published "On Strengthening Criticism." Mr. Zhu Xiuxia also published an article "On Realistic Wartime Literature" in the fourth issue of the first volume of "Literary Front," which accurately pointed out the superficial tendencies of conceptualization, abstraction, and monotony in wartime literature. In addition, Mr. Kajii Motojiro, a Japanese revolutionary writer who participated in our country's war of resistance, also successively published "Literary Thoughts" in the fifth and sixth issues of "War Zone Bi-Monthly," published "Miscellaneous Literary Essays" in the fifth issue of the third collection of "July," published "On the Question of 'Art and Propaganda'" in the sixth issue of "Wartime Literature," and held two "Literary Symposiums" with the colleagues of "July," etc.

From the perspective of category production after the War of Resistance, reportage and scripts were produced the most, followed by poetry, and then novels. From the perspective of creation tendencies, as Mr. Mao Dun analyzed in "Thoughts of August":

"In the first half of the past year (of course, this is a very rough division), the main trend in the literary world was to focus on the depiction of individual heroic scenes. Most works took the heroic and tragic stories in the War of Resistance as their subject matter and attempted to explain the greatness of the era from these stories themselves! The determination and courage of the Chinese people, their understanding and hope, their tolerance of current sacrifices, and their certainty of final victory. Such attempts, coupled with insufficient time to conceive and experience, unconsciously led to a phenomenon of focusing on writing about 'events' rather than writing about 'people.' In other words, there was a fixed story framework first, and then characters were filled in, while the concepts of the Chinese people's determination and courage, understanding and hope, their tolerance of current sacrifices, and their certainty of final victory were distributed and filled into the characters.

I believe that very few of the works at that time were satisfactory. The reason lies in the fact that there were still too few writers who delved deeply into life, and there were indeed many who followed the trend of describing heroic events.

'From 'events' to 'people' can be said to be a major trend in the past six months.

Finally, I feel that a further step in wartime literature in the past six months is that writers have begun to selectively and plannedly depict the most typical events among the heroic events.'"

This analysis not only points out the creative tendencies of wartime literature in the past year but also indicates the fundamental question of literary creation — writing about people, having characters, and then arranging stories: depicting the character of people in a typical environment.

This is a fact: shortly after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, almost all literary works wrote about heroic events or the invaders' atrocities of rape, plunder, and massacre. This caused the monotony and uniformity of the works. Therefore, Mr. Mao Dun repeatedly called for writing about people; Mr. Zhu Xiuxia also seriously pointed out: we must not only depict heroic events, we must not only express the invaders' atrocities, we must especially express the pro-Japanese factions, Trotskyites, traitors, and all the remnants of the old era. Those negative factors that hinder the War of Resistance and nation-building; we must especially express the invaders' vicious conspiracies of both soft and hard tactics, such as buying off traitors and recruiting ignorant refugees back to the occupied areas to be obedient citizens. These instructions are applicable principles for past, present, and future wartime literature. Our country's War of Resistance is a national revolutionary war. Externally, it is a national war to overthrow Japanese imperialism and strive for national independence and freedom; internally, it is a revolutionary war to build a free and prosperous New China on the ruins of war. Wartime literature must shoulder this sacred task. Wartime literature must observe, experience, and express the typical national heroes and typical national dregs in typical environments from multiple, related, and dynamic perspectives, and must also express the invaders' hard tactics—atrocities, and soft conspiracies—inducements.

### "The Art of Changing Colors"

— Luo'er

——Sending to Wang [Jingwei], Part Two

Mud dolls dare not cross the river; this principle is simple, but "fish eyes" can "pass for pearls," which not everyone can see through. The reason is that "fish eyes" still resemble "pearls" to some extent. However, humanity is constantly evolving. Spies who have the "art of passing off" have actually been able to "pass off" for a year and six months, which shows how clever their "art of passing off" is. If we slightly expose its cleverness, then you can discover that the so-called "art" is actually holding on to a "color." Where does this color come from? Answer: It is purchased from Tokyo, especially from Mr. Konoe [Fumimaro], a famous expert in color science.

Let's just give an example to let us understand Konoe's art, and then talk about the abilities of the peddlers. For example, Japanese fascists want to create the great cause of their "continental policy," so they panic and shout as if they were frightened by some ghost: "China has red, it must be communist, and we must prevent communism," and as a result, the "Imperial Army" is dispatched. This is one example. Secondly, following the application of red paint, there comes the green "peace" paint to establish the East Asian "New Order," and of course, there are other yellow "benevolent rule" brand paints, etc.

The traitors mixed in the War of Resistance are also mostly using paint to decorate themselves. However, the use of paint here is very skillful, sometimes showing "sacrifice color," sometimes "scorched earth color," sometimes "escape color," sometimes "azure blue"... It is really too numerous to list all the changes, but in the end, it is still "Jingwei color." And "Jingwei color" is in harmony with "Konoe color," so there appeared the astonishing "important suggestions." The art of changing colors has been exhausted, and Mr. Wang's [Jingwei] original traitorous form is completely exposed. From now on, there is no need to apply colorants anymore.

This is a color-changing drama. In fact, clear-sighted people have long warned the people of the country to be careful. Of course, now that the original form has appeared, everyone can understand, but we cannot assume that we can breathe a sigh of relief. Please raise the necessary vigilance and prepare to deal with possible events!

### Memories

— Lin Yingchuang

The gray curtain slowly opened, and the stars and moon shone brightly. A burst of rumbling cannon fire shattered the silence of the night. The alert morning rooster also flapped its wings, raised its neck, and crowed loudly. The sharp sound waves pierced my sorrowful dreams. I rubbed my weak, lazy eyes, wiped away the excess tears, and peered through the window at the gauze-covered earth outside.

A crashing roar echoed in the empty valley, stirring my sensitive mind. I glanced at the calendar on the desk, with only two shiny steel posts remaining. A wandering heart suddenly felt a longing for my hometown! The New Year's Day in Xiamen: a great procession to comfort the national army, with tens of thousands of people, starting from that Ding'an Road, winding its way like a gigantic dragon lying on the ground, bursting with heroic salvation songs and intense slogans along the way, heading towards the garrison defense area. On Huyu Road, a tense atmosphere of unity, liveliness, and tension was frozen in the air. Soldiers and civilians mingled together, and the slogan "Defend Dadongmen" shattered the midday sun!

I kicked off the quilt and scrambled up, leaning my back against the low wooden screen. I was excited, and I felt that nothing could compare to the joy of that day. Now, on this year's New Year's Day, I am wandering here, unable to hear this powerful roar, unable to smell the gunpowder, and even if you sing or shout, people will tell you to shut up! However, my relatives and friends in my hometown are struggling under the high pressure of iron hooves. Perhaps this year's New Year's Day is the establishment of the so-called "Municipal Government," and shameless puppets are putting on makeup and celebrating their promotions. What I can hear here is naturally different from what I can hear there. What I can hear is the moans of the sick lying under the arcade, the cries of hunger, the noisy sound of cars, the symphony of "mahjong," and the shouts and guesses of the teahouses and restaurants, the melodious jazz music, and the ruthless scolding of the procuresses, and the obscene solicitations of the "International Market."

Soon, the heart-wrenching moans continuously stimulated my mixed nerves. My premonition came true with a cry! I woke up, I was afraid, my heart felt like it had been hit hard. I hugged my head tightly, closed my eyes, and burrowed into the quilt, but my whole body was shivering, and the god of terror was surrounding me on all sides, and it seemed that the fate of death was about to come! But I gritted my teeth and resisted, struggled, and my whole body was burning with fever.

The faint dawn crossed the window bars and shone on my pale face. I opened my eyes and saw the Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong (Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) flag fluttering in the face, still waving, which indicated that I must defend our country, and I should go to the motherland to fight, and no longer linger on this island!

### My Dream

— Chu Qing

In memory of a fallen comrade-in-arms

I dream of your smiling face,

I am ashamed,

I am terrified,

I seem to hear your laughter:

"You faithless fellow!

You have forgotten the original covenant,

You are clinging to that bottomless comfort zone!

You have abandoned your comrades on the battlefield of national liberation!"

I dream of your smiling face,

I am ashamed,

I am terrified,

I seem to hear your laughter:

"You cowardly thing!

Why don't you follow in my footsteps?

'Our arms should never be separated,

Our work should never be slackened!'

You shouldn't have forgotten, right?

But why don't you follow in my footsteps?"

### Buying Old Books

— Shalivan

Buying old books is a kind of personal quirk of mine. This is another aspect of the pleasure of exploring bookstores, because bookstores are full of new books, and the prices are certainly more expensive. Book lovers are sometimes a little stingy, the reason being their own lack of affluence. Even though there are "10% to 20% off" books in bookstores that are cheaper, they are not entirely to my taste. Unable to get what I want, I seek the next best thing. So, I have a part in old book stalls and shops everywhere. I want to find my favorite books at a low price. Even though I am squeezed in a dark and small room, or squatting on the roadside sunbathing, and spending a lot of time, I do not cherish it at all. When I go back with the books, I am very happy, like children with a piece of candy in their pockets. Sometimes, the people who sell old books raise the price, or they know it is a good book, but I don't have much money in my pocket, so I can only stare blankly, always flipping through the books and reluctantly leaving, looking back as if it were my own loss.

The biggest problem with buying old books is the transmission of germs, as well as damage and dirt. After buying them back home, I have to spend a lot of effort to wash, slap, blow, dry, paste, and bind them. After so much effort, a deep friendship has already developed between me and an old book, which is not as indifferent as a new book. It adds to the power of enjoyment when reading. I often feel this way, as if it is my old friend.

Old books also have a special charm. It is the previous owner of a book!—Even if it has been transferred two or three times, is it not better for me to be the third owner of the book than to be the owner of a new book! This is a kind of magic. For example, I can buy something from the previous owner, even if it is Shanghai, Nanjing, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Xiamen... They are exchanged with each other from afar. In the hands of others ten years ago, today it falls on my bookshelf. Others bought it at a high price of one or two yuan, but I only bought it for one-tenth or one-twentieth of the price. Many things are a story, a legend. If books are spiritual, they would tell a history of vicissitudes, but unfortunately I can only look for the handwriting of my predecessors to explore its surface.

There are also the curves, symbols, detailed annotations, bold criticisms, absurd opinions, funny insertions, as well as sentence breaks, short couplets, strange words, and crooked poems drawn on old books... On the one hand, they can be a reference for my reading, on the other hand, they are also the best pastime besides serious articles.

Buying old books is a personal quirk of mine. "This quirk is so lovely." If you are my fellow traveler, you will say this.

### Last Night's Women's Basketball Game: Mei Fang, Southwest, Hong Kong University Win

[Our Special Dispatch] With the sound of firecrackers, the difficult year of the Republic of China 27 has already passed with the great wheels of time. In the few days after the arrival of the Republic of China 28, the basketball court was quite deserted. Last night, because there were three games scheduled, the spectators were quite lively.

The first game was Xuehua against Mei Fang. Xuehua's strength was already far behind Mei Fang. Moreover, the Mei Fang team was her older sister. Because of this, the game was not very intense. When the final whistle blew, Xuehua, in order to fulfill her sister's championship dream, lost with a score of 20 to 45.

The second game was Nanhua against Southwest. Judging by the strength of the two teams, Nanhua was not inferior to Southwest. However, because Nanhua's players were not accurate with their shots, they had to admit defeat.

At the start of the first quarter, Nanhua took the lead due to a foul by Southwest's right guard. In the blink of an eye, Southwest also scored a point in the same way. At this time, both sides were in high spirits. They went back and forth, like a tug-of-war. After a long melee, Southwest took advantage of another foul by the opponent and continued to score points, ending the first quarter with a score of 3 to 2.

At the restart of the second quarter, Southwest's players took advantage of their initial victory and made another long shot. However, Nanhua did not show any weakness. Fen also took advantage of a free throw to score two points. Southwest's players tried their best to maintain the lead, and the score was not far behind. After another period of fighting, Nanhua missed many opportunities because their players' shots were not very accurate. They inevitably fell behind a little in this quarter.

After the start of the second half, Southwest's morale declined slightly, which Nanhua took advantage of. Three forwards spread across Southwest's restricted area. In the blink of an eye, Fen scored, and Meiwei Ruomei followed up, surpassing Southwest's score. Southwest's players, realizing this, worked hard to maintain their lead. However, it was already approaching the end of the quarter. After Shizhi returned a shot, the whistle blew immediately. Southwest retreated with a score of 17 to 13.

The final quarter was a matter of life and death. Southwest was certainly not willing to give up, and Nanhua was also unwilling to show weakness. Therefore, the game was very tense and exciting. After ten minutes, Nanhua's misfortune began. Not only did they repeatedly miss shots, but Southwest's forwards, Peizhi and Ruomei, seemed to be divinely aided and scored three more times, leading with a score of 23 to 17. Nanhua, in order to avoid the sharp edge, requested a temporary break. However, Southwest's fighting spirit was high, and there was little impact. Thus, until the end of the game, Nanhua inevitably lost with a score of 17 to 24.

The last game was Hong Kong University against St. Paul's. Before the game, everyone knew that St. Paul's would not be a match for Hong Kong University. However, despite this, the game was the most interesting because St. Paul's players temporarily gathered many cheerleaders to support them. When the game was tense, the girls opened their cherry lips and shouted until they were hoarse. However, Hong Kong University also brought many men in suits to help. They shouted and cheered, which was also interesting. As for the game itself, it goes without saying that it was somewhat like that. Until the final whistle blew, Hong Kong University won with a score of 20 to 12. (Bottom People)

### World Professional Tennis Authority to Perform in the East This Year: Women's Star Marble and Others Will Come After

According to the Singapore "Hua Nan Chen Bao" news, the world professional tennis giants, Burke, Klein, Barnes, and others, will come to the East for public performances in the first half of this year. According to reports, Burke officially joined the professional tennis world on January 1 this year. After performing in the United States, he will travel to the Far East with Klein, Van, and others, traversing Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, and other places. Also, the world tennis players Marble and Pondai may set off this year to come to the Far East for an amateur performance tour. Barnes once came to Hong Kong with Tilden in the past. Panlai and Burke have not yet come. If it happens, it will definitely be a sensation.

### Washington University Basketball Team to Compete in the Philippines in March: Expected to Perform Once When Passing Through Hong Kong, Union

[Our Special Dispatch] Basketball is enthusiastically welcomed in the Golden State, just as football is in Great Britain.

In the near future—around March—the basketball team of the University of Washington in the United States, in response to an invitation from Manila, will travel to compete, passing through Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The sports news department of a certain English newspaper in Shanghai has been in contact with the team, inviting them to give a performance when they pass through Shanghai. However, a reply has not yet been received.

The technical level of basketball in Hong Kong is very low, and it is a one-sided activity. In addition to the Chinese who are fond of this sport, there are very few foreigners with team organizations.

If the University of Washington team comes to the East in the future and passes through Hong Kong, it is hoped that the Basketball Association will also find a way to invite them to perform once.

A few years ago, the Hong Kong basketball community tried to form teams to go south (mostly to Manila), but in recent years, they have been content with the status quo. The tune of traveling south to observe technology has not been played for a long time.

If the Federation has the intention to have the basketball community of this Association learn from the University of Washington team, then it may as well accept the reporter's request.

Also, the Hong Kong basketball community must not overestimate itself. In fact, the technology is still in its infancy. I remember two years ago, an American warship arrived in Hong Kong and sent a team to play friendly matches with the so-called strong teams in Hong Kong. As a result, the American sailors swept everything, and at that time, the technology of the Hong Kong basketball world was much better than it is now. (East Lang)

### Endurance Training Method

— Wang Xuezheng

First, run about a quarter of a mile at a moderate speed to warm up the body, then slow down slightly and continue running for another quarter of a mile at the same speed as the start, but accelerate to the maximum speed in the last hundred yards. After running, take a short, brisk walk. In short, alternate between walking and running for 45 minutes to an hour. Pay attention to the uniformity of steps.

On the way back, you can incorporate other exercises, such as jumping, climbing trees, and pull-ups (Chin Up), so that you can achieve the greatest effect and develop the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and arms.

With this type of exercise, it is easy to overdo it, so we should stop immediately when we feel tired and avoid overexertion. We can change to a brisk walk to complete the entire course. The distance of the route should also be planned in advance.

After exercising, do not let the body cool down suddenly. Take a bath immediately without hesitation. After the bath, use a rough towel to rub the body, and then rest quietly for about an hour.

Rope skipping and jumping exercises—this type of exercise can be used to replace outdoor running and walking. However, the most effective method is to do it every other day. For example, run and walk on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and skip rope and jump on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This will also make it more interesting. When skipping rope, if it feels too easy, you can change to alternating legs. When doing skipping exercises, it is best to choose those that are also beneficial to the torso.

Breathing exercises—if the breathing method is wrong during exercise, it will cause great damage to health, especially when performing exercises mainly for endurance training. When performing strenuous exercises, the lungs need seven or eight times more air than usual. Therefore, as long as the breathing method is correct, any exercise can also achieve the effect of breathing exercises. (Zhong)

### Para Thistle Wins Lifesaving Award

Hong Kong's inter-port swimming athlete and this year's cross-harbor ice swimming champion, Para Thistle, rescued a hawker who was being swept down from a mountain stream in the sea near the Castle Dory Swimming Club on July 20 last year. The hawker was fortunate to survive. The London Central Lifesaving Association awarded Thistle a bronze medal in recognition of his bravery and meritorious service.

### Burke's First Game Wins Against Barnes

[New York, 4th (Reuters)] Burke turned to professional tennis, and the first game was held on the evening of the 3rd of this month, at the Madison Square Garden. As a result, he defeated Barnes with a score of 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in three straight sets.

### Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-Port Football Match to Be Held on Lunar New Year's Day

[Our Report] The Football Association's management committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to accept the Philippine team to come to Hong Kong to hold the Hong Kong-Philippines inter-port match. The date of the match is on Lunar New Year's Day. In April, the Hong Kong team will go to the Philippines to return the invitation.

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment……Three Sisters Ssaly·Irene And

Mary

It is a song and dance film that brings together singers, musicians, broadcasters, and screen stars. The story is scattered, but a song and dance film does not necessarily need a perfect story. It only needs gorgeous stage settings and humorous songs and dances to succeed as an entertaining "musical blockbuster."

Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and dancing skills. The humor of the big-nosed Jimmy Durante is as constant as ever, and he is also an excellent character in the film.

Empress……The Rat Thief

The Rat

This film has a bold and profound depiction of the life of the lower classes of Paris, interspersed with a distorted love story. A thief nicknamed "The Rat Thief" is naturally suave and unrestrained, and has committed many thefts. The police have no choice but to deal with him. Later, because he loves the girl raised by his friend on the one hand, and is fascinated by a wealthy woman on the other, he mistakenly commits murder and is brought to court. The story is very tortuous, but the handling is slightly vague and lacks possibility. The protagonists, Lu Wukedun and Anton Wumbu, also have mediocre acting skills.

Safety……The Ore Love Seedling

Pa nred Desert

A film describing the American West. The plot lacks development, and the first half is slightly obscure. The second half has some thrilling fight scenes, which feel lively and tense. The story tells the process of tungsten mine exploration, the struggle for land rights, the conspiracy and destruction of villains, and the efforts of the mine owner to finally achieve success.

Wu Sheng George O'Brien has a satisfactory performance in this film.

East……Dual Female Competition

Woman chases Man

Looking at the title, you know that it is an interesting film. The content writes about how a father with no money uses various clever methods to ask a son with money for money, and at the same time uses a woman to do it, making a lot of jokes. As a result, the son actually fell in love with that woman, then needless to say, he is willing to take it out and invest in his father's company.

The protagonists are Joe McClear and Marlene Hawkins, and the performance is just right

Dahua……West Line Spy Network

Lancrr Spy

The story describes a British officer who looks like a German officer, and the German officer is captured by the British army. He disguised himself as a German officer and went back to spy on the enemy's situation, but the German officer had a lover, and this lover did counter-espionage work for Germany. Unexpectedly, they really fell in love with each other and told the truth, and let the fake German officer go back.

Similar spy stories have been told many times in the past, and this film is certainly not new. The whole film is handled very loosely, especially the first half is too dull. The two protagonists, George Sanders and Dorothy de Rio, also have no distinctive performances.

Jingxing……Wells Fnrgo

A film with the theme of developing transportation, depicting the situation at that time with hard work, tireless efforts to break through all kinds of difficulties, and it was written very forcefully, and finally achieved success one day.

Joe McCrae and Francis Dee's performance is very commendable. Although it is a nearly historical film, it does not feel dull due to proper handling.

Central……Four Heroes of the Wang Family

Mandarin film

It is a remake of a silent film story, changed into a sound film and dyed in color, and the scene is much more magnificent than the silent film. Wang Yin replaced Wang Yuanlong, who was popular before, and the heroine is Zhang Hong, who stepped into the film industry from the song stage.

### US Congress to Have Heated Debate on National Defense, Unemployment, etc.: This Year's Budget Is Also a Key Case, Haibu Suggests Increasing Bases

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt's budget subcommittee will raise several major financial issues in the country: Can the United States continue to be in a state of financial deficit, allowing the government to waste more gold and silver than its tax revenue by billions? It is speculated that this year's budget will spend 900 million US dollars, while revenue is only about 500 million. Although various sources of income have been developed, since Roosevelt became president, the national debt will total 400 billion US dollars. Not only that, but in the next mid-June, another 170 billion US dollars will be added.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Roosevelt's national defense plan is expected to reach 130 million to 150 million, including the cost of building 12,000 aircraft, two 45,000-ton dreadnoughts in the plan, and enriching the strength of the standing army and developing air force manpower. The House of Representatives now expresses its support for this military build-up plan, but it is expected that any proposal to amend the neutrality law will cause disputes.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] This session of the US Congress is meeting in a period of international turmoil, and it will not adjourn until the summer. The current international situation may have an impact on the attitude of the US Congress. During the adjournment of the previous Congress, the United States' attitude towards various dictatorial countries has become tougher. Therefore, the US government will ask Congress to support this attitude and first vote to approve the disbursement of 10 million yuan to meet the needs of the country.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The 76th US Congress opened at noon today. The Senate and House of Representatives were full of people. New and old members of Congress introduced each other. Thirty-five new senators took the oath of office to Senate Speaker, Vice President Garner. After House Speaker Bankhead was elected for reelection, all members of the House of Representatives took the oath of office to him. Today was only the opening ceremony, so the Senate and House of Representatives did not discuss any bills other than the customary announcement of the meeting. The atmosphere in the hall was extremely harmonious, but the majority of congressmen also realized that the current Congress will definitely cause heated debates when discussing the neutrality law, national defense issues, and unemployment relief issues. According to the distribution of the number of members of the Seventh and Sixth Congresses, (1) the Senate has 69 Democratic members, 22 Republican members, 1 Progressive member, 1 Ultra-Party member, and 1 Farmer-Labor Party member; (2) the House of Representatives has 261 Democratic members, 169 Republican members, 2 Progressive members, and 1 American Labor Party member.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The US Congress held its 76th meeting today, and the important issues that urgently need to be resolved are the national defense issue and the public relief issue. Some newspapers said that this was a "struggle for leadership" of the Democratic Party between President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner. Check that Garner is a representative of the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He tried to amend some New Deal laws and wanted to fix the implementation procedures so that they would not go any further. President Roosevelt will try to keep the party free and elect progressives as the party's presidential candidates in 1940. He dealt with the relief issue very skillfully, only informing Congress that if Congress does not pass a new appropriation bill for the use of the Public Works Administration, 3 million people will be unemployed by February 7. Republicans and conservative Democrats are advocating for cuts, the restoration of national control of relief funds to prevent the manipulation of politics by the unemployed. However, government officials believe that opposition politicians, in view of the fact that this matter is related to the continued or interrupted assistance of millions of workers, will follow the customary rules and pass the necessary relief funds. Yesterday, Roosevelt's message to Congress will adopt a strong tone, reiterating his opposition to the expansion of centralized countries, and advocating that the United States should regard itself as the leader of the democratic front in the Americas. Today, Congress elected Pang Dick as the Speaker of the House with a vote of 250 to 160. Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that this meeting will thoroughly review the legislation affecting US international relations.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The US Military Department recently suggested to Congress that the US Navy should build several naval bases in the United States and its vicinity in response to the environment. This matter was recommended by a special naval committee responsible for investigating the location of naval bases. Among the bases it proposes to add, nine are in the Pacific Ocean. The meeting also advocates that each base be completed in the shortest possible time.

[Associated Press, Manila, 4th] Former US-Philippines Army Chief of Staff and current advisor MacArthur suggested that Guam be built into an armed zone, because the island is located within the Philippine archipelago. If a war breaks out and enemy fleets seal off the Philippines, Guam can help and allow the Philippines to maintain a longer period of neutrality.

### British Merchants Urge the Government to Adopt a Tough Attitude Toward Japan: Believing That British Interests Will Be Occupied by Japan, They Should Actively Assist China, Which Was Insufficient in the Past

[Central News Agency, Mingdun, 4th] Those who have great financial and economic interests in China deeply hope that the government can adopt a tough attitude. Now the United States' attitude toward Japan is becoming increasingly tough, and at the same time, the United States has agreed to provide export credit guarantees to China. Therefore, those who enjoy financial and economic interests in China are very happy. The US credit guarantee to China is after the British should provide export credit guarantees to China. Although the US credit is not much, this move is extremely important to the morale of the Chinese people. As far as the US attitude is concerned, it will not change during the Sino-Japanese war. Therefore, the aid of the British and American governments is still a decisive factor in rebuilding the Chinese government's open door policy. Anyone who enjoys interests in China should pay close attention to this matter and understand the importance of this matter as soon as possible.

Diplomatic Protests Only Get Ridicule

[Lu) Tou Dun, 4th] Today, "The Times" and "Daily News" both published the British merchants' anxiety over the occupation of British interests in China by Japan. Lee, chairman of the Clerical Printing Union, wrote to The Times, strongly supporting Nicolson's letter of December 21, and condemning the British government's "long-term policy of enduring pain" in China, saying, "It is surprising that Britain has allowed its largest market to be occupied by Japan. British and other foreign interests in China have been deprived by Japan, and diplomatic protests can only get Japan's contempt and ridicule. If the British government does not change its 'long-term policy of enduring pain' and take active and tough actions, then British trade will only decline, and our dignity will also be reduced. Wuguo has invested 300 million pounds in China. British and American exports to China in 1938 were greatly reduced, while Japanese exports to China increased sharply. Since Japan seized Korea and 'Manchukuo,' British trade in these places is only 1%. If Japan's power is not stopped, then this situation will also occur in China. If we can promote export trade, we can cope with huge military expenditures and social undertakings."

Past Aid to China Was Really Insufficient

China has great potential for developing trade. The Chinese people love peace, and they should get our help. Our previous assistance was really insufficient.

In addition, Keeling wrote an article in the "Daily Telegraph" detailing the economic resources of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" and issued a warning against the speculation that Japan's financial and economic situation is about to collapse. He pointed out that Britain's foreign investment, except for Argentina, is the largest in China, saying, "If Japan can overcome its current financial difficulties and establish a Far East group, then Britain will be the first to suffer."

### When the British King Visits Canada, He Will Travel Along the Coast: He Will Go to the United States in Early June

[Reuters, London, 3rd] This morning, Britain and Canada issued an official announcement saying that when the British King and Queen return to Canada, they will have extensive travel along the coast. The King and Queen will leave Portsmouth on the "Driving" ship on May 8 and land in Quebec. After staying in Montreal for one day, they plan to stay at the Government Building in Ottawa for three nights, and then travel along the Canadian Pacific coast, visiting Kingston, Toronto, Fort William, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Banff, Vancouver, and Victoria. During the eastward journey, they will visit Jasper Park, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Shader Whiteley, Hamilton, and other places. Between June 8 and 11, the King and Queen will go to the United States at the invitation of President Roosevelt and his wife. After visiting the United States, they will return to Canada to visit Westbrooke, Moncton, Fredericton, Saint John, and Halifax, and leave Halifax for Newfoundland on June 15. They will visit the capital of Newfoundland on the 17th, and board the "Driving" ship to return to Portsmouth on the same night.

### Litvinov to Visit Poland at the End of the Month to Sign a New Trade Agreement and Discuss the Ukrainian Issue

[Haitong News Agency, Vienna, January 4th] It has been officially confirmed by Polish authorities that Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Mr. Litvinov is scheduled to visit Warsaw, the capital of Poland, at the end of this month. Mr. Litvinov will meet with Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and a new Soviet-Polish trade agreement may also be signed. The details of the agreement were finalized in Moscow before Christmas last year. The Polish side believes that the main topic of discussion between Litvinov and Beck will be the Ukrainian issue, as neither the Soviet Union nor Poland wants the issue of self-determination for the 40 million Ukrainians within the Soviet Union to become internationalized.

### Black Sea Storm Causes Many Sailors to Fall Overboard; Numerous Small Boats Capsize

[Central News Agency, Istanbul, January 4th] Violent storms raged in the Black Sea area yesterday, causing many casualties and significant material losses. All 22 sailors on the Turkish freighter "Maize" were drowned at sea. Many other sailors on other ships have gone missing, and it is feared that they have also been lost in the sea. The storm was most severe in the Kerch area, where twelve freighters ran aground in a very dangerous situation. Countless other small boats were destroyed and capsized.

### "Unnecessary" Germans to Be Deported from the Soviet Union; Secret Police in Various Regions Ordered to Expedite the Compilation of Lists of German Nationals

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, January 4th] According to reports from Moscow, the newly appointed head of the Soviet secret police, Mr. Beria, has ordered secret police agencies throughout the Soviet Union to compile lists of German nationals within two weeks. It is estimated that about 1,000 Germans are working in Soviet Russia. Those Germans deemed "unnecessary" will be deported before February 1st.

[Haitong News Agency, Tunis, January 4th] On the first day of French Premier Daladier's arrival in Tunis, no demonstrations occurred. Observers believe this is due to tight police security and the Italian community's adherence to discipline. Italian newspapers in North Africa are not criticizing the event, publishing the official announcements from both the French and Italian governments. Currently, much attention is focused on the official banquet to be held at the Grand Hotel on Tuesday evening, where Daladier will deliver an important speech. After this banquet, Daladier will travel to Gabès and inspect the border defenses there on Wednesday.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, January 4th] Italian newspapers are publishing articles commenting on Daladier's visit to Corsica, pointing out that Corsica contains Italian characteristics. The "Florentine Daily" stated in an article, "From the Prime Minister's perspective, Corsica is an integral part of Italy, and the local language, literature, culture, and customs are actually related to Tuscany and Sardinia." "La Folla" reported that Corsican architecture is clearly Italian style.

### French Premier Arrives in Tunis; Delivers Passionate Broadcast Speech; Vows to Protect Colonies and Resist External Threats

[Reuters, Tunis, January 4th] Last night, local and French demonstrators here broke the windows of an Italian clothing store and tore down the Italian flag. French Premier Daladier broadcast here, "I, as the leader of the government, tell you, 'The motherland protects its colonies as the colonies protect the motherland.'" He stated that the time has come for France and its colonies to be firmly united. He then proclaimed with passion, "France gives you order, laws, and freedom from oppression by violence and tyrannical governments. France has ample strength to guarantee your security. France is a peaceful and unified nation, unbreakable, with unlimited glory, possessing solid strength, ready to face external attacks and all dangers. We will not allow any pretext to divert the people of Tunis and France from their common great cause. In this land, we must establish a human society based on lofty ideals; only these lofty ideals can save the world and prevent it from falling into slavery." His speech was punctuated with constant applause.

[Reuters, Tunis, January 4th] French Premier Daladier arrived in Tunis city today, where he was warmly welcomed by the French and Muslim communities. The crowds were so dense as he proceeded to the residence of the Governor-General of Tunis that the police had difficulty maintaining order. The roads were so chaotic and congested that the Prime Minister's car had trouble passing. A demonstration against Daladier occurred outside the Palace of Tunis, but the demonstrators were dispersed by the Governor-General's guards and their banners were torn down. In his welcome to Daladier, the Governor-General stated, "Your Excellency can be certain that the people of Tunis will aid France when necessary. I can guarantee this here."

Brief Commentary

### An Ambassador's Blunder

A country's diplomatic envoys are representatives of its nation and government; the position of ambassador is the highest among these representatives. According to diplomatic custom, an ambassador is not only sufficient to represent the government of a country, but also its head of state. Therefore, an ambassador's statements are often the basis for international negotiations, not to mention their importance to world opinion. In the past, China was closed and isolated, and strictly speaking, had no diplomacy to speak of. In recent decades, under the aggression of imperialism, most diplomatic envoys only had the name of conducting diplomacy, but were unable to truly seek benefits for the nation. However, after the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, the situation changed drastically. For example, Dr. Wellington Koo, our ambassador to France, was indeed able to give full play to his talents and bring honor to the country. However, according to recent foreign news reports, our ambassador to a certain major power carelessly made public remarks, based on his own speculations, claiming that our country had expressed peace intentions to Japan. He also gave a lengthy speech at a banquet, lacking thorough observations about the situation, and drawing a pessimistic conclusion about the future of the war of resistance. Now that facts speak louder than words, our country is becoming more courageous as we fight, while the enemy has become "an arrow at the end of its flight." Presumably, the ambassador who has always "valued reality" must now deeply regret his past blunders. However, at the time, this kind of defeatist pessimism not only disheartened our compatriots overseas, but also made people in the ambassador's host country question the reliability of our country's long-term resistance and the reliability of our government's national policy. Therefore, we deeply regret the ambassador's blunder. According to the integrity of a diplomat, if careless statements harm the interests of the country, he should resign to apologize to the people, because as a national envoy, he should not have the freedom to criticize basic national policies. We hope that the ambassador will know how to conduct himself, and we further hope that the government will in the future pay more strict attention to whether the candidates for diplomatic envoys are suitable, and whether their words and deeds are correct!

Beware of New Conspiracies by Capitulationists

Since the Central Government resolved to punish Wang Jingwei, the activities of the capitulationists have suffered a major blow, and the temporary failure of the capitulationists has further contributed to the accelerated collapse of the Konoe Cabinet. However, we must not mistakenly believe that the activities of the traitors have ceased. We must be even more wary of their new conspiracies. There are two pieces of news worth noting: First, the traitors are spreading rumors about the "reddening" of our government, claiming that the "Wang faction" and the "right wing" are being purged, and that "Sun Ke and Chen Cheng are leading the organization of a left-leaning government." In particular, the capitulationists are using their privately-run newspapers to fabricate rumors and incite the people. The second piece of news is that the capitulationists are always using a ruse, deciding to sacrifice a few individuals to issue statements denying their previous absurd telegrams. The main intention of the first piece of news is to confuse international perceptions, sow discord in our internal unity, and hinder our international aid. However, the rumors are too bizarre, and sensible people at home and abroad will not believe them. In fact, not only has the Communist Party repeatedly declared its support for Chairman Chiang and the National Government, but this time the Central Government's punishment of Wang was also the result of a unanimous resolution by all the Central Committee members in Chongqing, including many former confidants of Wang. The intention of the second piece of news is to confuse all parties and divert attention. Of course, the country still hopes that Wang will not make mistake after mistake and repent. However, the so-called method of self-renewal is definitely not something that can be achieved with a single piece of paper, but must be expressed with concrete facts. In short, the traitors are in dire straits, and their conspiracy activities have by no means ceased. We must be even more vigilant in the future. The unanimous condemnation of Wang by various circles is indeed a very good phenomenon, but it is hoped that all sectors of society will make even stronger expressions of support for the Central Government, deal heavy blows to the activities of pro-Japanese elements, traitors, and capitulationists, and effectively restrain all rumors that incite the people!

### U.S. Naval Maneuvers Next Month on the 13th to Demonstrate Naval Strength and Test Panama Canal Defenses

[Central News Agency, New York, January 3rd] Seven warships from the Brooklyn Navy Yard sailed south yesterday, marking the first act of the large-scale U.S. naval maneuvers. 140 warships and 100 aircraft will participate in these maneuvers, the purpose of which is to make European and South American countries aware of the strength of the U.S. Navy. The authorities have designated these maneuvers as "Naval Problem No. 2," and they are officially scheduled to take place on February 13th. At that time, the fleet participating in the exercises will be divided into attacking and defending forces, the purpose of which is to test the defenses of the Panama Canal. Brazil, Colombia, and other extreme southern nations are also planning to send troops to observe the maneuvers. According to the New York Times' naval correspondent, when the maneuvers begin, the authorities will take over all radio equipment along the U.S. East Coast and apply it uniformly. Commercial shipping in the maneuver zone will also be required to assist.

### German Spies Penetrate U.S. Aircraft and Ship Manufacturing Plants; Communists Plot to Seize U.S. Political Power

[Associated Press, Washington, January 4th] It is reported that spies of the German National Socialist Party have penetrated American aircraft manufacturing plants and naval shipyards in an attempt to obtain secret plans for the latest warships. In addition, the German authorities plan to form a strict branch of German-Americans. If this plan is realized, a mixed group will appear in the United States under the leadership of the swastika to subvert the government. It is reported that U.S. investigations have only discovered the external secrets. It is also heard that the Communist Party plans to infiltrate the internal structures of the two major U.S. political parties, and will concentrate all its efforts in the next two years to form a national labor party to seize power.

### Japan in ××

— Author San Bo

Translated by Bao Ren from World News And Views, November Edition

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, the economic situation within Japan has deteriorated, becoming an arrow at the end of its flight. Due to China's arduous and determined long-term resistance, Japan's gold reserves have been depleted. When the war began, its gold reserves were 1,700,000,000 yen, but as of August 1st of this year, its gold reserves were only 596,000,000 yen.

In the first half of this year, Japan's import volume increased by 34% compared to the same period last year, because of the lack of domestic raw materials. 60% of its export goods rely on foreign raw materials for manufacturing, especially cotton and wool, accounting for 99%. Due to Japan's trade deficit, its economy is declining. In the first half of 1938, it spent a total of 195 million yen in reserves. After that, it will be unable to purchase raw materials from abroad to manufacture munitions.

According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of International Trade, U.S. imports of military raw materials to Japan, including copper, iron, motorcycles, aircraft, iron, and gasoline, have gradually decreased. This year's import volume is 25% to 85% lower than last year. Since the beginning of the war, its war expenses have reached 7 billion yen, accounting for 50% of the annual national income. The total amount of its issued government bonds has reached 18 billion yen.

Domestic prices are also rising rapidly. Rice prices are 30% higher than before the war, barley is 57% higher, meat is 41% higher, and other daily necessities, especially imported goods, are twice as expensive as before the war.

The actual wages of domestic workers are also declining drastically. The working hours of military factories have been extended to 16 hours per day. Most factories have been forced to close due to the impact of the war, and the number of unemployed workers has increased to 1.8 million this year.

Japan's rural economy has been on the verge of collapse. Generally, farmers suffer from reduced labor due to the conscription of young men and horses. At the same time, there is a shortage of agricultural tools and fertilizers, so production is insufficient to meet their own needs. Coupled with various harsh taxes and levies, farmers are frowning and complaining endlessly.

Due to the high cost of living, the livelihoods of poor peasants, small business workers, and craftsmen are facing difficulties. The number of people committing suicide due to lack of food and clothing is becoming increasingly common. The people are resentful of the government's oppression and acts of aggression.

Rising prices and wage cuts have caused constant strikes in Japan. In April this year, 2,500 workers at the Tokyo Electric Factory went on strike, demanding that the factory increase wages, and achieved partial victory. On May 4, 2,960 male and female workers at the Fuji Textile Factory went on strike, demanding improved treatment. In mid-June, workers at 25 military factories in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, jointly went on strike, demanding increased wages, and won complete victory.

Rural farmers also occasionally have riots, demanding that the government reduce or exempt land taxes during the period when the head of the household is on active duty. The struggle between landlords and farmers is growing, and the people's anti-war sentiment is increasing day by day.

The so-called general mobilization law implemented by Japan has caused the domestic small and medium-sized enterprises to decline sharply. Generally, small and medium-sized business owners are very resentful because they are deeply affected. The number of people arrested for opposition is countless. In the first two weeks of August this year, 10,800 merchants and shopkeepers were arrested and imprisoned.

According to various statistics, the losses suffered by the Japanese side in this Sino-Japanese War (from the beginning of the war to August of this year) are far greater than those in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905."

Current Sino-Japanese War

Russo-Japanese War

Mobilized Personnel……2,000,000+ 1,100,000

Casualties……700,000+ 200,000

War Expenses…7,000,000,000 Yen 2,300,000,000 Yen

Average Daily Expenses……20,000,000 Yen 3,600,000 Yen

More than 700 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed.

Although the Japanese military repeatedly trumpets the war at home and uses sweet words to deceive their people, the Japanese people have never been interested in this war. In August this year, Japanese Major General Takata once spoke on a fascist newspaper, one of which said: "It is regrettable that the Japanese people are indifferent to this war." Now the Japanese people's hatred of the military's war of aggression has turned into a strong anti-war sentiment. At first, the Japanese military's slogan for invading China was to fight a quick battle and make a quick decision, but now it has been changed to a long-term war. Recently, Koiso Kuniaki said: "Japan is forced to prepare for a war that will last for ten years." Later, Araki Sadao added: "We will not hesitate to prolong the war to twenty or thirty years."

At present, the anti-war upsurge in Japan has reached its peak. At the same time, in the Japanese army fighting in China, acts of disobedience and anti-war often occur. Incidents of suicide and mutiny are also gradually increasing. The reason why Matsui Iwane, the former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, was summoned back to the country was that he failed to maintain the discipline of the "Imperial Army". There are countless young people who evade military service and go missing, and deserters who are arrested and killed. Now the Japanese military has reorganized and re-assigned this group of anti-war deserters to guard the POW camps in North China.

The suffering and resentment of the families of soldiers towards the war have made the Japanese military feel uneasy. Its conscription system has plunged the government's internal affairs into a quagmire, which has greatly affected the morale of the frontline troops.

At present, the Communist Party of Japan is conducting secret activities. The atmosphere is boiling, and the Japanese military is extremely anxious about this. Although it has repeatedly suppressed it, it is still ineffective. The Communist Party's anti-war propaganda work is active everywhere, whether in factories, rural areas, or in the army, there are their traces. Generally, the peasant and worker classes, and even the small and medium bourgeoisie, are also actively promoting peace and resisting the military.

### British Unemployed Workers Carry a Coffin to Protest for Relief; Clash with Police When Delivered to the Prime Minister's Residence

[Reuters, London, January 2nd] Members of the British National Unemployed Workers' Movement planned to send a coffin to 10 Downing Street, but were stopped by the police. A large truck arrived on Downing Street and stopped outside the Prime Minister's residence. Several people jumped out of the truck, and people inside the truck began to push out a black coffin, painted with the words "The unemployed, their request for relief has been denied." One person went to the number 10 door and spoke to the attendant inside the door, while his companions pushed the coffin off the truck, intending to take it to the front of the number 10 door. Six police officers discovered this and rushed to the scene to intervene, and a dispute over the coffin broke out between the two sides. The police kept the coffin in the truck and ordered the truck to drive away immediately. At the same time, 100 unemployed workers gathered on Downing Street to demand winter relief. Prime Minister Chamberlain was spending his holiday in the countryside, so he did not witness the incident.

### New Situation in the Pacific After a Year and a Half of War

— Ji Yuan

However, the pleasant dream of the British gentlemen in the Far East was finally shattered by the artillery fire of the Japanese military, not long after the Munich Conference was established. The Japanese military blatantly ignored everything, and without prior notice to the British, directly landed in South China and attacked Guangzhou. The sound of compromise between Britain and Japan suddenly sank to the bottom of the sea, and what arose instead was the joint front of Britain and France in the Far East. At the same time, the British Cabinet passed a resolution at the end of October to strengthen the Far East Fleet. In view of the seriousness of the current international situation, Chamberlain decided to expand the air force and navy on a large scale. For the navy, 45 ships totaling 355,705 tons will be launched in 1939. After these 45 ships are launched, there are still many other ships that can continue to be launched, including two 40,000-ton battleships, four heavy cruisers, three cruisers, and other smaller ships are not counted. This large-scale shipbuilding phenomenon is also unprecedented since the European War.

Regarding the naval and air force bases in the Pacific, since the completion of the Singapore naval port this autumn, further efforts have been made to strengthen it. For example, the strengthening of Hong Kong's air defense and the increase in the number of mechanized army infantry and artillery units is an example. And the naval and air force bases in Australia are also being greatly strengthened because of their connection with Singapore and Hong Kong. Chamberlain also personally visited the French authorities in Paris in November this year. In addition to European issues, the critical situation in the Far East was also the focus of discussion. Under the goal of common defense, Britain and France adopted close ties for their Far East policies, and France's policy towards the Far East turned to be more active due to British support. The recent freedom of anti-Japanese movements in the French territories in the Far East is the best evidence of this. The French authorities have also decided to strengthen the naval and air defenses of Annam, preparing to take joint intervention actions with Britain when necessary. In the past few months, Japanese diplomacy has made several attempts to intimidate France, but until recently, they lost face and disappeared.

Five

The third sign is the shift of the Soviet Union's military and diplomatic center of gravity to the Far East, and the increasing closeness of Sino-Soviet relations.

The Soviet Union's military budget for this year has increased to 27 billion rubles. Because of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of concession towards Germany, and hopes to have further cooperation and friendship with the United States. As for Sino-Soviet relations, judging from the recent development of events, it can be asserted that in the later stages of the war of resistance, it will become the main force to support us.

Although Soviet Russia has no military action against Japan in the Far East at present, we should understand that under the current situation, rather than hoping that Soviet Russia will fight against Japan, it is better to hope that Soviet Russia will help us more, because in this way, it can dismantle the fascist cohesiveness and strengthen it.

In short, today, a year and a half after the start of the war of resistance, the relations between the great powers in the Pacific have undergone significant changes, and Japan has fallen into a dilemma of being surrounded on all sides. In 1939, it is very likely that the great powers will intervene in the actions of Japanese imperialism in the Far East.

Special Essay

### Hope for the American Congress

— Song Feiru

The diplomatic conflict between the United States and Japan has recently reached a point of intense confrontation, even if it does not immediately escalate into war between the United States and Japan, "the economic war in the Pacific will reach unprecedented heights." After the war in Guangdong and Hubei, Japan on the one hand declared that the "Nine-Power Treaty" was not applicable to "the new situation in East Asia," and on the other hand, it actually blocked China's economic interests for its own exclusive occupation. The United States subsequently submitted a serious note to Japan on October 6 of last year. Although it received a reply from Japan on November 18, it was still full of sophistry, and the United States was greatly dissatisfied. Therefore, it submitted a second note to Japan the day before yesterday, the content of which is more specific and can be summarized into three points: (1) Pointing out that the Japanese side's restrictions on the behavior and activities of overseas Chinese American people have placed Japan's interests in a superior position, and its impact has undoubtedly given discriminatory treatment to the legitimate interests of American expatriates; (2) Pointing out that this restriction method is unfair and unfounded, and is far from violating the current provisions of international treaties; (3) Declaring that the American people and government cannot agree to the establishment of a rule by a third country in China, acting arbitrarily, and seizing the rights of equal opportunity and fair treatment that the United States has long enjoyed; (4) Declaring that the basic principle of equal opportunity cannot be canceled by a unilateral statement, and denying Japan's right to establish a "new order" in the Far East.

The 76th Congress of the United States convened on the 3rd of this month. The United States government has planned to submit to Congress the data on Japan's discrimination against American commerce in the occupied areas of China, preparing to adopt a positive bill to impose economic sanctions on Japan. At a time when the Japanese aggressors' conspiracy to monopolize China is gradually becoming panicked, and the momentum of sanctions against Japan by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is gradually taking effect, the attitude of the United States towards Japan and the resolution of the United States Congress are very important. We would like to offer a few opinions here for the reference of the world, especially the American people.

(1) Economic sanctions against Japan by all countries in the world have reached the point where they need to be effectively implemented. Mere diplomatic notes or verbal resistance cannot awaken the obsessed Japanese aggressors. The current economic discrimination against Britain, the United States, and other countries implemented by Japan is just as listed in the second American note: controlling foreign exchange, forcing the circulation of counterfeit currency, arbitrarily modifying tariffs, and promoting Japan's economic monopoly in China; the United States government should also retaliate against Japan in the same way. We believe that the United States government intends to implement active measures. Newspaper propaganda states that whether President Roosevelt will invoke the provisions of Article 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act depends on whether the American public empowers him. This means that if Congress resolves that the United States can implement this clause against Japan, the United States government will implement it immediately. The American people have always been most enthusiastic in sympathizing with China's resistance against Japan, and since the loss of Guangzhou, the stronghold in southern China, American trade has also been lost due to the establishment of Hong Kong (from January to August last year, American exports to China via Hong Kong accounted for 30% of the total amount. The "Kokumin Shimbun," the organ of the Japanese military headquarters, recently advocated occupying Hong Kong). Whether or not it can preserve its rights and interests in China thereafter depends entirely on whether the American people can grant the United States government the power to implement retaliatory measures.

(2) Japan not only wants to monopolize China's economic rights and interests, but also attempts to actively enter Latin America. In recent years, Japan's entry into various small countries in Central and South America has been very significant. Recently, as President Luo said in his opening speech prepared to be read in Congress, "the three countries (referring to Japan, Germany, and Italy) are also united in their desire to search for markets and political interests in Latin America." At a time when the United States is currently striving for a close combination of "Pan-America" and the American countries all rely on the United States for effective leadership, whether the United States can actively prevent the aggressors of Germany and Japan from infringing on the Americas will determine whether the entire unity of the Americas can be successful and whether it can be consolidated thereafter.

(3) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are already prepared to cooperate effectively with the United States to stop the madness of international adventurers in the Far East. The recent consultations between Britain and France have not been limited to European issues or dealing with Italy, but have also given deep consideration to the Far East issue. Thereafter, Japan's further military actions in southern China will objectively promote cooperation between Britain and France. Britain has signed a trade treaty with the United States that has military and political significance, and its sincerity in cooperation is evident. In addition, as the Soviet Union and the United States have fewer points of conflict due to increasingly close trade relations, objective cooperation is very possible. Subjectively, the Soviet Union also hopes that Soviet-American cooperation will be realized. A few days ago, a certain parliamentary session on the Soviet government side discussed future diplomatic policies, and at that time, effective cooperation with the United States was listed as the most important item. Furthermore, based on the common nature of the Soviet Union and the United States in suppressing the aggressors of Germany and Japan, the eagerness of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is 100% reliable. What the Soviet Union is concerned about is the United States' adherence to the "isolationist policy," but the American public opinion has inferred when lending money to China that amending the isolation law this year is an important reason, then the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States completely depends on the attitude of this Congress.

The American people's enthusiasm for demanding that the government impose economic sanctions on Japan has been seen in their speeches (some even say that the United States has invisibly participated in Japan's war against China because it supplies Japan with various munitions and military raw materials) and actions (many workers refuse to load Japanese goods ashore and American goods on ships, and the general public also refuses to buy Japanese goods). The Congress, which represents the will of the people, can frankly grant the President the power to implement regulations to sanction Japan: "For any country that discriminates against American merchants, heavy tariffs may be levied on imported goods, and the goods of any other country may be prohibited from being loaded and imported by ships of that country that excludes the United States"; or even "all trade with that country that excludes the United States may be prohibited."

This is what we hope from the American Congress. At the same time, we also hope that the public opinion of the United States and other countries will jointly promote it!

### Recent Developments in Guerrilla County Administration in Shanxi

— Shu

[Our newspaper's communication from Jixian] The changes and reforms of the political institutions in Shanxi began at the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident. At that time, the Pacification Office and the Provincial Government, in order to make the political institutions of Shanxi suitable for wartime needs, issued a general order to the county authorities that in the event of a fierce attack by the enemy or the fall of the county seat, the county magistrate must lead the people's self-defense forces and guerrillas to move the county administration to the countryside and continue to perform the duties of the county magistrate. Later, Yanbei, Taiyuan, and Linfen fell one after another. Subsequently, the enemy launched a large-scale military offensive in southern and western Shanxi. At this time, the entire county administration of Shanxi was established in the countryside, implementing its guerrilla life.

What exactly is the county administration mechanism in Shanxi like now? Its new political mechanism can be divided into the following points:

(1) In the guerrilla areas of northern Shanxi, the county government has changed the four sections of General Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education to four sections of District Administration (First Section), Economy (Second Section), Military Affairs (Third Section), and Civil Training (Fourth Section). General Affairs has been changed to a subsection under the Administrative Section, construction matters are included in the Military Affairs Section, and education matters are merged into the Civil Training Section. This reform has actually expanded the scope of work of each section.

(2) In the First Administrative District (Wutai District), there have been some changes in the mobilization committees of each county. Originally, in counties where the administrative institutions were not sound and civil movements were relatively backward, the mobilization committee was a semi-political organization that mobilized manpower, materials, and financial resources. However, in counties where the political power was well-established, it was an organization that obstructed the consolidation of political power. Therefore, at present, in the First Administrative District of Shanxi, the joint meeting of county magistrates has decided to return the tasks of the mobilization committee that belong to the county administration to the county government.

(3) There have also been some new changes in the mobilization committees in other districts. The Political Department of the Second War Zone once stipulated that the county political institutions should be based on the principle of collective leadership formed by the mobilization committee. Five sections, such as political affairs, economy, civil movement, armed forces, and education and construction, should be established under the county mobilization committee. In this way, it is felt to be simpler and more flexible to use.

(4) In order to quickly correct errors and effectively implement laws and regulations, the county governments regularly convene representatives of various mass organizations to hold administrative inspection meetings. Sometimes, the county magistrates of several counties also convene in one place. However, the powers are still strictly divided. Administration cannot replace the work of civil movement personnel, and civil movement cannot infringe on the powers of administration.

(5) The third and sixth administrative districts of Shanxi have implemented the popular election of district and village chiefs and the participation of mass representatives in the district and village mobilization committees, etc. These are the characteristics of today's county administration in Shanxi.

The second is the work done by the guerrilla county government:

(1) The primary task of the guerrilla county government is to thoroughly destroy the puppet regime of the traitors. It not only thoroughly attacks the puppet maintenance associations, but also strives to have those who have been forced by the enemy to act as traitors serve us. For example, in the eighth administrative district, the maintenance association of a certain county regularly supplied our side with food and important news from the mountains. Therefore, the enemy's puppet regime either could not be established at all, or it was established but was of no use to it.

(2) It is to mobilize a wide range of mass organizations to gather around the government, such as the Sacrifice League, the Peasants' Salvation Association, the Workers' Salvation Association, the Children's Salvation Association, and the Women's Salvation Association. Today, these mass organizations are not only loyal supporters and executors of government laws and regulations, but can also, under the leadership of the government, do sentry duty, investigate the enemy's situation, inspect pedestrians, carry out anti-traitor movements, punish bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people, and launch guerrilla warfare to assist the army in attacking the enemy.

(3) It is to organize powerful self-defense forces and guerrillas who have left production. Due to the enemy's atrocities such as burning, looting, slaughter, and rape, every member of the public deeply hates them. With the government to lead them, the public is automatically organized like a rising storm. Therefore, the number of self-defense forces and guerrillas in Shanxi is countless.

(4) Due to the call of the guerrilla county government, the military and civilians have begun close cooperation. The government not only mobilizes the public to help the army fight, but also calls on the public to help local friendly troops solve their difficulties and try to supply food and other military supplies. The people everywhere destroy the enemy's transportation, demolish city walls and forts, and implement rapid emptying of the fields, making it extremely difficult and obstructed for the enemy to attack a certain area or occupy a city or town.

(5) It is the reasonable burden and the concrete implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction.

In addition, the new county administration in Shanxi today, in addition to the above points, at the same time, the guerrilla county magistrates are not only able to fight bravely, but also able to endure hardship. They automatically reduce their living expenses to below five yuan. When the county seat falls, they perform the duties of the county magistrate in the countryside. Sometimes, they even move from one village to another due to the pursuit of the enemy, but they do not leave the county boundary even one step. They are even less willing to let go of every favorable opportunity to disturb the enemy and assist the regular army in fighting. Therefore, among the 105 counties in Shanxi today, except for the two counties in northern Shanxi (the current provincial government has issued an order to the Wutai District Committee to appoint county magistrates), the remaining 102 counties have established our complete county administration power, and there are more than 7,000 such new county magistrates.

### Enhancing National Dynamism

— Chen Lifu

The function of education lies in cultivating virtue and achieving talent. Cultivating virtue begins with self-cultivation, and achieving talent is for the benefit of the group. In other words, cultivating young people through moral, intellectual, and physical education to make them suitable for group life is the main goal of education. The discussion of new education in China has been going on for decades, but the number of scholars who have achieved success is still small, and there are few talents who can be put to use. The study of books is mostly useless learning, and the effect on the way of rectifying virtue, benefiting the people, and enriching life is minimal, which does not require detailed explanation. I have always believed that the education of the revival of the Six Arts is the priority of today's regular tasks. The loss of music in education is the key to the failure of past education. Remedying shortcomings and correcting biases cannot be delayed, and there is no other way to change course.

Confucius' education started with the Six Arts, and among the Six Arts, rites and music were the most important. There are two explanations for the Six Arts. One is: rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic. As Yan Xizhai said, rites are to regulate the five relationships, music is to harmonize the five relationships, and archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic are to assist these five relationships. The order in which they are placed can be explained by Mr. Cheng's theory. The other is: poetry, books, rites, music, Yi, and Spring and Autumn Annals. Poetry and books are for self-cultivation, rites and music are for benefiting the group. The Yi and Spring and Autumn Annals use the laws of heaven to clarify the good and bad fortune of human affairs, and explain the changes in the world to distinguish the gains and losses of responding to them, which is for the use of the world. In both theories, rites and music are mentioned, and there is no doubt that they are studies that combine theory and practice.

During the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty, culture and education flourished, and education was integrated into art. That is why Confucius sighed, "How flourishing is its culture!" The Taibo chapter says, "Be inspired by poetry, establish yourself with rites, and complete yourself with music." Learning poetry and rites must be completed with music, so the importance of music education can be further seen. Therefore, in the education of Chengjun, Dasi Cheng, Xiaosi Cheng, and Lexu all presided over music. In the Zhou official system, Dasi Yue, Yue Shi, Da Xu, and Xiao Xu all presided over learning (the so-called "governing the learning and politics of building the country"). It is also like in the Book of Documents ordering the princes to belong to the Dianyue and the music officials, who actually presided over education. So the position of music in education at that time can be imagined to be important. The Inner Canon says, "At thirteen, learn music, recite poetry, dance with spoons, complete chapters, learn archery and charioteering, and dance with elephants." The education of the Zhou Dynasty actually planted its foundations with music. The reason is to cultivate one's temperament, to make it harmonious, and to still guide the flourishing vitality, so that scholars can achieve success and everyone knows how to strive for themselves.

After the Qin and Han dynasties, classical music was lost. Those who made music only recorded its drums, dances, and chimes, and the Confucian scholars could not understand its meaning. Not only were rites destroyed and music collapsed, but the education of the Six Arts also declined. In the Wei and Jin dynasties, learning was used to provide eloquent speech. In the Tang and Song dynasties, it was corrected by taking reading as learning the Way. As a result, scholars groaned about their pens without benefiting the world. The foundation of the country was already shaken, and the national character was thus degraded, leading to dispersion, disorder, licentiousness, and weakness. Who can be held responsible? It is all due to the loss of music education. The ranks are not straight, advances and retreats are not uniform, likes and dislikes are not balanced, and people drift away and forget to return. The influence of things on people is endless, and people's likes and dislikes have no moderation. This is what the Book of Music means when it says, "When things arrive, they are transformed in reverse, destroying great principles and exhausting human desires." As a result, there are hearts of rebellion, deception, and falsehood, and there are events of lewdness and rebellion. The strong coerce the weak, the many abuse the few, the wise deceive the foolish, the brave suffer from cowardice, the sick are not cared for, and the old, young, orphaned, and lonely do not get their due. The destruction is heartbreaking!

The purpose of rites and music lies in benefiting the group, and the group's character is based on organization. The key to a strong organization is, first, strength, and second, dynamism. Strength is to sustain its survival, and dynamism is to promote its development. As the saying goes, "To pacify those above and govern the people, nothing is better than rites; to change customs and transform habits, nothing is better than music." Rites have the power of stability, and stability makes the organization strong. Music is rich in the opportunity for development, and development makes the organization dynamic. They must be used in conjunction with each other and work together. When rites are clear and music is complete, they can become self-reliant and never cease. But rites are made from the outside, and music is born from the heart. The use of rites lies in regulating individuals within the common rules, and the use of music lies in expressing individuals within the collective action. Therefore, rites cannot avoid being reluctantly practiced, while music can be practiced in peace. Music is based on movement, with ups and downs, advances and retreats, fast and slow, and sound and appearance are both beautiful, so it is easy to be joyful and follow, and the interests are all raised, so it is naturally moderate. Therefore, the flourishing of courage can revitalize the weakness of will; arranging the ranks can cure the dispersion of body and mind; "advancing and retreating as a brigade" can manage the disorder of things; and peacefulness and harmony can correct the licentiousness of temperament. Chinese culture, spanning five thousand years, although there is nothing that does not return, the scenery is always new, but if music education is not cultivated, it will suppress the vitality too much and will tend to decline and old age, and the crisis of the nation cannot be ignored!

The disadvantage of the single implementation of rites education is that the atmosphere is solemn, easily flowing into rigidity, and the tendency of conservatism is more, then the courage of advancement is insufficient. Like the seasons, the convergence of autumn and winter is ultimately not as smooth as the vitality of spring and summer. The ancient blind musicians proclaimed that in spring they recite poetry, in summer they play stringed instruments, and in autumn and winter they teach books and rites, which also shows that they follow nature and teach according to the seasons. The relationship between culture and life is often similar. By middle age, there have been many experiences, and experience continues to grow, but creation does not easily attempt. The fact that our culture has reached middle age is a fact, so we must restore the original to restore its innocence, catch up to strengthen ourselves and never cease. It is recorded: "The way of heaven and earth, cold and heat are not always equal." Education is the cold and heat of our people. If education is not timely, it will harm the world." Therefore, adapting to the times and promoting self-reliance and regeneration, music is actually a medicine for saving the world in education.

The disadvantage of overemphasizing rites education is that although the form exists, the essence does not. Overemphasizing books and neglecting application, recognizing the meaning of empty reading, exegesis, and doctrine as the way of metaphysics, and belittling the practical skills of archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic as the skills of metaphysics. The result is that intellectual education cannot benefit the people, physical education cannot bear heavy burdens and go far, and even moral education has less merit in self-cultivation, family governance, and peace, and more merit in writing books and making statements. Pale-faced scholars cannot distinguish between soybeans and wheat, and they cannot govern themselves when used to govern others, and they cannot support themselves when expected to support others. When wielding weapons to defend the country, the path of literary and military arts has been divided for a long time, and there is no strength to defend themselves and others. Tracing the cause, there is more time spent learning to be still than learning to move, and the power of practice is used to study literature, so how can scholars not only have a dying body? How can the world not present a picture of twilight and沉沉? To treat its vital points and revive its wasted diseases, there is no other way to find but to revive music education.

The matter of music involves instruments, sounds, and appearances. The instruments are bells, drums, pipes, chimes, feathers, flutes, shields, and axes. The sounds are songs, and the appearances are dances. Listening to its sounds, the will is broadened; learning its bowing and raising, the appearance becomes solemn; performing its ranks, grasping its rhythm, the ranks are straight, and advances and retreats are uniform. Its teaching is one, and moral, intellectual, and physical education are all contained in it. Changing customs and transforming habits, and shaping temperament, then moral education is good; the hands dance, and the feet step, then physical education exists, and the introduction of Shang and engraving of Yu, dividing skills without loss, five tones and seven rhythms, reciprocally becoming palaces! "The same law measures and balances" is used as the standard, and "coordinating the time, month, government, and day" is used as the basis, then intellectual education is also captured. And its wonderful use is to unify and love, and to be close to all the people. The orderly and unified pace, the harmonious and cordial sound, circulate the spirit. Moving the mind, blood vessels, nourishing moderation and virtue, and saving the deviation of temperament.

When the great cause of nation-building is beginning, music education is enough to wash away flaws and embrace new opportunities.

Mr. Zi's discussion of sounds generally mentions the five: bells, stones, silk, bamboo, drums, and chimes. He said that when a gentleman hears the sound of bells, he thinks of military ministers; when he hears the sound of chimes, he thinks of ministers who died defending the border; when he hears the sound of zithers and lutes, he thinks of ministers with will and righteousness; when he hears the sound of reed pipes and Sheng, he thinks of ministers who raise livestock; when he hears the sound of drums and chimes, he thinks of generals. It is sufficient to know that the sound of flourishing and courage is enough to stimulate ambition, and the dance of shields and axes is enough to discuss military preparations. Therefore, the small self composes poetry, and the hegemony of Qin becomes greater day by day. The Marseillaise is arising, and the French revolution is successful. During the War of Resistance, to plan how to inspire people's hearts and arouse morale, music education has the greatest function.

The function of incense music education, as described above, can restore the foundation of the country with the Six Arts, save the decline of national morality, save the crisis of national aging, awaken the attention of practical science, collect the effect of uniting the spirit, and use the construction of the organizational foundation to eliminate the common hatred of the enemy to meet the needs of the War of Resistance. Therefore, when the second phase of the War of Resistance begins and the education of nation-building is initiated, the urgency of correcting the deviation and the importance of the status are self-evident. Its influence on people is extremely profound, so its effect is also extremely rapid. "The evening drum and morning bell are thought-provoking," and the religious have already known and utilized it before me. Can the enhancement of national motivation not be sought here!

### The Oil Mine in Xikang Can Supply the World for 300 Years, Making It the Most Promising Virgin Land for Development; Coal Reserves in Five Provinces Reach Over 80 Trillion Tons

[Kangding Communication] The government has been actively implementing plans for the development of mineral resources in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, with the mining of coal and oil receiving particular attention. Coal and oil are fuels that China currently lacks and urgently needs. Currently, more than 50 official and private companies are working on coal mining, and in the future, production will increase to meet national needs. Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Xikang have the largest oil reserves, and efforts will be made to mine them to curb the outflow of money. It is learned that the current estimated amount of coal reserves in the southwest is 9.874 trillion tons in Sichuan, 1.672 trillion tons in Yunnan, 1.549 trillion tons in Guizhou, 71.950 trillion tons in Shaanxi, and 2 million tons of annual production in Gansu, totaling over 85.045 trillion tons of coal reserves in the five provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Among them, western Shaanxi has the largest amount, ranking second in China. The annual production in the past was 1.4333 million tons, with Sichuan accounting for the majority at 1 million tons. As for oil, according to the survey of foreign experts, the oil reserves in the Ningjing Mountains of Xikang are the largest, and the reserves can supply the world for 300 years. In addition, the reserves in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces also reach 1.357 trillion barrels (one barrel is calculated as 42 gallons), which is 56.994 trillion gallons. Once this astonishing amount of reserves is opened, the profits will be incalculable. Therefore, the development of the rich resources of the southwestern and northwestern provinces, in addition to the coal reserves in the five provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Gansu, the oil mine in the Ningjing Mountains of Xikang is the most promising virgin land for development. This is also included in the government's development plan, so it will be actively mined soon.

### "December 25th" in Chongqing

— Yu

A Passionate Commemoration by 700,000 People

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing for This Newspaper] There are three meanings to commemorating "December 25th": (1) December 25th was originally the date of the Yunnan Uprising, which overthrew Yuan Shikai and eradicated the resurgence of imperial ambitions. It can also be seen as a commemorative day for laying the foundation for the revival of China and the establishment of the Republic. (2) It is the anniversary of the Xi'an Incident when the Leader escaped danger. (3) At the onset of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy becomes increasingly weary with each battle, while we become more courageous. In order to strive for final victory, we must unite more sincerely, accept the call of our Leader's great personality and spirit.

Like celebrating the New Year, the streets were lined with large red slogans on every household. National flags with the blue sky, white sun, and crimson ground hung from building tops and windows. Many families also hung four round lanterns. Although there was a constant drizzle from morning till night and thick, muddy ground, the enthusiasm of the general public attending the event was not diminished.

The expanded commemoration of the "December 25th" festival was held in three locations that day. The city district's venue was at the public stadium, a plaza capable of holding over 50,000 people. The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 4:00 PM. However, by 3:30 PM, it was already packed with representatives from over a thousand organizations, schools, and groups, as well as spontaneously participating civilians, leaving no space to move. Male and female actors from the Central Film Studio, local singers, and latecomers were all excluded, left to sigh from outside the venue. As a result, a human wall formed, extending from Linjiang Heng Street on the left to Chaijia Lane on the right, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Moreover, the areas near the venue and major streets were teeming with spectators, creating a joyful atmosphere.

In front of the rostrum, walls and railings were covered with banners dedicated to the Supreme Leader from all sectors. A "hada" (a piece of white silk representing respect) presented by representatives from the 108 Lamas of Lhasa was draped over the Leader's portrait, with foot-long tassels on each end. Looking down from the rostrum, one saw a forest of small flags, portraits of the Leader, lively dragon lanterns, and countless heads wearing straw hats and caps. The rain continued to fall, wetting the heads and feet of the crowd. However, what did that matter? Their hearts were filled with joy and excitement, so everyone stood tall, awaiting the commencement of the commemorative ceremony.

At precisely 4:00 PM, amidst booming cannon fire, the opening ceremony began, proceeding according to protocol under the leadership of Chairman Guo Yuyi. He reported the significance of the meeting, elaborating on the commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising and the Leader's escape from the Xi'an Incident, and solemnly declaring that the commemorative event was purely a spontaneous initiative inspired by the Leader's greatness, character, and spirit, without government orders, and absolutely reflected the true intentions of the people. After the speech, representatives from various sectors marched onto the stage to present flags, totaling over a hundred.

Next, Deputy Director He, representing the Chairman, read Chiang Kai-shek's message: "Today marks the anniversary of my return to Nanjing two years ago after escaping danger in Xi'an. Recalling the initial kidnapping by rebel generals caused endless anxiety among all comrades and the entire nation, who devised every possible way to rescue me, fully expressing their utmost care for the individual and the Party-state, for which I am deeply moved even now. Although my personal safety was a concern at the time, my individual life was of lesser importance. Under no circumstances could the nation be placed in a state of peril because of my personal life. Therefore, I resolved to dedicate my life to the cause in the face of danger, unmoved by intimidation, to preserve the integrity of the world and extend the life of the nation. Now, our enemy, Japanese imperialism, is constantly employing intimidation tactics against us, no different from the situation when I was kidnapped by rebel generals. They merely want us to stop the War of Resistance, accept humiliating terms, and deprive our nation of any hope of revival, turning our descendants into their slaves. I dare to solemnly declare to all comrades and compatriots that I will uphold my long-held aspiration and the resolution I made two years ago in the face of danger, and will never yield to the enemy's ferocious power and allow their delusions to come true. I will continue to lead all comrades and compatriots to engage in a long-term struggle, deal severe blows to the enemy, and complete the great mission of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. Today, you are all presenting flags to me, which clearly shows your ardent hope for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. While accepting this, I can only work even harder on the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, in order to live up to everyone's high expectations, and hope that everyone will rise up together and advance towards the path of light." This powerful instruction gave us a great deal of excitement and amid thunderous applause, the Chairman's message ended.

Among the guest speakers were General Lu Chao, representative of the National Government, Yang Minshan, representative of the Korean Revolutionary Party, and Aja Jiang Cuo, representative of the Lhasa Tibetan Comfort Team, who all expressed their utmost support for the Leader. Mr. Yang Minshan, the Korean representative, said, "China's War of Resistance is not only seeking the survival of the Chinese nation, but also seeking liberation for our Korean compatriots. Therefore, Korean compatriots have recently established the Righteous Men's Corps to directly participate in China's great War of Resistance. This volunteer corps is just the beginning of Korean compatriots' participation in the war. Now, for the liberation and survival of the two nations of China and Korea, all 33 million people of Korea will rise up together to help in the struggle." This further proves that in the midst of the violent enemy's invasion of China, its internal colonial territories have been fundamentally shaken.

Finally, the conference proposed three resolutions: (1) Seventy million citizens of Chongqing send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. (2) A telegram of comfort to the soldiers at the front. (3) Recommend to the central government and the Xingying that "December 25th" be designated as National Revival Day. These were unanimously approved with applause, the cheers reaching the sky. The sound of paper flags waving continued for five minutes. They shouted slogans, and starting in the dim twilight, teams set off on a torchlight parade. The procession stretched for over ten miles. The sounds of firecrackers, singing, and slogans filled the city of Chongqing, and the emotional tension reached its peak. (December 26th)

### Lastest News

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Central News Agency on the 4th] A Tokyo foreign dispatch reports that the general public believes Hiranuma will be ordered to form a cabinet. If so, Konoe will be transferred to serve as Chairman of the Privy Council, concurrently serving as a minister without portfolio. It is also reported that Minister of the Army Itagaki, Minister of the Navy Minei, Minister of Health and Welfare Kido, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita will all continue to serve, but Minister of Finance Iida, Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu, Minister of Agriculture Arima, Minister of Railways Nagae, and Minister of Railways Nakajima will all be dismissed. As for whether Minister of Support Araki and Minister of Colonial Affairs Ba will enter the cabinet, nothing has been heard.

### The Japanese Political Situation Becomes Increasingly Critical. The Konoe Cabinet Resigns En Masse. The National General Mobilization Law Intensifies the Collapse of the Cabinet. The Japanese Emperor Orders Hiranuma to Form a Cabinet.

[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Haitong News Agency, New News] The composition of the cabinet will likely be known late tonight. According to news circulating in political circles here, the cabinet may be composed of the following personnel: Prime Minister Hiranuma, Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita, Minister of the Army Itagaki, Minister of the Navy Hasegawa, Minister of Home Affairs Shiono, and Minister of Agriculture Sakai. Hasegawa is currently the Yokosuka Defense Commander and was formerly the commander of the fleet stationed in China. Shiono is the former Minister of Justice and has a very close personal relationship with Hiranuma. Sakai is a member of the House of Peers and also has a relationship with Hiranuma.

[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] Although the selection of new cabinet members has not been announced, speculation is widespread. It is generally believed that Hiranuma Kiichirō will serve as Prime Minister, Yūki Toyotarō as Minister of Finance, and Shiono Suehiko as Minister of Home Affairs. Hiranuma has previously served as the Vice Minister of Justice, Minister of Justice, and Vice President of the Privy Council in the Saionji cabinet.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Central News Agency on the 4th] A Tokyo foreign dispatch reports that the Japanese Emperor summoned Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei this afternoon to inquire about his opinion on the selection of new cabinet members. Yuasa requested that the Emperor first exchange views with Elder Saionji and then report back. Yuasa left Tokyo at 2:00 PM today to visit Saionji, and returned to Tokyo at 9:00 PM this evening. At that time, he directly entered the palace to recommend candidates for the cabinet based on Saionji's opinion. According to follow-up news, the Emperor has summoned Hiranuma to the palace to personally order him to form a cabinet.

[Special dispatch from Shanghai for this newspaper on the 4th] A Tokyo dispatch reports that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet has been brewing for a long time. In the emergency cabinet meeting convened at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:00 AM this morning, there was a sudden and drastic turn of events. Participants included Prime Minister Konoe and other cabinet ministers. After about an hour of discussion, it was decided that the cabinet would resign en masse. After the meeting, Konoe immediately entered the palace to see the Emperor and personally submit his resignation. At the same time, Minei and Itagaki separately convened meetings of the heads of the Navy and Army ministries. On the Navy side, attendees included Minister of the Navy Minei, Vice Minister Yamamoto, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Inoue, and Chief of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu. On the Army side, attendees included Minister of the Army Itagaki, Vice Minister Tojo, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Nakamura, Chief of the Personnel Bureau Anan, and Chief of the Accounting Bureau Ishikawa. The General Staff Headquarters also sent Vice Minister Tada to attend. As a result, the two ministries unanimously agreed to maintain close contact through liaison officers regarding the selection of the next prime minister. At the same time, Army Minister Itagaki visited Prince Kan'in Kotohito, the Chief of the General Staff, to report on the cabinet's resignation. After the collapse of the Konoe cabinet, the most popular candidate for the next prime minister is Hiranuma, the president of the Privy Council. Currently, all eyes are focused on Saionji's trip to Tokyo and the meeting of senior statesmen to be convened today and tomorrow. Konoe's Declaration of Resignation

[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] After resigning as Prime Minister, Konoe issued a declaration stating, "Japan's policy towards the Sino-Japanese war is entirely approved by His Majesty the Emperor, and therefore cannot be changed. This resignation is because I believe the country needs a 'fresh start.' Under the rule of the new cabinet, the people must concentrate their minds to build a new order in East Asia and resolutely maintain it. I feel that in order to deal with the new situation, we must implement some new measures so that the new cabinet has the responsibility to rely on." He also said, "I feel that my ability is insufficient and I am not worthy to continue in this position, so I will give way to someone more capable. The situation does not allow for any further delay." Interpretations of Konoe's remarks believe that he intends to immediately expand the provisions of the National General Mobilization Law. Even if the law is not fully implemented, at least more of its provisions will be implemented.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Central News Agency on the 4th] A Tokyo foreign dispatch reports that Prime Minister Konoe convened a cabinet meeting at 10:31 AM this morning. After the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, Konoe entered the palace to have an audience. Afterward, he met with the Chief Secretary and announced that the Prime Minister had submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet to the Emperor. He also declared that the decision to resign en masse was made during the cabinet meeting this morning. Japanese newspapers predict that the new cabinet will be formed by Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō. It seems that three members of the current cabinet may join the new cabinet.

[Dispatch from Tokyo via Reuters on the 4th] The Japanese Konoe Cabinet has resigned en masse. Tokyo newspapers predict that Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu and Minister of Finance Ikeda will not be included in the new cabinet, but Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita is expected to retain his position. The stock exchange opened today after a full holiday, and prices plummeted due to the cabinet crisis.

Reasons for the Konoe Cabinet's Resignation

[Special dispatch from Shanghai for this newspaper on the 4th] According to news from North China, after Konoe's resignation, the most likely candidate to succeed him is Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. The main reason for the downfall of the Konoe cabinet was that Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu, the leader of the fascist military faction, firmly advocated for the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law, which Konoe did not agree with, leading to a decisive break.

[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] The Konoe Cabinet submitted its resignation today. It has been learned that Konoe convened a meeting of cabinet members on New Year's Day to discuss the national general mobilization plan. Most cabinet members disagreed, leading to a stalemate and the decision to resign en masse. Recently, Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu has been the strongest opponent of merging domestic political parties and implementing a totalitarian movement under the command of the army and navy leaders. After the dissolution of the Konoe cabinet, the Prime Minister will be succeeded by Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. The cabinet's resignation is due to: (1) Avoiding the threat of Minister of Home Affairs Suetsugu to dissolve the Diet; (2) Dissatisfaction from all parties with the government's increase in military spending by 250 million yuan for China; (3) Difficulty in obtaining foreign loans while the Sino-Japanese war continues.

[Tokyo Dispatch of the 4th via Associated Press] Observers here believe that the Konoe cabinet's resignation is due to Japanese public opinion disapproving of the "national reorganization plan" advocated by Konoe and Suetsugu. The attacks were mainly focused on Suetsugu alone, but since Konoe supported Suetsugu, people generally share the responsibility.

### Our Planes Bomb Nanjing, Traitors Flee to Shanghai in Droves

However, according to the Washington dispatch of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the United States hopes to hold an international conference to resolve the Asian issue. The U.S. government and business community usually take a break during the New Year. Some sources say that the U.S. note was sent during the New Year, which shows Roosevelt's intention to take action before Congress convenes.

The enemy was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy's forces in Guangdong province reached Fogang. Conghua has already been taken by our troops. In recent days, the # army has not been very active, hoping that Wang Jingwei's change of allegiance could promote peace with Japan (?). Yesterday's resignation of the Japanese official will inevitably have a profound impact on the war situation in South China. Regarding Doihara's movements, he is extremely secretive, although there are rumors that he is colluding with various puppets in South China to instigate peace talks, since he believes the Japanese political situation to be dire. Our troops took advantage of the enemy's indecisiveness and launched a simultaneous counter-offensive against the enemy in Sanshui, Southwest, and other areas, with considerable success.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Reuters on the 4th] General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Xingying, declared, "There is a possibility that the Japanese army will land in Beihai. The Chinese army is ready, and the people and food have been moved inland." Also, Chinese is currently guarding Wuchou. Some foreigners are still staying there to protect their properties. Chinese troops once attacked Zengcheng.

[Dispatch from Zhongxiang via Central News Agency on the 4th] Although the enemy forces in Yingshan have increased to 7,000 or 8,000 men, they still have no intention of attacking.

The U.S.'s Far East policy, as seen from this note, is becoming increasingly active.

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 3rd] Late arrival, responsible person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, After the Central government notifies the various embassies and consulates of Wang's [Jingwei] case, the embassies and consulates were very indifferent to this matter and no one felt interested. The Ministry inquired, The recent protests from the U.S. against Japan were issued after Wang [Jingwei]'s announcement (29th), and the wording was even more forceful than before, indicating that the attitude did not change because of Wang [Jingwei]'s affair. The U.S. and the UK have been consistent, so the UK is also without incident. In summary, the quickness with which our central government dealt with this matter, shows that the national policy of resisting until the end is not easy to change, and nobody can change it. Since all countries see that we are able to deal with the situation, there is nothing else to say.

### Philippine and Canadian Governments Ban the Supply of Military Supplies to the Japanese Army

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Central News Agency on the 3rd] A Tokyo dispatch reports that the Director of the East Asia Information Bureau and Inada, of the General Staff Headquarters, have received information that the governments of the Philippines and Canada have suddenly secretly ordered all military supply merchants and factories to stop selling military supplies to Japan from now on.

After Sun takes office as President, he will make even greater contributions to Sino-Soviet relations and domestic unity.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via Reuters on the 4th] Since Wang Jingwei was expelled from the Party, there will be several changes in the Chinese government. It is heard that the government will appoint a progressive thinker to succeed Wang Jingwei as Vice President of the Kuomintang.

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] Those with deep personal friendships with Wang continue to serve and express their anger at Wang's actions, hoping he will realize his mistake.

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] Sichuan Chairman Wang Jixu is scheduled to fly to Chongqing with Deng Xihou and Pan Wenhua to meet with the highest authorities and important figures for instructions. This shows that all kinds of rumors circulating are completely deliberately fabricated by .

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] There has been no special news about the Wang case in recent days. The central government and all parties believe that Wang's personal reckless actions will not lead to any other repercussions and will not affect the future of the war of resistance.

[Special dispatch from Chongqing on the morning of the 5th] Shao Lizi said that whether the central government will make further statements to Japan depends on Wang's future actions. The central government's handling of Wang's case is serious but lenient. There are many friends of Wang in the central government who continue to serve as usual.

All Parties Finally Advise Wang to Go to Europe to Recuperate and Await Punishment

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] A certain important person said that the central government has not yet issued an arrest warrant for Wang, which is still lenient. All parties still hope that Wang will not act anymore and betray the nation. It is heard that several people have sent telegrams to Wang in their personal capacities, making a final plea for him to go to Europe to recuperate and await punishment in order to seek the forgiveness of the people.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] According to sources from relevant parties, Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the country has been met with opposition from the entire nation. The central government has severely punished him, and the international community has not paid much attention. Wang is now very frustrated because this matter has reached a stalemate. He is considering easing the unanimous opposition from all sectors of society. He is also planning to implement a "bitter scheme" by sacrificing his confidants Chen x and Lin x. Gu x will issue a public statement denying that the telegram was Wang's original intention and adding that Chen and Lin made the suggestions on their own authority. Then, Wang will issue a second statement. The content of this statement will still express support for peace, but declare that the previous statement was a suggestion from Chen and Lin, not Wang's suggestion.

Generals Telegraph the Central Government; Cultural Circles Denounce Wang's Treachery

[Special dispatch from Chongqing for this newspaper on the 4th] In recent days, generals have telegraphed the central government to support the handling of Wang's case. Chongqing newspapers are still publishing articles denouncing Wang Jingwei. Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, and more than 20 other cultural figures have telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to denounce Wang. All parties in Chongqing are now treating Wang's case as a joke, and no one sympathizes with Wang. A few people are angry that Wang is foolish and has been deceived by the .

[Dispatch from London via Central News Agency on the 4th] According to the Birmingham Post, the Chinese government can be more united and stronger since Wang was expelled. As for the situation of the opposition in China, there is no phenomenon that can be said to respond to Wang's telegram. It has no effect on the general morale of China. Chinese people have been strengthened by the preliminary economic assistance given by the United States and Britain, so their resistance is more solid. Observers here have a very good impression of the comparison.

### Continued Discussions in the Hunan-Guangxi Train Car (Part Two)

— Our Special Zhejiang Reporter, Geng Ya

"Those not of our 'front' must have different hearts. Grievances have their source, wrongs have their perpetrator, and national and familial hatreds are clearly understood even by village children. This undeniably demonstrates a significant advancement in general national consciousness and cultural standards due to the war of resistance." I had just concluded my conversation about that tearful "Jiangxi fellow" when, diagonally across from me, sat two "Northeast compatriots," also armed comrades, of course. They had just finished eating local grapefruit. One of them, wearing a black leather jacket, raised his voice as if trying to startle everyone, saying:

"Most foreigners bully the weak and fear the strong. The Japanese devils are especially prone to this despicable nature. When they attacked our Xuzhou, damn them, they didn't treat our compatriots as human beings. They killed men on sight and raped women. Some women shaved their heads in advance and disguised themselves as male villagers, but they were still forced to strip for inspection, and ultimately couldn't escape being violated. See how they oppress our ancestors? But every time we surround them on the battlefield, they put on a pathetic act, crying and begging for mercy. The last time we surrounded several hundred of them near Xingzi on the Nanxun Road, they all knelt in rows on the grass, holding their guns high above their heads, as if their parents had died, loudly shouting the slogan 'Long Live the Republic of China' while weeping. Some even spread a handkerchief in front of where they knelt, respectfully presenting gold rings and banknotes looted from our occupied areas on the ground. They thought that by doing this, they could bribe our soldiers and avoid being captured, hoping we would let them go easily. In reality, the Japanese devils are accustomed to playing these kinds of petty tricks, hoping to achieve a seductive effect on the battlefield, which is like a toad trying to eat swan meat!

"However, we have always been ordered to treat captured Japanese soldiers well. We treat the wounded, provide better food than our own soldiers, and try our best to ensure their safety by housing them in foreign company buildings, for example. The Japanese soldiers, for the most part, know how well we treat prisoners, so the more conscious soldiers often take the safe-conduct passes we drop from airplanes and seize the opportunity to escape the clutches of their fascist warlord aggressors, running over to our lines. Some of these more enlightened Japanese soldiers are unwilling to be sent to the rear or secretly return home, and instead wish to join our battlefield work. Thus, we have formed them into a volunteer army and sent them to operate behind Japanese lines. Among them, there are also many patriotic individuals from Korea, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and other places, especially the Korean Nationalist Party volunteer army, who are active in the [unclear] war zone. Each one is loyal and courageous, and their results are very outstanding. As the ancients said, 'Those who lose the Way receive little help, while those who gain the Way receive much help.' This is not only a vivid example, but also a key factor determining our final victory!" Finally, he took out the safe-conduct pass he had on his person, the one used by enlightened Japanese soldiers to surrender to our army, and passed it around for everyone to see. In the end, "forgive me for using the Son of Heaven to command the feudal lords," and taking the liberty of citing readers' need to see it as a reason, I asked him for it to be published as a printing plate.

It was already past two in the morning. The train suddenly stopped and we heard a pheasant crowing at dawn. Our temporary discussion group thus implicitly declared its end, and everyone went to sleep on their seats and chairs. When we woke up the next morning, the train had been stopped in Quanzhou for two or three hours. On the platform, there was a wooden sign stating that the station had air raid shelters capable of holding four to nine hundred people, and that passengers should head towards the designated targets for shelter in the event of an air raid. On both sides of the tracks, along the mountain slopes, newly planted tall pine trees, freshly washed by the night rain, were particularly lovely. Twenty or thirty miles away, there were also tall, towering peaks, glimpsed through the gaps in the fleeting mist, appearing ever higher the more we looked. A moment later, the train whistle sounded a long blast, and the train continued on its way in the rain.
