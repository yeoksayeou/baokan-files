### The Japanese Warlords' Deception and Its Consequences

Warlords, both ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, are intoxicated with power and do not believe in justice or true feelings in the world. They believe that only military force can achieve anything and that many deceptions can rule over foreign races. The defeat of Napoleon and the failure of Wilhelm II were not enough to awaken them. On the contrary, they claimed that their predecessors were not clever enough. Therefore, although Wilhelm failed, Hitler still copied his old tricks, and although Tanaka failed, Itagaki remained unchanged. Because Hitler and Itagaki believed that their predecessors' unwisdom lay in neglecting political work, especially propaganda work. In the minds of Hitler and Itagaki, propaganda was deception. They believed that designing several deceptions could lead to success. But what are the consequences of deception? Let's start with a description of Itagaki's deceptions over the years:

The Japanese warlords' propaganda principles for deceiving the Chinese people were "no territorial ambitions" and "aid to China's independence," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "anti-communism to save the country." The facts of these deceptions unfolding before us are as follows:

(1) The so-called "Great Hanism" was brought to Xiamen by the traitor Zhang Ming in May last year. The reason given by the Japanese warlords for promoting "Great Hanism" in Xiamen was said to be the result of accepting the suggestion of the traitor Zhang Ming. Because nationalist ideas in South China were deeply rooted, and the Three People's Principles could not be adopted, a nationalist facade was needed to attract young people and overseas Chinese. The Japanese warlords thought this was a reasonable suggestion, so they readily accepted it, and at the same time clarified that the purpose of Great Hanism was the autonomy of the Han people, which could also prove that the Japanese warlords had no territorial ambitions in Xiamen. Zhang Ming began to promote "Great Hanism" for less than a month, and the Taiwan government issued a serious protest, saying that Taiwan had five million Han people, and if "Great Hanism" became popular in Taiwan and a revolution broke out, who would be responsible? What followed was a demand that Xiamen be governed by the Taiwan government. After five months of dispute, the ruling power of Xiamen fell into the hands of the Taiwan government, and "Great Hanism" followed Zhang Ming to Shanghai to live a life of leisure. The lesson of "Great Hanism" is deception, eternal deception!

(2) The "Peaceful Salvation of the Country" movement was also a deception that the Japanese warlords were proud of. The director of this deception was Doihara, the executors in North China were Kita, in Central China was Kusumoto, and in South China were Kayano and Takahashi. The slogan was peace and saving the country, but the real intention was to divide the united front and disintegrate the Kuomintang. This conspiracy began after the fall of Xuzhou. Groups claiming to save the country issued false telegrams and statements, spread rumors and slandered generals as being pro-Japanese, and spread an atmosphere of peace. All the tricks of deception were put on stage, but the result after half a year was Wang Jingwei's escape and the censorship of the ×× Daily. All the deceptions were exposed.

Afterwards, Itagaki said, "Wang Jingwei misunderstood our true intentions. We expected Wang to play a role within Chongqing, but now he has left."

(3) "Anti-communist and pro-Japanese government" is the smokescreen used by the Japanese warlords to cover up "no territorial ambitions" and "aid to China's independence." Therefore, Doihara desperately tried to get Tang Shaoyi to come out of retirement. After Tang's death, he desperately tried to get Wu Peifu to serve as the puppet president, in order to deceive the international community and manipulate the backward masses. Using the means of enticement, threats, and rumors, he tried to force Wu Peifu to become a traitor. However, Wu Peifu put forward two conditions: one was that political power should be returned to the Chinese people, and the other was that an army commanded by the Chinese should be organized. Since they claimed to have no territorial ambitions and wanted to aid China's independence, Wu Peifu's conditions should of course be acceptable. Why couldn't they agree and instead tear down their own deception? Foreign Minister Arita, in his speech to the Diet on December 22, declared that "the Imperial government hopes that the new central government will be established as soon as possible to cooperate with us in resolving the war situation." Only eight days later, when answering questions from members of the Diet, he reversed his previous statement and said, "From a historical and current perspective, it is not easy to create a central government with China as a whole. It is only necessary to unite local regimes to deal with international affairs." This was an action of slapping oneself in the face. Deception is just deception, and lies cannot produce the truth, which was to be expected.

Now the Japanese warlords' policy of inducing surrender has failed, and the deception has also failed. The international crisis is pressing on the doorstep of the three islands. In order to break the deadlock, the political parties have suggested convening a Sino-Japanese ethnic conference to find a way to resolve the dispute. The veteran ministers are also planning to convene an international conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Hiranuma did not accept this suggestion at first, but the domestic crisis has reached the most profound stage, and the crisis of international intervention has also become a possibility due to the United States joining the camp. This is indeed an urgency that the warlords did not expect. Therefore, Hiranuma's attitude has gradually inclined towards acceptance, but the warlords are still obsessed and are planning new deceptions, hoping to gain advantages in the deceptions!

Regardless of how the Japanese political situation changes and how the Japanese warlords come up with new tricks, deception is always deception and can never solve the Sino-Japanese dispute. We should raise our political vigilance, step up political work in the war zones, and advance alongside the military, using our strength to shatter the Japanese warlords' illusions—to make the Japanese warlords know the power of justice!

Special Commentary

### The New World War (II)

— Chen Youren

In fact, today in Asia, Europe, and Africa, there is already a state of actual war of "undeclared war." This state can suddenly appear at any time, as long as you can see those new "Caesars" who seem to be in Austria, in Czechoslovakia, in Spain, in the Mediterranean, in North Africa and Palestine, in Abyssinia, in China, and in the planned and actual actions on the seas of the Far East. And you can see that these types of actions are about to expand to other regions: to those regions that Italy believes the London Treaty promised to cede but has not yet ceded to him, to Egypt, to the colonies of England, France, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands, and to Asia, to other regions of the Pacific. If the activities of Germany and Italy continue to be carried out in Nicaragua and elsewhere in the Americas, then the expansion of actions will also reach important strongholds within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine.

(IV) War and Diplomacy

These types of actions have various forms. When dealing with a weak country that has not entered into a military agreement with another strong country, such as China, Abyssinia, and Spain, these types of actions are manifested in the form of open warfare. If it is to deal with a weak country that also has a military agreement with England and France, then the manifestation of the action must take other forms. And if it is to deal with the powerful England and France, knowing that England and France, with the aid of Soviet Russia, can subdue today's "Caesars," then the manifestation of the action should take other forms. In short, when dealing with strong countries and weak countries that have military agreements with strong countries, today's "Caesars" will naturally use their totalitarian diplomatic methods and means from many aspects to use their new strategy of "invisible warfare." In diplomatic use, they are different from England and France. England and France regard diplomacy as a gamble, a skill. Hitler and Mussolini regard diplomacy as a department in war.

Then, can the actions of tangible and intangible wars that are occurring simultaneously in various places today be regarded as accidental events? Here we can also ask whether the battlefields of the previous World War were also accidental local wars?

In today's tangible and intangible wars, there is indeed a common effect. The actions of today's tangible and intangible wars are really no different from the wars in the various battlefields of the previous World War. In the previous World War, the war in France that converged the Western battlefields with the war in northern France became the European War from 1914 to 1917. After the United States joined the war, this European war changed into a World War. Today, the tangible war launched by Japan in China on September 18, the tangible war launched by Italy in Abyssinia in 1935, the tangible war launched by Germany and Italy in Spain in 1936, and the intangible wars launched by Germany and Italy in various parts of Europe, in the Mediterranean, in North Africa, and in Palestine, have become a "convergence of great wars." This "convergence of great wars" has now become a new World War due to the emergence of the Anti-Comintern Pact.

(V) Dictators and the Scourge of War

And it is really not easy to realize that the so-called "next World War" has already occurred. Because the arrival of this great war is like the coming of death mentioned in the Christian Bible, sneaking in like a petty thief in the middle of the night!

The beginning of the previous World War was completely based on the rituals prescribed by international law, beginning with a formal declaration of war, followed by rapid military mobilization, and then by mass killings. And many people still deeply believe that the opening of the "next World War" must go through the same rituals and must first see the same ominous signs. But this war, this war that today's dictatorial leaders have long begun, will naturally have extremely painful and massive killings when it enters the second stage of determining victory or defeat, when it enters the stage when totalitarian countries begin their general offensive. And this new great war not only has no need for a formal declaration of war, but also has no need for a sudden mobilization, because in totalitarian countries under dictators, the army has long been permanently mobilized.

Just like ancient Rome, it implemented a dictatorship during wartime in order to lead the war more effectively. Today's Germany and Italy obviously have a great leader and a fighting leader. They have long actually and openly ruled their countries with the spirit and means of complete dictators. They have used their power and totalitarian methods to mobilize the national male, material, and spiritual forces, and have transformed their countries into the highest degree of fighting nations. In wartime, even a democratic country must take such measures. Even the democratic countries during the previous World War had roughly implemented this means of concentrating power. Democratic countries are like this, then these dictators who believe that they can only achieve their goals by means of war naturally need to maximize the use of their national totalitarian organizations and functions in order to achieve the establishment of the Great German Third Reich desired in the book "Mein Kampf," Mussolini's New Roman Empire, and the expanded Japanese Empire established by the Japanese young and middle-aged dictators who desire to establish a "New Order in East Asia."

### See How the Japanese Will Invade Guangxi

— Reporter dispatched by this newspaper, Geng Ya

The withdrawal from Wuhan occurred three months ago. The stalemate and silent war situation has recently shown signs of becoming gradually tense again. The main reason for this is that the exhausted Japanese, desperate for food, hastily assembled old, weak, young, and puppet Mongolian troops, making some supplements and reorganizations, and not forgetting the dream of a quick decision (?), they want to make one last struggle. Moreover, since the former Japanese prime minister made a ridiculous statement about peace negotiations, it has not only failed to sell their conspiracy of political division to us, but has instead shaken the wavering elements lurking within us, making the unity of the whole country more consolidated. At the same time, international forces aiding China have also entered a new stage along with our resistance, becoming increasingly active, and have extended credit and loans to us one after another. Seeing that our great cause of resisting the war and building the country is about to be completed quickly and smoothly—this, in the eyes of the Japanese fascist warlords, is of course the most serious blow to their policy of aggression! At this critical moment, if the Japanese warlords can immediately lay down their butcher knives and retreat in the face of difficulties, their national life may not be ruined from then on. But the Japanese warlords, who believe that "every Japanese is a Napoleon," are absolutely unwilling to do so. This is like an old buffalo entering a narrow alley; it can't turn around and has to go all the way, blindly. From this, we know that since their political conspiracy against us has failed, they will continue to make a last-ditch effort militarily.

To make a last-ditch effort militarily, they want to swallow our entire Chinese nation in one bite. How easy is that? To speak frankly, in the first phase of the War of Resistance, we fought with our bodies and machines, desperately fighting flesh and blood against artillery fire. We certainly encountered some unexpected failures. Now that our War of Resistance has reached the second phase, the quality of our troops has improved, the number has increased, and mechanized units have been added. The various military, political, economic, and other departmental agencies have also undergone strong and dense improvements to meet the needs of wartime. Whether in the Northwest, Central, and Southwest battlefields, as well as in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines, all necessary preparations have been doubled. No matter which direction the Japanese focus on attacking us, or whether they attack on all three fronts, north, south, and central, we can give them extremely strong blows and crush any of their offensive strategies.

What's more, after the launch of the second phase of the War of Resistance, if the Japanese, due to troop limitations, adopt a strategy of defending the north and attacking the south, or defending the south and attacking the center, then our response method, based on the initiative we have already gained in the early stage, will be to implement a comprehensive war of resistance in this phase. We must not only go all out to fight head-on against the road of the Japanese main force's invasion, but also treat the aspects where the Japanese have adopted a defensive posture "equally," launching large-scale attacks to drive them out and reclaim our rivers and mountains. Therefore, the places where the flames of war burn are not only in one war zone where the Japanese main force is invading, but in all war zones in the south, center, and behind enemy lines. The battlefield is larger than in the early stage of the War of Resistance, and the war is also more intense than in the early stage, and the journey to our "final victory" is naturally shorter and closer.

To put it more concretely, in the future war situation, we will learn from the bloody lessons learned in the previous stage and strictly prevent the Japanese from using fewer troops to calmly transfer them on various battlefields and defeat us individually. Then we will adopt the strategy of "responding to the north when attacking the south, responding to the south when attacking the north, and responding to both north and south when attacking the center," advancing step by step and setting up positions everywhere. Instead of waiting for them to attack me, I will attack them first, and I will surely make them unable to resist and be trapped and defeated by the surrounding Chu songs.

The above is the reporter's rough view of the war situation in the second phase. Therefore, after the sound of New Year's firecrackers, I was just about to head north from Hengyang when I met a colleague on the street who had just come from the northern Guangdong battlefield. He said: The Japanese are retreating from the northern Guangdong battlefield and concentrating in Guangzhou, preparing to join forces with the Japanese fleet in Beihai to prepare to invade Guangxi. Therefore, the center of gravity of the war in the second phase must be in Guangxi. He also persuaded me to return to Guangxi and work together. But after I told him the reason that Guangxi will be tight, and the central and northwest will inevitably have a big battle, he also nodded very much.

However, the flames of war have spread to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. What kind of changes will there be in the situation? This is indeed a question that deserves great attention. In order to get a reliable answer to this question, I specially visited Mr. Xie Zongkeng, the director of the Eighth Route Army's office in Hengyang. Mr. Xie is from Guangxi and has held important positions in the province's military and political circles, so he is very familiar with the people of Guangxi. According to him: "Guangxi is a major base for our resistance in the southwest. It is expected that the Japanese will invade sooner or later. Perhaps the purpose of invading Guangxi is only to 'attack the east and strike the west,' to contain our southwest forces in order to cover up their activities in the northwest. Judging from their invasion routes into Guangxi, there are no more than three: one is to go up the Xijiang River, one is to land at Beihai, and the other is to enter Guangxi from Sihui, Guangdong, along the highway through Guangning and other counties, to Huaining to threaten Guilin. However, Guangxi is mostly mountainous, with natural hazards. Since wars have occurred, it has always been difficult to attack and easy to defend. If the Japanese can use shallow-water ships to invade on the Xijiang River with all their strength, they will at most be able to reach Wuzhou. Above Wuzhou, the waterways are shallow and have many beaches, making it extremely difficult to navigate. The roads are branched and there are no bridges across the river. Even if the Japanese increase their troops threefold, they will not be able to advance an inch. If they attempt to land in Beihai, the shallow beaches along the coast are more than twenty miles wide, and light and heavy troops cannot get close to the shore. The coastal defense line is as solid as gold. The Japanese can only use motorboats and artillery to harass, and it is difficult to shake the hair of our defense line. As for the highway into Guangxi from Sihui, there are even more steep mountains and winding roads that are difficult to describe. The terrain along the road is not suitable for the activities of mechanized units. When necessary, we can quickly destroy the entire road. Guangxi's natural environment is fully equipped with superior national defense conditions, and we also have strong personnel preparations. We have already deployed each entrance to the dangerous places into heavenly trenches—'arranging fragrant cakes to fish for golden turtles,' see how you, the Japanese, invade"?

Mr. Xie's remarks are like an experienced official judging a case. There is not a single word or sentence that is not based on the actual situation. The land in North China is flat and the transportation is convenient. The Japanese are still "able to get on their horses immediately" but unable to govern from horseback. Now, in Guangxi, which has all three advantages of favorable weather, geographical advantages, and the support of the people, they are attempting to invade with great fanfare. This is too much for them to overestimate themselves. Although, the ancients said it well: "If Qingfu does not die, the disaster of Lu will not end." The Japanese fascist warlords' predatory careers and war ambitions will not fail until they reach the end of the road, and she will hope to turn around. Come on; we, the heroic soldiers of China, who bear the heavy responsibility of defending Guangxi, have taken off the gun covers and wiped off the bayonets, and have been waiting for a long time!

### Eastern Jin, Liaoxian Recovered. The Yellow River is Strengthened due to River Defense by Frozen River. The Japanese Attempt to Invade Shaanxi Becomes a Bubble.

[Report from Xi'an, 5th of the month by this newspaper] Although the plan to invade the Northwest is urgent, the Yellow River has rapid water flow and the ice shuttles are small pieces. Currently spring is approaching, it will not freeze solid, and our river defenses have been strengthened, the Japanese attempt to cross the river to invade Shaanxi will be a bubble. The Japanese are accumulating food and ammunition in Ningwu, Shanxi province, as a base for invading the Northwest. The Japanese in Eastern Jin, HeShun, Liaoxian, have increased to two brigades and continued to divide and attack west. They fought fiercely with us in Ximucheng. There were also battles near Liaoxian and Sixiacun. Liaoxian has been overcome by us. After the Japanese invaded Yicheng in Quwo, they have a tendency to continue east. We have taken strict precautions. There is still the sound of artillery fire on the banks of the Yellow River in Southwestern Jin. Approximately 1300 Japanese soldiers at Zhan Dian Station and Xiao Ji Dian Station in Northern Henan, in our surprise attack. Approximately 4000 Japanese soldiers in Xiuwu are moving northwest and were intercepted by us, with over 100 Japanese soldiers killed.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 5th of the month] Liaoxian, which was once captured by the Japanese on the 31st of last month, has been retaken by us on the 2nd after we increased and redeployed troops. Currently our army is dividing and pursuing. It will not be difficult to eliminate the Japanese invaders in Eastern Jin.

### Fierce Battles on Various Roads in Guangdong. The Japanese Continue to Increase Troops in Sanshui.

[Special report from Sihui, 5th of the month by this newspaper] The various roads in Guangdong are still in fierce battles. Over 300 Japanese soldiers invaded and harassed Lianzu from Zengcheng to Dongguan and were killed by us. Over 500 Japanese soldiers in Xinjie invaded and harassed Maxi Huangqi Mountain. The Japanese in Fengyong fled into Jinbu. We intercepted and attacked them. The Japanese in Sanshui have increased to three companies. The Japanese continued to open from Diankewan to the south, and cut off traffic on the Beihai sea.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 4th of the month] Our guerrillas ambushed the Japanese in two ways between Tongshan Chongyang on the evening of the 3rd, and gave the Japanese a heavy blow. Often, one route detected that over a hundred Japanese soldiers in Baini Bridge were moving towards Chongyang along the highway. Our army ambushed Gaojia Ling on the east side of the road, and waited for the Japanese to pass. Taking advantage of the superior terrain from a high position, they launched dense shooting, killing over dozens of Japanese soldiers and seizing a lot of ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated in panic to Baiqiao. Another route detected that about one or two miles south of Nanlin Bridge, in Tongpen Ridge, there was a Japanese company entrenched and fortifications were built. They groped forward in the dark of night, and set fire to the barracks before the Japanese soldiers, and then destroyed the barbed wire set up around their quarters. The Japanese soldiers fled in a hurry. They were captured by us in large numbers. Later, the Japanese soldiers in Nanlin Bridge opened fire to support, and some of them fled towards Nanlin Bridge.

[Central News Agency, Nanyu, 4th of the month] Japanese aircraft bombed Xiangtang (sixty miles from Nanchang) on the 4th, spying on Nanchang and Wuning. Five Japanese aircraft bombing Xiangtang flew south from Duchang at 11 am, spying over the city, and flying along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. Ten light-pound bombs were dropped at Xiangtang Station. The explosions of the Japanese bombs landing were vaguely heard in the city. After investigation, three civilians were killed and injured, and twelve houses were destroyed. The Provincial Rescue Work Group, the World Red Cross Society, and other organizations immediately sent people to rescue them. In addition, two Japanese aircraft scouted along the south bank of the Xiu River and Wuning and other counties on the morning of the 4th, and were fiercely attacked by our anti-aircraft guns and fled in panic.

### Smooth Cargo Transport Between Burma and Yunnan: British and Burmese Authorities Take Strict Protective Measures; ×'s Conspiracy to Disrupt Thwarted

[Hong Kong News] Since the disruption of the Canton-Hankow Railway, our sea gateway route has shifted from Hong Kong-Canton-Hankow to Burma-Yunnan. Rangoon has imperceptibly become a second transfer hub. Our overseas purchases of European and American goods are now entirely shipped directly to Burma, then transported back to Kunming via the Burma-Yunnan land and water transport routes, before being distributed to various locations in need. For more than three months, the goods we have ordered from Europe and America that are transported by waterway have consistently used the Suez Canal route, and the large quantities of goods previously stored in Hong Kong have also been gradually transferred via Rangoon. Having been completed, a certain official dispatched by the central government to Rangoon to manage the transfer of goods came to Hong Kong on official business. Upon inquiring about the transport situation in Burma and Yunnan, and the conditions in Burma, he described the following:

Pro-China and Pro-× Locals Form Two Factions

The Burmese people's level of knowledge is relatively low, leading to the imperceptible formation of two major factions among the Burmese locals: pro-China and pro-×. The situation has become increasingly tense recently. Burmese people traditionally deeply believe in Buddhism and have great faith in their monk leaders. Among them, a monk leader named 某 [omitted] has always engaged in local autonomy movements and incited the locals to engage in various disruptive actions. He had been imprisoned several times before. Later, unable to gain a foothold, he fled to Tokyo, Japan, where he was taken in and exploited by the × [omitted]. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the × [omitted] sent Mr. Ke back to Burma to conduct pro-× propaganda among the locals. A portion of the simple-minded locals were quite fooled by him. However, the majority of Burmese people have great sympathy for us. Since the beginning of the war, they have adopted a pro-China and anti-× attitude. Most of the people on this side are intellectuals, led by high-ranking officials in the Burmese government, who lead the entire Burmese education sector and the working class of merchants in actively supporting China and enthusiastically promoting various practical actions. They are highly admired by both Chinese and foreign figures and actively resist Mr. Ke and his followers, who are incited and lured by the × [omitted]. They are particularly powerful in terms of written propaganda.

After the Burma-Yunnan Road became our main foreign route, the monk-led pro-× locals urgently tried to disrupt it and did their best to obstruct the transport of goods to our country through Burma. Disruptions to the Burma-Yunnan transport line have occurred repeatedly in the three months since. On the one hand, they searched for various military raw materials. A month ago, the × [omitted] attempted to bribe a local to purchase a large amount of kerosene from a certain kerosene company at the Burmese oil fields for transport to Japan. However, the person in charge of the company suspected that the locals were buying a large amount of kerosene and investigated strictly, revealing the truth and refusing to sell. This aroused jealousy among the × [omitted]. Later, after a great deal of suppression and mediation by the authorities, a satisfactory resolution was reached.

British and Burmese Authorities Carefully Maintain Public Order

After the inside story was revealed, the British and Burmese authorities, in order to maintain overall public security, promulgated emergency martial law regulations for extraordinary times, taking careful measures in important areas such as traffic throughout Burma. In the past, the Burmese-Chinese transportation industry was extremely chaotic, with all kinds of vehicles operating freely by merchants and without time restrictions. However, due to the current tense situation, these have been curbed and uniformly managed. Following the Hong Kong traffic management methods, whether it is long-distance buses, taxis, trams, etc., they must all be registered with the government and operated exclusively by one company. Furthermore, all traffic and vehicle operations are restricted from ceasing after 5 PM every day. The main traffic routes are patrolled by an increased number of police officers, and the British defense forces stationed in Burma have also been ordered to assist the police in defending local security and maintaining order. Under these strong measures, public order has improved. At the same time, for thorough planning, all social norms have been placed under emergency regulations for extraordinary times. Regardless of any person, any gathering cannot be freely held without the permission of the authorities. Machine gun and artillery fortifications have been set up in various important Burmese city markets, commercial districts, and road junctions, and they are garrisoned by British defense forces. Every night, the atmosphere is tense and heavily guarded.

Troops Stationed Along Transportation Lines

Since our imports of goods ordered from Europe and America are now transported via the Burma-Yunnan line, the urgency of shipping has created a phenomenon rarely seen in Burmese history. Cargo ships from various countries shuttle back and forth in the waters of Rangoon, and large cargo ships traveling to and from Burma and Yunnan on the Irrawaddy River are operating day and night. Because the main Burmese-Chinese transport line, the railway, is not yet fully completed, all goods are transferred by road freight trucks. If heavy machinery is encountered, they are forced to be transferred by waterway because bridges and other structures are unable to handle the load. Therefore, the number of river ships has temporarily increased dozens of times due to the current special needs. The British and Burmese authorities, in order to carefully protect the safety of our transferred goods, prohibit all irrelevant persons from approaching our purchased goods upon arrival in inland waterways, whether they are on the original ship or have been transferred to barges. Even any ships must be moored at a distance of one hundred feet away, or they will be severely punished. As for the section of the Burma-Yunnan Highway within Burmese territory, a protective station is established at regular intervals, garrisoned by British defense forces and equipped with powerful anti-aircraft guns and machine guns for comprehensive protection. The Burma Road runs from Rangoon directly to the Hsenwi station on the Burmese-Yunnan border, a distance of 655 miles. On the 512-mile journey, there is the Gokteik Viaduct, a great engineering feat of the world. The bridge is one and a half miles long and is constructed between two mountain ridges. The distance from the bridge surface to the bottom of the valley is over seven thousand feet. This shows the immensity of the bridge's construction. Currently, anti-aircraft defense stations have been set up at both ends of the bridge and in the middle, defended by the military. Pedestrians are strictly prohibited from passing, and vehicles passing over the bridge are also prohibited unless they have obtained a permit from the Chinese and British authorities. Each military convoy must first be led by an armored vehicle before proceeding, followed by a string of cargo trucks.

Burma-Yunnan Railway to Be Completed Soon

The frequency of cargo transport on the Burma-Yunnan line is increasing daily, and it is believed that this transportation route will undoubtedly develop further in the future. To meet future needs, both China and Britain have already started construction on the Burma-Yunnan Railway. Currently, the railway project is being accelerated for completion, and it is estimated that the administrative methods of the railway will be based on the British-Chinese collaboration methods of the Canton-Kowloon Railway around May or June of this year. The reporter also learned that upon the completion of the Burma-Yunnan Railway, all personnel originally employed on the Canton-Kowloon and Canton-Hankow Railways will be transferred to serve on that railway to gain experience. Mr. Li Lüzhuan, the former director of the Canton-Kowloon Railway Bureau, has also left Hong Kong for Rangoon to plan and allocate personnel for the entire railway, so that they can quickly become operational at that time, increasing our import of overseas goods, thereby strengthening all aspects of the war effort and national reconstruction.

### Horrific Massacre in Wanxian: × Planes Drop Over a Hundred Bombs; Numerous Casualties

[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Yesterday at noon, × aircraft, numbering eighteen, bombed the main street of Wanxian, dropping over a hundred bombs, many of which were incendiary. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the number of dead and wounded is over one thousand.

### Assault on British Nationals in Hankou: British Consulate Lodges Protest; Situation in Hankou Shows No Improvement After × Ceases Blockade of French Concession

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] News from Hankou: Regarding the assault on British national Mr. Corson and his wife by Japanese sentries on January 27th, the British consul in Hankou has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities. Mr. Corson is the manager of the Hankou Trading Company and the Hankou Ice Factory. According to his wife, they saw a Chinese worker attempting to carry a basket of food into the French Concession that day. Japanese sentries immediately destroyed the food and dishes in the basket. Mr. Corson and his wife did not interfere, but the Japanese sentries surrounded them and attempted to push them into a Japanese naval vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Corson resisted, and the Japanese sentries began to beat them and strip their clothes. French police rescued Mr. and Mrs. Corson. Mrs. Corson was bedridden for several days due to the assault.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] News from Hankou: The Japanese authorities ceased their "blockade" of the French Concession yesterday. Chinese people can now carry a small amount of food into the French Concession. However, if the Japanese side deems that too much is being carried, the food will still be confiscated. Today, many Chinese people are therefore entering the French Concession.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] News from Hankou: On February 2nd, the Japanese consulate here issued a notice stating that foreign nationals in Hankou must henceforth show proof of identity when passing Japanese sentry posts for inspection. The Japanese military authorities explained this to reporters yesterday, stating that Hankou is still under martial law. Although no incidents have occurred to date, there is no guarantee that incidents will not occur in the future. Therefore, the Japanese side cannot treat third-country nationals differently. Foreign nationals do not need to remove their hats and salute Japanese sentries when passing sentry posts.

Tianjin × Forces Extort 300,000 Yuan in Military Funds from Major Concession Stores

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] News from Tianjin: Since × forces occupied Tianjin, they have arbitrarily arrested and oppressed our people, employing every possible means. Recently, × forces set up obstacles near the British and French concessions, threatening to blockade the two concessions. They sent personnel to major stores in the concessions to negotiate, demanding 300,000 yuan in "contribution" funds as a condition for removing the obstacles and stopping the inspection of pedestrians. However, our fellow merchants have refused.

### Fire in West Shanghai: Many Thatched Houses Burned Down at Former Site of Tongwen College

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Daily] News from Shanghai: A major fire occurred at the former site of Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, burning down many thatched houses.

### Uncertainty Regarding Evacuation of British Nationals from Kuling: Awaiting Instructions from Embassy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] News from Hankou: Regarding the evacuation of British nationals from Kuling, the British Consul in Hankou is awaiting instructions from the British Embassy in China.

### Indefinite Opening of the Pearl River: Ship Hijackings Continue to Occur Along the Coast

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 5th] Japanese Consul Okazaki in Guangzhou told a Reuters reporter today that before the Pearl River is publicly opened, no ships of any country, except for Japanese warships, troopships, and gunboats, will be allowed to navigate it. Okazaki denied signing any agreement, but the Japanese side, for the sake of foreigners on Shamian Island, has publicly allowed one British ship to transport necessities to Guangzhou at any time.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd] Two × warships anchored off Nanyutang outside the Min River estuary intercepted and hijacked three of our fishing boats on the morning of the 2nd. They left eastward on the morning of the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] News from Shanghai: On January 22nd, Japanese troops hijacked the Hungarian foreign tugboat "Adria" in Wenzhou. The captain was Dutch. The Hungarian consul in the Netherlands has protested to the Japanese side. When the "Adria" was hijacked, it was carrying scrap iron, gasoline, and other goods. The ship is still detained. Also, the Japanese Navy searched the Portuguese merchant ship "Dom Luiz" in Wenzhou yesterday.

[Associated Press, Hankou, 5th] According to the "Wuhan News" today, rumors that the Yangtze River will be opened and navigation restored are completely unfounded.

### Cultural Developments in Kunming

— Meng

[Special Dispatch from Kunming] Kunming is located in the southwest corner. In the past, due to poor communication and economic difficulties, culture could not be cultivated. Therefore, before the War of Resistance, it was a culturally underdeveloped place. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, everything in Kunming has become active in the past year. In terms of culture, Kunming has added two newspapers, relocated five national universities, attracted many cultural figures, increased several theater troupes, and newly published many magazines.

(1) Newspapers

Kunming originally had two newspapers, the "Yunnan Daily" and the "Republic Daily." The former has a long history and good sales locally. The latter is the party newspaper of the Yunnan Provincial Party Headquarters and is located within the Party Headquarters. Both newspapers have undergone significant improvements recently after being exposed to new culture.

The newspapers that have recently arrived in Kunming are the Tianjin Yishibao and the Nanjing Chao Bao. The Yishibao resumed publication in Kunming on December 8th last year. Although it has only been a little over a month, its sales are particularly good. This is partly because their work is intense, and they have added several young reporters studying at universities, making them appear unusually active. On the other hand, their supplements are particularly numerous: "Religion and Culture," "Youth Garden," "Surrounded by Flames of War," "Reading," "Books," "Education," "History," "Medicine," and "Borderland," "Science." The first three are edited by the newspaper and have been well-received by a wide readership since their publication.

Recently, the Yishibao has also published a small "Yishibao Evening News." Kunming has seen an evening newspaper for the first time, so it is particularly welcomed by the general public.

The Chao Bao resumed publication in early December last year. It is a concise small newspaper with an affordable price. It is published very early in the morning, so it is also very popular with the general public.

The "Central Daily News" Changsha Edition will also be republished in Kunming in the future. Their equipment and entire staff have already departed from Guilin and will arrive in Kunming soon. At the same time, the Chongqing Shishi Xinbao will also set up a branch in Kunming.

### Chen Youren Condemns Hitler's Absurd Speech: Suggests Diplomatic Authorities Promptly Lodge Protest

[Special Report] In his speech to the Reichstag last week, German leader Hitler lavishly praised Japan's invasion of China, perversely calling it a "struggle for human civilization." His insults to our country are evident in his words. This reporter therefore visited Mr. Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented this issue, and inquired about his views. Mr. Chen immediately gave the following response:

The Principle of Great Deceit and Great Lies

Mr. Chen said: "In his book 'Mein Kampf,' Hitler openly extolled the merits of great deceit and great lies, saying that the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it. His praise of Japan this time is clearly a practical application of this principle of great deceit and great lies. At the same time, the entirety of his speech is also an application of this principle, forcibly justifying the international stalemate created by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.

The most important point of current international events is in fact the struggle to destroy the international status quo initiated by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Germany's ambition is to encompass Eastern and Central Europe and seize the oil fields of Romania and Soviet Russia to create its so-called Greater German Reich. At the same time, it also attempts to seize some parts of the African territories of England, France, Belgium, and Portugal to create a colonial empire. Italy's ambition is to control the Mediterranean and dominate the Arabs, and seize the oil fields of Palestine and Mosul as the basis for creating its New Roman Empire. Japan's ambition is to conquer China, dominate the Pacific, and seize the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies, using the banner of 'New Order in East Asia' to establish an expanding Japanese Empire. The seizure and control of oil fields are what Germany, Italy, and Japan are dreaming of day and night today because today is an era controlled by airplanes and tanks.

Countries Maintaining the International Status Quo

This kind of border change can only be achieved through war or through the surrender of England, America, France and the Soviet Union, who are mainly committed to maintaining the international status quo. Because peace is a necessary condition for maintaining the international status quo, England, America, France, and the Soviet Union are objectively the countries of peace today. Conversely, because destroying the international status quo requires the use of violent aggression to achieve, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan are in fact the countries of aggression today.

In order to cover up their aggressive acts, Hitler now has no choice but to use his principle of great deceit and great lies. Also, because the ruling classes of England, America, and France still harbor hatred for Bolshevism, just as the rulers of the feudal era hated capitalism, Hitler shamelessly pretended to condemn the Soviet Union as the enemy of human civilization, while praising Japan's inhumane actions in China over the years, saying: It is serving human civilization.

The Real Threat to Human Civilization

If the best way to maintain the evolution and activities of human society is through peace, and if peace is the true path to human progress, then the various atrocities perpetrated by Germany, Italy, and Japan against humanity's material and spiritual well-being in order to destroy the international status quo are the greatest threat to civilized humanity since the dissolution of the Roman Empire.

Here, I would like to make a suggestion to those in our country responsible for deciding foreign policy. I believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not sit idly by in the face of Hitler's unreasonable praise of Japan's inhumane behavior in China over the years, and his mental and diplomatic insults to our country, and should immediately issue an appropriate protest.

What I want to say is very simple. Recently, Wang Jingwei advocated that our country join the anti-communist group. The propositions of the anti-communist group are: (1) Destroy China, so that China will no longer become an independent country, (2) Unite all peace-loving countries such as England, America, France, and the Soviet Union as targets of attack. Therefore, forcing our country to join the anti-communist group is not only sacrificing China and offering it to Japan, but also preparing to force China to oppose England, oppose France, and oppose the United States in the great war between maintaining the international status quo and destroying the international status quo.

### A Night's Tale with Karman

— Zhang Changren

[Special Dispatch from Guilin]

After dinner, I played a game of billiards with Karman at the "Le" Club. He invited me to his room to talk further.

A Guangxi-made charcoal stove warmly radiated heat. The room, already not very cold for the southern country, felt even more like spring. This man, not yet thirty-two years old, who had traveled extensively through "Spain in Flames" and "China in Struggle," a reporter for the Soviet News and a cameraman for the Soviet Newsreel Studio, didn't seem tired despite having just arrived on a plane from Chongqing. He excitedly poured a cup of hot coffee from a thermos and handed it to me, smiling and saying, "This is hot coffee from Chongqing!" He poured a cup for himself and put a piece of bread on my plate, saying, "Please try the bread flown in from Chongqing!"

Drinking the coffee with its tropical flavor and savoring the soft bread, which I hadn't tasted since leaving Wuhan, I couldn't help but say, "This is truly an interesting thing! But in the future, after China wins the war, you can have morning tea in Chongqing, lunch in Hankou, attend an afternoon press conference in Nanjing, and join a victory banquet and dance in Shanghai!"

He smiled amiably. It was a smile I had become familiar with since he first came to Wuhan from the Soviet Union last September. Afterwards, we shared the hardships of leaving Hubei and Hunan, and finally withdrawing from Wuhan. On a cold morning in Xianning County, I was invited by that smile to eat his sardine bread at a small roadside teahouse, discussing everything about the second phase of the war. After parting in Changsha, we met again in Guilin in early December. After that, he went to Chongqing.

Although he came to our country a year after the start of China's war of resistance, he was more active on the front lines and in the rear than reporters from other countries. He was like an American, possessing the energy and talent of an American journalist. He sympathized with China's war of resistance, witnessing the heroic battles of soldiers shedding blood on the front lines and the tragic bombings of peaceful civilians in the rear, knowing that only by using strength to provide sympathetic assistance to China. Thus, the "Secret Document No. 148" and other dispatches were published in Moscow newspapers, revealing the truth about the Japanese warlords using poison gas to massacre Chinese soldiers and civilians, telling the Soviet people. His "Amo" film reel captured "China in Struggle," allowing millions of moviegoers in the Soviet Union and around the world to observe the Sino-Japanese War more closely. Among foreign reporters, he seemed to be a latecomer, but he was a good friend of the Chinese military and people. His pen and camera facilitated the enthusiastic friendship between the two great democratic nations and peoples of China and the Soviet Union. In Chongqing, during a short month, he was constantly being invited to banquets by Chinese friends, seemingly rushing about every day for these feasts. The Chinese government and the public have already realized the importance of international publicity, and the hospitality towards foreign guests is particularly thoughtful. Tea parties and banquets often keep a foreign guest busy; but besides asking international friends to taste Chinese cuisine, the more important things are to let them "know" and "see" these two things, which are often considered secondary. I feel that this point should be emphasized a little more. He felt that Chongqing City was increasingly under the threat of bombing and should actively focus on passive air defense. He particularly told me that he met Zhao Tong, the commander of the guerrillas near Beiping, in Chongqing, and praised his bravery and courage.

He said, "After China's arduous war of resistance achieves final victory, China will surely be like other of the world's strongest countries. People generally say that China's wealth is underground, waiting to be developed; but in my opinion, that's not entirely true. In Sichuan, I saw coal mining areas that could be mined on the spot. I am particularly interested in Guangxi: tens of thousands of men are fighting a war to defend the country; women are strong, hardworking, and doing all kinds of labor in the rear; and the scenery is so beautiful! As far as I'm concerned, Guangxi occupies the longest section on his film."

He showed me new photos he had taken since leaving Wuhan and explained them to me one by one. News photos taken by a filmmaker have a special artistic flair. I saw Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resolute and heroic posture at the Nanyue Conference, the grand occasion of senior generals from all over the country gathered together, General Tang Enbo's leisurely demeanor smoking a pipe at the front-line headquarters, the strong and perfect fortifications built by the ××× Division on the Hunan-Hubei front line, the promotion of political work, and the unity of the military and civilians, etc. Through his skills, many photos can often represent a dispatch on a certain issue. As for the records of enemy bombings, they will inevitably arouse anger and sympathy in those who have not experienced them firsthand.

He met Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling: "When she saw me, she asked me if I could speak English. I said I could. So she spoke to me at length. Actually, my English is not very good, so I didn't understand very well. I quickly said, 'Madam Chiang, I'm sorry. I have difficulty understanding fast English.' So she spoke slowly. She is a very capable woman, a good helper to General Chiang Kai-shek."

He asked me many questions about the southern war zone. He will go to the Fourth War Zone in a week, and after returning to Guilin, he plans to go to Beihai again. He wanted me to go with him. I originally wanted to go to Beihai, and if I can return to Guilin after he returns from the Fourth War Zone, he would be a good travel companion to Beihai. I told him that the road to Beihai only goes as far as Lianlin, and he would have to leave the car behind to go the rest of the way on foot.

After finishing the coffee, the conversation turned from the war situation to general topics. He missed Barcelona, which was still in the hands of the Spanish government forces and was likely to fall into the hands of the Fascists. He said, "Once, I was filming in a military uniform factory in Barcelona. It was full of female workers. When they knew I was a Soviet cameraman, the whole place cheered. An elderly woman suddenly embraced me warmly and kissed me. Then, I was surrounded by fifty young female workers who kissed me one by one." He talked about "meeting a Japanese prisoner named Yoshihito in ××, who belonged to the 106th Division. He was the son of a Japanese senior official. The boy tried his best to promote anti-war sentiment." He found many photos of prisoners, and I recognized the Japanese boy. One photo showed a Japanese prisoner, holding a cigarette in one hand and gesturing with the other, sitting opposite a Chinese political worker, reporting their military situation. Finally, we talked about billiards. I said, "I usually play 'pocket billiards'!" He was very happy and said, "In the Soviet Union, there is only 'pocket billiards'! He is also good at 'pocket billiards'!"

As we shook hands and wished each other good night, Karman said, "Let's compete at 'pocket billiards' at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon!"

(January 26, 1939, Guilin).

### Opening of the Supreme Council of Italian Fascism, the Government Declares No Withdrawal of Troops Invading Spain, the Prime Minister Reports Exaggerated Collusion Between Germany and Italy

[Rome, 5th, Reuters] The Fascist Supreme Council opened last night at 9:00 PM, adjourned at 11:50 PM, and this morning at 2:00 AM the government issued an official gazette declaring that the Italian volunteer army stationed in Spain will never withdraw before Franco's army achieves complete victory. The gazette expressed satisfaction with Hitler's recent declaration of close cooperation with Italy, and then briefly described the proceedings of the meeting, stating that the Prime Minister had made a general report on the international situation, which was greeted with enthusiastic applause and support from the participants. Foreign Minister Ciano explained the main points of Italian foreign policy, and the Prime Minister made further explanations on important points, and Ciano's report was adopted. The Supreme Council expressed extraordinary satisfaction with Hitler's declaration at the 6th Anniversary of his coming into power, expressing willingness to cooperate closely in political and military affairs between Fascism and National Socialism. "Since the occupation of Girona, Catalonia has been freed from the 'barbaric' oppression of communism. The Supreme Council has paid the greatest respect to the courageous 'Spanish' (?) and foreign volunteer soldiers who have achieved 'victory.' At the same time, it must be stated that the Fascist volunteer army will never abandon this mission until Franco achieves complete victory, that is, until Fascism achieves victory. The official gazette stated that the Prime Minister has announced his plan to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Fascist Rule on March 23rd, at which time the new Fascist United Congress will be opened, and at the same time, at the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the intricate social legislation will also be further developed at that time. The Supreme Council finally reviewed Italy's income and expenditure reports from 1920 to 1928, and the meeting will be continued on the evening of February 10th."

Mussolini Makes No Surprising Remarks, New Offensive Being Prepared in Secret

[Rome, 4th, Reuters] The Italian Fascist Grand Council held its first meeting since last November tonight. It is expected that Mussolini will report on various items and announce his determination until the meeting starts.

Aside from routine matters, will there be anything else surprising in the speech that Mussolini will make?

[Rome, 5th, Associated Press] According to the Italian authoritative magazine "International Relations" weekly, peace in Europe is unlikely before the issue of German and Italian colonies is resolved. The Fascist Supreme Council met last night at 9:00 PM, and the public gathered outside the Venice Palace to cheer. It is said that Mussolini personally presided over the meeting to discuss various important issues.

[Washington, 5th, Associated Press] According to the unofficial authoritative newspaper "Army and Navy Journal," based on the speculation of American naval personnel, Germany and Italy will make new demands after the end of the Spanish war, and the world situation will become the most serious at that time. Italy's demands may be directed towards France, and if the opportunity is ripe, Germany may again raise the issue of foreign colonies.

The French Government Conspires to Collude with Italy, the People Unanimously Oppose

[Paris, 5th, Associated Press] It is heard that the Daladier Cabinet intends to secretly resolve various conflicts between France and Italy. According to reliable official sources, the President of the Annam Bank, Baudoin, has arrived in Rome to conduct negotiations with Italy. Mr. Baudoin's visit to Italy has no official title, but it is said that he was appointed by the French government to negotiate with Mussolini on the railway of Djibouti, which is proposed to be jointly managed by France and Italy as a buffer condition, and the issue of the Mediterranean will also be discussed.

[Paris, 5th, Reuters] The French newspapers are extremely focused on the fact that France sent Mr. de Peysson to Burgos (the location of the Spanish rebel government) as a representative of the French government. The left-wing newspapers unanimously attacked this move, saying that Foreign Minister Bonnet acted without authorization and without the approval of the Cabinet. Right-wing newspapers expressed their approval. According to the "Le Petit Parisien" newspaper, Mr. de Peysson's mission includes the following matters in addition to discussing the refugee issue: (1) To find out whether Franco is willing to accept the conditions put forward by the French envoy and to find out whether Franco requires legal recognition of his government; (2) If France participates in the war, whether Franco is prepared to remain neutral; (3) To require Franco to reiterate his commitment to maintaining the territorial integrity of Spanish territories.

### Spanish Rebel Army Approaches the French Border, Refugees Flood into France Reaching 70,000, Spanish Government Army Driven into the Mountains by France

[Burgos, 5th, Every News Agency] According to the announcement made here on Saturday afternoon, after the Spanish rebel army occupied Girona, its front line is only about 34 kilometers away from the national border.

[Burgos, 4th, Reuters] After the rebel army attacked and occupied Girona, it is only thirty-four miles from the French border, and the rear units of the rebel army are sixty miles from Barcelona.

[Paris, 4th, Reuters] As the Spanish rebel army continues to advance, 1,200 members of the government army's security corps have arrived in Bayonne from Collioure today. It is said that all members of the Collioure security team expressed their willingness to return to Spanish territory under the rule of the rebel army.

[Perpignan, France, 5th, Central News Agency] The number of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France has gradually increased, reaching 70,000 to date. The governments of France and Spain have formulated methods to deal with the refugee problem, so the situation at the border is no longer as chaotic as in the first few days. The Sixth Army Corps of the Spanish government army has been driven to the mountains on the Spanish border.

[Perpignan, 4th, Reuters] According to the current rate of advance of the rebel army, Figueres will fall within three days. Government agencies were still working late at night in the basement of the Figueres fortress last night, but the area was repeatedly bombed, and diplomatic envoys were unwilling to visit for any meetings. Currently, refugees are flowing on the French border highway. According to estimates, 70,000 people have entered French territory. The French and Spanish authorities have taken effective measures, so there is no chaos like in the first few days, but there are six government army units now pushing north to the mountain areas on the Franco-Spanish border, and tragedies may occur. In the final stage, these government troops will be forced to retreat on three routes and be bombed by rebel aircraft. The government fleet is now firing up its engines but can do nothing except transport senior officials and technicians to the Valencia and Madrid areas.

### The Spanish Government and People Vow to Fight to the End, Talk of Peaceful Negotiations is Absolutely Ridiculous, Italian Army Commander Wounded

[London, 5th, Reuters] A spokesperson for the Spanish government embassy here told reporters that the rumor that the Spanish government intends to conduct peaceful negotiations with the rebel army is absolutely ridiculous. The Spanish government and people are all determined to resist to the end.

[Rome, 5th, Huitong News Agency] It is reported that General Battusa, the commander of the Italian volunteer army Littorio Division, was shot in the foot by a machine gun while attacking Girona and is now leading the division in battle with difficulty.

[Perpignan, France, 5th, Central News Agency] According to news here, the Spanish government is planning to withdraw from the city of Figueres due to the continuous bombing of the city of Figueres by the "National" army, and the city of Girona (50 miles from Barcelona) has been lost to the west. However, it is not known whether the Spanish government will immediately choose to go to Valencia or Ceret, or whether it will support itself near the Catalan coast for a few more days before taking other measures. According to the progress of the Spanish "National" army, the city of Figueres may fall within three days. Last night, Spanish government personnel were still working in the ancient cellars of the city.

[Paris, 5th, Reuters] A vehicle transporting works of art from the Spanish government from Figueres to the border was bombed by rebel aircraft. It is not clear whether there were any losses. A protest has been lodged here with the Duke of Alba, requesting him to inform his government to prevent similar incidents from occurring. At the same time, according to the official gazette of the Spanish government, the result of this air raid by the rebel army was 300 deaths and 800 injuries in Figueres.

[Paris, 5th, Central News Agency] 1,200 Spanish government soldiers entered the city of Bayonne (in southwestern France, 4 miles from the Bay of Biscay) yesterday from the province of Catalonia. It is reported that they all came from areas ruled by the Spanish National Army. The French also plan to send them back to Spanish territory.

### London Detectives Investigate Bombing Cases

[London, 5th, Central News Agency] London detectives have started investigating the recent series of bombing cases here and have obtained some secret clues. It is expected that there will be rapid developments soon. Yesterday, detectives here searched various places and stepped up day and night patrols. Two people were arrested in Liverpool yesterday morning, and a large number of documents were obtained. According to documents seized by police in Belfast, there was a plan to bomb Buckingham Palace, the House of Commons, and Scotland Yard (the most famous detective agency in Britain). Police everywhere have stepped up their guard.

### Indian Defense, British New Minister of Defence Reports on Research Work

[London, 5th, Reuters] The newly appointed Minister of Defence, Lord Chatfield, returned from India yesterday. He studied various defense issues there. He told Reuters that the committee he organized has studied all aspects of Indian defense in detail. This work is extremely valuable.

### Shanghai British Merchant Sassoon Talks About Japan's Tendency Towards Redness, Britain, France, and the United States Must Urgently Aid China to Restrain Japan, and Plan for a Prosperous Future China After the War

[New York, 4th, Central News Agency] Sir Victor Sassoon, a famous British merchant in Shanghai, returned to China yesterday. According to him, even if Japan wins militarily, it will not be able to develop China's resources without financial assistance from Britain. If Britain, the United States, and France can impose economic sanctions on Japan, the Sino-Japanese War can be ended immediately. The Japanese army will have to be forced to withdraw from China. As a result of the war, Japan will face difficulties in various social and economic aspects, and there is a danger of redness, which is Japan and not China.

[New York, 4th, Central News Agency] The New York City Federation of Women's Clubs presented Madam Chiang Kai-shek with a gold medal in recognition of her indomitable leadership of Chinese women in the war of resistance during China's national crisis.

### Britain and France Order Another Batch of Aircraft from the United States

British Ambassador's Visit to France is Given Great Importance

[London, 5th, Central News Agency] The British Air Military Commission has ordered another 250 aircraft from the United States, including 50 reconnaissance aircraft and 200 trainer aircraft.

[Paris, 4th, Central News Agency] According to sources, the statistics of military aircraft sold by the United States to France are as follows: (1) 100 "Curtiss" fighter jets with a speed of 450 kilometers per hour; (2) 200 North American reconnaissance aircraft (the same as those ordered by Britain from the United States); (3) 450 Douglas aircraft with a high speed of 580 kilometers. All types of aircraft must arrive in France before the summer of this year. The reason why France must order from the United States is that its domestic aircraft manufacturing plants cannot deliver on schedule.

[Paris, 4th, Central News Agency] Political figures here attach great importance to the meeting between British Ambassador Phipps and French Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon.

### Italian Newspapers Slander Roosevelt, the United States Protests to Italy, American Opponents of Roosevelt, Senator Borah Claims Illness and Enters Hospital

[Rome, 3rd, Central News Agency] Italian newspapers have recently spared no effort in personally slandering the US President, even using insulting words to say that the President has physical defects. The US government today lodged a formal protest with Italy because of this. The US resident in Italy, Ambassador Phillips, submitted the protest to the Italian government today. According to the situation in which Italian newspapers, under the leadership of Guido, the editor of the Salvation Newspaper and the unofficial spokesperson for Mussolini, are attacking the US President, the US protest states that the US government does not oppose Italian newspapers criticizing the US and its foreign policy, but the US government believes that it is necessary to take formal action against the personal attacks on the President by Italian newspapers. Some Italian newspapers even inferred that the President suffers from paralysis, which causes his "nervous disorder." The Minbao newspaper likened the President to "the first public enemy of peace." Guido, the editor of the News Newspaper, wrote a three-column editorial on the front page of the newspaper, saying that the President is "a disturber of European problems and an instigator of international turmoil" and believes that European problems have nothing to do with the President. In addition, he issued a warning to the American people, saying that the President's proposals will determine the future lives and interests of the American people and said that before criticizing extreme countries, the United States should first recall its own oppression of other nations and commented that the United States' oppression of Indians, Mexicans, and Hawaiians is no more brutal than the means by which Germany and Italy treat the Norman nation.

[Washington, 4th, Central News Agency] US Senator Borah has been admitted to the hospital for treatment for a cold he contracted last week and is now recovering. Borah did not issue a statement attacking President Roosevelt's foreign policy due to illness.

### French Authorities Praise Roosevelt's Speech

[Paris, 4th, Central News Agency] Responsible persons here have commented on the confidential talks between US President Roosevelt and the members of the Senate Military Committee a few days ago, stating that the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan now has a tendency to be transformed into a military alliance. As a result, the United States shares its interests with Britain and France. President Roosevelt's expression this time is an attempt to contain it. Regarding the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, after the ambassadors and ministers of Japan stationed in various European countries held a meeting in Paris on the 29th of last month, the German Ambassador to Japan, Voth, and the Italian Ambassador to Japan, Oletti, held talks with the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tsurumi, yesterday. It is said that the main points discussed were whether this military alliance should stipulate that when one of the signatory countries goes to war with the Soviet Union or any other country, the other signatory country should be obligated to provide assistance.

### Philippine Government Will Propose a Naturalization Prevention Act

[Manila, 4th, Central News Agency] The Philippine government will propose a Naturalization Prevention Act to the Philippines. The purpose of the bill is to reduce the number of Chinese and Japanese immigrants to the Philippines. The content is to advocate that all Orientals who wish to be naturalized in the Philippines must reside in the Philippines for fifteen years (originally five years) and at the same time have property worth 5,000 Philippine pesos. It is expected that the Philippine Congress will be able to quickly pass it.

### 空襲不足畏！
— Translated by Tianling

This article is translated from "Breathe Freely" by Professor Janae Eendall, a chemistry professor at the University of Edinburgh, UK. During the European War, he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Allied Chemical Corps.

Popular books describing the tragedies suffered by civilians in large cities during air raids in the next world war often exaggerate the situation. They claim that bombs fall from the sky and poison gas permeates the entire city, or that planes arrive in formation, spreading "death fog," and allege the existence of newly invented, strange poisonous gases that can cause death and cannot be resisted by any gas mask, painting a vivid and alarming picture. However, as a chemist, I dare to assert that all such claims are nonsense.

To my knowledge, scientists have not recently discovered any significant new poisonous gases, and it will likely not be easy to discover any in the future. Scientists knew the killing power of poisonous gases in great detail before the European War (chlorine was discovered in 1774, phosgene in 182, and mustard gas in 1850). Chemists now predict that there will be no more potent poisonous gases discovered in the next ten years than mustard gas. Even if there were, their danger would be so severe that large-scale production would be impossible. In August 1918, before the end of the European War, the Chemical Warfare Service Corps in a mustard gas factory in Maryland, USA, had a higher number of poisoning cases among those manufacturing the gas than the casualty rate of any unit of the same size fighting on the Western Front. In the British mustard gas factory in Avonmouth, none of the 1,100 employees could avoid being poisoned within a few months.

The claim that poison gas can penetrate gas masks is also not a cause for concern. With new scientific methods, the activated carbon used in our current gas masks can absorb even the smallest molecules of any heavy gas and can resist all lighter gases, such as chlorine and phosgene, for a certain period. If sodalime is added to the charcoal, the resistance to poison will be even more durable. Therefore, the anti-poison device in the gas mask can indeed resist any poison gas.

Those who deliberately make alarming claims that air raids on large cities like London will inevitably succeed imagine large formations of bombers dropping thousands of tons of poison gas while the city's residents are unprepared and panic, not knowing what to do. One general wrote about the situation in London after an attack: "The people in the city will be disturbed for days, hospitals will be overcrowded, traffic will be disrupted, and the entire city will become a terrifying hell. The authorities will be overwhelmed by the chaotic situation and will be at a loss. At this time, the enemy will propose peace conditions, and the government will accept them hastily." However, in reality, the advances in modern anti-poison methods far surpass the methods of releasing poison gas. Unless the attack is sudden and unexpected, there will be few victims of poisoning.

Based on my knowledge, the situation in London if attacked would be roughly as follows:

When war is about to begin, the government will distribute gas masks to the people, two for each person, to be carried at all times. Children will bring them to school, and adults will bring them to work. Once news arrives that a large formation of enemy planes is near London, an alarm will sound, and citizens will go indoors, prepare their masks, and put them on immediately upon hearing a special alarm. Half an hour later, the most potent mustard gas will be released from the air in quantity. However, the pedestrians on the street will have already fled, so the city's residents will not be affected by the poison gas, except for those whose houses are hit by bombs or whose windows are broken by flying debris from nearby explosions. Within minutes of the poison gas bombs being dropped, the decontamination team will arrive. An hour later, citizens will remove their masks upon hearing the signal, but will remain indoors. Only when the all-clear signal is given will they resume normal activities. Within a few hours, London will return to its bustling state. Later, newspapers will report that several hundred citizens have been sent to the hospital, most of whom are children and mostly only slightly poisoned. As for the twenty or thirty unfortunate deaths, they were caused by being hit by large pieces of shrapnel. As for the so-called "death fog," it is purely fantasy. It is said that enemy planes can silently release this type of poison gas at high altitude, and this gas is so minute and invisible when released that it explodes upon contact, making it impossible to defend against. However, according to experienced experts, aircraft must fly no higher than 300 feet to release poison gas streams. Therefore, if a city has even a little air defense equipment, there is no need to fear poison gas attacks.

Alarmists often like to mention the fact that one ton of mustard gas can kill 45 million people. However, this refers to those 45 million people standing in line waiting to be poisoned. If that were the case, if all the residents of London were to lie down automatically, a road roller could also crush all the city's residents. However, few people panic and do not know how to avoid an oncoming road roller.

Under ideal conditions, that is, on a windless plain, seven tons of phosgene can only maintain a lethal concentration within a circular area with a radius of 5 yards and a height of 15 feet. The small amount of harm caused by poison gas released in a city can be imagined. I recall that in May 1928, eleven tons of phosgene leaked in Hamburg, Germany, due to an explosion, resulting in 12 deaths, 12 poisonings, and 160 mild poisonings. At that time, the city's residents had not received an alarm, were still coming and going on the streets, and were not wearing gas masks. If people stay indoors, wear masks, and have adequate air defense equipment in the room, they should not be harmed unless a gas bomb hits the building and explodes.

As a chemical expert stated in his air defense pamphlet: We do not need to exaggerate our fear of air raids. During the European War, French farmers living near the front lines would hide indoors when poison gas came, tightly close their windows, and only come out after the gas had passed. At that time, they did not have any anti-poison equipment, but they were still able to avoid harm.

Our preparation for poison gas attacks lies not in the poison itself but in the panic it causes. When the enemy releases poison gas in a city, their primary goal is not to kill people, but to make people panic and long for peace. Therefore, the first thing we must remember during and after enemy air raids is not to panic blindly!

[Central News Agency, Capital of Yugoslavia, 4th] Due to the co-existence of three ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, disputes often arise. Among them, the Croat ethnic group is politically in an opposition position. Yesterday, five cabinet members, including two Slovenians and one Muslim, resigned jointly because of disagreements with Prime Minister Stojadinović regarding the Croat ethnic group issue. As a result, the cabinet resigned en masse to Prince Regent Paul this morning. Prince Paul immediately summoned key figures from various parties to consult on the formation of a new cabinet.

However, the low living standards of the people were not the fault of the Nazi government, but of the democratic countries, because the democratic countries threatened Germany with war. We have been able to find work for millions of unemployed people, but what they produce is munitions, not useful goods. This is not our fault.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary, the government's official newspaper, Izvestia, commented that the Anti-Comintern Pact was a prelude to the military alliance treaty concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is well-known in Moscow. Hungary first signed a cultural agreement with Japan, then recognized "Manchukuo," and recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Although this action is ostensibly anti-communist, it will undoubtedly become a sharp blade in the hands of the aggressor nations. The diplomatic policies pursued by bourgeois countries are based on violence, aggression, hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy. The Soviet Union, however, bravely exposes their masks and reveals their true faces, and takes appropriate measures to maintain peace and national independence. The severance of diplomatic relations with Hungary is just one example.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Schnurre, head of the Eastern European Department of the Trade Division of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally planned to visit the Soviet Union, but recently postponed the trip. Foreign observers here have commented that there are two main reasons for this. First, the economic delegation sent by the Polish government is currently conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union. If Germany were to send a representative to Moscow at this time, it would inevitably be suspected of competing with Poland. Germany does not want to offend Poland. Second, after France and the Soviet Union become closer, Japan will definitely be unhappy, which is also not what Germany wants. Regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary, some observers believe that Hungary joined the Anti-Comintern Pact fifteen days ago. Why did the Soviet government wait until now, after US President Roosevelt decided to assist the democratic countries, to sever diplomatic relations with Hungary? There are clues to be found in this.

### 小評　達拉第的反動政策
### Short Commentary: Daladier's Reactionary Policy

慕尼黑會義以後，法國現任達拉第內閣追隨張伯倫的妥協外交反動政策，曾經使法國從歐洲一等强國降到第二三國家的地位。可是達拉第內閣現在還在繼續執行其反動政策，據今天巴黎電訊，他們一面已經派出比拉德氏至西班矛叛軍所在地蒲爾哥斯與意大利指揮下的西叛軍私通欵曲，一面密派安南銀行總裁巴　榮到羅馬與意談判法意妥協。這種反動政策直接犧牲西班牙民主共和國，同時亦將使法國於地位低熟之後再加上殖民　的割讓！
Since the Munich Agreement, the current Daladier cabinet in France has followed Chamberlain's reactionary policy of compromise diplomacy, which has reduced France from a first-rate European power to a second- or third-rate country. However, the Daladier cabinet is still continuing to implement its reactionary policy. According to today's Paris dispatch, on the one hand, they have sent Mr. Bérard to Burgos, the location of the Spanish rebels, to collude with the Spanish rebels under Italian command. On the other hand, they have secretly sent Mr. Baudoin, president of the Banque d'Indochine, to Rome to negotiate a Franco-Italian compromise. This reactionary policy directly sacrifices the Spanish Democratic Republic and will also lead to France's further weakening after its status has been lowered, plus the cession of colonies!

拉達第內　是法國獨佔資本的代理人，他們心目中只有藉出費與戰爭以便私人發財，根本不會顧到國家利益，更不會顧到世界和平！現在的問題，就在法國人民對反動政策容忍到什麽程度？就在法國人民陣綫如何在金融資本的武力之下掙扎起來。推翻達拉第內閣，產生眞正代表人民的內閣。意大利指揮下的四叛軍，距法國邊境只有三十公里了！法國人民不能讓法國永遠屈服下去！
The Daladier cabinet is an agent of French monopoly capital. They only think about making personal fortunes through expenditure and war, and they will never consider national interests, let alone world peace! The question now is, to what extent will the French people tolerate the reactionary policies? How will the French Popular Front struggle under the force of financial capital? Overthrow the Daladier cabinet and create a cabinet that truly represents the people. The four rebel armies under Italian command are only thirty kilometers from the French border! The French people must not allow France to submit forever!

墨索里演詞
Mussolini's Speech

意大利侵略者的法西斯最高會議於四日晚開幕，首相舉索里尼發表演說及報吿，全文尙未發表，但一般觀察，除了對於德國帮助意國侵略表示讚美之外，似不致有驚人的地方。這當然是受了美國和蘇聯當局最近表示積極援助民主國的影響所致。不過我們不能就此認定意大利不會再有驚人之舉，不，當意大利全部征服西班牙之後，他們必更與德國及日本勾結發動更大的暴行，五日美國海陸軍紀事報所稱西戰停止後，德意必將有新的要求提出，實爲依據意　內外危機事實的推斷。只有一個辦法可以防止意德新的要求，那就是英法兩國迅速聯合蘇美，從積極挽救西班牙民主國開始！
The Fascist Supreme Council of the Italian aggressors opened on the evening of the 4th. Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech and report. The full text has not yet been published, but general observation suggests that there will be nothing surprising apart from expressing praise for Germany's assistance in Italy's aggression. This is of course due to the recent expressions of active assistance to democratic countries by the US and Soviet authorities. However, we cannot assume that Italy will not take any more surprising actions. No, when Italy has completely conquered Spain, they will surely collude further with Germany and Japan to launch even greater atrocities. The US Naval and Military Record of the 5th stated that after the end of the Spanish war, Germany and Italy will surely make new demands, which is a deduction based on the internal and external crisis facts of Italy. There is only one way to prevent new demands from Italy and Germany, and that is for Britain and France to quickly unite with the Soviet Union and the US, starting with actively saving the Spanish Democratic Republic!

囚犯集中營
Prisoner Concentration Camps

本港當局現感囚犯日多，各監獄多已超過原定限額，現取法世界各地建集中營收容囚犯辦法，並將各種政府工程分派囚犯祖任，以代獄中苦工。
The Hong Kong authorities are currently feeling the increasing number of prisoners, and most prisons have exceeded their original limits. They are now taking the approach of building concentration camps to accommodate prisoners, following examples from around the world, and assigning various government projects to prisoners to replace hard labor in prisons.

資本主義社會發展，囚犯的增多是必然的結果，在整個社會沒有改造之前，對於日益增多的囚犯安置問題，實有益趨嚴重之勢，固不僅本港二地爲然。現在建築集中營，自爲安置辦法之一一，因爲既可節省政府公帑，又可實行監獄制度的改善。不過鑒於過去各國囚犯集中營的弊害，爲事前補救計，第一是應該改善及推進囚犯的敎育一，至少使囚犯有讀報，俾獲知世界大勢；第二是改良囚犯的生活，給以相當體育與更人道的物質生活。
The increase in prisoners is a natural result of the development of capitalist society. Before the entire society is transformed, the problem of accommodating the increasing number of prisoners will inevitably become more serious. This is not only true for Hong Kong. The construction of concentration camps is one way to accommodate them, as it can save government funds and implement improvements to the prison system. However, in view of the past abuses of prisoner concentration camps in various countries, the first thing to do in order to prevent these problems is to improve and promote the education of prisoners, at least allowing them to read newspapers to learn about world affairs. The second is to improve the lives of prisoners, providing them with adequate sports and a more humane material life.

The thousands of isolated troops who mistakenly entered British territory, after being relocated by the Hong Kong authorities to the Matou Chung refugee camp, were eager to fight [Japanese] and felt ill-suited to the living conditions. They secretly formed groups and attempted to return to the front lines to serve the country. Because the garrison discovered and stopped them, bloody tragedies occurred many times. Those who were intercepted on the way were also sentenced to imprisonment separately. The issue of the treatment of the isolated troops is one of the reasons for their secret departure from the camp.

醫　總監　力圖改善
Director of Medical Services Strives for Improvement

記者昨以孤軍日常生活之改善問題、舉詢于醫藥總監司徒永覺（氏爲難民營之負責管理人、）據稱、政府規定撥給華軍衣食、巳極度充足，卽西人每日食用此數量亦相當充裕、至華軍之所以發生不滿者、或由於廚子之技術方面、未得完滿、致有所影響、現在已積極加以改淮、舉凡廚夫工役、均以富有經驗者充任、本人前以各難民管理工作、極度冗忙、故未暇及此、現救濟難民、已歸統一、救濟工作、吿一段落、特規定每星期至馬頭涌營巡視一次、如發覺有不善之處、逐步改良、至於禦寒之毛毡衣被、現目亦頗充足、幷就孤軍習慣所需要之娛樂、一一供應、使不致生活上感到寂寞、營中一切設備、已逐漸趨於完備之境、本人責有所司、當竭力謀改善、使華軍不致再有秘密離營之事件發生、
Yesterday, the reporter asked the Director of Medical Services, Situ Wing-kok (who is the responsible manager of the refugee camp) about the improvement of the daily lives of the isolated troops. It is said that the government's allocation of food and clothing for the Chinese troops is extremely sufficient, and even Westerners would find this amount sufficient for daily consumption. The reason why the Chinese troops are dissatisfied may be due to the fact that the skills of the cooks are not perfect, which has had an impact. Active improvements are now being made. All chefs and workers are now experienced. I was previously too busy with the management of the refugees and did not have time for this. Now that the refugee relief work has been unified and has come to an end, I have specifically decided to inspect the Matou Chung camp once a week. If I find any shortcomings, I will gradually improve them. As for the woolen blankets and bedding for warmth, there are now quite enough of them. Entertainment that the isolated troops need according to their habits will be supplied one by one so that they do not feel lonely in their lives. All the equipment in the camp is gradually becoming perfect. I have a responsibility and will strive to improve things so that the Chinese troops do not secretly leave the camp again.

According to a report in the English Sunday newspaper in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government authorities, in view of the current overcrowding in various prisons, plan to implement a prisoner labor system to disperse them and save a lot of expenses for the Public Works Department. The method is to build a camp, to which all prisoners serving short sentences will be transferred. These prisoners will be used to engage in various public works. According to Prison Officer Wilcox, this method is not new. He implemented this method in the colony where he previously served, and the results were very satisfactory. Concentrating prisoners for work is practiced in many other parts of the world and has become a common trend in modern punishment methods. This measure can not only save a lot of expenditure on public works, but also reduce the cumbersome procedures for registering new prisoners, thereby reducing expenses and personnel. Those sent to this camp are first-time offenders serving short sentences. The work they do may be more difficult than the work they do in prison, but doing it in the open air is naturally more comfortable for the body and mind and far better than living in a cage. This camp will become a permanent facility. It will not be surrounded by stone walls, but only by wire mesh, just like the method of detaining prisoners of war during the last World War. It is now planned to carry out a great land reclamation project in Kowloon Bay, and the work will likely become one of the tasks assigned to these prisoners, but this matter is still under discussion. Also, the number of prisoners in the various prisons in Hong Kong has now doubled the original capacity, and the above-mentioned method has almost become an urgent measure.

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The central government has established various methods of rewards and preferential treatment for increasing production and exporting domestic goods, in order to lay the economic foundation of the country during this difficult period of resistance. Overseas Chinese also deeply understand this purpose and give it enthusiastic support, so the export of domestic goods is improving day by day. However, recently, some shameless [Japanese people] have been repackaging [Japanese goods] to pretend to be domestic goods in order to deceive overseas Chinese and seize our domestic goods market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, seeing this, has telegraphed chambers of commerce in various parts of the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) to pay attention to this matter. In the future, the export of domestic goods will be given concrete proof by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Please investigate to avoid being deceived. As for the incident of pretending to be domestic goods, active measures are also being taken to prevent it. As for the goods transported from factories in Hong Kong to Nanyang, whether they are piece goods, foreign goods, woven goods, hardware, or various other items, they are all inspected by the relevant chamber of commerce. When it is determined that they are indeed domestic goods without error, a corresponding certificate is issued. When overseas Chinese purchase goods, a certificate can immediately determine the truth and the cunning scheme of those who pretend to be genuine [is uncovered], and it is difficult for them to sell. As for the piece goods sold retail in Hong Kong, those that are genuine domestic goods must have a certificate from the Piece Goods Dealers Association, which is hung high in a conspicuous place in the store. Those who do not have this certificate are feared to be counterfeit. Because the prerequisite for obtaining this certificate is to sell genuine domestic goods. If there is any fraud, once discovered, the seller is willing to be punished by the regulations of the Piece Goods Congress with a fine of several hundred yuan to purchase public bonds, and their store name will be publicized as a warning. Overseas Chinese who want to buy genuine domestic cloth or domestic goods must pay attention to this matter. (Luo)

### Special Report by This Newspaper: Firewood Shortage! Firewood Shortage! The Tragedy of the Impoverished Class

— Cai Lusheng

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, with the fall of Xiamen and Guangzhou, and the widespread harassment of the South China coastline by the enemy, Hong Kong—this "haven" of "refuge"—has experienced a rapid surge in population due to the influx of refugees from various regions like a tide. The price of all daily necessities has skyrocketed due to demand exceeding supply. Moreover, due to the blockage of transportation in the mainland, the source of goods has been almost completely cut off, leading to constant shortages and deficits.

Living in this "haven" where exchange rates are high and the cost of living increases daily, it is already difficult for refugees and "quasi-refugees" to sustain a basic livelihood, let alone with the manipulation and monopolization by merchants seeking to profit from the "national crisis." Under the distorted state of so-called "rice as pearls and firewood as cassia," the lives of the impoverished class are even more distressed!

Now, let's talk about the "firewood shortage," a problem that has been lingering for a long time without resolution. There are many "small issues" that have been overlooked by the bigwigs.

Firewood, which accounts for an important part of the "seven necessities of life," used to be very cheap in Hong Kong. One dollar could generally buy more than a hundred catties. However, now, due to the increase in demand and the disruption of the mainland as a source of supply due to transportation blockades, firewood imported from places like "Singapore" and "Sandakan" has become expensive due to high transportation costs. As a result, the price of all firewood has doubled, and there is still a shortage of supply.

Because of the scarcity of firewood and its price becoming "unattainably high," families with limited purchasing power—or refugees and "quasi-refugees"—often "cherish" things that were previously unnoticed for economic reasons, such as worn-out mats, old wooden clogs, wood shavings, waste paper, etc., and pile them up in front of the stove, even sending them into the stove. Sometimes, they also buy some rotten wood at the entrance that seems to have been dug out of the ground, riddled with termite holes, or some timber stolen by "mountain rats." The price is, of course, a bit cheaper. However, this kind of stolen timber is only dared to be bought by families living in more remote areas, but they often abandon it in large quantities out of a "guilty conscience" due to rumors that the "police" are coming to inspect private firewood.

From the perspective of us "outsiders," Hong Kong, with its tropical climate, has lush trees and mountain grass, and firewood is everywhere. Why the "firewood shortage"? But after living here for a long time, you will know that these are all "royal" "wildlands." Not only are people not allowed to cut them down, but there are also many "police" officers specifically responsible for protecting the trees. If anyone is caught stealing timber, they will be subject to penalties such as fines or imprisonment. Therefore, except for a small number of "mountain rats" who steal firewood for a living, and impoverished people who steal some to sell or use, people with a relatively comfortable life certainly dare not and are unwilling to engage in this kind of "criminal" activity.

In slightly remote mountainous areas, "firewood theft" is often discovered. Every time in the twilight of the setting sun, you can often see some impoverished men and women, covered in dust, in groups of several people, carrying some "stolen" rotten wood and broken branches on their shoulders and backs, sneaking down from the mountain paths like frightened birds. Although the "theft" of those rotten wood and broken branches does not damage the "scenery" of this island in any way, if they unfortunately encounter the "police" guarding the trees, they will inevitably face lawsuits—and imprisonment.

Not long ago, I saw a poorly dressed, impoverished woman carrying some small, rotten, withered branches that she had picked up, which should not be considered "illegal" in any way, and a few broken wooden clogs, walking along the seaside. Unexpectedly, a "police" officer saw her. Due to excessive panic, in the process of running and struggling, she somehow accidentally fell into the dirty, smelly, and neck-deep harbor. At this time, many people immediately gathered on the shore to watch the "show." The woman stood dripping wet in the sea, soaking in the icy cold seawater. She trembled, staring miserably at the people on the shore, staring at the majestic "police" officer. She never saw a single sympathetic hand. She was poor, she was helpless, she was "breaking the law," her tears flowed like a spring. In despair, everything was despair. She no longer wanted to live so miserably. She suddenly turned around and plunged into the sea. The whole person disappeared. At this time, the people watching the "show" on the shore began to stir, shouting anxiously: Save her! Save her!

In the instant that the woman's life or death was determined, a young man could no longer bear to watch this tragedy. Regardless of the "dignity" of his clothing, he jumped into the sea. He managed to grab the woman's long hair, and with great effort, he managed to save the woman back to shore. However, the woman had swallowed a bellyful of seawater and her face was ashen. She was unconscious. In the end, she was carried away to "report the incident"!

Another time, it was one evening when the night was already getting dark. Near my residence, beside the highway in a depression, a group of poorly clad, impoverished children who had returned from scavenging were gathered around. Each of them had an empty basket hanging on their arms, their eyes glistening with tears as they watched the rotten branches, tangerine peels, and fallen leaves, etc., that they had worked hard to collect all day being confiscated and gathered together to be burned. However, this should be a relatively "compassionate" scene.

"Firewood shortage"! If the "firewood shortage" cannot be resolved and continues to be a shortage, then many tragedies that are not very "pleasing to the eye" will continue to be staged and will increase day by day—although the problem is not limited to being as simple as a "firewood shortage."

### Pearl River Channel Opening Issue: No Hope for Resolution Yet. The Jinshan Wheel's Resumption of Navigation is Difficult to Achieve. Foreign Vessels Remaining in the Province Will Soon Be Released.

The Jinshan Wheel, which once test-sailed between Guangzhou and Hong Kong a month ago, has recently been rumored to resume navigation again. This reporter said that to understand whether the ship would resume, he specifically visited the person in charge of the ship's office yesterday. The answer was: Guangzhou is now a dead market. Even if this ship resumes navigation, our people may not take it back to the province. If there are no passengers and few goods, the cost is too high and it is difficult to maintain for long. This ship is considering this issue. The saying of resuming navigation in these few days will be difficult to achieve. It is also checked that foreign vessels such as Dongan and Dali, which are trapped in the provincial river, have not yet been released. According to yesterday's English weekly newspaper, it said that the foreign vessels remaining in the province would be released back to Hong Kong during the day. This is the result of the British negotiations with the enemy. According to another news, the issue of the official opening of the Pearl River Channel has not yet reached the stage of resolution. The enemy still insists on exclusive occupation, only allowing enemy ships to navigate, and third-country merchant ships cannot touch it.

### Smugglers are Rampant: Customs Forms Motorcycle Squad to Strictly Arrest

Recently, smugglers on the border of Hong Kong have been very rampant, smuggling dutiable goods into the mainland in large quantities. In order to step up the work of arresting them, the customs authorities have now organized a motorcycle squad and a special team to patrol between the Kowloon-Canton Railway and the Po Tai Road, so that smugglers have nowhere to escape.

### The Fishermen's Association Submits a Petition to the Central Relief Commission, Asking the Hong Kong Government to Protect Fishermen, and Sends a Letter to Cai Chusheng Regarding Work Relief Measures, Requesting the Purchase of Fishing Boats for Work Relief Cooperation with Relief Funds

Xu Shiying, Acting Member of the Central Relief Commission, believes that fishermen have been ravaged by the enemy, causing them to gather in Hong Kong waters and not dare to sail for work, thus leaving them without a livelihood. He specifically ordered the Fishermen's Association to create a detailed report, so that it could be forwarded to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in preparation for submitting it to the British government for protection. The Fishermen's Association obeyed the order and did so, and yesterday submitted a petition to the Commission. The content of the petition first stated the total number of fishing boats that had been in distress and the total number of casualties, as well as the total value of the property lost, and then described the number of fishing boats in distress in 1939, which had reached as many as forty-six. Finally, it stated the importance of fishing to Hong Kong's commerce, and that most of the fishermen were Hong Kong citizens, appealing to the authorities to negotiate with the British, requesting the Hong Kong authorities to provide protection, or for the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate with the enemy, and that these unarmed fishing boats should not be slaughtered.

Relief for Fishermen: Work Relief Cooperation

Regarding the method of providing relief to fishermen in distress, social figures concerned about this incident have proposed various methods of relief. However, the number of unemployed fishermen is very large, and if the goal is to benefit everyone, it is indeed difficult to plan. Yesterday, the Fishermen's Association specifically replied to Cai Chusheng's contribution of views, and now it quoted its original letter as follows: Dear Mr. Chusheng, Having received your letter, as well as the letter from the Joint Committee of All Sectors of Hong Kong for Relief to South China Refugees to you, I am aware of everything. I am entrusted to draw up a relief distribution plan, etc. The Relief Association, despite its simplicity, tentatively proposes the following: Those in urgent need of relief number no less than thousands, and even women and children number no less than hundreds. Now, because there are many victims and the relief funds are only two thousand national currency, if only women and children are provided with relief and men are not, it seems to be biased in favor of universality. Even if it is limited to women and children, if two thousand national currencies are divided and distributed, each person will receive only two or three yuan. With these two or three yuan, thrifty people can use it for two weeks or one month. If it is not wasted, it will only be enough for a moment. Therefore, although the Relief Association has obtained a fundamental relief for the fishermen in distress, the charitable funds must be used to handle charity that also combines production, so that their talents can be displayed, their skills can be used, and collective economy can be used to benefit a large group. Therefore, this Association has repeatedly stated to the Deputy Chairman of the Central Relief Commission, in order to provide fundamental relief.

Work Relief Measures: Purchase Boats for Fishing

Now, I am entrusted to draw up a distribution plan, and this Association only recommends work relief cooperation as a suggestion, for the following reason: The work relief cooperation method can use two thousand national currency, which is more than one thousand and ten Hong Kong dollars, to purchase four small fishing boats (Gu Zai) for the use of fishermen in distress to fish. This Association, according to the household registration on the People's Livelihood Registration List, selects 515 people whose lives are the most difficult, excluding women and children who cannot work, and 240 people who can work and produce. These 240 people will be divided into several teams, with five people arranged on each boat for each team. Each team is limited to five days, and each person can work for five days. The income earned in five days will be divided into six parts, with each person occupying one part, and the remaining part will be used as a public accumulation for the cost of repairing the boats. In this way, every victim can benefit. All women and children can be given hemp spinning and weaving, which can also obtain a considerable solution, and at the same time, it can promote the first voice of fishermen's cooperation, and the charitable funds will also be used for a long time. How are the above two points considered to be brilliant? If it is in accordance with the intention of Mr. He Xiangning in the letter, this Association does not agree, but only asks to set a method and hand it over to this Association for execution.

### Feature: Kowloon Handcart Porters: Request Reduction of Cart Rental Tide Resolved: Cart Rental Restores to Original Price After April 1

Braving the piercing cold wind, drinking the icy cold rain, under the spur of life, the handcart porters who still shake their spirits late at night and huddle on the lonely streets to struggle can be regarded as the most tragic workers among the toiling masses in a prosperous city!

Under the chewing of the gears of this great era, the handcart is gradually entering the stage of elimination. In the near future, it will finally become a thing of the past like the horse-drawn carriage, leaving only a page of record in the history of world transportation development!

Here, in this Xiangdao, which is known as Little Dunlun and still maintains the special colors left over from the feudal era, the reason why the handcart profession continues to drag on for a long time is to allow distant tourists to appreciate the unique industry of the Far East. Naturally, it is a miracle of Hong Kong. It is not swallowed by the flood of transportation tools (buses or long-distance cars) because it has a special transportation function that is incredible. Its only life-saving elixir is said to be that it was specially approved to be retained until now because it had served the local "royal family." The handcart porters in the Peak area of Hong Kong are descendants of those who voluntarily participated in the work for humanitarian reasons during the unprecedented World War (?). As for the handcart porters in the Yau Ma Tei to Jordan Road area of Kowloon, they were even given special merit for serving the Hong Kong government during the 1926 war. From that time on, they have been maintaining the work of pulling carts to this day. Their original homes are mostly from Hailufeng. This incident of the Kowloon cart pullers requesting the "pit head" to reduce cart rental also occurred among the handcart pullers in the Yau Ma Tei area.

The matter is like this: In the past, handcart pullers would directly rent carts from the five major handcart owners facing the sea. The daily rent was between four and a half hairs and five hairs. From 1927 to the present, there has not been much change. Only recently did Shi Yanxx's "pit head" (meaning someone who rents a large number of vehicles from the owners and sublets them to the handcart pullers) raise the rent of the 19 handcarts under his name to eight hairs. The cart pullers added this heavy burden. The money earned by their blood and sweat labor every day, after deducting the remaining money from the cart rental, was not enough to maintain their lives. Therefore, they had to ask the "pit head" to reduce it somewhat. After several negotiations between the two sides, the "pit head" was still unwilling to reduce the cart rental. As a result, this group of toiling masses finally complained to the Chinese Affairs Secretary, requesting to uphold justice. After several mediations, it was not until February 1 this year that it came to an end.

It is heard that as a result of this mediation, the workers finally achieved a final victory. Yanxx was only allowed to continue to batch the 19 handcarts for one season (until April 1), and return them to the two major cart owners, Yanxx and Yanxx, when they expired. In the future, each handcart puller will operate as before and can directly rent the cart from the owner, and the cart fee will be the same as the others and cannot be increased. However, a deposit of six Hong Kong dollars must be paid, the purpose of which is to prevent arrears of rent. It will only be allowed to be recovered when the rent is returned.

This trend has been resolved. Although the handcart pullers have achieved a final victory on the surface, during the negotiation process in the past, the cart pullers still had to pay a daily rent of eight hairs and eight cents until April 1 of this year. This unexpected loss still fell on the cart pullers, and there was no compensation! (Min)

Transportation and Travel

### Aerial Tour of the Philippines

— Ke Shaoming

After yearning for a long time, I finally got a seven-day vacation. In advance, we repeatedly planned how to use this short vacation to travel to a place we had never been to before, and change the daily environment that we were tired of. But this problem never had a satisfactory solution, because of time constraints, distant places could not be visited, and eight or nine out of ten nearby places had been visited. At the same time, there were flames of war everywhere, and many places could not be visited. As a result, we got instructions from a travel agency to take Pan American Airlines' Clipper to Manila, visit Baguio and the Pagsanjan Falls in the North Mountain. We went on Thursday and returned to Hong Kong on Wednesday next week on the Western Airlines plane flying from San Francisco. It only took six days, and the round-trip fare, including meals, accommodation and sightseeing, only cost HK$490 per person. At such a low price, we visited the famous Baguio Mountain in the Far East and took the world-renowned Clipper twice. We did not hesitate to realize this plan.

At 7:15 on Thursday morning, we gathered at the Kowloon Peninsula Hotel and took the beautiful bus prepared by the airline to Kai Tak Airport. After checking our passports and weighing our luggage, we took a two-minute motorboat to board the giant Clipper, because it was moored on the water three or four hundred yards from the shore. Mail and guests were transferred by motorboat. The one we took this time was the Hawaii Clipper (the plane went missing a few weeks after the author took it). It was produced by the American Martin factory and was equipped with four 800-horsepower engines, which traveled at 150 miles per hour and carried 28 passengers. After boarding the plane, we took our seats in the order of the numbers on the purchased tickets. The plane was divided into two floors. The upper floor was the cockpit, the radio operator's room, and miscellaneous items such as mail, luggage, and fuel. The front part of the lower floor was the captain's room, the staff room, and most of the middle part was the cabin. The rear part was the bathroom and the kitchen. The comfortable seats could be turned into berths at night, but this route, except from San Francisco to Honolulu, did not fly at night. The berths were only suitable for that section. After taking off at 8:30, we looked down at Hong Kong and the countless large and small islands surrounding Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was a spectacle. Just that moment was worth our flight. Although we were 8,000 feet in the air, except for the engine noise, which was a bit harsh, we did not feel much different from riding in a car. The Hong Kong newspapers and newly published American magazines were available for guests to read that day. Sitting in an armchair, looking at the wonders of the universe, we were unconsciously at noon. We ate a delicious lunch on the plane and arrived in Manila at 2:00 pm. We took a car to the designated hotel to rest. The hotel was newly built and well-equipped, and suitable for the tropics. After putting down our luggage, we walked around. The streets of Manila were neat and clean, with towering trees. The residential area was even more beautiful. People walked in it as if they were in a park. That was Manila's new city. It turned out that Manila was divided into new and old cities. Europeans and Americans, new-style shops, banks, and hotels were mostly in the new city. The old city was built by the Spanish and mostly inhabited by natives. After watching the sunset, we returned to the hotel, because the sunset in Manila was one of the wonders.

The next day, we took a car to tour the city. First, we went to the old city. The streets were clean, but not as good as the new city. The houses were uneven and very different. The moat outside the city wall had been filled and turned into a golf course. We visited Manila Cathedral, the University of the Philippines, and the museum. Unfortunately, we were not very familiar with the historical evolution of the Philippines, otherwise this trip would have been much more interesting.

Originally, we planned to visit Pagsanjan Falls in the North Mountain on the third morning and return to Manila that night. Later, after listening to other people's advice, the North Mountain Falls were suitable for visiting in the morning to avoid the heat of the sun, and the wonders before noon were ever-changing, and they would lose their original appearance after noon. So we went there that day and rested at the Pagsanjan Falls for one night. We got up in the morning, had a light breakfast, changed into our swimsuits, put on a wide-brimmed hat, and walked to the river bank. We boarded a small canoe made of a single log. Each boat could only seat one person, but there were two experienced boatmen in front and behind the boat to steer and paddle. At first, we paddled in the lake, and there was nothing unusual. Only the surrounding cliffs were as high as three or four hundred feet, and coconut trees grew all over the mountains. After paddling for a while, the water became rapid and many waterfalls were discovered. Our small boat went down against the current, which was extremely dangerous. If we were not careful, we would capsize. Even if you were good at swimming, you could not resist the rapids. Fortunately, the boatmen were all experienced. We passed countless rapids and encountered more than five dangers. At the same time, we heard the mournful cries of monkeys, which increased the sadness in our hearts. After two hours, we arrived at a calm inner lake. After resting for a while, we returned along the same road. Although the boatmen were not as tired as when they came, the degree of danger was reversed. We were terrified. After a little over half an hour, we returned to the original place (half an hour less than when we came (everyone breathed a sigh of relief and went to the hotel to change clothes and take a car back to Manila along another road.

On the fourth day, at 6:30 in the morning, we took Philippine Airlines' Pelaika plane to Baguio. The plane was very small in scale, far less than the Clipper. It could only accommodate four passengers. The altitude of the flight was from 1,000 feet to 7,500 feet. We arrived in Baguio one hour later. Baguio is a famous summer resort in the Far East. Even in the hot summer, we still wore autumn clothes. It is said that the people who live there are Iliguae, who are culturally backward and extremely fierce, and are completely different from Filipinos. Not long ago, there were still incidents of killing white people. With the introduction of friends, we stayed at the Country Club. First, we went to the market to see that the Iliguae people were not as scary as rumored, and were also very close to tourists. They carved wooden heads and peddled them to tourists. We bought a few, as well as some wooden carvings as souvenirs, because Baguio is a place that tourists often visit. There are many highways and well-equipped hotels. If you don't take a plane, you can reach it by public bus from Manila in four or five hours. The authorities have also opened several complete golf courses. Tame horses can be rented. We galloped for a while and returned to the Country Club to rest.

On the fifth day, we took the Pelaika plane we took yesterday back to Manila and visited again. In the evening, we went to the lively streets to sightsee again.

On the sixth day, we took the China Clipper from San Francisco back to Hong Kong. Before arriving in Hong Kong, the plane stopped in Macau. Pan American Airlines hired a car for us to tour the entire city. We stayed for about 50 minutes and continued flying. We arrived at Kai Tak Airport at 1:10 pm.

From Hong Kong to Baguio, if you take a plane, you will arrive in Manila on the first day and change planes to Baguio on the second day. It takes three or four days by ship, two days in Manila, and change to a train or public bus to Baguio.

### Yellow Mountain Travelogue (1)

— Huang Jiayin

Although it was only two or three years ago, things have changed, gatherings and separations are impermanent. The travel companions of the past are now scattered like clouds and have gone their separate ways. Therefore, although it was only two or three years ago, it seems like a distant dream.

It was the spring of 1936 when school was out for spring break. More than a dozen of us like-minded classmates who often spent time together organized a tour group with Huangshan in Anhui Province as our destination.

We took a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, and then a long-distance bus from Hangzhou directly to the foot of Huangshan.

The Lullaby of Nature

On the first night of arriving at Huangshan, we stayed at the China Travel Service guesthouse. The place was quiet, and the environment was elegant. Because there were so many of us, although there were not enough beds, I spent the most comfortable night of my life there.

The rustling of the towering trees outside being blown by the wind, mixed with the gurgling sound of the spring water in the deep valley, formed the gentlest lullaby sung by the mother of nature. After the sound of laughter gradually disappeared, I finally fell asleep in the embrace of nature. This was the most memorable sleep in recent years, reminiscent of the restful sleep in my mother's warm embrace in childhood.

A Beautiful Maze

We seemed to have entered a beautiful maze, running east and west among the mountains formed by those huge, unparalleled boulders. We walked a distance, and then another distance, until we were exhausted, still surrounded by mountains. The rugged mountain road seemed endless. (To be continued)

### Special Shipping News

The French mail ship Felix Roussel, originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai this morning, was delayed in leaving Shanghai and will now arrive tomorrow morning. It will then depart at 4:00 PM on the same afternoon for Saigon, Singapore, Marseilles, and other ports. The Italian mail ship/cargo ship Hulubei, originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Europe today, has had too many port calls, so the arrival date has been changed to the 10th of this month.

The Taizi Shipping Company's Qinghua Taizi will arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai tomorrow morning and dock directly at the Kowloon Dockyard. About three to four hundred tons of goods from the United States and Shanghai will be unloaded there. The ship will then depart on the 11th for Luzon, Iloilo, Mayaguez, Boston, Halifax, and other ports.

### On the Way to Yan'an

— Sun Enlin

Two years ago, going to northern Shaanxi was more convenient in terms of transportation than it is now, but the people were not as straightforward as they are now. Looking back at the scene at that time, there are still things worth recounting. I will write down the journey from Xi'an to Fushi, as far as I can remember. As for issues concerning people and politics, firstly, time has passed and they have become things of the past; secondly, this article focuses on free observation and unrestrained expression, emphasizing only interest and avoiding other topics, so I will omit them all.

It was precisely the season of bright spring in Jiangnan when we—Mr. Yu Songhua and I—arrived in Xi'an. The next day, we encountered a sandstorm the likes of which had not been seen in decades. Looking out from the window of the Xijing Guest House, the whistling wind was swirling yellow sand in the air, obscuring the sky and the earth. The bleak and grayish-yellow scene made this ancient city of Chang'an appear particularly arid and cheerless.

After the strong wind came rain. The clay roads in the Northwest became impassable to vehicles when wet, so we didn't set off for northern Shaanxi until the fourth day. In advance, we had made arrangements at "Seven Sages Village" and hitched a ride on a grain truck. From Xi'an to Fushi, it normally takes two days, but most of these freight trucks were already old, and they were carrying thousands of pounds of grain. Like a gaunt, old ox, even with the whip, they were beyond help. We departed from Xi'an on the morning of the 4th and didn't arrive in Fushi until the afternoon of the 16th.

There were a total of five large trucks going to northern Shaanxi that day. Mr. Weng and I each occupied a seat next to the driver in two different trucks. Before we set off, we had already inquired about the simple travel accommodations and food along the way, and we also received good intentions from those who were hosting us. They first explained to us: "I'm afraid you two gentlemen are not used to it. It would be better if you could bring your own bedding and sundries." So we asked Mr. Zhou from the guest house to rent four cotton quilts and purchased flannel blankets, washbasins, mouthwash cups, goggles, flashlights, thermos bottles, canned food, etc. Mr. Yu also bought some cigarettes—including the mild "Three Cannons" brand. When I checked my luggage, I also put milk malt extract powder, sugar cubes, and wheat biscuits that I had brought from Shanghai into the basket. At first, we felt really ashamed, why couldn't we live a few days of the simplest life? But later we felt that traveling in this "remote wilderness" of northern Shaanxi, bringing some cigarettes wouldn't hurt, and we packed the basket full. The tires of those old trucks, when climbing uphill, wouldn't slip or fall back easily.

It was not easy climbing to the top of the mountain. The truck needed to add water and be repaired, the drivers needed to rest, and we also took the opportunity to get out of the car and stretch our muscles. The top of the mountain was a flat piece of clay land, which really surprised us. We smoked our cigarettes and drank the boiled water we brought, pacing on this mountain top with its strange and fantastical scenery. Looking up, many of the mountain peaks were flattened, as if countless large round tables had been placed there, but the tabletops were empty. Some mountains showed huge scars—as if mad gods had fought there, and the giant spirits had broken them with their palms, the streaks of the traces were very obvious, like giant candles burning in nature, and the candle tears had formed countless miracles. Although the mountains stood still, our eyes, when staring at this mountain or that mountain for a little longer, seemed to see many ancient, huge beasts rising slowly with the smoke swirling around our fingers, jumping between the mountain ridges and giant valleys; the more we looked, the more unclear it became, illusions, clouds... Suddenly we heard the car driver shout, "The car is fixed, everyone get in and let's go!" We then threw our tiny cigarettes into the deep valley and re-embarked on our journey.

Near Yijun, the terrain was the highest, with dozens of ascents and descents, we finally reached Luochuan, the closest point to Yan'an, and stayed overnight. Along the way, in addition to experiencing the northern Shaanxi scenery of the yellow sand and barren land, we also encountered many simple and honest common people. On the road, we often saw a clumsy ox cart coming towards us. The inability of the car to yield to the ox cart was really like city people looking down on country people. So the Shaanxi people with their heavy accents would anxiously jump out of the car and try to drag the ox to the side of the road. The ox's brain was even more unclear, and the villager's situation was even more anxious. On the one hand, he was afraid that the car would crush the livestock or overturn the things on the cart—nothing more than some coal, fodder, or firewood, and on the other hand, he could hear the drivers who were used to fast roads cursing there. That kind of embarrassing and pitiful situation was constantly revealed in his "trying every possible means." Some villagers, driving mules carrying coal on their backs, galloped in the mountain roads, making "hissing" sounds in their mouths to urge the livestock to run faster. They ran dozens of miles a day, selling the heavy and worthless coal, and the reward they got was less than a few dozen coppers. Some people regard sugar, tea, or water fruit as having incredible wonders.

The "Weiyang Ancient Ferry" loomed before our eyes. Before reaching Sanyuan, we had to cross the historically famous Wei River and Jing River. There were wooden elms erected on the river surface, which looked not very strong. Fortunately, there were some square-headed wooden boats lying under the bridgehead, supporting the bridge surface and acting as pillars in the middle of the river. When we saw this situation, we couldn't help but feel uneasy. Fortunately, the people in the car all felt the same way, so everyone got out of the car and walked across the bridge. The drivers, however, disregarded everything and drove one by one to the other side. Many mules, horses, and handcarts used square-headed ferries to cross the river, and some also walked across the bridge. The water in the Wei River was originally very turbid, and the flow was not rapid. In the eyes of Southerners, is this kind of river worth missing? However, since passing the Jing River, all the way to Yan'an, there were no wide rivers except for a few streams.

We spent a night in Yaoxian. On the way to the second rest stop, Luochuan, we had to pass through Tongguan, Yijun, and the middle part—the location of the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum—the terrain gradually became higher, and the car road suddenly went low and suddenly high, climbing over mountains and ridges, and winding around. All that met the eye was ochre-red and grayish-yellow soil mountains. Don't underestimate the soil mountains here, they don't refer to ordinary small mounds or randomly piled mud. They are many strange and fantastical scenes, sometimes after looking at them for a long time, it almost makes people go crazy. According to geologists, these many loess soils were blown eastward from Mongolia by the strong winds of Central Asia thousands of years ago, and over time, they became the strange phenomenon they are now. The car struggled to climb the mountain from the valley, and the creaking sound clearly told people that it was doing its duty to the fullest. However, the driver had to do his duty even more, stepping on the highest gear and opening the accelerator to the maximum. This poor car was fighting with the steep mountain slope with its last drop of blood. Of course, it was even slower than walking, moving forward step by step. The freight truck I was riding in, in addition to the driver, also had an assistant. At this time, his work was extremely tense. He was holding a huge wooden mallet in his hand. When the car was climbing uphill, when it was at its most critical moment and about to "lose power," he would wedge this large wooden mallet under the rear wheel. In this way, he helped this responsible and old car, not even for a copper penny.

The life of the people in northern Shaanxi can be represented by four colors—red, yellow, gray, and black. They live in cave dwellings—caves dug in the yellow earth mountains, they eat coarse noodles or hard steamed buns, which are gray and yellowish. They are served with red chili sauce and gray salt. The clothes they wear, although they were not originally black, are covered with a lot of gray sand and yellow earth due to lack of water. They are shiny and oily, and if they are not black, they are black. Everything seems to be no simpler or cruder. If people's property, clothing, housing, etc., can be calculated in thickness, then the people of northern Shaanxi, apart from their naked bodies, are only covered with a thin film.

In Luochuan, we met Mr. Liu, the director of the radio station, from Wujin, and Mr. Chen, the director of the telegraph office, from Ningbo. Thousands of miles away from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they were naturally very happy to meet us Jiangnan people. And us, although we had only left Shanghai a week ago, because the change in the environment was too drastic and too rapid, it seemed like we had been away from our hometown for several years. At first sight, we also felt a sense of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land."

In the afternoon, as the faint sunlight shone on the city walls of Yan'an and was about to fade westward, we entered this ancient city. Because they had already received notice from Xi'an, someone came to greet us and put us up in the guest house. Although we slept on earthen beds and ate gray steamed buns, we met some famous people who were doing many complex and difficult tasks and living the simplest and most humble lives.

Night came, and I walked back from the street. There were no gas lamps, let alone electric lights. Many common people and vendors were doing business under the dim candlelight and oil lamps. They sold roughly made handicrafts, hard steamed buns, noodles, cakes, and some vegetables. The streets were also quite lively, but around seven or eight o'clock, the market dispersed. Darkness and calmness were intertwined on the streets of Yan'an, because although the people there had weapons, they did not necessarily wear leather shoes. Except for hearing faint command sounds from afar and seeing the bright flashlight light in the darkness, you wouldn't know that there were still people walking on the dark streets. This is the "night" of Yan'an.

### A Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

Seizing silk factories in the war zone, with no time to take care of sericulture farms. On the one hand, it is also because there are not yet degenerates in the sericulture seed industry like Zhang Zizhen and Qian in Wuxi who are loudly denounced. Although there are also people who collude with the puppet government, on the whole, they can still maintain the dignity and integrity of the sericulture seed production farms of the Republic of China. This is the evaluation of the war zone sericulture seed industry's perseverance and struggle under such difficult circumstances for the past year.

However, the occupied area is still an occupied area. The Japanese conspiracy against China as a whole is ultimately fierce and vicious, and You Xiaobiao's (the second section chief and technician of the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, and concurrently the director of the Sericulture Control Office, who is actually the highest authority in sericulture administration in the puppet Jiangsu Province) is ultimately just a spineless traitor. Trying to continue operating sericulture seed production in the occupied area according to the previous policy, or trying to maintain the status of the sericulture seed production farm under the protection of people like You Xiaobiao, or even taking the opportunity to gain some benefits, is all a pipe dream. Because in business, (1) no eggs are left unbroken under an overturned nest, (2) slaves have no right or courage to interfere with the "master" (?) and participate in the end discussions. These are the two preconditions that the war zone sericulture seed industry should fully recognize.

Therefore, we further discuss the recent attack of the "Central China Silk Company" on the sericulture seed production industry in the war zone.

Two or Five Conditions for Destruction

Recently, in order to implement control over the sericulture seed industry in the war zone and to achieve the extraction or destruction of the entire silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "Central China Silk Company" has proposed "cooperation" to the Hushu Pass Dayou Sericulture Seed Production Farm, which has always been known as the oldest and largest brand in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This is the first shot fired by the Japanese at the sericulture seed farms in the war zone, and it is undoubtedly intended to be promoted to all the sericulture seed farms in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zone. The terms of cooperation are tentatively set at five, which are excerpted as follows:

(1) The original seeds must be purchased from the company and may not be reproduced or transferred.

(2) The company will send a technical advisor, and the farm will pay the salary.

(3) The disease rate shall not exceed 3 per 1000.

(4) The manufactured silkworm seeds shall be sold by the company and shall not be sold or transferred to others. Half of the seed money will be paid upon delivery of the seeds, and the remainder will be paid after July for spring seeds and after October for autumn seeds.

(5) If the silkworm seeds issued produce poor results, the farm will be responsible for compensation.

Among the five conditions, the first, fourth, and fifth are the most vicious. The second and third are merely supplementary to these three. I will analyze them further below.

Regarding the first article, it actually contains three sinister meanings. First, of course, it is to control the silkworm varieties in the war zone, causing the excellent varieties originally cultivated by several larger sericulture seed farms to be eliminated. In this way, on the one hand, various farms will not be able to obtain original seeds for breeding to produce ordinary silkworm seeds unless they cooperate with the "Central China Silk Company." In other words: they will rely solely on the Japanese, so the existence and elimination of silk can be completely controlled by the Japanese supply of original seeds. Second, since the war, Japan has restricted the import of wool, but because Japan's wool production is poor, it has to find other remedies, so there is the so-called cocoon-quality wool (that is, cocoons are treated with chemicals to make them a fiber similar to wool). Not only are the cocoons used as raw materials for cocoon-quality wool not necessarily as good as the raw materials for silk, but they are actually more suitable for cocoons that are unsuitable for silk making, so after promoting breeding in the country, it was met with fierce opposition from the silk industry, the reason being that the promotion of this kind of inferior raw material cocoons will inevitably greatly affect the production of excellent cocoons for silk making. Therefore, if the Japanese control the original seeds in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zone, so that various farms buy their products, they will of course take the opportunity to import this type of variety into the war zone, on the one hand, they can get the Chinese in the war zone to produce raw materials for them, in order to achieve their purpose of squeezing, and on the other hand, they can alleviate the opposition from the domestic silk industry. Third, the Japanese have always regarded China as an enemy country of their silk industry, because China has a vast land and abundant labor force, and the silk industry still has great potential for development. Japan is just the opposite. Precisely because of this, the threat to the Japanese silk kingdom is also the greatest. Therefore, after the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the main areas of China's silk industry, the Japanese government has repeatedly sent authorities from the domestic silk industry, such as Kogure of Higashi-Taka Sericulture, Fukumoto, and Hayashi Teizo of Ueda, to successively investigate and view sacrifices, in order to obtain an overall policy on Chinese silk. At that time, the Japanese argument was that there were two types of complete elimination and development, but now the Japanese conspiracy is to adopt controlled development elimination in the war zone, that is, to carry out controlled development in the war zones such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Except for the Japanese, the Chinese side has no buying and selling relations with other foreign countries, so that the position of Chinese silk in the world consumer market will be terminated and eliminated. In this way, there is no need to worry about the competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk, and the treasures of the silk industry in the war zone can be obtained. Once the original seeds in the war zone are controlled, this goal can of course be easily achieved. The most obvious example is that if the silkworm varieties that are unsuitable for silk making are promoted in the war zone, then the silk factories in Shanghai and the small silk factories in the war zone will not be able to and will not bother to collect the raw material cocoons produced in the war zone, because these cocoons are no longer the raw materials needed for silk making. This is the so-called "establishment of a century-old plan" loudly advocated by the Japanese, and it is also the veneer of "economic cooperation" that the Japanese government calls for.

### Special Silver Plate Replay: Eastern Eliminates South China; Liu Zhuhan of Eastern Deserves Primary Credit; South China's Weak Defense Leads to Two Goals Lost Due to Carelessness

(Our Report) Eastern Athletic Club's football players have shown remarkable progress recently, leading to their victory over South China in the league the previous week. Yesterday, in the special silver plate replay against South China, they once again achieved a major victory and secured a spot in the semi-finals.

Yesterday's major victory for Eastern can be primarily attributed to Liu Xianhan. During the first ten minutes of the first half, South China's offensive was extremely strong. Chen Dehui, Yang Shuiyi, Qu Shi'e, and others had multiple opportunities to make brilliant shots that seemed certain to break through the goal. At that time, Xianhan alone was able to turn the tide amidst the overwhelming attacks, successfully preventing any goals from being scored. This allowed the entire team to seize a counter-attack opportunity, leading to Hou Chengtuo's successful strike. Therefore, Xianhan's contribution was greater than anyone else's.

During the first half, South China generally had more momentum, but they were thwarted by Xianhan's defense, leaving them sighing in vain before the goal. If they had managed to score first during their intense offensive, it would have boosted their morale significantly and potentially prevented the first two careless losses. However, the outcome of the game is sometimes beyond human control, and the changes in war are infinite and unpredictable.

In Eastern's performance, Xianhan and Chengtuo stood out, but the rest of the team also performed their duties well. Their ability to withstand the initial dangers in the defense was particularly commendable. Although their first two goals can be attributed to chance, the team's unified spirit was unmatched by South China. Their ultimate victory was not without reason.

As for South China's defeat, the blame lies in their weak defense. Lin Depu's injured appearance affected his performance, while You Huaxing kicked and passed blindly, failing to stop Chengtuo's progress. Therefore, the only reliable defender was Xie Jinhong, who barely met expectations. Consequently, they lost control in both offense and defense and were unable to withstand the pressure. Eastern was thus able to take advantage of the opportunities and launch attacks.

Liu Mao and Liu Weipei offered nothing commendable and repeatedly made mistakes. The loss of the first two goals was due to their carelessness. However, Tan Jun'gan, who missed the catch on the second goal, cannot escape blame either.

Someone said to the reporter that although South China's defeat was due to the defenders' mistakes, the biggest reason was the error in team formation. It was already a mistake to abandon Liang Bowei in the right-back position and use Bi Xing, who had courage but lacked strategy. Secondly, Depu's foot injury had not yet healed, so he should not have been sent to play in this crucial match. Therefore, their defeat was due to the mistakes of those responsible for the lineup and should not be entirely blamed on the players.

The referee blew the whistle to start the game. South China launched a fierce attack first. After four minutes, Shi'e crossed from the baseline, and Dehui shot, but it went high above the goal, missing a great opportunity. After nine minutes, Dehui swept the ball towards the corner of the goal, but Xianhan managed to save it in time. After ten minutes, Eastern launched a counter-attack. Jingcheng and Ling collaborated to advance, then Qi and Liu Mao kicked the ball simultaneously. The ball bounced off Deqi and he passed it to Chengtuo, who ran quickly and kicked it into the net, giving Eastern a 1-0 lead. After twelve minutes, South China launched an attack. Huaguo jumped high to head the ball, avoiding South China's rush and conceding a corner kick. Songsheng took the kick, and Dehui headed the ball towards the goal, but Xianhan managed to push it out. When Shuiyi took the third corner kick, Songsheng fouled, and the defense was relieved. After fifteen minutes, Shuiyi took a long shot while running, and Xianhan jumped to catch it, conceding another corner kick. South China was able to benefit from this. In an instant, Shi'e, seeing an opportunity, launched an attack, but Xianhan fell to the ground and pushed it out of bounds. Although South China got a corner kick, Eastern's defense worked together to save the ball. After surviving the crisis, Eastern's good fortune arrived. Ling quickly passed to Chengtuo, who used his old trick, running around and attacking the goal. Jun'gan fell to the ground to catch the ball, but the ball was too strong and slipped out of his hands. Bingtu rushed forward and pushed it in, scoring another goal. After twenty-nine minutes, Lingsheng passed the ball to Bingtu. Bingtu, being in defense, passed it to Deqi. Deqi dribbled past Weipei and passed it to Chengtuo. Chengtuo then swept the ball into the net, making it 3-0, ending the first half. Switching sides to start the second half, Eastern continued to work hard. After six minutes, Deqi received Chengtuo's pass, turned around, and shot the ball into the net, scoring the fourth goal and securing the victory. After ten minutes, Huaguo tripped Dehui in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Shuiyi took the kick and scored, breaking the shutout. After thirty-two minutes, Eastern became slightly lax as the end of the game approached and was attacked fiercely by South China. Songsheng took the opportunity to score a goal. The game ended soon after, with Eastern eliminating South China by a score of 4-2.

### Shanghai Student Tennis Team Loses to South China 2-3; Tang Baojia Shows Promise

[Our Report] The Shanghai student tennis team competed against the Hong Kong University team the day before, demonstrating their strength and achieving a great victory. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, they competed against the South China Athletic Association team at the Hong Kong Cricket Club, and South China won 3-2.

After the Shanghai University tennis team arrived in Hong Kong, they were busy and I had not seen them practice. The day before, I was unable to watch the South China-South China special silver plate match and could not spare the time to go to Pok Fu Lam to watch them play. I was very eager to see them play. Yesterday, I learned that they would be playing against members of the South China Athletic Association at the King's Park South China Athletic Association tennis court at 2:30 PM, so I went to watch them first before heading over to watch the Guanghua-Foreigner football match. Fortunately, they played their best two singles matches first, allowing me to catch a glimpse of Tang Baojia and Li Guofan's performances.

At that time, Tang and Li were playing Chen Zhiqiang and Huang Funan simultaneously on two courts. I was also invited by Mr. Chen Guangyao to be the baseline judge for Tang and Chen's match, so I can only talk about Tang's skills. Tang and Chen's match finished first. Although I briefly watched Li and Huang's match, I only saw the last two games, so I dare not comment on Li's skills. I can only say that he is small and agile, and can be described as steady. As for how good his ball skills are, I will have to wait until I see him again before I can offer my opinion. Yesterday, I was distracted by the football match and left before 4 PM, so I did not get to enjoy the third singles match or the two doubles matches.

In the match between Tang and Chen Zhiqiang, both players had large and sturdy builds, and both had powerful strokes. It can be said that they were evenly matched in terms of strength. However, Tang is young and lacks experience. He was also unfamiliar with the court, and Chen performed exceptionally well, so in comparison, Tang seemed to lack in many aspects. He lost both sets by a score of 6-3, 6-3, which seemed to represent the difference in their skills yesterday.

Tang is a promising talent and may improve significantly in the future. However, his ability to predict incoming balls seems too quick, and his footwork is often chaotic. I did not see any particularly impressive shots or high shots, and he did not show much skill at the net. Yesterday, Chen Zhiqiang dominated him at the net and never gave him a chance to get there. His first serve was decent, but his second serve was weak. However, he sometimes managed to sweep the ball near the line and was good at seizing opportunities for quick attacks and passing balls. His long shots from the baseline were too high and not good enough. If he does not improve his footwork, it will be difficult for him to make significant progress. His speed and stamina in saving balls are his strengths. However, in Hong Kong today, he is only a top ten player.

In yesterday's match, Chen Zhiqiang lost the first two games, then came back to tie it 2-2, then lost two more games, before coming back to 3-4. He then lost three more consecutive games to lose the first set 3-6. In the second set, he won the first game, then the score became 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-2, and then he lost four consecutive games to lose 3-6. Li Guofan defeated Shang Funan by a score of 6-1, 6-4.

### 25-Mile Cycling Race Results Not Good

The Hong Kong Cycling Association's public 25-mile cycling race was held at 10:30 AM yesterday, at the halfway point between the nine and ten-mile marks in Tsuen Wan North. Except for Cai Huilin and Chen Guanlin, members of the association who were absent, a total of 24 people participated. The results of the race are as follows: First place: HAG Jie Shi (Hong Kong Cycling Association) with a time of 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 23 seconds. Second place: G Ge Talu (Hong Kong Cycling Association) with a time of 1 hour, 24 minutes, and 10 seconds. Third place: Zhou Qiguang (Individual) with a time of 1 hour, 29 minutes, and 10 seconds. Fourth place: Wu Song (Individual) with a time of 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds. Fifth place: Liang Ruiguang (Youth Cycling Team) with a time of 1 hour, 31 minutes, and 5 seconds. The results of this race were not good and failed to break the previous record of 1 hour and 6 minutes. It is said that the association will hold a 50-mile race in March.

### The Soldiers Give Their All; Guanghua Defeats St. Joseph's Again; Dagaoshannu and Biludo Have No Place to Show Their Skills; Guoqi and Rongsheng Display Their Skills

[Our Report] Guanghua and St. Joseph's met again at the Kowloon Club at 4:15 PM yesterday. This was a first division football league match. In the first match, Guanghua defeated St. Joseph's 3-1. Yesterday, when they met again, St. Joseph's was determined to avenge their defeat and deployed a full squad. The famous player Dagaoshannu was assigned to the front line, and Biludo was assigned to the center back position. Therefore, in terms of strength, St. Joseph's seemed to have the upper hand. However, after a fierce battle, Guanghua won again with a score of 2-1, a truly outstanding performance.

In this match, St. Joseph's offensive line was very active and constantly besieged Guanghua's goal, making it impenetrable. Biludo's performance as a center back was also excellent. However, the internal defense was not strong enough to stop Guanghua's attacks. This was the reason for their defeat. On Guanghua's side, Li Guo, Hou Rongsheng, Zhuo Shijin, and Zou Wenzhi all made excellent contributions, which laid the foundation for their victory. Zhong Huilin's movements were rather slow and sluggish. Fortunately, Guoqi and Rongsheng defended effectively, turning danger into safety. The three midfielders also worked hard, but their skills were insufficient to contain the opponent's front line. The five forwards were all lively and worked well together, which allowed them to secure the final victory in this fierce battle.

At the start of the game, both teams displayed their skills. Guanghua's players launched two attacks on the opponent's goal, but were blocked and forced to retreat. St. Joseph's immediately launched a counter-attack. Rong Niu used his great strength to repel the attacking players. After a while, Guanghua's forwards became active again. Chi Fen dribbled the ball forward and reached the opponent's territory. Sima Fashi committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Shi Jin took the kick and scored, giving St. Joseph's a one-goal lead. The St. Joseph's players then launched an all-out counter-attack, with even the two internal defenders crossing the center line to assist. After five minutes of intense fighting, Guanghua was in constant danger. Fortunately, the entire team gave their all and managed to temporarily hold their ground. Shi Jin then broke through and attacked along the side, making two beautiful crosses. On the latter occasion, it was a sure chance to score, but Chi Fen failed to rush forward in time, missing the opportunity.

After a while, Biludo sent a pass forward. Dagaoshannu intercepted the ball and shot at the goal. Guoqi fell to the ground and blocked it, but Huilin kicked the ball weakly. Aruo Wushi happened to be in front of the goal and took the opportunity to shoot it into the net, tying the score. At this point, the situation became very tense, and there were many exciting moments. Soon after, Rongsheng saved the ball and Jingcong received it and attacked. After reaching a suitable position, he crossed the ball. Wenzhi rushed forward to meet it and kicked the ball into the net. Maguishi missed the save, and Guanghua took the lead again with a score of 2-1. After that, Guanghua was besieged again. Li Anna and Dagaoshanu shot at the goal one after another, with shots raining down. Fortunately, Guoqi was a skilled goalkeeper and managed to defuse the danger one by one. Soon after, the first half ended. After the break, the battle resumed. At this time, the St. Joseph's players had high morale and were very active. Guanghua's capital was constantly under attack. Dagaoshannu had many opportunities to shoot at the goal, keeping Guoqi busy. Fortunately, all the soldiers fought bravely and managed to escape the danger. Then, Guanghua's two wings launched a counter-attack, but the opponent's defense was very strong and they were quickly repelled. However, St. Joseph's had the upper hand at this time, but they had bad luck and were unable to recover their lost ground. In the last five minutes, St. Joseph's launched a more intense counter-attack, but time ran out, and the battle ended. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Guanghua Association)

Li Guoqi

Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng

Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui

Huang Jingcong, Zou Wenzhi, Zhuo Shijin, Qian Chifen, Liang Bingjin

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment! The Secret of a Rich Girl

There Goes My Heart

This is an American-style comedy. The story and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and victorious techniques have created many fresh jokes for the audience in this film. The plot's crazy and humorous elements are also very attractive.

The film depicts the story of a rich girl who is inexperienced and craves freedom running away from home, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.

Frederic March and Virginia Bruce are not very good protagonists and did not achieve much in the film. They performed averagely. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful and gave a very outstanding performance. She is a lovely clown. Nancy Carroll plays a vain and jealous shop assistant. This is her second performance since returning to the screen, and the result is not bad.

Showing at the Queen's...

Peace... Sixty Glorious Years of the British Royal Family

Sixty Glorious Years

This film also depicts the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her sixty years in power. In order to pursue truth and authenticity, it was specially produced by the British Royal Company, but it is somewhat of a promotional film for the history of the British Queen.

Because the material is particularly rich and the material is precious, it cannot be omitted or deleted. Under these circumstances, it is not easy for the director to please the audience and handle it properly. This film suffers from this problem. The whole play, except for the first half, which depicts the Queen's life after marriage, is slightly vivid and lively. In the second half, it can only introduce historical fragments as a matter of power. One cannot blame the director's limited skills.

There are several very excellent scenes in the film, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the British Royal Army's impact, the Queen's Jubilee celebration, and the visit to her old maids of honor. They are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there is not much change from the previous "The Story of Queen Victoria." Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, gave an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Walbrook, who plays Prince Albert, is also very excellent.

Eastern... That Certain Age

That Certain Age

This film depicts a precocious girl who falls in love with a reporter who is twice her age. He initially does not know this. After realizing this, he tries his best to dissuade her, but to no avail. In the end, another woman resolves the situation.

Undoubtedly, Deanna Durbin is even more beautiful in this film. Not only is her performance delicate and lively, but she has also made significant progress. The male lead, Melvyn Douglas, is very qualified, just like Marjorie Rambeau in "The Primrose Path." Jackie Cooper still reveals his innocent acting skills.

The four new songs inside are also quite moving.

Tai Wah... Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

This is Laurel and Hardy's penultimate film. The story is about two cheese sellers (Laurel and Hardy). Once, they went to Switzerland to do business, and the two foolish guys made a lot of jokes. Some places are indeed lacking, but that is precisely because it is a comedy.

There are also two European singers participating in the performance, especially the woman's singing is very good. The two treasures perform the same as before.

New World... Modern Woman Seeking Husband

Cantonese Silent Film

This is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking Husband." The plot tells the story of a millionaire who is unusually stingy. He not only refuses to contribute to any public welfare undertakings but also wants to take advantage of others. At this time, various sectors have launched a campaign to raise funds to establish a Chinese industrial factory and want to ask him for help. However, as a result, he not only does not take out a penny but also stole some pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised the "Modern Woman Seeking Husband" plan to trick him and then use female charms to seduce him.

The main characters are stage stars, Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanzhen, which is also the producer's business sense.

The director's techniques are still quite good.

Central... Black Clothes Team

Cantonese Film

This film depicts two disparate classes in society: on the one hand, the hard-working women of the masses, and on the other hand, some leisurely class playboys. However, the director's description of each plot is too focused on achieving the goal of "sensuality" and ignores the expression of reality. At the same time, for the sake of "sensuality," the film is filled with low-level, vulgar, flirtatious, and chaotic elements.

The plot depicts a weak woman whose husband went abroad to earn a living. Her family was not well-off, forcing her to work as a maid and endure all kinds of bullying and oppression. When her husband returned home with honor, all kinds of misunderstandings arose.

Half of the film is loose, and most of it is performed in the form of opera, in an attempt to cover up the emptiness of the content. The director's techniques are also not refined enough. However, the actress Huang Manli's excellent performance in this film cannot be buried and is worth praising.

### Navy Easily Defeats Soviet Army

(Our Report) The Navy and the Scottish Regiment drew 2-2 in the first week, with no clear winner. Yesterday, they met again, and the Navy crushed the Soviet Army 6-0. The Soviet team's defeat was expected, as they had lost several good players to returning to their home country. The team's foundation was unstable. When they met this maritime bully yesterday, the difference in strength was already apparent. Their main player, Bo Yudu, was also absent, weakening their defense. As soon as the game started, the situation became one-sided. The Navy's victory was due to their solid defense. Newley played again, preventing Hodges' threat. The offense and defense were consistent, and the coordination was flawless. Armstrong showed an amazing performance, dribbling, passing, and shooting with ease. He deserves the most credit. The rest of the team also performed well.

In the Division B match, the Engineers defeated the Police 6-1. As the Division A match began, the Navy lost its position and attacked Red Sun. McVittie guided from the middle, dribbling a few steps and then crossing the ball. Armstrong moved forward to meet it and shot with great speed, hoping to succeed at the first attempt. However, Cutler managed to return in time and saved the goal, kicking the ball out of bounds. The Scottish Regiment took the opportunity to launch a major attack, but the two wings failed to coordinate, missing several opportunities. Hodges rarely received support, and his heroism had no place to show. He could only sigh in vain. The maritime bully then launched a comeback, dividing its forces into five groups and penetrating into the opponent's territory. The Scottish Regiment's defense was in frequent danger, and everyone was on edge. Deng Qin, seeing the dangerous situation, bravely left his goal to attack. However, Adamson misunderstood and kicked the ball back to his own territory. Deng Qin was unable to save it, allowing McVittie to take advantage and open the scoring.

The game resumed in the center circle, and the Navy's momentum was strong. The forwards moved all over the field, wreaking havoc in the Scottish Regiment's territory. Deng Qin saved three dangerous shots in a row, but the crisis could not be averted. After a long struggle, ten minutes before the end of the first half, Turban and Armstrong used their heads to score two goals in a row, ending the first half with a score of 3-0. After the break, the game resumed. The Scottish Regiment's forward line showed its weaknesses. Armstrong entered the opponent's territory as if it were no man's land. Fraser was unable to stop his attacks. At this point, the situation became one-sided. McVittie took advantage of a cross and scored the fourth goal. Turban then met a pass in front of the goal and scored again, making it 5-0. McVeigh also showed his strength, breaking through the defense alone. Deng Qin was unable to stop him, and he scored another goal, making it 6-0. The Soviet Scottish Regiment suffered a crushing defeat, losing 6-0. The lineups are as follows:

(Scottish Regiment)

Fraser, Adamson

Cutler, Marshall, Fleming

### Beware of "National Pickpockets"

— Tie Guang

After the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee concluded, people's trust in the national policy of resistance against Japan and domestic unity has obviously become more firm and solid. People see that the Kuomintang has clearer guidance in military, political, cultural, economic, party affairs, and civil movements. In particular, the establishment and appropriate staffing of the Supreme National Defense Council has fully strengthened people's belief that resistance against Japan will surely succeed and nation-building will surely be accomplished. We have the right to say that the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most dynamic and only leading institution for winning the final victory. We have more reason to say that the existence of the Supreme National Defense Council will, along with the persistence of resistance against Japan, promote the glorious achievements of the national liberation movement. Therefore, from now on, we should execute the various instructions of the Supreme National Defense Council. This is the most correct practice for promoting resistance against Japan and ensuring its victory. We do not need to worry; we only need to enthusiastically believe and manifest it in our actions.

However, we should sternly point out certain spies. For them, the most important and most suspicious matter of the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session is the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council. Their suspicion is actually the suspicion of the "X" people.

In the eyes of the spies, the Supreme National Defense Council is deliberately distorting vision and obliterating the true facts. They stubbornly insist that the Supreme National Defense Council is the establishment of a joint committee between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They deny the important factor of the coexistence and cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties. This is a slander against various anti-Japanese parties, a most insidious trick of instigation. We should clearly see their true colors.

The spies have always fabricated rumors that the Communist Party is robbing the government. They are indeed quite capable of spreading rumors, but the people and the astute anti-Japanese soldiers have used facts to shatter the tongues of these slaves. Therefore, from the clear meeting of the Fifth Plenary Session to the current establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, although the slaves are still fabricating rumors that the Communist Party is seizing the National Defense Council and resolutely oppose this supreme power organ that accommodates various anti-Japanese parties, people have deeply understood that this is just the mad barking of slaves who are racking their brains. No one listens to them, and no one believes them. Those who believe them are probably only a few ethnic minorities and those literary men who put on the airs of slave overseers.

Finally, we must solemnly say that the Supreme National Defense Council is the true cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties, the supreme entity for the true establishment of the national united front. This is of course invisible to the spies, because the spies are suffering from blinding eye disease. Our current task is to puncture the malicious rumors of these national pickpockets and expose their crimes nakedly in front of the people.

### Eunuch

— Mr. Xiaoyu

I used to raise a cat. Following the suggestion of the old nanny, I neutered it. Sure enough, the animal grew up strong and extraordinary, but there was one shortcoming: after being neutered, it became listless, only knowing how to eat, no longer catching mice at night, and no longer looking for a lover in the spring.

Opening the Shen Bao of January 25th, who knew that the headline that caught my eye on the first page was a Japanese councilor suggesting cutting off bovine glands. It is said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not dare to act rashly because the common people opposed this "virtuous" policy, thus arousing severe criticism from two councilors of the Minsei Party, who said they were useless. This eunuch policy is listed on the agenda of the sacred parliament of the Holy East Asian League's Anti-Communist Axis New Order Inventor Count, truly is the pinnacle of civilization today.

I don't know if the two councilor masters are representatives of the common people? Are they turning a blind eye to the "Old Chiefs'" (soldiers too) warmongering, acting against the tide, and constantly using big hats like "Yamato Spirit" and loyalty to the emperor and love for the country to force the common people to prostrate themselves and obediently provide them as cannon fodder to fight Chinese people of the same culture, and still feel that the sacrifice is not thorough enough, wanting to turn the people into a uniform mass of dull-headed eunuch cats.

I thought of a business for the Japanese people, which is to repay them in their own coin. For now, it's better for everyone to rise up and neuter these warlords and politicians who breathe through the same nostrils as the warlords first. Let's see if they will be so ferocious after becoming eunuch cats and eunuchs. Furthermore, it is better to give birth to fewer little demon kings who stir up trouble, boil beans to burn stalks, and half-baked people who act as accomplices for tigers and oppress compatriots.

### The Process of Bringing Shaw's Play to the Screen

— Zhang Jiafeng

George Bernard Shaw is one of the world's most opposed to having his works made into films. Over the years, international film companies from England, America, France, and Germany have tried every means to purchase the film rights to his novels or plays. Every time filmmakers went to ask him, he would cleverly reply: "The film rights to each play sell for one million pounds. Only if you shoot a silent film for the deaf to see will my play be given to you." Or he would say: "The protagonist in my film must be played by Lloyd George (Translator's Note: a contemporary British statesman)."

Every time filmmakers requested permission to film his works, Shaw would always sneer and say: "I am famous enough and do not need any films to increase my glory. I am rich enough and do not need their money. So why should I sell my works to filmmakers? They might ruin them and give me unnecessary trouble!"

One filmmaker after another ran into a wall like this and didn't want to pursue the matter with him anymore. This privilege was later obtained by a relatively unknown filmmaker, while all the famous companies failed. Gabriel Pascal, although a French name, was born in Hungary. He was a news recorder, specification writer, novelist, and filmmaker. He worked in many film companies in Hollywood, London, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Budapest for a long time.

Recently, in Paris, without a penny to his name, he suddenly had an idea and wrote a letter to Shaw, whom he had met on the Adriatic Sea two or three years ago, seeking help. The gist of his letter was:

"Sir, perhaps you still remember me, we had a conversation in Italy" twice "actually talked for fifteen minutes," perhaps you also remember, I am now a filmmaker, I have always been interested in your works, I really hope to make one of your plays, especially 'Pygmalion,' into a film, under what conditions would you grant me this privilege? At least, give me one casually."

Strangely, Shaw actually remembered this Hungarian and, contrary to his usual habits, even gave him a reply. This time, he didn't say the same disappointing things as before. He instructed him (Pascal) to find his accountant, "This is a very reasonable person, he is currently traveling in Holland," he told him (the accountant) the mailing address in Rotterdam.

"My only opportunity is to go to Rotterdam myself!" Pascal said to his only friend in Paris, and showed him Shaw's reply. "If you can lend me a thousand francs, I can obtain the film rights to 'Pygmalion' within a week."

That friend lent him a thousand francs, and Pascal ran to Rotterdam to meet the accountant (he was a lawyer from London). After ten negotiations, they still hadn't agreed. What could Pascal do? The lawyer was asking for a high price, requiring payment in installments and demanding all kinds of guarantees, while the money in Pascal's pocket was dwindling day by day. Finally, all his money was used up. Walking along the Rotterdam docks, he inadvertently saw a British cargo ship leaving for London within an hour.

"Where is the captain?" Pascal asked with a spark of inspiration.

"What are you asking for?" A sailor in front of him replied. "He's probably in the pub across the road?"

"Captain," the Hungarian pleaded with the tall, generous man, "Only you can save my life. I will always be grateful to you."

Pascal simply told him his current situation, that he had received Shaw's reply and was unable to reach an agreement with Shaw's accountant.

"If you can get me to London, I will definitely be able to meet Shaw. As long as I see him, all problems can be solved within half an hour."

Thirty hours later, Pascal arrived in London and went to Shaw's house.

"I am Gabriel Pascal," he said. "I have come all the way to ask you to sign this contract yourself, because your accountant, although very good at business, is not on the same wavelength as me. Just think, he dragged out our negotiations for more than ten days, to the point where I couldn't even take out a penny from my pocket. In fact, now I am asking the captain of a cargo ship to bring me to London to see you."

Shaw couldn't help but laugh loudly when he heard these words. The two continued to talk for a while and drank a glass or two of whiskey. Shaw signed "Pygmanon" on the back of Habascal's letter, giving him the film rights.

This film is being shot in London, and a new filmmaker is moving forward on the road to success. 'Translated from MagazineDigest'

### Winter Jasmine

— Yuan Bu Pai

It's that season,

The four-petaled winter jasmine,

Yellow and bright, blooming on the fence.

The north wind sends the bare-chested boats,

Carrying farmers and their families from the countryside,

They smile, wrinkles appearing at the corners of their eyes.

Buying cloth to make new clothes,

Exchanging rice for pork,

And New Year incense for the gods.

But this story is too old,

Today they are captured by "X" troops,

Driven to the front line to supplement the Imperial Army's shortage.

Disobedience is "Communist,"

Machine guns are mounted on their backs,

"Civilization" is interpreted as "arbitrary killing."

It's that season,

But the four-petaled winter jasmine

No longer blooms on the fence.

### Eastern River Frontline

Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard

(1) Embarking on a Two Thousand Eight Hundred Li Journey

It was the season of late autumn, with the autumn wind blowing and the leaves of the Chinese tallow trees falling to the ground. In the large square of Pui Ying Middle School in Fangcun, Guangzhou, hundreds of youths with boiling blood were gathered, and a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere filled the originally desolate square. This was a general meeting where all comrades resisting Japan were gathered, discussing the departure marching route and formation.

On the evil evening of October, more than seventy warriors in different clothes, carrying bundles on their backs, calmly and quickly passed through the streets of Guangzhou like snakes and crossed the river. Arriving at the Shiwetang military station, we began our one thousand eight hundred li journey.

It was midnight, the sky as black as ink, with only a few sparse stars twinkling. Shiwetang Station was crowded with countless refugees. Suddenly, the wailing air raid siren sounded, the lights went out, and all activity ceased. We had to scatter around the station. Only when dawn was about to break did the alarm end. The main force groped forward along the railway. After dawn, the sound of exploding bombs followed behind us. Looking back, under the distant Baiyun Mountain, white smoke was constantly rising. Destruction, Guangzhou was destroyed. A heavy, almost unbearable weight pressed on our hearts. Everyone continued to move forward with grief and indignation.

Foshan was the same, tense and chaotic, with the people busy evacuating. After a day and night of walking, fatigue invaded every comrade's body, and everyone fell asleep. In the middle of the night, just as people were sleeping soundly, the assembly whistle rang. With sleepy and blurry postures, we returned to the team. The captain said in a hoarse voice: "Comrades - everyone is tired, but this little bit of hardship is nothing to the Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, we should endure all hardships. The Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades are not afraid of hardship. Everyone, bring out the vanguard spirit!" These words struck the comrades' ears like a shot of morphine. At the same time, the captain announced that we were on a forced march and should especially strengthen vigilance at night.

From the southwest to the Pearl River Estuary, we traveled by water. After much negotiation, we found a sailboat that crammed in more than seventy people, plus the original passengers. Therefore, every corner of the boat, the sides, the top, was crowded with people. The boat was too full and moved as sluggishly as a camel. In order to advance quickly and reduce the hardship of the boatmen, we launched a cable-pulling team. Undoubtedly, every comrade fully demonstrated the vanguard spirit. Those who volunteered were eager to be first. So we divided into groups and took turns helping the boatmen pull the cable. Singing boatmen's songs, but with lively postures, we quickly dragged the boat forward. Therefore, we were able to quickly slip past Southwest, Sanshui, Lanbao, Qingyuan, and to the Pearl River Estuary.

At the Pearl River Estuary, only a few railway ties remained, twisted and powerless, supporting it. Under the bridge, charred pieces of wood flowed continuously. In order to stop the enemy's advance, our side did not hesitate to sacrifice many great people's buildings. According to intelligence, the "X" people were only seventy or eighty li away from here. We estimated the "X" people's line of attack and decided to pass this danger line and take the road north.

Learning, learning, and learning again, this was the central slogan of self-education in the team. On the water, there was no work to do, so time was spent on theoretical learning, seizing time to read necessary books, and enthusiastically discussing various issues related to the resistance against Japan.

From the Pearl River Estuary, the main force advanced along the Guangdong-Han Railway. The stations along the way were burned down, and piles of railway sleepers were stacked next to the stations, burning fiercely. This was our expression of unwillingness to supply the enemy. Everything was burned down for the "X" people. When will we be able to rebuild this broken country? This only requires us to work hard!

Although it was a forced march, we never neglected our work for a moment. At a small hill in Dakengkou, the forest was so dense that it covered the place like a curtain. We were stationed here and encountered a team of new recruits from the 29th Army. This team of new recruits, who were originally demoralized and filled with homesickness, was driven away by the speeches and singing at our farewell rally, which dispelled their fatigue and reorganized their homesickness. In particular, the little ghosts in the team made them feel that going to the front line and fighting the "X" people was a glorious duty and a sacred right!

Little Ghost Shi was a female comrade who was only thirteen years old. She followed her brother to participate in the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, carrying a burden on her back; she blended into the main force and followed the main force with big steps. When we couldn't find a house on the mountain road and couldn't get a decent meal for sixty or seventy li, she couldn't reduce her excitement. Not only did she not need the busywork of the big ghosts, but she also often aroused the motivation of the big ghosts.

(2) Hitting the "X" People's Rear

The main force arrived in Wengyuan. The people's spirit here was particularly closed and dull. The people simply did not know what resistance against Japan meant. Most pitifully, some picked up leaflets dropped by the "X" people from airplanes and even took them home to frame them on the wall as decorations.
