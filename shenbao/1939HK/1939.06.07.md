### On the Current War Situation, Strategy, and Tactics: "Seek Small Victories with Full Strength, Fight Small Battles with Great Force"

(Special Correspondent Minzhi, Guilin Air Mail, May 31st) A certain military expert recently gave a speech in Guilin on the current situation of the war of resistance, strategy, and tactics, which has been highly valued by all parties. We hereby record the full text as follows: (Editor's note: Some Hong Kong newspapers have published a part of it. To facilitate readers to see the whole picture, we specially publish the full text.)

Since the war of resistance entered its second phase, the × [Japanese] have changed their offensive strategy. Although our strategic approach is still to deal with them with persistence, the method of war guidance is also different from the first phase.

The first question we should discuss today is how to achieve the goal of a protracted war, which at present is how to exhaust the strength of the × [Japanese] and increase our own strength.

To Win by Delay or to Win by Fighting!

On this issue, some people share the belief that a protracted war will lead to victory, but they see persistence as delay, believing that as long as the delay is long enough, the × [Japanese] will inevitably collapse on their own. Therefore, decisive battles with the main force need to be avoided. In order to delay, they still adopt the past method of exchanging space for time, that is, continuous retreat. It doesn't matter if we retreat to a more remote border. Once the × [Japanese] collapse, we can return to Nanjing with our entire army. In fact, if we build our strategy on this method of delay, it is very dangerous.

Because the × [Japanese] are currently taking advantage of this psychology, attacking this weakness: Since Wang Jingwei defected, the × [Japanese] offensive has become more subtle, also because Wang Jingwei understands China's internal affairs more clearly than the × [Japanese], so it is said that the current × [Japanese] offensive is to expand into our weak points, taking advantage of the gaps. He takes the divisions between the central government and local authorities, between local authorities, between armies, and between parties as his targets of attack. Therefore, if we still advocate winning by delay, the result will inevitably be our passive preparation in the rear, passive ambushes in the front to annihilate the × [Japanese], and passive efforts to fight the × [Japanese] in the rear. In short, all preparations will be passive, so a strategic counter-offensive in the future will not be possible.

Therefore, our second phase of operations against the × [Japanese] must be to win by fighting, not to win by delay, but to actively gain victories in battle. Because to win by fighting, we must make the strength of the whole country move towards a difficult future, so as not to be undermined by this passivity, so that the × [Japanese] have the possibility to use their strength and use their claws to destroy us.

Therefore, we must use attrition warfare to strive for victory as much as possible. Only by actively seeking victory can we avoid being passive about the future of the war of resistance, have confidence in the design of our work, and become more active.

Comprehensive Leaping Warfare

If we affirm that we will fight and win against the × [Japanese], then we can examine the historical facts of the war of resistance over the past twenty-three months.

The method of warfare the × [Japanese] use against us is generally believed by researchers to have been one of failing to win in battle at the beginning, followed by a quick fight to a quick resolution, and finally a quick peace to a quick resolution. Historical facts have proven that these methods have failed.

So, what is the form of the × [Japanese]'s second phase of operations? We can examine what are the characteristics of their offensive. In this period of the × [Japanese] offensive against us, they have felt many difficulties. First of all, the battle line from the northwest to the southwest is extremely wide. Since the × [Japanese] invaded Pinghan and Yueao, the battle line has been extended, and many gaps have appeared between the occupied points and lines. Due to the activity of our guerrillas, the × [Japanese] have been forced to pay attention to defense, so their troop strength is very insufficient. Therefore, the × [Japanese]'s offensive in the future will be different from the first phase. For example, if he wants to put his military focus in South China, then it will be difficult for him to have any activities in North China, let alone any auxiliary attacks. He can only organize a striking force to seek a strategic victory; at the same time, the main attack direction is only in one direction within a certain period of time. When he attacked Nanchang, other aspects did not have effective coordination. In short, this kind of action can only be said that he cannot make strategic deployments from the perspective of the war situation, and can only have a strategic action. He is replacing strategic actions with strategic actions. This is the first feature.

Furthermore, when the × [Japanese] attacked us in the past, whether it was attacking Shanghai or Nanjing, they regarded the city as the target of the battle. The reason was that by taking the city, he could propagandize to the international community and at home, boost morale, and also give us a blow. But today there is no such situation. Secondly, perhaps he takes our main force as the target, seeking a decisive battle to annihilate our main force, but we are conducting a protracted war. Before the timing of the decisive battle with the main force has arrived, we disperse our forces to avoid combat. Therefore, it has become very difficult for the × [Japanese] to find a target to conduct a decisive battle.

If the × [Japanese] cannot find a decisive target, will they not continue to attack? He will continue to attack, but where will he attack? This produces the second characteristic, he can only attack along a certain line of communication, reduce our territory, and control longer lines of communication, forcing our main force to be blockaded in the mountains on the border with less international significance, and on the one hand, he will also achieve his goal of sweeping the rear and establishing a puppet government to create a second Manchuria.

Some people want to ask, since the × [Japanese] have consistently attacked along the lines of communication, why can today's attack along the key points be regarded as a characteristic? This is because at present, the × [Japanese] can only form one force, without a coordinating force, and in fact, the × [Japanese] have already controlled the main lines of communication, such as Longhai, Tongpu, Pingsui, the Yangtze River, and some highway lines, while our lines of communication have not yet been established and cannot be easily mobilized. Therefore, although the × [Japanese] only have one striking force, they can still find our weaknesses everywhere and win small victories with small forces. The × [Japanese] can use the lines of communication to attack in all directions. This kind of leaping long-distance mobile offensive can be called a comprehensive leaping warfare.

The application of this offensive method is obviously beneficial to the × [Japanese]. First, he can attack our weakly defended areas and gain cheap victories. Although this victory does not give us a serious blow, he can widely publicize it to the international community and at home. Second, the × [Japanese] can use mechanized transportation to quickly transport troops, while we are at a disadvantage. Therefore, this comprehensive leaping offensive can make us exhausted and unable to fight.

Preserving Space, Seizing Space

If the × [Japanese] adopt this method of warfare, then what should we do? This is a question that must be studied.

In the past, we adopted "exchanging space for time" to deal with the × [Japanese]'s active offensive, which did play a great role, because we have seen that to truly defeat the × [Japanese], it must be built on a long-term war of resistance. First, to transfer our material base from the southeast to the southwest, and to cover this proper transfer, in order to lay the foundation for our material base. Second, to use the stimulation and promotion of war to strengthen our domestic unity and supplement our past shortcomings in preparation. Third, to deal with the strong × [Japanese], we must improve our combat effectiveness. In order to enhance combat technology, we can only learn from the battlefield in the process of war, see how the × [Japanese] fight, and see if what we have learned in the past can defeat the × [Japanese]?

Therefore, in the early stages of the war, we had to "exchange space for time," partly because the × [Japanese]'s firepower was stronger than ours, and their tactics were better than ours. On the plains, the firepower was very strong, and it was not easy for us to win. But if he seized this opportunity during his march or movement to strike a blow, it would be easy to achieve victory. Initially, we planned to lure the × [Japanese] deep into our territory, extending his lines of communication, so that we would have more opportunities to strike the × [Japanese] and achieve the goal of attrition. Therefore, exchanging space for time and luring the × [Japanese] deep into our territory was a policy that had to be adopted in the early stages of the war of resistance.

Is "exchanging space for time" accurate in the second phase of the war of resistance? My brother's opinion is that it should be modified. It is necessary to protect the space. The strength of the protracted war of resistance lies in the space. If there is a decisive battle, where is the strength? How to mobilize and organize the power of the masses? These are all linked to the issue of space protection. In some spaces, we must prepare our strength for a strategic counter-offensive. In other words, we must preserve as much un-occupied space as possible, but just preserving space is not enough.

Because on the one hand, the × [Japanese], under difficult conditions, express their military efforts in the form of a comprehensive leaping war, and in politics, it is "using Chinese to control Chinese." He wants to use our material resources, financial resources, and human resources in the occupied areas. Therefore, we must use all our strength to strike the × [Japanese] and strive to regain the occupied space. Now we can no longer "exchange space for time," but must not only protect the space we already have, but also strive to regain the occupied space.

A long-term war of resistance cannot imagine that when a certain period arrives, the large army will launch a counter-offensive, and after one or two decisive battles, it will immediately chase back to Shanghai and Nanjing, driving the × [Japanese] across the Yalu River. In fact, this is not in accordance with the facts. Therefore, only by desperately striving for space can we guarantee the victory of the second phase of the war and achieve the goal of preparing for a counter-offensive force.

Then, what tactical methods are there to strive for occupied space and retain un-occupied space? This has two conditions. First, we can only use joint battles to strike the × [Japanese]'s leaping offensive to prevent him from penetrating deep into our territory. Therefore, we need regular troops on the front line to strike the × [Japanese]. Second, we must also use guerrilla warfare to continuously strike the × [Japanese]'s rear communication units to contain the × [Japanese], and politically prevent the establishment of puppet regimes, and economically impose a counter-blockade on the × [Japanese], forcing the × [Japanese] to be unable to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and unable to use our manpower and resources. This strike is effective, because the × [Japanese] are severely attacked in the rear, which will inevitably increase the difficulties for the front-line combat troops relying on the rear. There were many examples of this in the past in the Shanxi campaign. Because the communication lines were cut off, the supplies to his front-line troops were cut off, and the mechanized troops could not move. To overcome this difficulty, the × [Japanese] could only turn back the front-line troops to attack the guerrillas. This is the reason why the guerrillas help the regular troops on the front line to fight. Furthermore, due to the planned attacks on the × [Japanese] on the front line, the × [Japanese] will undoubtedly not be able to advance any further, which guarantees the consolidation of the front-line positions and maintains the stalemate in this area, and the un-occupied space is therefore guaranteed. On the other hand, developing guerrilla warfare in the × [Japanese] rear and establishing bases preserves the space in the × [Japanese] rear, so that we can be sure of the growth of our strength. With space, then we have strength, so the growth of strength is partly in our own rear and partly in the × [Japanese] rear.

Because we consume the strength of the × [Japanese] in battle on the one hand, and our strength continues to increase on the other hand, this is what makes the strength of the × [Japanese] and us change, and we gain an advantage in the balance of power, so we can launch a powerful counter-offensive. This proves that preserving the un-occupied space and striving for the space in the × [Japanese] rear is correct. Now we can no longer "exchange space for time," but we must strive for time and also strive for space, so that we can complete the task of the second phase of the war of resistance.

Everything for the Sake of Offense!

Of course, all strategic plans must be completed by combat. Therefore, we cannot ignore the actual application of combat. Based on the experience of the first phase of the war of resistance, we must not ignore small victories in the second phase of the war of resistance, but strive for small victories. Therefore, there must be some changes in tactics today. Although we are on the defensive strategically, we must adopt an offensive posture tactically. The content of tactics can be said to be "everything for the sake of offense."

The × [Japanese] offensive is to attack a certain point along a certain line of communication, which we can estimate in advance. Therefore, first, tactically, we must "attack what he must come to," and strike and win when the × [Japanese] are in motion. On the other hand, make a feigned attack, seize the × [Japanese]'s weaknesses and take advantage of the opportunity to strike the × [Japanese]. It is good to have a division destroy a company. Therefore, "attacking what he must save" is also a necessary method to strive for offensive victory.

Second, defense must be defense for offense, with offense as the purpose, and defensive measures are taken. So, defense on a line is to coordinate with attacks to achieve victory.

Third, retreat is also important. A general who is good at fighting is good at attacking, but also good at retreating. The purpose of retreating is to attack. If the attack is unfavorable, then retreat and attack in other directions. This is called "transfer." Transfer is a means. To achieve the purpose of protracted attrition, we must attack and we must retreat. Attacking and retreating are all to eliminate the × [Japanese].

Fight Small Battles with Great Force

Achieving the goal of attrition is not "head-to-head," like bulls fighting each other with their horns. We do not need to adopt this kind of bull-like tactics. We must fight small battles with great force under superior conditions and strive for small victories. "Fighting small battles with great force" is using an army against a regiment, or a full division against a battalion. When deciding on the exploration, the following three points must be taken as the standard.

First, it is the method of dealing with big × [Japanese], that is, using feigned attacks, waving flags, shouting and other methods of making a false show of strength are all feigned attacks. Feigned attacks can make the × [Japanese] not know the truth and keep them on guard everywhere, thus dispersing their strength. This can contain the × [Japanese] and allow our main force to strike and win against the × [Japanese] under favorable conditions.

Second, it is the method of dealing with strong × [Japanese]. When we are facing the × [Japanese], even if it is a regiment against a regiment in terms of numbers, the × [Japanese] are still stronger than us in terms of equipment technology, etc. At that time, we will also attack, but only take advantage of the opportunity to annihilate their tails or annihilate a part of them when they are in motion.

Third, when encountering small × [Japanese], we must be determined to annihilate all of them and annihilate them without hesitation.

In short, whether it is big × [Japanese], strong × [Japanese], or small × [Japanese], we are all attacking the × [Japanese]. Only by tactically attacking the × [Japanese] can we complete the strategic goal of protracted attrition.

Destruction is More Important than Combat

The third problem is that in the past we rarely paid attention to the × [Japanese] rear. As mentioned above, the × [Japanese] mechanized troops completely rely on the rear communication lines. If the rear communication lines are destroyed, making his communication inflexible and cutting off supplies to the front, this will greatly increase the difficulties for the × [Japanese]. Therefore, we must mobilize the strength in the × [Japanese] rear, whether it is the guerrillas, the regular army, or the masses, to engage in destructive work. Thorough destruction of the × [Japanese] militarily is very important. We can put forward a slogan called "destruction is more important than combat" to force the × [Japanese] to change his equipment on a large scale, so that he has to abandon heavy artillery and tanks to adapt to the terrain, and switch to light equipment. In this way, the intensity of the firepower will be reduced, and we can be more confident of defeating the × [Japanese].

In summary, we must actively strive for victory in combat. Therefore, tactically, we must establish the idea of striving for small victories.

Seek Small Victories with Full Strength

Finally, I would like to explain the importance of striving for small victories.

In the past, our troops rarely made use of opportunities to eliminate the × [Japanese] with rapid action. This is because we do not have enough confidence in our ability to militarily overcome the × [Japanese] in combat. Some generals still lack confidence in annihilating the × [Japanese], which has led to the inertia of merely blocking the × [Japanese] and delaying time. Generals returning from the front often say, "It's very good that I held out for seven weeks," but in fact, this is far from enough. Today, we can create more glorious victories by "fighting small battles with great force." If an army or a division is fighting against a battalion or a company of the × [Japanese], it should resolutely implement annihilation warfare, and the × [Japanese] will annihilate the entire battalion and company. In order to learn the ability to annihilate the × [Japanese], the anti-Japanese troops can only conduct annihilation warfare against the × [Japanese] on the battlefield in the actual combat process. At present, we are trying to annihilate the × [Japanese] with great force. In the future, we will have more vigorous attempts. We will not fight unless we are sure of annihilating the × [Japanese]. Therefore, in the future, our goal can be raised to a greater level, annihilating a regiment of the × [Japanese]. At the same time, we can also see that an army or a division can annihilate a battalion or a company of the × [Japanese]. That is not only a physical blow to the × [Japanese], but also a great spiritual blow to him, making him grow a sense of terror from then on and dare not make cone-shaped突擊 [blunt attack]. In addition, annihilating the × [Japanese] and achieving victory can have a better impact internationally and domestically. Therefore, "seeking small victories with full strength" and "fighting small battles with great force" must be the change in the style of the entire battlefield. In the future, these principles must be applied tactically to seek victory, so that we can accumulate small victories into big victories and strive for the arrival of the final victory.

### How Young People Can Fulfill Wartime Missions (Part 1)

— Speech by Feng Wenbin, Special Air Mail from Xi'an

What do we rely on to achieve all the work we want to do?

We must rely on the power of organization.

Our organizational strength is much greater than it was at the time of our first representative congress. In the second part of the report, we pointed out this point. Our organizational work techniques have also improved a lot. We have greatly overcome closed-doorism and formalism. In the process of organizational work, we have also trained many new young cadres and young leaders. These are all guarantees that we can fulfill our missions.

However, we must not forget our shortcomings. Most of the young people, especially the working young people, are still outside the organization. Even in terms of work techniques and cadre training, our progress is far behind the needs of the objective situation. We have pointed out the reasons for these shortcomings, but in any case, our insufficient subjective efforts cannot be concealed.

Our organizational mission is naturally to realize our political mission. Our political mission today is to establish a united front of Chinese youth to carry out various tasks of resisting Japan and building the country. Therefore, our organizational mission today is to organize all young people and strive to absorb millions of unorganized young people into the organization.

Today, the focus of our work is in the vast war zones and the × [Japanese]-occupied rear. In these places, most of the cities are in the hands of the × [Japanese], and most of the places we have are rural areas. Rural work is the place where our past work foundation is the weakest. Therefore, our organizational work in the future must especially focus on the issue of shifting from the city to the countryside.

To transform our narrow organization into an organization for all young people, and to transform the work centered on the city to being centered on the countryside, we cannot rely on our subjective fantasies, but must first base it on our real strength. We must implement the transformation on the basis of our existing organization.

Secondly, we must base it on our past work experience. Our past work has not been in vain. We must humbly and objectively summarize our experiences and lessons in organizational work.

We have learned the first lesson. That is, when we start to organize young people, we must first deeply analyze the various different environments, grasp and adapt to all the characteristics of the time and place, and start with the most concrete work to establish various forms of organization. Only then will our work not run into walls.

The Youth Salvation Corps in the Fifth War Zone and the Youth Salvation Corps in Wuhan, although they have the same name and similar goals, in order to adapt to the environment, they did not merge with the × [Japanese], and are directly led by the commander-in-chief of the Fifth War Zone. They played a significant role in the battle to defend Xuzhou.

In Shaanxi, a teacher in a small school initiated the organization of a Small School Teachers' Union, which was hindered as a result. Another group of teachers in a small school organized a Teaching Method Research Association, which was able to succeed very smoothly. This research association implemented wartime education in the school, and also did many other anti-Japanese and national salvation work, which was highly praised by the authorities.

Similarly, it is impossible for the Chinese Student Organization Salvation Association in ××, but the Disaster Relief Association they organized can develop very smoothly.

The second lesson we have learned is that we must also analyze different young people and establish various different organizations according to their urgent needs and inherent traditions.

In a city where the youth movement is relatively sluggish, it is difficult to develop general youth organizations, but some young people organized a Mass Salvation Song and Drama Troupe, whose central work is singing, acting, holding symposiums, etc. Because it can suit the interests of the majority of young people, it has developed to more than 1,000 people and achieved great results.

For example, the factory youth in a certain city are not universally welcome to organizations such as the National Liberation Vanguard Youth Salvation Corps, but they are very enthusiastic about organizing hometown associations, because most of the factory workers there are from other provinces, so the organization of the hometown is very suitable for their needs.

Some rural youth in Shaanxi are not very welcome to the National Liberation Vanguard either, because they cannot easily understand its meaning. In some places, some people initiated the organization of a "Lengwa Corps," and they are very happy to participate. The so-called "Lengwa" is a Shaanxi dialect, specifically referring to a person who is good at fighting injustice and is not afraid of things. They are very familiar with the glorious tradition of "Lengwa" in the countryside, so they are very willing to join this organization and be an anti-Japanese "Lengwa."

The third lesson we have learned is that our organization must be open to the majority of young people. Only an open organization can become an organization for the majority of young people and can seek rapid development. Some organizations with a history, mass base, and work achievements can be open among the majority of young people, but the local authorities have not yet been able to give them legal status. At this time, it is especially necessary to adhere to the open policy. The open policy can first seek the recognition of the authorities, and second, it can seek the approval of the society. These two conditions can guarantee the widespread development of our organization.

The fourth lesson we have learned is that our organization must conduct necessary struggles against the adverse environment. Now our environment is obviously not always favorable. In many places, we still encounter unreasonable obstacles from various evil forces. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, we can certainly make necessary concessions, but if the concessions exceed a certain limit, it will instead mislead the overall situation, and the evil forces will instead make progress. This requires us to conduct necessary struggles. Some organizations lack the determination and ability to struggle, so they cannot withstand some blows. This not only weakens the strength of the youth movement, but also weakens the strength of the war of resistance. Therefore, if we want to develop our organization, we must understand how to properly combine necessary concessions and necessary struggles. (To be continued)

### The Battle for Qianjiang Intensifies: Our Forces Advance Rapidly Along the Xiang River to Encircle the Enemy; The Enemy Appears to Have New Plans on the Border of Henan and Hubei

[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 6th] It is reported that many Japanese officers and military experts are currently gathering in Nanjing, preparing to hold an important military conference to discuss plans for penetrating deeper into the Chinese mainland. It is said that the naval forces have also sent many representatives to participate in the conference.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Frontline reports have been very rampant in recent days. It is generally believed that Qianjiang is still occupied by the Japanese army, but because the rear is frequently attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in that area is in a very dangerous situation. According to Chinese sources, a unit of the Chinese army has crossed the Xiang River and advanced eastward, threatening the rear of the Japanese army in Qianjiang. At the same time, the Chinese army on the front is also launching a fierce attack on the area. It is likely that the outcome will be determined in a few days. The battle for Qianjiang has intensified since yesterday morning.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 6th] The enemy in central Hubei, after suffering setbacks in their invasion of Suizhou and Zaoqiang, immediately dispersed and fled towards Tianmen, Yuekou, Yingcheng, Zaoshi and Anlu along the lower reaches of the Xiang River, and the areas around Yingcheng. They were intercepted by our large army in the Yuekou and Qianjiang areas and have no strength to continue their attacks. Another 10,000 or more enemy troops have recently gathered in Xinyang, and seem to have continued plans. A unit of our army has been closely monitoring them, and the enemy will certainly not succeed.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 6th] An enemy plane flew over Miluo, Changsha, Changde and other places around 10:00 AM on the 6th for reconnaissance.

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 6th] On the morning of the 31st of last month, a unit of our army in eastern Henan attacked the enemy in Wuzili (west of Taikang), killing dozens of enemy soldiers. At the same time, artillery fire hit all targets, and fires broke out in several places inside the enemy stronghold. Soon, the enemy in Taikang rushed to reinforce them, but were ambushed by our forces en route, suffering heavy casualties. Our army then took advantage of the victory to advance towards Taikang.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] A unit of our army in Hebei attacked Neiqiu the night before last. Near Toucun, they encountered the enemy. Our army launched a brave attack and, after three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled towards Liulin. In this battle, the enemy abandoned fifteen corpses and had more than forty wounded. We captured many rifles and hand grenades.

Guangzhou Once Entered

[Central News Agency, Yingde, 6th] According to military sources, a unit of our army suddenly entered the urban area of Guangzhou on the night of the 24th of last month, and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's gendarmerie headquarters in the northern district of the city. They fought fiercely with the enemy on Bianjing Street. Our army's actions were swift and tactics were clever, leaving the enemy exhausted. Many enemy soldiers were killed. At the same time, another unit of our army rushed into Xihua Road and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy and puppet forces, killing several guards of the puppet maintenance association on the spot. Several hours later, a large number of enemy troops stationed at Guanyin Mountain came to reinforce them, and enemy planes also strafed at low altitude. Our army fought fiercely with the enemy until dawn, and then bravely broke through and transferred to another location. In this battle, seventy or eighty enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. Our platoon leader Wu Hai died, and two soldiers were wounded.

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 6th] The remnants of the enemy who were harassing Muzhou and Sanjiang have been completely wiped out. The puppet security team leader Zhao Shanzhan and chief of staff Li Xinyong, who were captured in this battle, have all been executed, much to the delight of the people. The situation in Jiangmen is currently stable. The main force of the enemy in Xinhui is still gathered in the area west of Xinhui City, confronting our forces.

### 20,000 Enemy Troops Invade Our Liulin; Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense in Western Shanxi; Enemy Planes Drop Leaflets Threatening to Invade Shaanxi; We Adopt Mobile Tactics to Fully Strike the Enemy

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to Chinese reports, 20,000 Japanese troops have now arrived in Zhongyang and Lishi in western Shanxi, equipped with several heavy artillery pieces and dozens of steamships. It is suspected that they will advance westward from there, attacking the Chinese defense lines in Liulin, Jundu, and Ji Kou on the east bank of the Yellow River. They have also dispatched planes to drop leaflets over Tuokou, declaring that the Japanese army is determined to cross the Yellow River and attack Shaanxi. The Chinese army is fully prepared and plans to divide into two routes, northwest and west, to meet the Japanese army, and to destroy the communication between the advancing Japanese army and their rearguard, in order to prevent their advance.

[Central News Agency, Xingxian, 6th] The enemy invading Liulin, on the front, is approximately 500 strong in Liangjia Hui and Kongjia Shan (more than 20 li east of Liulin), with four artillery pieces attached. The enemy in Lijiawan and Jiaokou has also increased, and they are attacking our forces. On the right flank, approximately 400-500 enemy troops are in Xue Ling and Angou, 30 li south of Chugou. On the left flank, more than 1,500 enemy troops are detouring south through Han Jia Ling (north of Liulin), attempting to encircle Liulin. We are currently intercepting them on separate routes.

[Central News Agency, Xingxian, 6th] This time, the enemy has mobilized elite forces to launch a large-scale westward invasion. Their division commander Anan has moved into Fenyang, and brigade commander Yamaguchi has also arrived in Lishi to command. The enemy on the Liulin front has been severely attacked by our forces and has not dared to advance further. Therefore, the enemy has adopted a policy of detouring and encircling, launching attacks from Zhongyang and Lishi in several routes from the north and south, attempting to occupy the ferry crossings of Qishi, Jundu, and Sanjiao, and then cross the river to invade Shaanxi. In recent days, after being severely attacked by our forces on separate routes, their momentum has been thwarted. The enemy advancing westward along the Lishi-Qishi road was severely attacked by a brigade of our army near Wang Laopo Mountain, and was ambushed and attacked from the flanks by two regiments of troops on both sides of the road. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with approximately 500-600 killed or wounded, and fled in a disorderly manner to the southeast. We are currently clearing out the remaining enemy forces on Wang Laopo Mountain and continuing to advance southeast to pursue them. A unit of more than 2,000 enemy troops advancing westward from Zhongyang occupied Liuyu (west of Zhongyang) on the 2nd, and then divided into two groups to attack northward. A unit of approximately 3,000 enemy troops is attacking Fengjia An (southeast of Liuyu) through Shibengtou and Fengjiazhuang, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with a division of our army. Also, a division of our army is now advancing between Sanjiao and Dawu, taking advantage of the victory to occupy the strongholds of Qiaojia Shan, Lijia Shan, and Matou Shan near Dawu. A regiment of our army is also actively operating in the northeastern mountains of Qishi, causing great panic among the enemy in Lishi.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 6th] In southern Shanxi, on the 3rd, it was reported that several thousand enemy troops in Shuitou Town (north of Anyi) were harassing the areas around Yangcun and Dingcun (east of Anyi) on the afternoon of the 4th. They encountered a unit of our army and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy was subjected to intense artillery fire from our forces, suffering heavy casualties, and has retreated towards Xiacun. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, approximately 2,000 enemy troops in Anyi attacked Shuangmiao and Hanwang through Zhujiazhuang.

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 5th] Enemy planes bombed Suide on both the 4th and 5th. Enemy planes also flew over Yijiawan and Qikou along the river on the morning of the 5th for reconnaissance.

### National Government Orders

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The National Government issued an order on the 6th, appointing Liang Long as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiating the Sino-Romanian Treaty of Friendship. This order.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The National Government issued an order on the 6th:

(1) Appointing Zhang Tianwu as the Secretary-General of the Provisional Council of Ningxia Province. This order.

(2) Chuan Zhongfang, who concurrently serves as the Director of the Guizhou Provincial Security Department, is to be reassigned. Chuan Zhongfang should be relieved of his concurrent post. This order.

(3) Appointing Han Wenhuan as the Director of the Guizhou Provincial Security Department. This order.

### Visiting the Buddhist Holy Site of Ta'er Monastery (Part 1)

— Jun Sui

[Special Correspondent Report from Qinghai] Before we came to Qinghai, we were told by friends who had been to Qinghai that we must go to Ta'er Monastery once, where we could see the authentic works left by the Buddhist revolutionary Tsongkhapa. Committee Member Xie Cizhou, who came with us, also tried his best to ensure that we did not make the trip in vain. However, although Xining is only twenty li away from Ta'er Monastery, one must either ride livestock or take a carriage, which is very inconvenient. There was only one Ford car belonging to Chairman Ma in Xining City, and there was no way to rent one. Later, Committee Member Xie personally came forward to borrow Chairman Ma's only car in Xining on our behalf, and Chairman Ma generously agreed. So, we decided to set off at 7:00 AM on May 4th. In addition to Mr. Zhang, the travelers included Inspector Ma and Councilor Ma from the provincial government.

Our car left the west gate of the city, and along the way, we saw white poplars and green willows planted on both sides of the road. The newly planted saplings were too numerous to count, which showed that the authorities paid attention to afforestation. The villages we passed all had county-run elementary schools, and the schoolchildren were carrying their schoolbags on their way to school. The students' clothing depended on whether their families were rich or poor, and they were not forced to wear the same school uniforms, which also demonstrated the spirit of Guangxi. When we were about to reach Luosha Town, we saw a Muslim elementary school established by the Muslim Promotion Association. The school buildings were neat and the grounds were quite large. Like the Muslim Middle School in the city, they also conducted military training. Luosha Town is a place where Han and Tibetan people trade with each other, but not during the review meeting. The goods were not concentrated, and the trade was naturally very slack. It is said that foreign firms used to be established there, specializing in buying Tibetan products, which shows the prosperity of trade in the past. After passing Luosha Town, we saw towering buildings and pavilions lined up in the green willows. That was the Buddhist holy site of Ta'er Monastery.

We first drove past eight lama pagodas and the Little Golden Tile Hall, and went straight to the office building, known as "Gongben Jiwa" in Tibetan. Xiangzuo Gengdun Daji guided us through the entire monastery. "Xiangzuo" is similar to the abbot of a southern monastery, but their Xiangzuo are divided into three types: in charge of grain, in charge of accounts, and in charge of general affairs, commonly known as the First Master, Second Master, and Third Master. The Second Master, who was guiding us, was already fifty-eight years old, with a burly body. He had lived in Yonghe Palace in Beijing for many years in the past, so he spoke fluent Mandarin. He was very sincere and was very warm to us as soon as we met. He accompanied us on our visit. We first visited the Great Sutra Hall, which was built with reference to both Chinese and Western architecture, and was extremely magnificent. The area was very large, and it was said that it could accommodate 3,000 lamas to worship and chant sutras. The pillars in front of the hall were similar in model to the Dacheng Hall in Qufu, but unfortunately the pillars were all wrapped in red cloth, so we could not see their original appearance. The pillars in the hall were all covered with valuable Tibetan felt, and the kneeling pads were made of precious carpets, which were as long as the width of the hall. However, each lama monk's kneeling place formed its own circular pattern, which could be used as a substitute for a futon.

Further inside was the Sutra Lecture Hall, a magnificent building containing Buddhist scriptures in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit. The collection of Tibetan scriptures is the most abundant in the country. According to Buddhist scriptures and precepts, they divided the Tripitaka into three colleges, and after the lamas in the entire monastery had studied the classics for a considerable period of time and passed strict examinations, they were sent to each college to conduct more in-depth research. The Vinaya College was further divided into medicine and astronomy. Today happened to be the oral examination period for Aja Khutuktu. The so-called Khutuktu means "saint" and is the highest authority among the lamas. Aja is his name. All the lamas who were taking the exam, except for a part who were sitting on the ground around Aja, were being interviewed by Aja in person. The rest were in the square in front of the college, divided into three major groups, each group further divided into several small groups. In each small group, one person stood in front of the crowd to ask questions, and the rest sat around to be tested. Each question was limited to a certain time to answer. If the answer was correct, the person in the middle would clap his hands to express approval. Otherwise, he would strike the backs of his hands together to indicate that the answer did not match the question. Those who answered incorrectly would first be punished by having their rosary beads hung around their necks, the second time they would press their necks with their hands, and the third time they would rub their necks with their hands to humiliate them. What they were being tested on was Buddhist epistemology, which is also a department of argumentation. They measured the depth of Buddhist learning by the level of epistemology, which is like logic being the gateway to studying various disciplines, and the reasoning is actually the same. We saw the solemn and calm attitude of the people who were asking the questions, the expressions of the people who were thinking and responding, and the spirit of the people who were listening attentively to the questions and answers. The questioners made decisive decisions when the answers were right or wrong, making gestures to express acceptance or rejection. The style was graceful and generous, like an experienced official judging a case. As for Aja's style, it was like that of a learned scholar. His method of lecturing was completely autonomous, with the listeners freely asking questions and then correcting them. It is said that before lamas enter each college for research, they must pass strict examinations. Each person can take the exam three times, and if they fail the third time, they will lose their qualifications to study a major. It is also said that there are many original Indian texts of the scriptures on Vinaya in the monastery that have not been translated into Tibetan, so lamas studying Vinaya still regard studying in India as the only way out.

Further inside is the Great Golden Tile Hall, which was built specifically to commemorate their ancestor Tsongkhapa. The copper tiles on the roof of the hall are plated with gold, hence the name Great Golden Tile Hall. The roof decorations are also made of copper and plated with gold, making it as splendid as possible. The hall is three stories high. In the center of the hall is an image of Tsongkhapa, said to be cast in pure gold, and displays his finger-blood self-portrait sent to his mother when he taught in Tibet, his childhood footprints left in the stone mouth, and all other relics. In front of the statue, the ghee lamps burned brightly. It is said that they have not been extinguished since the hall was built. Under the eaves of the hall, the ground is paved with wooden strips. Lamas come from as far away as Mongolia and Tibet, determined to kowtow what they call "equal-body heads" in front of the image of Tsongkhapa, which is to first kneel on their knees, then stretch out their hands to hold their heads in front of them, and then kowtow their heads on the ground, a five-body prostration. We saw seven marks on the board, which were formed by rubbing the ground with both hands, both knees, both toes, and one head. It is said that they count 10,000 kowtows as fulfilling one wish, and the more wishes they have, the more kowtows they perform. Moreover, some people start counting from the moment they leave their homes, kowtowing every step of the way until they reach the Great Golden Tile Hall of Ta'er Monastery. If the person making the wish runs out of travel expenses and cannot continue to move forward, they remember the location where they stopped and beg for food to return to their hometown, in order to accumulate another sum of money so that they can go to Ta'er Monastery again from there to fulfill their wish step by step. Leaving aside this method, their spirit of moving forward without fear of setbacks is truly admirable. If they could transfer this spirit to studying and establishing a career, they would be bound to succeed. (To be continued)

### The Enemy Intentionally Creates Difficulties; Accuses British Military Officer of Being a Spy; Fabricates Charges as if They Were True; Forbids Embassy Personnel From Meeting With Him

[Reuters, Shanghai, 6th] Colonel Spear, military attache of the British Embassy in China, and interpreter Kou Bo, were detained by the Japanese military authorities in Zhangjiakou. However, they are now safe. Colonel Spear has sent a letter to Mr. Lambert, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, and Major Dillaman, commander of the British forces in Tianjin. Lambert and Dillaman were ordered to go to Zhangjiakou to investigate the matter, but the Japanese military refused to allow them to see Spear, only allowing them to deliver letters. Spear also sent a reply. Lambert and Dillaman have now returned to Peiping. Colonel Spear was detained by the Japanese military in Zhangjiakou on the 26th of last month, and Kou Bo was also detained when he went to investigate.

[Foreign News from This Port] According to a strange report released by the Japanese Allied Press this morning, on May 15th, the Japanese military authorities obtained intelligence that several foreigners of unknown names were staying in Bian Shou Village (transliteration), Zhuolu County, about 35 miles southeast of Zhangjiakou. The Japanese military police were ordered to rush to the designated location and take two British officials to the Japanese military police headquarters in Zhangjiakou. After interrogation, it was learned that one of the arrested was Colonel Spear. Spear was appointed to a new position in Shanghai in October last year by the British Ambassador. In February this year, he left Shanghai by boat, via Hong Kong, and went to Hanoi. From Hanoi, he flew to Chongqing. After arriving in Chongqing, he met with leaders of the National Government scattered in various places, and inspected the actions of the Chinese army, such as the Eighth Route Army in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hebei, and other provinces. Afterwards, Spear entered Shanxi from the important base of the Eighth Route Army in Shaanxi, and then arrived at Shuang Shou Village in southern Chahar via Kelan, Wutai, and Yangjiahe. During the journey from Yan'an to Chahar, Spear walked on foot, and compiled a report on the situation in the Japanese-occupied areas. He used the Eighth Route Army's radio telegraph to send it to Peiping and Shanghai. When Spear was in Yangjiahe, Shanxi, he sent his Chinese partner to Peiping to contact the British Embassy. The embassy's interpreter, Kou Bo, went to find Spear without properly contacting the Japanese authorities in advance. The two of them also hid everywhere for three days in order to avoid being searched by the Japanese. The local Japanese military authorities attached great importance to this case, because they felt that the two of them had deliberately entered the Japanese military-occupied area from enemy territory to collect various intelligence and transmit it to the Kuomintang and the Eighth Route Army. Furthermore, the Japanese military authorities had issued a notice that foreigners who wished to travel in the war zone must obtain the understanding of the Japanese military authorities in advance.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 6th] According to a report from the Japanese Allied Press, Colonel Spear and interpreter Kou Bo were detained by the Japanese military because they were "ordinary spies." Spear was wearing civilian clothes in an attempt to avoid being detained by the Japanese military. The Japanese military authorities allowed Lambert and Dillaman to transmit letters and exchange opinions with Colonel Spear, and learned that Spear is currently safe. Officials from the British Embassy said that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government in Tokyo. Japanese officials claim that the Japanese military has its own designated methods for dealing with foreigners who travel in Japanese-occupied areas without the permission of the Japanese authorities. The British authorities have been notified in advance. A Japanese spokesman said that the British authorities had expressed that they did not understand the Japanese position. Although Colonel Spear and Kou Bo have been detained for nine days, they cannot be allowed to meet with Lambert, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, and Dillaman, commander of the British forces in Tianjin, because "the investigation has not been completed."

### Debate in the British House of Commons; Disputes Between Britain and Japan in China

[Reuters, London, 5th] Foreign Secretary Butler reported on the latest situation in China during question time in the House of Commons today. He stated, "There have been battles in the Han River area of central China. There have been no major changes in the original front lines. The general situation in the Shanghai International Settlement is essentially unchanged. The troops landed on Gulangyu have not been withdrawn and are continuing negotiations to find a solution. British and American Marines remain ashore. Regarding the detention of British officials by the Japanese, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy and a British Army liaison officer are returning to Peiping with the latest news. (The above two people were ordered to go to Zhangjiakou on June 1 to investigate the truth). The entire matter is being negotiated with the Japanese military authorities and the Japanese government. As for Japan's claim to have the right to blockade Chinese seaports, Japan announced a blockade of the Chinese coast after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, but stated that its blockade was limited to Chinese ships. If Japan attempts to extend its blockade to foreign ships, it would de facto become a belligerent, but since China and Japan have not officially declared war, this action would be illegal. The British government has fully expressed this view to the Japanese government." Conservative Party Member Morgan questioned the government whether it would consider the "Lanpura" incident to be closed based on the Japanese explanation that there was a misunderstanding about the ship's nationality. Butler replied, "We have always agreed that if the Japanese have doubts about whether a ship belongs to Britain, they can board the ship for inspection. There is no doubt about the misunderstanding in the 'Lanpura' incident, so we have taken a firm stance and have received an explanation from the Japanese side." When asked whether the government considered this explanation satisfactory, Butler replied, "Yes." Replying to another question, Butler said, "The Prime Minister is aware that the Japanese naval representative in Qingdao has strictly ordered that a separate loading and unloading certificate must be obtained for each bill of lading for all British goods, and is aware that due to this procedure, British goods often have to be abandoned on the pier for several days, while there are no restrictions on Japanese goods. Regarding the issue of warehouses, if goods stored are Japanese, they must be carefully distinguished and the ones they like are stored. However, they do not provide any assistance in distinguishing British goods." When asked whether the Prime Minister would indicate to the Japanese government that if it did not rescind these unequal restrictions, British ports would treat Japanese ships in the same way, Butler replied, "Negotiations are currently underway with the Japanese authorities in Qingdao, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also protested to the Japanese government, requesting more warehouse space to facilitate the storage of British goods."

Editorial: Achievements and Prospects of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly

The first session of the Provisional Assembly of Guangdong Province concluded on the 28th of last month after two weeks of effort. Resolutions on politics, military affairs, people's movement, economy, culture, education, and other matters have been seen in various newspapers in recent days, and the full text of the closing declaration was also disclosed yesterday.

Reviewing the achievements of the first session of the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Assembly, in addition to various valuable resolutions, we believe that the following points should be particularly emphasized and expressed in the declaration for all parties to value. First, it solemnly points out to the 35 million compatriots in Guangdong that only by adhering to unity under the leadership of our wise supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, adhering to a protracted war, a full-scale war, and striving for the initiative can we save ourselves, save the country, build the province, and build the nation. Furthermore, based on the situation of China and the international situation, it points out the basis for our inevitable victory in the war of resistance and national construction. Second, it solemnly points out to the 35 million compatriots in Guangdong that "those two or three with mistaken understanding and weak will [omitted text] are like slag in a furnace, eliminated after prolonged forging, making the future of the war of resistance even brighter." This further sweeps away the poisonous atmosphere spread by Wang Jingwei and his ilk of "using anti-communism and peace to save China," clarifies the vision of our Guangdong compatriots, and strengthens their will to support the government and persist in the war of resistance. Third, this session solemnly and painfully declared that "those in power are afflicted by arbitrariness and opportunism, leading to division and infighting, plunging the nation and the state into irredeemable danger... We can indeed reconcile and harmonize matters through human effort... Then, political clarity can be expected, and people's livelihoods will gradually become affluent." In fact, not only does future political clarity and affluent livelihoods rely on abandoning arbitrariness and opportunism and relying on reconciliation and harmony, but also, in the present moment, if we want to prevent the [omitted text] from penetrating deeper and save Guangdong and our country from danger, it is essential for the government, the army, and the people to refrain from arbitrariness and opportunism, eliminate partisan prejudices, and reconcile in sincere unity!

We express our highest respect for the achievements of this session of the Assembly, which allows us to foresee an infinitely bright future for Guangdong Province and the overall war of resistance and national construction! However, we must solemnly point out that since the war of resistance has entered its second phase, the [omitted text] situation has begun to change dramatically, and Guangdong Province is increasingly important in determining the success or failure of the war of resistance and national construction. How can we consolidate the unity between the government, the army, and the people? How can we consolidate the cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties to concentrate efforts on the war of resistance and national construction? How can we earnestly and effectively mobilize the strength of the people to enhance the fighting power of the front lines? To develop combat behind enemy lines? To assist the growth of new forces in the rear? To stop the [omitted text] offensive and plan our country's future counter-offensive? How can we implement democracy to improve political institutions? Promote people's livelihood to improve the people's lives and relieve refugees in various places? How can we develop economic construction as the basis for building the province and the country? All of these are urgent problems that need to be solved to save us from our perilous situation. After this first session of the Assembly, the senators of Guangdong Province, under the leadership of the highest authorities, should assist the wise military and political authorities, selflessly lead the people of the province, promote truly talented individuals, cultivate young cadres, and strive for the thorough implementation of all resolutions of this session, working together to achieve the thorough implementation of the wartime administrative program of Guangdong Province! The people of Guangdong have glorious revolutionary and combat experience and lessons. In the future, they will surely advance and carry forward this spirit to strive for the final victory of China's liberation. This is what we humbly pray for and encourage each other to do.

U.S. Holds Pacific Fleet Exercises for Days

Secretary of War Requests Additional Panama Canal Locks

U.S. House Drafts New Neutrality Act

[Central News Agency, San Pedro Port, U.S.A., 5th] Eighty large warships and 400 seaplanes belonging to the U.S. Pacific Fleet departed from this port of San Diego today to conduct exercises, which are expected to be completed by the 20th of this month.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A bill allocating $100 million for the U.S. government to purchase military raw materials was passed through all congressional procedures today and is now awaiting President Roosevelt's signature.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] Secretary of War Harry Woodring appeared before the House Appropriations Committee today, requesting the passage of funds to add several locks to the Panama Canal for the exclusive use of the Navy when necessary. In his speech, he stated that the world situation is extremely tense, and countries are competing to expand their military forces. The United States can no longer rest easy because the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans serve as barriers. From a military perspective, the Americas are no longer another continent but are closely related to other continents. This is what the people should understand.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee began drafting a new bill today to amend the Neutrality Act. State Department Assistant Secretary Moore, Director Chuck Haworth, and legal expert Savage were invited to attend to explain the State Department's views. After a lengthy discussion, the committee passed the first article of the bill proposed by Committee Chairman Pittman by a majority vote and scheduled to continue discussing other articles tomorrow. According to the current Neutrality Act, the existence of a state of war should be determined by the President, and the implementation of the Neutrality Act should be announced. The article passed now authorizes the President to declare the existence of a state of war when the peace of the United States and the lives of American citizens are threatened. In this sense, the President will have greater freedom to invoke the Neutrality Act.

British Submarine Disaster

Chamberlain Issues Report

London Mayor Launches Donation Drive to Aid Bereaved Families

British Cabinet to Decide on Investigation Method Today

[Reuters, London, 5th] British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain gave a lengthy report in the House of Commons today on the Thetis submarine disaster, stating that the sinking of the Thetis submarine was not due to carrying extra personnel but was actually caused by the flooding of the two front compartments of the submarine. The water entered through the torpedo tubes at the bow. It is unknown how the torpedo tube doors became open or whether they were already open when the submarine submerged. The submarine's signaling device was damaged and could not communicate with surface ships. Although buoys and smoke signals were released, they were not immediately seen. Efforts were made to raise the rear of the submarine to the surface to drill a hole for rescue, but they were unsuccessful. It is believed that three people attempted to escape at the same time as the first group, but this proved fatal, and they were dragged back into the submarine. The Prime Minister stated that various methods had been exhausted to rescue the personnel in the submarine. An attempt was made to lighten the submarine so that the stern could float to the surface. After the Plaxton rescue ship learned of the submarine's location and released sound signals, two people inside the submarine used Davis escape apparatus to float to the surface and were rescued. One of them was the captain, Oram, who risked his life to escape using the escape apparatus. At that time, he reported that everyone in the submarine was still alive but in a very dangerous situation. Later, two more people escaped to the surface. Divers then entered the sea to work but encountered great difficulties. It was originally intended to raise the rear of the submarine to the surface to drill a hole for rescue, but under the circumstances, drilling a hole would easily flood the submarine, which would be unfair. Subsequently, although repeated attempts were made to float the submarine, it gradually became heavier. After the three people who attempted to escape using the escape apparatus perished, no one else used the escape apparatus to try to escape. Rescue personnel later knew that there was no hope for the lives of the people in the submarine and turned to rescuing the submarine. The Prime Minister continued, saying that the Lars Company is providing compensation to the families of the deceased employees, and the Mayor of London has launched a public donation in accordance with national public opinion to provide financial assistance to the families of the deceased. He expressed his deep condolences on behalf of the government and the two houses for the loss of the Thetis submarine. An official then asked whether a public inquiry into the Thetis submarine disaster should wait until the submarine has been rescued from the sea. Chamberlain replied that this should be done as soon as possible, but before the submarine is raised, the internal situation of the submarine cannot be investigated, so the proceedings may not be fully conclusive.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Mayor of London has launched a donation drive to provide relief to the families of those who died in the Thetis submarine disaster. The King and Queen, Queen Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Connaught, the Princess Royal, and the Earl of Harewood have all agreed to donate. Leaders of local civil authorities have also telegraphed, responding to the Mayor of London and starting donation drives.

[Reuters, London, 5th] It is reported that the government is currently considering the method of investigating the Thetis submarine disaster, which will be the same as the method of investigating the R101 airship disaster, that is, a signed lawyer and expert jurors will conduct the investigation together. The British Cabinet will make a formal decision on this matter on the 7th of this month.

[Reuters, London, 5th] It has been reported here that the King of Italy, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the King of Belgium have sent condolences for the tragic Thetis submarine disaster.

False Alarm - Attempted Assassination of British King's Younger Brother's Wife

Duchess of Kent Safe

Suspicious Elderly Man Arrested Late at Night

[Associated Press, London, 6th] A shocking incident occurred last night involving an attempted shooting of the Duchess of Kent, the wife of the British King's younger brother. The incident occurred around 9 p.m. when the Duchess of Kent was going to watch an American film with another noblewoman named Portarlington. The film starred the beautiful actress Merle Oberon. The Scotland Yard Detective Department announced at 10 p.m. that the Duchess of Kent and others were safe. In fact, the Duchess did not know that someone had shot at them until she arrived at the cinema. After hearing the news, they decided to continue watching the film. A suspect was arrested late at night. This person arrived in the UK from Australia three weeks ago and is quite old. The authorities are not willing to release his name. It is said that the suspect had suspicious activities near the Duchess's residence. It is claimed that this person used a shotgun to fire in the direction of the Duchess's vehicle.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Duchess of Kent heard gunshots last night while going to watch a film with the noblewoman Portarlington. The Duchess of Kent and others were unharmed and did not know that someone had shot at them until they left the cinema. A suspect was arrested by the police near the location of the shooting, but no charges have been laid yet. After the incident, the Duke and Duchess of Kent's residence on Belgrave Square was guarded by three security guards, but the guard has been reduced to one person this morning. One of the windows of the Princess Royal's house was shattered by a small bullet. It is reported that the police authorities do not consider this matter important.

The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East

By Shudi

(Continued from May 29th) The British plan, from beginning to end, is one-sided, the so-called cooperation in resisting German and Italian aggression against third countries, rather than an alliance that shares its fortunes with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, on the contrary, insisted on a mutually beneficial tacit agreement similar to an alliance. Thus, there was another pause here.

In this way, Chamberlain presented a very obvious situation to Hitler: attacking Britain and France would inevitably involve the Soviet Union, but attacking the Soviet Union would not necessarily involve Britain and France. However, Hitler ignored this and continued to cooperate with Mussolini, preparing for further blackmail against Britain and France. On the Soviet side, of course, it could not long expose itself to the danger of being attacked and had to take self-defense measures. Thus, the Foreign Minister Litvinov, who advocated collective security most strongly, resigned at this moment, neither too early nor too late.

Litvinov's resignation was a clear demonstration to Britain and France. For a considerable period, Britain was indeed shocked. However, what shocked them even more was the news of a Soviet-German rapprochement, which suddenly became clamorous.

(2) The Possibility of a Buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany

If Britain does not correct its current illusions and make the greatest determination, then a buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany is not only possible but inevitable. The key to success or failure lies in whether Germany can make Poland maintain its neutrality as a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Germany. Apart from this, the conditions for a tacit understanding between the Soviet Union and Germany already exist. (1) The Soviet Union's anti-aggression attention is now not in Europe but in the Far East. (2) Germany's coveted objects are the colonies of Britain and France, not Ukraine. (3) China's war of resistance has created a new situation in the Far East, weakening Japanese fascism and creating new hope for the Soviet Union to gain the assistance of a powerful friendly country in the East. At the same time, it has also increased German and Italian suspicion of Japan's power to threaten Britain and France. Under the situation of closer ties between China and the Soviet Union and Japan's gradual inability to echo Germany and Italy, coupled with Britain and France's continued alienation from the Soviet Union, then the future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly show a considerable degree of tacit understanding.

This is just theory. What is the reality? Recently, it is worth noting that one of Stalin's closest confidants, David Kandalaki, suddenly appeared in Berlin. Everyone knows that this Kandalaki had visited Berlin several times before to promote German-Soviet rapprochement, and the most successful time was his trip to Germany in mid-April 1937. At that time, it was on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, and the Soviet Union was very willing to obtain a considerable understanding with Germany. However, because of Hitler's arrogance at that time, the understanding that had already been drafted ultimately failed at the last minute. The current situation is different. The strength of Japan in the East has been greatly reduced. At this time, this gentleman's visit to Berlin is a headache for Britain and France.

There is also a second matter. According to the opinions of the German military authorities recently, if Germany wants to expand again, then, in any case, it must obtain the prior condition of Soviet non-interference or inability to interfere. According to their estimates, if this point can be achieved, then Germany and Italy can immediately make territorial demands on Britain and France. Britain and France would absolutely not dare to fight back. Even if the war were to start, Britain would definitely withdraw halfway, leaving France alone to be dominated by Germany and Italy. Therefore, when Japan recently proposed the issue of attacking the Soviet Union to Germany, the German side immediately rejected it. Subsequently, Germany instead proposed new ideas to Japan, which were roughly: (1) The decisive point in the current Sino-Japanese War lies in the overall situation in Europe, not in East Asia. Japan will inevitably fail if it continues to fight in this way. (2) If Japan is willing to echo Germany and Italy in threatening Britain and France so that Germany and Italy can achieve a decisive victory in Europe, then at that time, Germany and Italy are willing to devote all their efforts to helping Japan to deal with the Soviet Union. (3) To fulfill the current mission, Japan should take a completely defensive posture in the various battlefields in China, but at the same time, send a naval fleet to the Mediterranean and a considerable number of ground and air forces to Africa. Although this plan has not been realized, it is very clear that Germany and Italy currently have no intention of dealing with the Soviet Union.

Because of these phenomena, the current Britain is filled with worry about a German-Soviet tacit understanding everywhere. Let me give two examples here. The first is a warning that appeared recently in The Times. This warning was issued by its correspondent in Rome. He reminded the British people to never forget what Hitler said in 1930, which was that he wanted to "give India to the Soviet Union and divide Africa among Italy." The second, a sentence in a book in Britain is currently receiving much discussion and attention. The book is a recent work by an Australian Dr. Duleker, entitled "The End of Economic Men," and the famous saying is, "From whatever angle you look at it, a Soviet-German rapprochement is almost inevitable unless there is a large-scale war in the near future that can prevent it--the so-called near future being 1940 at the latest." This famous saying was written long before Britain's policy change this time, but it is still worth noting.

However, what is described in this section, from the perspective of Britain and France, can only be said to be shadows. In addition, there has also been a bright side recently. What is the bright side? It is:

Central Market Requests for Rent Reduction Denied More Than Thirty Stallholders to Move Out Authorities Remain Firm and Unresponsive Former Tenants Moving Out Will Call for New Tenants to Take Over

After the completion and opening of the new Central Market, it caused a sensation for a time due to its convenient location and magnificent architecture. In particular, the competition among merchants bidding for stalls in the city was fierce, and the bids were high, which was rare in the past. However, less than a week after the market opened, business was not prosperous, which was far from what people generally expected. Merchants began to feel that the rent was too high to sustain. Therefore, some closed down after only a few days of operation, and some who won bids dared not open for business. Those who continued to operate, apart from a few who made a small profit, were mostly in a precarious situation. However, because they had paid two months' rent in advance before the opening, they reluctantly supported themselves, waiting for the situation to improve. Recently, more than 30 households, including those selling chickens, ducks, vegetables, and meat, submitted a request to the Municipal Health Bureau due to poor business and excessive rent, requesting that they be considered for the difficulties of the merchants and that the rent be reduced appropriately to maintain business. The Health Authority, limited by municipal regulations, was unable to approve the merchants' request and rejected it. The merchants in the market, unable to obtain a solution to their request, submitted a request to the authorities on the 31st of last month for the sake of preserving their capital, stating that they would move out by the end of this month to avoid suffering greater losses. The merchants preparing to move out have recently been carrying out all the relocation procedures, and some have been looking for business locations outside the city as a fallback plan for the future. Some have already stopped operating and will wait until the end of the month to move. It is reported that the authorities have decided that after these stallholders move out, or in early July, they will put the vacant stalls out for bid. The rent will be based on what was paid by the original stallholders and will not be reduced. However, according to the current business situation in the Central Market, [text incomplete].

Hong Kong Rotary Club Elects New Officers

The directors are Huo Jia, Miezuer, Feng Bingfen, Ross, and Weiyue Man.

Last Tuesday, the Association held a weekly meal meeting at the Hong Kong Hotel. Chairman Huo Jia gave a speech, first welcoming Guangzhou Rotary Club member Hua Liyasi and guest Chen Pishi, and announced that a board meeting would be held next Monday at 5:15 PM, followed by introducing Professor Bulong's lecture on "Spitsbergen" (Arctic place name). He said, "I lectured on the various aspects of Iceland some years ago. Now I will describe the journey to Spitsbergen. It may be interesting or not. The departure date was July 31, 1938, departing from a fishing port in northern England. Thirty hours later, I saw a mountain 7,000 feet high with snow covering its peak. The Norwegian government has an important meteorological station there to report the weather to Europe. Later, I arrived at King's Bay, where the snow was very thick and the coal mine production was quite abundant, with a railway for transportation. This is the northernmost railway in the world. Spitsbergen has no trees at all. There are some, but they are only small Arctic willows, less than six inches high. However, there are many other flowers, and the interior has grasslands, but not where we were scheduled to go. There are many flowers and plants, and there is no plant testing ground. The work has been quite remarkable. According to the records, there are a total of 130 kinds of flowers and hundreds of kinds of moss. Birds are also tight. This is what we find strange, mostly blue gulls, and their nests are almost all built underground. When we walked past, the blue birds flew over our heads, chattering endlessly, as if scolding us. Some of the people who were not wearing head protection were often pecked by the birds flying down, so when we returned to the ship, there were several people with head injuries and bleeding. At that time, we only had cameras and no weapons, so we could not retaliate, so we had to adopt a non-interference policy. It is said that this kind of bird flies from this Arctic Ocean to the Southern Ocean once a year, because it is cold and hates

Free Talk: A Trip to the Isolated Island By Zhuang Ruiyuan
When the last express train from Hanoi arrived in Haiphong, it was already 2:00 AM. I was still identifying the characters for "Shanghai Bound" on the luggage piled up like small hills, all written in chalk. I felt a little joy and wrote it down like this.

Three days ago, when I boarded the train, a friend held my hand and asked:

"Why do you want to go to Shanghai?"

"I don't know." It was for a personal matter, but I didn't think that would be a convincing reason for my friend. And in fact, I didn't know what it was for besides this simple reason.

"I know. To be honest, I want to go back too." He squeezed my hand even tighter.

"Then, shall we go together?" I smiled vaguely. In this way, even I felt that I was being envied. Envy for being able to feel a little joy for those chalk-written characters at the Haiphong station. Although traveling through many boats and cars, in a world of coal dust, it is mostly a distant and arduous journey; however, the road still leads directly to Shanghai. All roads lead to Rome.

Now, the arduous and distant journey has begun. I only say it's for two years of missing, missing Shanghai like a long-lost friend. It should be said that this is such a ridiculous thing. From the day I set off, in order to make it clear to myself that I missed this long-lost friend, I missed her with all my might, and I reorganized my language knowledge from two years ago.

Jumping on the train, I said to the people seeing me off on the platform: "Go back!" Using the Shanghai dialect I knew two years ago. Since then, I never let go of every opportunity to speak. As long as the opportunity comes to me, I use the Shanghai dialect from another era without hesitation. I spoke it six or seven years ago, and in these two years, it has been abandoned. When I accidentally stepped on an Annamese person's foot, I repeatedly apologized, but he glared at me fiercely.

I left a place I was attached to and set off to a place I missed. This journey cannot be completed in a day or even ten days. So the train threw me down for the first time, throwing me into a lonely small town. The station pointed me to a nearby hotel. At night, because the mountain road in the dark was dangerous, the train stopped and rested on the platform. But this was not where I was going, but I was forced to stay here, staying between the two places of attachment and longing. The desolation lacks descriptive words, and I can't say how I left a night's name in this hotel.

The next day, the train started again, and the loneliness on the train was still unbearable. I found a fellow traveler among the passengers using Shanghai dialect, thin and short, with teeth yellowed by cigarettes. When he spoke, his eyes stared at people, and his words were as numerous and trivial as his saliva, spraying out in strands. He was a cigarette merchant, interspersing his pure Shanghai dialect with Ningbo dialect with the meaning of the marketplace, as if he was conducting a batch of transactions with anyone at any time.

"Look, there are bananas all over the mountains and plains, why don't they know to pick them and sell them!"

The train slowly arrived at Anpei Chegu, barefoot Annamese women crowded into the car doors, baskets filled with bananas and plantains picked from the wild; when the Annamese women moved the bananas back and forth in front of him, he complained: These are wild bananas. "Yes, the exchange rate is too expensive, one yuan and eight jiao can only be exchanged for one yuan."

But I just smiled lowly. Despite how much I hated such people in the past, now I really don't have the ability to turn my face away and avoid such people. I miss Shanghai. Words that I haven't said in two years are now appearing on my lips again, and such people are exactly what I need now.

I explained how eagerly I wanted to see Shanghai and asked him why he wanted to return to Shanghai from Chongqing.

"Is it because of the bombing of Chongqing?"

"No, even if there's no bombing, I have to go back. How can I not go back?"

Then he started spitting more saliva, and his conclusion was that Shanghai was still very important. A cigarette factory moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Hankou because of the war, but part of it remained in Shanghai. Their cigarette company monopolized the sales rights of this factory, and the main task of this trip was of course to appeal to cigarette smokers in the interior. However, "to be honest, since the Anti-Japanese War, the price of cigarettes has never been raised in the factory." Shanghai is still very important because only the cigarette factories in Shanghai have not raised the prices of their products. In addition, he wanted to send his family from Hong Kong back to Shanghai, and then bring his brothers from Shanghai back to Chongqing.

Of course, this matter alone might not cause him to make such an expensive trip. He had more affairs. In short, Shanghai is still very important, is his conclusion.

The presentation of the problem is often adapted to the opposite side. He was really too excited, so I grabbed a question and planned to make him feel a little disappointed. So I said.

"Shanghai is very unreliable, don't send your family to the enemy's place."

"What are you talking about! It won't happen. Shanghai will be ours forever."

His saliva was sprayed out in strands, his eyes were turning all over me, and he went on. Shanghai is our place, we rent it to foreigners, and then sublet it to us. The second landlord and the tenant all live in the same house: How difficult it is to break in and occupy it! One… I failed.

Although I don't entirely like his statement, this metaphor interested me. A businessman, burned by the fires of war for the past year or two, sees money in his eyes, and what the war makes him lose is also money. He ran to Chongqing, and his conclusion was that Shanghai is still very important and will be ours forever.

In any case, Shanghai is still passable, because it is our place. This is why I felt a little joy when I saw the words written in chalk and wrote it down like this.

Five Minutes (2) By Luo Feng
Although He Zheng's appearance was very peaceful; his heart was pounding like a clanking shackle, and he felt the sound of his heart pounding, drowning out the clanging of the shackles.

How to die? He wasted a lot of precious time guessing this novel mystery. He first guessed that they would not use guns, and secondly... there were so many unimaginable ways to kill him. He couldn't determine in advance which method would be used. He thought: Everything will be clear in five minutes, and everything will be over!

His watch had been confiscated by the enemy soldiers. Now he didn't have a more accurate timepiece to calculate the length of those five minutes. According to the usual test, every seventy heartbeats equals one minute, then about three hundred and fifty heartbeats would be close to that time. So he walked forward leisurely, pressing his wrist with the watch in the other hand, but before he could press on the pulse, he separated his hands as if he was shocked. He felt that this action was really stupid and boring.

The footsteps continued slowly. Every iron ring on his feet opened his clanging throat, singing an extremely monotonous marching song. The four suburbs of this desolate mountain also echoed distantly at the same time...

He didn't know how long he had been walking, but he knew that it must not have exceeded five minutes, otherwise he would immediately fall dead on the barren mountain.

He began to curse this moonless night. In this night, nothing could be seen except for layers of darkness. As for the future, no, maybe at the moment, when that terrible moment came, it would be difficult to see what method the enemy would use to eliminate his life. He Zheng regarded such a death as the biggest regret in his life.

Time slowed down as if it was going backwards. A long time ago, He Zheng always felt that every pause in breathing had the chance to stop breathing forever, but now that chance seemed to never be realized.

Just as He Zheng's mind was very confused, a rough hand suddenly pushed him from behind, so his whole body staggered forward a few steps diagonally, and finally, he was tripped by something huge and hard. His chest hung on that thing, and his head hung upside down. Within ten seconds, he did not change his position, and he silently伏在那廢, waiting to accept the unknowable death. At this time, his hearing discovered the snorting of beasts, and that snorting was close at hand. He knew that he had been thrown into the beasts. So he stood up instinctively and grinned at the snorting. Two guards were watching outside.

Far Away By Yu Saif
Mother poked her head out of the window and said:

"Be careful of your health!"

I nodded and walked away hastily, stepping on the shadows of the December clouds.

My younger brother watched me at the door. We parted silently. When I looked back, I could no longer see the door of home. All I saw were light yellow buildings, red roofs. Lively white clouds bloomed like flowers in the blue sky.

Last night, outside the door of a friend's house, the turbid shouts, the sound of handcuffs, the black car without notice... these gave me such a shock; in the morning, I knew he was missing, and now, I...

I have to start exile.

The whistle roared. The sailors untied the mooring ropes, and the dockworkers jumped from the ship to the dock one after another. They were crowded, they shouted, they seemed to be watching something. Thin smoke came out of the chimney. The whistle roared!

Quickly carrying two suitcases, I squeezed into the crowd. The ship had already left the dock by about a foot. I jumped into the cabin and ran to the deck so hastily, just to see the faces of my father and sisters again...

Father arched his shoulders, turning his entire old face towards me. Then, he removed his felt hat, and his gray hair seemed to be replacing his painful blessings. My sisters lowered their faces and no longer smiled foolishly at me.

I took out a handkerchief and waved to them, and even forced a smile. Father waved his felt hat…

What should I say to them?

This noisy sound, and the whistle roared again and again, the machines, the waves, and the wind, all hindered my shouts.

What should I shout to them?

Finally, people were small, scenery was small, and everything became a white fog. From then on, I left them. When the ship sailed out of the Wusongkou, I saw the sun opening its bloody mouth sadly in the twilight... That flag was inserted on the roof.

"There will be such a day..."

So, in my mind, a picture floated up of Japanese warships with the sun flag all being sunk in the sea.

I sat in the cabin, facing the surging dark green sea. The sky was gradually getting dark, and the sea was so wide that it was terrifying. The wind, freely and wildly, rushed across this turbulent wilderness. It howled, swallowing the smoke coming out of the chimney.

The lights came on, and soon, suddenly the whistle roared again.

"Why?"

"Why?"

The passengers realized the ship was in trouble, and everyone opened their eyes wide, thinking about bad things.

"The inspection is coming..."

The cabin was in chaos. I opened my suitcase and gave the two notebooks I brought with me to the sea. I felt uncomfortable and covered the box.

Soon, two or three groups of five or six soldiers each rummaged between us. They didn't speak, and the cabin was filled with dead silence. ... The next day, I learned that nine Chinese people had been arrested in this search.

### Between Brothers By Zeng Zhaojun
Since the Japanese cavalry was stationed in Ju County, the market has been as dead as a graveyard. A large group of old people who had been conquered by the nation had moist eyes and were very sad. Most of the old people shook their heads and sighed, lamenting the demise of the world and the degeneration of people's hearts, which is why there is such a cruel retribution; what about the young people? They are unwilling to be obedient people or slaves. Their bright pupils radiate extraordinary light, staring fiercely into the distance, as if waiting for something.

In a bungalow not far from the market that had not been destroyed by artillery fire, lived two brothers, thirty-two-year-old Da Zhang; twenty-seven-year-old Xiao Zhang. The two people's faces looked very similar: white faces, slender eyebrows, almost even their toenails were the same. If it weren't for Da Zhang's left ear having a gold earring that was half a tael in weight, even their mother sleeping in the coffin would probably have a hard time telling them apart. Speaking of Da Zhang, he is really a young moralist. He wears horse pants with tight trouser legs all year round, and a small calligraphy brush is inserted in the small pocket on his chest. He has been studying at the university for seven years and still hasn't obtained a bachelor's degree. His actions and words are as slow as each other, slow and careful for fear of making mistakes. However, he has one commendable point, which is that the four characters "benevolence and concession can be admired". He is always willing to take a step back in everything and is full of the spirit of sacrifice. He is able to help others and sacrifice himself. Speaking of Xiao Zhang, he only has one thing in common with Da Zhang, which is "they are both willing to sacrifice." Everything else is completely different. Xiao Zhang's thoughts are very fresh and capable, and he always puts on the posture of a "leader." At school, he beat the principal and tied up the teachers. In society, he has been challenging evil forces. They are a pair of very good brothers who never argue, but since Ju County became an occupied area, when the enemy's "heroic" (?) posture was flaunted in Ju County, Xiao Zhang changed.

When eating, Xiao Zhang often deliberately broke bowls, saying that this dish was not good, that dish was too bad, and the coarse rice was even more inedible. He really couldn't stay here any longer. He wanted to divide the family. He also said that his father said before his death that half of the land would be divided among him, and Da Zhang should settle it immediately and go their separate ways. Da Zhang saw his beloved younger brother suddenly become another person and felt very strange, but he admitted that anything was possible. He didn't think carefully about the reason for his brother's "change". He listened carefully to Xiao Zhang's lion-like roar until Xiao Zhang's anger subsided, and then he slowly said: "Fourth brother, why do you want to talk about dividing the family? You can take as much as you want. How can you rob me... When father was dying…" When he said this, tears rolled from the tip of his nose onto his ancient duck feet.

The night of March 15th was a night with a full moon. The earth was covered with a layer of silver light, which made people truly feel that "the scenery is still the same". Xiao Zhang came back bathed in the moonlight, wearing an overcoat. It was Da Zhang who greeted him with a smile.

"Fourth brother, look at such a good moonlight, it is a sign of brotherly reunion. Let's have a drink."

"Brother," Xiao Zhang's voice trembled a little, seemingly moved, "Now is not the time for us to reunite and drink. I advise you to divide the family with me immediately, otherwise it will be very unfavorable to you!"

"Otherwise, it will be very unfavorable to you!" Da Zhang didn't sleep all night, slowly thinking about his brother's words. By the time the east turned white, he seemed to have suddenly realized something.

"Fourth brother must be going to do something unruly. He is afraid of implicating me, so... so he wants to 'divide the family'!" Da Zhang said to himself. He wanted to find Xiao Zhang, but he searched all over the county and couldn't find Xiao Zhang's trace.

On the evening of the eighteenth, floating clouds covered the moonlight. Our guerrilla team launched an attack. The fire from the gun muzzles illuminated the sky red. The sparse stars looked like drunkards' faces. They first attacked the stables and killed all the horses. Without horses, the enemy's cavalry lost most of its combat power, and each one became material for making ashes. By the time reinforcements arrived, the guerrillas had disappeared without a trace.

In the square, a man in his thirties was tied up, with a white face and slender eyebrows. A "two-tael-heavy" earring hung on his left ear, and the small calligraphy brush was still inserted in the small pocket on his chest. It is said that this is the leader of the guerrillas, whose name is called "Xiao Zhang, Xiao Zhang!"

### Good News from the Education Sector

Yesterday was Teachers' Day, and the education sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon held enthusiastic celebrations in three locations. There are two particularly gratifying points worth reporting.

Firstly, over fifty schools in the Kowloon area held a solemn oath-taking ceremony for the National Covenant. For the first time, they united under the flag of the motherland, swearing absolute support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership and vowing to serve the country with all their might. It is hoped that everyone will encourage each other to earnestly put this into practice. Not only will it aid the national salvation effort today, but its benefits to the nation and society in the future will be immeasurable!

Secondly, during the Kowloon Education Festival, under the solemn leadership of Councilor Zhang Yijun, a significant proposal was passed: to send a message of appreciation and respect to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to convene a national monthly meeting, and to strengthen the unity of the education sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon, etc. This is a great declaration from the education sector, a milestone for the education sector in undertaking new tasks and implementing a new life!

### Moving Speech

During yesterday's Hong Kong district assembly commemorating Teachers' Day, Mr. Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press, delivered a speech that moved everyone present. Mr. Wang advocated that future education should primarily cultivate good citizens for the nation, not just good children for the family. This point directly addresses the shortcomings of certain ××××× education currently. We hope not only that the education sector will pay attention to this, but that enlightened parents should also patiently and earnestly persuade the general fathers and elder brothers. We must also recognize that in this era, children who only care about their own personal wealth and safety are certainly not good children, while those who can be good citizens for the country, because they can focus on the big picture and consider the long-term interests of future generations, are certainly true good children!

Mr. Wang then pointed out that future education should not only focus on students' knowledge, but also on their life and cultivation outside of the curriculum; and that it should encourage students' autonomous and proactive learning. These two points are extremely important instructions for current education. It is hoped that teachers, students, and their parents will work together to guide them, not only encouraging students to participate in legitimate patriotic and social movements, but also encouraging students to seek self-study and cultivation through seminars and gatherings. The new era requires new talents, and even more so, new education! May everyone strive hard!

### Shanghai Pudong Lun Chang Factory Incident: British National Fighting with Japanese Soldiers; × Soldiers Exceeding Authority to Interfere in Factory Disputes; Staff Members Stepped Forward to Stop It and Were Arrested

[Reuters Shanghai, 6th] A serious incident occurred in Pudong this morning. A British staff member of the British-owned Lun Chang Factory, Mr. Dingkler, was injured by Japanese soldiers and placed under "protective detention." A Japanese naval spokesman met with reporters this afternoon and stated that "the incident occurred due to a fight between striking workers and those opposing the strike at the Lun Chang Factory. Japanese naval forces intervened in this riot and dispersed the rioting workers. The British staff member of the company approached the Japanese sailors, demanding to handle the matter themselves. After the Japanese sailors refused, they fought with the Japanese sailors, attempting to remove the Japanese sailors' rifles. Dingkler fired at a certain sailor and snatched the weapon of another Japanese officer, forcing the officer to leave. He then repeatedly pointed the rifle at the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Pudong, insulting him and attempting to harm him. Dingkler was eventually disarmed, but he continued to attempt to strike, so his head was struck by a Japanese sailor," he said.

[Reuters Shanghai, 6th] Chinese workers at the Lun Chang Factory in Pudong have gone on strike. British staff member Dingkler and a Japanese officer were injured. However, British authorities are currently unaware of the exact situation. Dingkler is currently in a Japanese hospital in Pudong, and British officials are not allowed to enter.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to news from outside Shanghai, Mr. Dingkler, a British staff member of the British-owned Lun Chang Company in Pudong, was arrested by the Japanese today. According to the Japanese, Ding had shot at a certain Japanese officer with a pistol and threatened two other Japanese officers with a gun. According to another source, Chinese workers at the Lun Chang Company clashed with British staff members again yesterday. Japanese troops attempted to maintain order and therefore opened fire. Dingkler and one Japanese officer were injured. Ding is now being sent to the Japanese hospital in Pudong by the Japanese troops, and British personnel are not allowed to meet with him. As for the true situation of the incident, the British side has not yet determined it.

× Consul Protests to Britain

### British Study of Soviet Reply: No Concrete Decision; Officials Deny Negotiations Are About to Break Down; House of Commons Suggests Chamberlain Appoint Envoy to Soviet Union

[Associated Press London, 6th] According to reliable sources, the British Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee has further studied the recent proposals put forward by Moscow and concluded that a number of the proposals cannot be accepted. It is heard that the Soviet Union's demand that Britain and France guarantee the integrity of Estonia, Finland, and Latvia has been opposed by the committee, so the conclusion of the alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union cannot but be delayed. However, rumors that the negotiations for the alliance between the three countries are about to break down have been denied by officials. A spokesman for the British government also said that the British government does not wish to disregard the wishes of the Baltic countries or rashly go to war without their consent to protect the independence of those countries.

[Reuters London, 5th] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain was asked whether he would consider making a formal visit to Moscow in person. Chamberlain replied that at the present stage, he did not see that the above suggestion would be of any use. When asked whether he felt that a personal visit to the Soviet Union would be sufficient to clear up "any obstacles or unpleasant phenomena between Britain and the Soviet Union," Chamberlain did not answer.

[Central News Agency London, 5th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Chamberlain. The committee immediately studied the Soviet reply on the issue of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and considered how Britain should respond, but no concrete decision was made.

Soviet Sources in London Know the Contents of the Soviet Reply

According to Soviet sources here, the contents of the Soviet reply were to review the drafts of Britain and France article by article, either accepting them directly or making amendments. There are three most important amendments: (1) The British and French drafts mentioned the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, in order to establish the alliance and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. "The Soviet Union now suggests amending the clause as follows": Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, wishing to promote the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, have made an agreement. If so, Article 16 of the Covenant "namely, the clause on sanctions against aggressor countries, which stipulates that sanctions can only be implemented after the League of Nations Administrative Council has unanimously approved them," need not be invoked further. (2) The British and French drafts advocated that the signatory countries should consult each other. The Soviet Union believes that it is acceptable to maintain a consultation mechanism when there is no war crisis. If such a crisis occurs, action should be taken immediately, and the method should be specified in advance. (3) The British and French drafts advocated that each country should mutually guarantee each signatory country. If one of the signatory countries is invaded and requests assistance from one of the signatory countries, assistance should be given immediately. The Soviet Union believes that Finland, Latvia, and Estonia should also be guaranteed, and the names of these countries should be specified in the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Informed sources here recently stated that the British cabinet is willing to find ways to resolve the first two points. However, as for the third point, the Baltic countries do not want to accept the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This attitude cannot be ignored. At the same time, the current state of this corner of Europe must be maintained. Considering all aspects, it is extremely difficult. Generally, Britain will first conduct talks with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels in the hope of finding new ways to ensure that all relevant countries can adopt them in principle, and then formally propose new suggestions to the Soviet Union.

### Fascist Warlords Urging: Japan, Germany, and Italy Colluding

[Associated Press London, 6th] A dispatch received here today from Tokyo states that Japan is unwilling to take on more obligations in Europe unless the Soviet Union is also involved. At the same time, it is heard that Japanese warlords are still trying to bring Japan closer to Germany and Italy. It is also heard that Arisue, the Japanese military attaché in Italy, who is known as a fervent supporter of the "Axis" policy, is planning to return to Japan soon. After arriving in Japan, he will fully promote activities related to the conclusion of a "Japanese-German military alliance," because an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is about to be established. Kawabe, the Japanese military attaché in Germany, may travel to London with Arisue to consult with Kiyonami, the military attaché in Britain.

### Germany and Latvia Sign Agreements

[Central News Agency Berlin, 5th] Official news has been released that Germany has separately negotiated non-aggression pacts with Latvia and Estonia. The negotiations have been completed and will be announced here at noon on the 7th of this month. The foreign ministers of the two countries will arrive here on the 13th or 14th to hold formal signing ceremonies.
