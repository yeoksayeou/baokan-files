### Albanian War Clouds and the European Situation

The European situation is such that one wave subsides only for another to rise. Seeing these few days of dispatches, Albania is again shrouded in war clouds, and the situation is precarious.

Albania is one of the six Balkan countries, located on the western side of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering Yugoslavia to the northeast and Greece to the southeast. To the west, it faces Italy across the Adriatic Sea. Its strategic location has long earned it the reputation of being the heart of the Balkan countries. In recent years, fascist aggression has swept across Europe. Hitler has made steady progress, and Mussolini is even more eager to avoid being overshadowed. Recently, to gain the price of seeking aid from Hitler, he is urgently seeking to expand his power in the Mediterranean. Consolidating military power on the Adriatic Sea is one of the most important strategic goals. Albania is located at a crucial passage for Central European advancement southward, making it undoubtedly the leading edge of Mussolini's further aggression. Moreover, Albania possesses large amounts of undeveloped mineral resources and has oil production that has always been a target for the great powers! Furthermore, as the British government is gradually showing a tendency to actively change its foreign policy, Mussolini's launch of a military occupation of Albania can threaten its neighboring countries, Yugoslavia and Greece, preventing them from taking steps against the German-Italian axis of aggression, thereby controlling all the Balkan countries and further weakening and isolating Britain and France.

Based on the above analysis, we should recognize the following points: Firstly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania aims to seize control of the country, with particular attention to plundering its oil, while also consolidating the Adriatic Sea, thereby preparing to control and blockade British and French transportation in the Mediterranean. This move is clearly the beginning of a further offensive by Italy against Britain and France. Secondly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania simultaneously threatens Yugoslavia, Greece, and even all the Balkan Peninsula countries. Coupled with the recent chaotic dance of the shadows of Italian and German aggression in Palestine and Iraq, it clearly proves that Britain and France are already in the process of being further surrounded by fascist aggressors. Thirdly, the Italian aggressors' occupation of Albania has indeed received the active support of the German aggressors. An Associated Press dispatch from Rome on April 5 stated, "The Italian authorities have secretly mobilized naval, land, and air forces, and the army headquarters in Algiers has been transferred from Rome to Taranto. Also, a German vehicle team has been dispatched to Italian territory." At the same time, news of German reconnaissance into Denmark and the Netherlands has also appeared in various newspapers. From this, it is even more evident that although internal contradictions between Germany and Italy are developing, the axis will inevitably appear stronger and the connection will be closer in terms of aggressive actions. All arguments excessively exaggerating the division of the aggressive front are baseless. Finally, we see that the European situation has become tense again, and there is sudden news of a Soviet border conflict, which proves that the aggressors are trying to coordinate with each other from east to west. We should pay attention to the Japanese aggressors taking this opportunity to launch their military and political conspiracies in the Far East!

In response to these serious developments, we should emphasize that the international fascist aggressors' further offensives are comprehensive and total. Those threatened and harmed are all democratic and peace-loving countries, not just a few small countries. However, at the same time, we should also point out that the fascist aggressors' further offensives are aimed at the recent success of Soviet peaceful diplomacy and the strengthening of the democratic and peace-loving front. This shows that their strategic position has already degenerated to a passive tendency and proves that their offensives can be overcome and defeated! Therefore, our current task is to accelerate the unity of all forces that cherish democracy and peace and to use force to combat this new offensive by the aggressors. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on April 5, "The British government is currently considering a plan to strengthen the peace-loving front. It is reported that the plan seeks to establish a system of military strategic consultation among countries (establish an International Military Strategic Bureau)." This is certainly one of the important countermeasures to meet the current urgent needs. In addition to supporting it in principle, we should also promote the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to quickly and earnestly establish a form of international conference to deal with fascist aggressors. When using this form to resolve international disputes, we must first recognize the truth that "peace is indivisible," recognize the international nature of the fascist threat, oppose all incomplete and therefore ineffective unilateral guarantees or partial solutions, and oppose all claims that only talk about the European situation and ignore the rampant aggression of the aggressors in the Far East. Secondly, we must earnestly and practically unite all countries that cherish democracy and peace. Here, it is not enough to be satisfied with the participation of the Soviet Union alone. We must also strengthen the unity of all small countries and weak nations, and in particular, we must earnestly recognize the contribution of China, which has been bravely resisting for more than 20 months, to the world, and its important position in the current international situation. Any resolution of international disputes, especially international consultations on sanctioning fascist aggressors, if China does not participate and take into account China's current position and interests, then we can hardly imagine that there will be any satisfactory results. This is what we want to emphasize in particular, and this is what we want to make special efforts to achieve.

### Friends of China in China (I)

— Ye Juesun

Mr. Li Meng was one of the two directors of the national radio station during the People's Front government in France. At the same time, he also served as the deputy secretary-general of the propaganda department of the state-owned cabinet. He has an excellent reputation in public opinion. This time, he came to China as a special correspondent for the Paris "New Europe" magazine and the "Otto Daily" newspaper, introduced by our ambassador to Paris, Mr. Gu Weijun. Ms. Shi Meishi is a film reporter for "World's Eyes" magazine. She is the daughter of General Guo Shimei, who died on the front lines during the European War in France. She has two older brothers, one serving as a naval colonel stationed in the northern African Fenice area, and the other as an important consultant in the French government. She can marry Qi Meng, who comes from a working-class background and has not yet attended a formal university, as a woman from an aristocratic background. From this point of view, it can be imagined that her thoughts and spirit are indeed worthy of reading and admiring. They want to use words and photos to record the inhuman acts of the Japanese military in China and the heroic battles of the Chinese military and civilians against the two-way invasion. Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng firmly believe with 120,000 points of sincerity that China will inevitably achieve final victory. After the Hainan Island Incident, Li Meng wrote an article, "Hainan Island Affects the Entire Situation in the Far East." In this paper, he clearly pointed out, "Only the victory of China is the guarantee of peace in the Far East and security in the Pacific." Yes, not only are China and France the same in terms of national character, both deeply loving freedom, peace, and independence, but also in terms of diplomatic interests and geographical connections, China and France should work closely together. In Europe, since Franco came to power in Spain, France has fallen into the encirclement of fascist forces. To the east, it is threatened by Germany; to the southeast, Somoni, Hitler's ally, is waiting for an opportunity; the Mediterranean Sea to the south is even more densely covered with the forces of fascist aggressors; and to the southwest, Franco, the running dog of Germany and Italy, is barking. In French Morocco in North Africa, it is also constantly attacked by German and Italian forces. The Sicilian Island (Simlia lland) and Pantellaria Island (Pintellaria lland) in the Mediterranean Sea have caused endless trouble for Tunis (Lnnig). In the Far East, since Japan tore up the 1907 agreement on the Hainan Island issue and carried out armed occupation, it has destroyed the entire security guarantee of Annam. This is such a shocking disappearance. Less than two days after Japan occupied Hainan Island, Japan actually made a new request to France for the Panracels Islands in the northwest of Hainan Island—at the same time, we know that Siam and Japan have a kind of secret provisional agreement. Once something happens, wouldn't Annam be attacked from both sides? Therefore, as Li Bei said, "Now is the time for us to be deeply aware and truly sincere. He glanced at the naval and air force bases that we hope to build in the Far East, but the only reliable force that can truly prevent Japan from invading the South, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and attempting to control the Far East and the Pacific is the victory and independence of China. Undoubtedly, the combination of China and France is one of the great driving forces for promoting world peace. I believe that the vast majority of people in China and France already have such a deep trust. The remaining task is how to strengthen publicity and increase influence, so that every French person can deeply understand the two paths of China's resistance war are bright, only victory! Throw all the propaganda materials of Japanese imperialism in Paris into the toilet. Therefore, we welcome 'Friends of China' to China, they will surely get a full understanding of the impressions, and understand the truly great power of the Chinese nation!"

China's War of Resistance is long-term, anti-aggression, the weak against the strong, and revolutionary. Therefore, we need the sympathy and assistance of the vast masses of peace-loving people around the world. At the same time, we firmly believe that international public opinion must be on our side. Not only are the people in major countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union like this, but also many small countries in the Far East and the Near East are eagerly expecting China to win the war, regarding China as their savior for survival. According to Ma Tianying, the representative of the Islamic Near East Study Group who recently returned to China, "India, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran, and all the countries in the Near East have held seven 'China Days'. They are eager for news about China's War of Resistance, and they are waiting to welcome every Chinese person who goes to the Near East. However, there are too few people from our country who go there, and there is too much news about the war, while the Japanese are doing propaganda everywhere, shamelessly trying to please the Islamic people..." Yes. I want to repeat a sentence: We have already gained the widespread sympathy of the people all over the world. The work left here is how to communicate, connect, and increase their understanding of the actual situation in China! Therefore, we warmly welcome the "Friends of China" all over the world to China, to spread the brave history of China's War of Resistance to the world. At the same time, we must not forget the world nature of the Sino-Japanese War. The mad actions of the Japanese warlords, or rather, the aggressive behavior of international fascism, are by no means simply enemies of the 450 million Chinese people, but rather the beginning of preparing to control the world. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War may transform into the last massacre of mankind. In the process of this war, the entire world's politics, economy, and culture will enter an unprecedented dramatic change, and approach the final result of mankind, victory and glory. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War is by no means a problem limited to the East, but will deeply and inevitably affect the world. Therefore, in order to respond to the environmental needs of this great era, the unity movement of international news practitioners should be rapidly developed and firmly established. However, it is undeniable that not only with foreign countries, but also with foreign reporters in China, we do not yet have a close connection and have not achieved good cooperation. This time, reporters and Li went from South China to Northwest China together, almost defining the entire war in China. In order to raise the attention of the people to this issue, and to promote the development of the movement, I would like to make a brief record of the situation of Mr. and Mrs. Li in China.

### Why [Peace]

— Lao Ne

—The Sorrowful Words of a Refugee—

I am a refugee from North China, and I have been engaged in education for many years. Since the fall of Tianjin and Peiping, I have taken my family to the south, struggling to survive in Hong Kong for over a year. Because I don't speak Cantonese, it is a bit difficult to communicate with friends. I feel lonely sitting in my small room all day. The only thing I rely on for entertainment is reading the newspaper. Not long ago, I saw that the Hong Kong ×× Daily published a paper by Mr. Dai, titled "Give an Example." I was surprised, deeply moved, and extremely bewildered. I wanted to keep the newspaper so that I could carefully examine his intention, but unexpectedly it was torn up by my young child, and I could not translate the original text again. I studied it sentence by sentence. Fortunately, the general idea of the original text has probably spread throughout Hong Kong, so there is no need to go into detail. I originally respected Mr. Mou's foolish sincerity, but I am boldly asking for guidance.

Mr. Mou criticized, "Advocating peace is my view on national affairs." He also said, "I should do my best to advocate a realistic limit."

I do not know what is the difference between advocating peace and surrender, or what is different from submission. If seeking peace does not fear national humiliation, and after peace, it does not exist in name only but still retains territorial sovereignty and remains complete, then peace is not impossible. But may I ask, can Mr. Mou really be sure that he can do it?

If peace cannot maintain territorial sovereignty and results in losing the country and humiliating the nation, existing in name only, then is advocating peace beneficial to the country or harmful to the country? Please, Mr. Mou, calm down and think about it. Have you been fighting for the revolution for decades to get promoted and make a fortune for yourself? Or is it to fulfill what our predecessors left behind, "Devoting ourselves to the National Revolution for ten years, the goal of which is to seek freedom and equality for China"?

Also, Mr. Mou said, "What I sincerely and earnestly seek is the long-term stability of East Asia. If China and Japan fight, both will be defeated and injured. If they make peace, they will coexist."

Alas, if China and Japan fight, both will be defeated and injured. This is indeed true. But may I ask, did we start the war? Aggression has no end. Should we just sit and wait for death without resisting?

Another thing that perplexes people is "If they make peace, they will coexist." May I ask what is a country? Is its definition not a strict stipulation of the integrity of three essential elements: territory, people, and sovereignty? Suppose there is only territory and people, and sovereignty is no longer complete. Then it exists in name only. Korea is gone, but its land still exists and its people still survive. Only its sovereignty is lost. After making peace, the other side can survive, but can we still survive? What is the interpretation of the so-called coexistence?

I guess Mr. Mou's original intention is probably that he believes that continued resistance with our country's weak strength will be even more unfavorable. It is better to temporarily endure humiliation and seek peace, temporarily preserve strength, wait for an opportunity, and gradually recover.

There is some reason for this view. However, may I ask, will the other side allow us to nurture our elite forces, wait for the time to work hard, without taking precautions and putting us to death?

Also, the conclusion in the latter part is quite prescient. It is believed that in today's world, who else is there but me. Everyone knows that × is strong and we are weak. The heavy sacrifices have long been expected. However, the whole country is united in its determination to resist to the end, preferring to be shattered jade than to be complete tiles. This is because our country has had the spirit of Confucius for thousands of years, "Knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway," and "There are things that are more desirable than life, and there are things that are more detestable than death." If everyone imitates Mr. Mou, knowing that war will inevitably lead to defeat, it is better to seek peace first. Then Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa are really foolish and unachievable, while Qin Hui and Hong Chengchou are outstanding figures who know the times. Should etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and loyalty, filial piety, festival, and justice, the eight great characters, still be preserved?

Because of the word integrity, I thought of the former military officer, Mr. Wu, who lost power in Beiping and was so impoverished that he could not make a living. The × side surrounded him day and night, using coercion and inducement, trying every means to persuade him to come out of the mountains. But Mr. Wu was stubborn and unyielding. A poor and destitute military officer known for his counter-revolution had the spirit of being incorruptible in wealth, unshakable in poverty and humility, and unyielding in the face of power. But a party-state great man who started with revolution and reached the height of power actually sails with the wind and is the first to kneel. This is truly a strange thing. The revolution must first reform the heart. Confucius said, "At first, I listened to people's words and believed in their actions. Now I listen to their words and observe their actions." Hypocrisy and sophistry have existed since ancient times, and they are more prevalent today.

Also, Mr. Mou said that the Communist Party likes to make trouble.

According to what I have heard from the refugees from the north, the Eighth Route Army conducts guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas and has very good discipline. They cooperate with the people and do not commit any crimes. Moreover, they abandoned class slogans and protected local wealthy merchants and gentlemen equally. Not only that, they also properly protected foreign missionaries and pastors, not at all like the spirit of the anti-religious alliance of the previous year (opposing theocracy). So the claim that the Communist Party is making trouble is completely unfounded. If opposing peace and advocating resistance is considered making trouble, then if one wants to condemn someone, there is no shortage of excuses. And is it only the Communist Party that opposes peace? Even though this year has been more than a year, with no information, no idea of life or death, and not knowing whether they are alive or dead, and two of my sons have joined the army, there has been no news for half a year, and two of my nephews have joined the army and have already died in battle. I am saddened and cannot sleep at night, selling my belongings and borrowing money to make a living, eager for the war to end soon, hoping to return home and farm the fields, to avoid dying in a foreign land. However, I still endure the pain and do not want to hear the voice of submission and peace. Then I know that people share the same heart and the same principle. It is not just the Communist Party that opposes peace. Or, as I call it, those who are ignorant and do not understand the affairs, deeply believe that the fate of the country lies in human effort. If today's important figures had a few more Wen Tianxiangs, Lu Xiufus, and Shi Kefas, then there would still be hope for a better future. The fall of the Song and Ming dynasties was really due to the greed of the emperors and ministers at that time, and the ignorance of the people, who did not know the misery of national subjugation and regarded changing dynasties as a common occurrence. But today, there is an enlightened, decisive, steadfast, and outstanding leader above, and patriotic youths who are aware of sacrifice and regard death as returning home below. The national consciousness is unified throughout the country. This is completely different from the end of the Song and Ming dynasties. Moreover, in today's world, international relations are complex and complicated. Although we cannot rely entirely on foreign aid, it can still increase our assistance. Based on the experience of more than 20 months of war, our sacrifices have been great, and our courage is not small. What is shameful is that our weapons and personnel are lagging behind. If our warships, airplanes, and artillery were not so far apart from the other side, then we would be even more confident of winning the final victory. Therefore, at present, we must step up organization and training so that military, political, educational, and economic construction can all progress to the level of modernization, which is the level of science. Then the war situation will improve, and the other side will know the difficulty and retreat. At that time, if both sides are sincere and wholeheartedly seek a long-term stability in East Asia, it may be easier to achieve. The important thing is to be able to fight before we can talk about peace. If we cannot fight, we can never talk about peace. After Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, Mr. Mou sang of peace and said that people from both countries should work together. Then can it be said that knowing the times makes one a hero? How would the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves, the front-line soldiers who sacrificed themselves, and the rear-area civilians who sacrificed themselves feel if they knew?

### Save Hong Kong's Children

— Zhu Qizhuo

If Hong Kong has a million people, and children make up a quarter of that, then there are a huge 250,000 children in Hong Kong.

What kind of life are these 250,000 children living?

——Selling newspapers, shining shoes, doing hard labor, being enslaved, wandering...struggling on the edge of starvation, suffering painful bullying, living a dark and hopeless life, letting their golden childhood vanish like the wind, like bubbles, without a trace, what a painful reality!

What about the so-called "happy" children?

——Influenced by their families, they are instilled with "money worship" and "feudal" ideas; some are also infected by "mahjong education" and distorted family systems.

In prison-like schools, there are old teachers' scoldings and beatings, as well as tedious "sermons" that are difficult to understand and bear.

What "classical Chinese"! What "English"!… Stuffing a string of ancient people and adults' "things" into their weak minds, plus the old teacher's "serious discipline," today dictation, tomorrow recitation, covering the pure souls of children with a layer of darkness, the great creativity suffers stern blows and is declared aborted. The "happy" children, although spared the threat of material life, suffer enough spiritual abuse!

——Such children are our future masters, the future masters who we hope will continue our generation's steps to build the country. How can such masters not make people tremble with fear?

The twentieth century is the century of children; the quality of children determines the fate of a nation's rise and fall. If others snatch away our children, we must reclaim and nurture our children. "Save our children" should also be a pressing task.

Before the entire social system can be changed, we certainly do not dare to expect the children's problem to be completely and satisfactorily solved. However, there are still many ways to rescue children that can be done here and now, and action should be launched immediately:

1. Please Teachers Put Down the Whip

"Corporal punishment" is said to be a common phenomenon in Hong Kong schools. The "whip" in the old teacher's hand has changed from a "teaching tool" to an "instrument of torture." Why beat the weak children? Apart from "wildness" and "violent venting," there is no justification for it.

The excuse for implementing corporal punishment is that it "encourages good children to work harder and makes bad children aware of discipline." In fact, is there really an effect of "encouraging" and "making aware of discipline?" The executor of corporal punishment knows this best himself. Any teacher or parent with a little conscience will deeply regret it after administering corporal punishment to a child. "Encouragement" and "discipline" have other educational methods to follow. Today, the strategy of "corporal punishment" can no longer be used. The Ministry of Education's report on the abolition of corporal punishment is the crystallization of research and experimentation by national experts and progressive schools and teachers. It is a model that anyone educating children should carefully study and diligently practice. The government's repeated orders to ban corporal punishment are also laws that every school and every teacher should absolutely obey.

Those who stubbornly cling to their prejudices and cannot overcome their bad tempers may put on a stern face and come up with seemingly reasonable reasons to protest: "Theory says so, but you don't know the difficulties in reality—some children really have to be beaten sometimes!" However, the author has lived among children for many years and does not feel that way. I don't know how many educational pioneers have been able to practice character cultivation and gradual guidance! The author pleads for children and sincerely hopes that those who believe "corporal punishment is useful" will humbly observe how progressive teachers treat children and how they obtain spiritual comfort, and then read the Ministry of Education's report on the abolition of corporal punishment to study whether it can be implemented. At that time, they will definitely resolutely "put down the whip and immediately become a good teacher." If they still stubbornly insist that "corporal punishment is necessary," then they must frankly admit: "I have no way to teach children," not that "children must be beaten."

The harm that corporal punishment does to children's physiology and psychology is too shallow to be discussed! To save children, the first thing to do is to eliminate the greatest enemy of children! Ignorant parents may not be able to do this universally, but "please teachers put down the whip" should not be a problem, right?

2. Don't Teach Children Things They Can't Understand

After the children are freed from the torture of the whip, next, we hope that the teachers will not teach the children things they cannot understand. Like the "profound" "classical Chinese" and "English"… It really makes the children more and more confused as they read. What does child-centered education mean? What do curriculum standards tell us? Teachers must not ruin the future of their students, nor must they be afraid of the nation's crisis. Teaching classical Chinese and English is said to be "adapting to the environment," which certainly has its merits. However, "adaptation" should have a limit! Moreover, "adapting to the environment" is not the ultimate goal of education, but a means to "transform the environment." White powder can kill people, and killing people without shedding blood is even more terrible. How should the manipulator handle things carefully! Teachers are like wielding a knife in their hands. Are they killing the children around them, or opening a path for the children to move forward? This is something that teachers must decide for themselves. I sincerely hope that our teachers will save our children!

3. Launch a Spiritual Food Movement for Children

Children have curiosity and a strong desire for knowledge. The monotonous and boring textbooks in schools are certainly not enough to meet the children's needs. If there is no progressive teacher to guide the reading of beneficial children's books, they will undoubtedly drill into "comic books." Being addicted to "comic books" is already a common phenomenon and a serious problem. This bad influence really makes people with good intentions feel heartbroken!

In response to this serious fact, there is a great need to launch a spiritual food movement for children. All progressive teachers, writers, artists, and the press should unite to bear the responsibility for this long-neglected but significant movement. In addition to improving the quality and strengthening the existing children's publications (especially comic books), children's newspapers, children's paintings, new comic books, children's periodicals, children's plays, etc. should all appear with a brand-new look, so that the majority of children can obtain fresh and progressive spiritual food.

4. Let Children Grow Up in Collectives

Children are not the private property of their parents, nor are they toys that can be monopolized. They belong to society, to the nation. Therefore, they need to grow up in collectives.

The New An Travel Troupe, the Shanghai Children's Theater Troupe, the Xiamen Children's Theater Troupe… These progressive children's organizations have indeed shown amazing achievements in the crucible of the collective. The children's nurseries and student associations in Hong Kong are also large groups of children. If they are strengthened, how great a role will they play? I sincerely hope that the teachers and student associations of various schools will not hesitate to make every effort to bring all the children in Hong Kong and Kowloon under the unified leadership of children's organizations, to live a collective life and grow up in the collective. Children's organizations have already done a lot of work for children in the past and have a glorious history. In the future, in addition to further developing collective reading movements, health movements, and national salvation movements… It is also necessary to implement a Young Pioneer system, so that school children can take on the daily tasks they should bear, to educate children in the neighborhoods, and to connect and unite with British children in Hong Kong and children friends at home and abroad. What a meaningful movement this would be!

British children in Hong Kong have already joined hands with children from children's nurseries; the implementation of the Young Pioneer system is also a popular movement in the mainland; national and global children's correspondence, under the advocacy of the National Central University Experimental School, has also set a precedent. It is hoped that the children of Hong Kong will also be vigilant in the sound of the anti-Japanese war in the mainland and catch up with the great and progressive motherland, which also needs such masters.

The scope of saving children is very broad; the four points mentioned above are only the minimum actions that should be started and can be started at this time and in this place. These small opinions are very ordinary; I also hope that they can "draw jade" by "throwing a brick." The author, at his own risk, put them forward, and the motive is only this. I deeply hope that our children can be rescued from the anger of the great era.

### Our Army in Guangdong Province Fights Back Valiantly, Announcing Victories on All Fronts, Recapturing Jiangmen. Our Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb Enemy Troops in Sanshui and Guangzhou. The Situation in Jiangxi is Stable, and the Enemy in Shandong Province is Stirring.

[Our Newspaper Tokyo, 6th Guangdong Telegram] After recapturing Xin'an, we continued to recapture Jiangmen. Our troops in northern Guangdong are advancing on all fronts, and the battle situation is intense, creating an unprecedented major victory since June.

[Central News Agency Sihui, 7th Dispatch] Our troops counterattacking Jiangmen are making rapid progress. A vanguard of plainclothes soldiers charged into the city center at 8:00 AM on the 6th. The main force followed, and the enemy fled in panic to Tangxia. We pursued and killed more than 200 enemy soldiers, and countless were wounded. Many spoils of war were seized, and Jiangmen was officially recaptured by us. A small unit of the enemy attacking Xinhui was surrounded and annihilated by us due to their inability to retreat.

[Central News Agency Guilin, 7th Dispatch] Our army on the southern front has been fighting back valiantly for days, announcing victories on all fronts. On the 5th, we victoriously recaptured Xinhui. On the evening of the 3rd, we victoriously recaptured Jiujiang, Shaping, and Xin'an Street. At the same time, Guanbu, Dashijiaxu in the northeast of Sanshui, Yangcun in the south of Huaxian, and other places were also occupied by us.

[Central News Agency Guilin, 7th Dispatch] On the evening of the 9th, 200-300 enemy soldiers crossed the river towards Mamuwan (south of Conghua), and 600 enemy soldiers also crossed the river at Mumian. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army in the Shima Mountain area. On the same night, a unit of enemy soldiers also arrived at Jiekou in Conghua. Suddenly, the sound of gunfire was very dense, and it was reported that they had made contact with an assault team from our division.

[Central News Agency Sihui, 7th Dispatch] After we recaptured Guanbu, we continued to attack the Fengyong, Yaotang, and Jinshan Temple areas. At 4:00 AM on the 6th, we advanced to the vicinity of Fengyong and Yangcun. At 9:00 AM, the enemy sent a team of more than 200 soldiers from the Yunshan area, along with a tank unit and eight armored vehicles, along the highway to Zengbu. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with us in the Baishaqiao and Daxiaogang areas.

[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 7th Dispatch] On the Huaxian front, our army advanced south along the Yuehan Railway at noon on the 6th. In the evening, we once attacked Jiangcun, and the fighting with the enemy was very fierce. At night, because the enemy used many cannons to form a fire net and attacked us fiercely, we withdrew and held firm in the area north of Jiangcun. At the same time, our army had conquered all the strongholds west of the highway between Xin'an Street and Huaxian. This morning, we are besieging and annihilating the remaining enemy entrenched in Yushagang and the Overseas Chinese Memorial Hall. Our assault troops launched an attack on the enemy barracks in Hengtan and Maotang villages on the evening of the 5th. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 6th, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. We once recovered the above-mentioned areas, but due to terrain limitations, we automatically withdrew to our original positions. The enemy in Longkou Village, after our fierce attack, stubbornly resisted with fierce artillery fire and sent troops to attack us from the flanks. At noon on the 6th, a unit of more than 400 enemy infantry and cavalry, under the cover of aircraft, entered the Shidong area (northeast of Huaxian) via Pingshan and Lianglong Huaxian City to contain our army in Xin'an Street. They were intercepted by our army, and after a fierce battle until dusk, the enemy was defeated and retreated to Huanghuai in the southeast. In this battle, more than 30 enemy soldiers were killed. This morning, our army continued to advance towards Longkou Village.

[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Guangdong, 7th Dispatch] On the morning of the 5th, a squadron of our planes flew to Guangzhou for reconnaissance and circled over the city several times, but did not drop bombs. The enemy was extremely panicked, and more than a thousand enemy merchants, women, children, and wounded soldiers in the urban area fled in disarray. Guangzhou is now under martial law. The enemy took the opportunity to search for military supplies and looted property, which was even worse than before, and people were in a state of panic.

[Central News Agency Sihui, 7th Dispatch] At 9:00 AM today, several squadrons of our air force suddenly appeared over Sanshui Nanhai and bombed the enemy positions fiercely. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. Our air force heroes completed their mission and flew back calmly.

More Than a Thousand Enemy Soldiers Annihilated in Southern Shanxi

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Special Telegram] Shaanxi Telegram: Enemy troops from Shanxi, attacking south from Zhangjiadian, were annihilated by us with more than a thousand casualties, and retreated to Yuncheng and Xiaxian Shuitouzhen to take up defensive positions.

Jinjiang Across the River Confrontation

### The Military Affairs Commission Releases a Weekly War Report (Continued from Yesterday)

Henan Province

The battles in Henan Province are more intense in the Xinyang area. Our army surrounded the county seat on three sides last week, and the enemy's retreat route has been cut off. This week, the enemy increased reinforcements by one or two thousand, along with many cannons and aircraft, and launched a counterattack against us in separate routes. The two sides repeatedly engaged in unprecedented fierce battles near the county seat at Luotuodian, Shizipo, and Yugukou. After suffering losses, the enemy indiscriminately released poison gas, but all failed. Currently, the outposts in the four suburbs of the city are still in our hands, and all traffic in all directions has been completely cut off by us. The enemy, who stubbornly resisted in the city, is in a state of being trapped in a jar. As for the enemy in eastern Henan, this week, they once joined forces with the puppet army of Cao Wenchen to attack Shicao, west of Luyi. After our counterattack, we achieved a victory, killing more than 200 enemy and puppet soldiers. The puppet army leader Zhang Wenchen and more than a hundred others were captured. The enemy in Yuanwu, northern Henan, numbering four to five hundred, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the southwest on the morning of the 1st and engaged in fierce fighting with us. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the road that night. There has been no further movement as of yet. Also, at Sanzhongzhai, the enemy forcibly recruited civilians to block the mouths of the tunnels. On the morning of the 2nd, our army launched a courageous attack, and the workers bravely responded, attacking from both inside and outside, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy showed signs of fleeing east.

Other Areas

In addition, (1) In the Tongling Qingyang area of southern Anhui, the fierce battles between our and enemy armies are still very intense.

### Enemy Casualties Increase Sharply After We Expand Mobile Warfare. Nineteen High-Ranking Enemy Officers Killed. We Will Surely Win in the War of Attrition. Important Statistics from the Jin-Sui War Zone.

[Central News Agency Yuji, 6th Dispatch] The responsible agency of a certain war zone recently released various statistics since the start of the war.

In northern Shanxi and Suiyuan, at Yanmenguan, Datong, Tianzhen, Pingxingguan, Longjiaoling, Xinkou (including Yuanping), Niangziguan, Taiyuan, and Ganhuling, in eight positional battles, the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 2.3 to 1.

In thirty-five city attacks, twenty-four were successful and fifteen were failures. In five counterattacks (in the area of Hanhouling Tanqu), in thirty-two fortified attacks, the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 1.4 to 1.

In fighting against the enemy on the march, from March 27 to February of this year, there were twelve larger battles and twenty-nine smaller battles. The ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 3 to 5.

In mobile battles above the regiment level, there were a total of nine hundred and fifty-one from March 27 to March 18 of this year, and two thousand three hundred and twenty-two below the regiment level. In one hundred and thirty-two large-scale night raids, ninety-four were successful and thirty-eight were unsuccessful. The ratio of our casualties to the enemy's was 1 to 4.

Nineteen enemy officers above the rank of major were killed, including Major General Miura Toshiji, commander of the 21st Regiment of the 5th Division (Xinkou), Major General Uemura Yoshio, commander of the 40th Brigade of the 20th Division (Quhou), a field marshal (title unknown, Zhongtiaoshan), Colonel Saeki, commander of the Engineers Regiment (Jun County), Colonel Shinzou Yu, commander of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Division (Qikou), Colonel Kaido Akira, commander of the 123rd Regiment of the 108th Division (Lingshi), Colonel Ishida Kin, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (Liulin), Colonel, commander of the Field Artillery Regiment (name unknown, Wangwushan), Lieutenant Colonel Takeshima Hitoshi, commander of the Battalion of the 20th Division (Pindin), Lieutenant Colonel Okazaki Tsutanosuke, commander of the Battalion of the 105th Regiment of the 108th Division (Gaoping), Lieutenant Colonel Naruse Kotobuki, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (location unknown), Lieutenant Colonel Tanimura Bunma, commander of the Battalion of the Field Artillery Regiment (Xinkou), Lieutenant Colonel Toshihayashi Heichiro, commander of the Battalion of the Field Artillery Regiment of the 108th Division (Niangziguan), Major Motoura, commander of the 18th Cavalry Regiment (Lushi), Major Fuji Kunitaro, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division (location unknown), Major Sata Ai, commander of the 78th Regiment of the 20th Division (Nankou), Major Yamade Taitsune, commander of the Battalion of the 14th Division (Lushi), Major Ozaku Heiga, commander of the Independent Machine Gun Unit of the 14th Division (Lushi), Major Takahashi Habun, commander of the 77th Regiment of the 20th Division (Nankou), totaling three generals, five colonels, five lieutenant colonels, and six majors. According to the above statistics, the most noteworthy is the dramatic change in the ratio of our casualties to the enemy's. Before March 27, in positional warfare, we sacrificed twenty-three people to kill one enemy soldier. After March, due to mobile warfare and fortified attacks, we sacrificed 1.4 people to kill one enemy soldier. In fighting on the march, we sacrificed three people to kill five enemy soldiers. In night raids, for every one person we sacrificed, the enemy suffered four casualties. We are constantly replenishing our strength and engaging in long-term warfare with the increasingly weakened enemy. The difference in these figures will continue to increase. It can be asserted that if we continue to support the war of attrition and deplete the enemy's strength, the enemy will inevitably fail.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Students of the Army University and Delivers a Personal Admonishment During the Meeting.

### Anti-War Riots Within the Enemy Army. The Wife of a Captain Commits Suicide as a Result. A Japanese Newspaper Unintentionally Reveals the Truth.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] According to a foreigner who recently arrived from Tokyo, anti-war riots within the enemy army are frequently heard of and are indeed true. However, their scale is still small and lacks coordination, so they cannot become a powerful action. The enemy is extremely secretive and strictly prohibits newspapers from publishing such news, so few people know about it. However, there is evidence to prove that this statement is not fictitious. In a report in the Osaka Asahi Newspaper on February 10 concerning the suicide of the wife of Captain Hayashi Yuichi, it was said that the reason was that her husband was fighting on the front lines, and many of his subordinates were killed or wounded. Moreover, some of his subordinates had experienced a certain incident, for which her husband was responsible, and she felt deeply burdened by it, so she decided to encourage him with her death. The so-called "certain incident" refers to anti-war riots. This is a secret that the enemy newspaper unintentionally revealed.

[Civil Revolutionary Society Yuji, 7th Dispatch] It is reported that enemy youths, in opposition to the invasion of China, have secretly fled from Tsushima Island to the Soviet Union in large numbers every day. Professor Kawai of the Imperial University claimed that the anti-war alliance in the enemy country is a large organization, and the conflicts between the right-wing and the young officers are also fierce. According to his observation, in July and August of this year, the working masses of Japan may take action to overthrow the Japanese government.

### Japan Rejects French Protest Over Forcibly Occupying Storm Island. The French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Today.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] Tokyo Telegram: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the French Ambassador to Japan visited the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in the third quarter of this year to protest against Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands. The protest has been rejected. When asked by reporters whether Japan would submit the matter to arbitration, the Japanese spokesman said that since Japan has already occupied the islands, it is naturally impossible to arbitrate.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] Shanghai News: French Ambassador Cosme, who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the French ship "D'Artagnan", is scheduled to arrive tomorrow afternoon.

### Italy Commences Armed Invasion of Albania: Troops Land in Several Locations; Anti-Italian Demonstrations Continue Throughout the Day in Albania

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] An official agency here issued a communique today stating that Italian land and naval forces have taken offensive action against Albania. Italian troops left Brindisi and Bari last night, heading directly for Albania. The First Naval Fleet has been patrolling the Albanian coast between Saseno, Quaranta, and Mantu since dawn yesterday. The air force has also been ordered to mobilize. Italian ships in Durazzo and Valona have transported hundreds of Italians, including many women and children, back to Italy. The communique explains the situation, stating, "In recent days, the Italian government has been negotiating with King Zog of Albania to conclude a new agreement, but armed demonstrations in Tirana and elsewhere have endangered the lives of Italian nationals in Albania." It is reported that the Italian forces participating in the invasion of Albania consist of three divisions, approximately 35,000 men, while the Albanian standing army consists of only 12,000 men, making resistance difficult. According to a semi-official source, Italian troops have landed in Valona, Durazzo, and Mantu. It is worth noting that Italian troops have begun penetrating the Albanian interior, supported by 400 aircraft. However, they have been ordered not to attack residential areas.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 7th] According to official reports from here, Italian troops landed in the port of Durazzo in Albania on Friday morning and have already occupied the city.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Speaking in the House of Commons this morning on the Albanian issue, Chamberlain said that according to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Italian interests have been threatened. To his knowledge, "an Italian cruiser and two warships arrived in Durazzo this morning. The government is closely monitoring the development of this situation. Although Britain does not have direct interests in Albania, it has a broad interest in world peace." Chamberlain stated that he had not yet learned the purpose of the Italian warships' mission. Regarding the Italian concentration of troops in Bari or Brindisi, he had not yet received any information. Chamberlain concluded by saying that he had not received detailed information from Albania regarding the purpose of the ongoing negotiations with Italy. He had received a communication from the Albanian side denying that it had accepted conditions that contradicted its sovereignty and national integrity.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] Authoritarian nations are now embarking on new adventures. Italian warships are positioned along the Albanian coast, prepared for action. Britain has taken the following resolute retaliatory measures to resist such threats: (1) Britain has concluded a military defense alliance with Poland; (2) Three Nazi officials threatened German refugees who had emigrated to Britain, forcing them to hand over their property. The British government has expelled the Nazi officials; (3) The British government is preparing to hold negotiations with Romania to conclude a counter-aggression agreement.

[Reuters, Tirana, 7th] Anti-Italian demonstrations continued throughout the day here. Parliament, in session, declared that Italy's demands were unacceptable. This afternoon, 29 Italian aircraft flew over the capital, immediately triggering a large-scale demonstration by people in front of the Parliament, the Royal Palace, and foreign embassies. Demonstrators declared that Italian troops could only occupy their country after their death. The government has mobilized 26,000 men.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The Albanian Embassy here issued a communique today, reiterating its determination to oppose the violation of Albania's independence and the landing of troops on its territory. The communique stated that the 1927 Italo-Albanian defense alliance did not provide Italy with a pretext to interfere in Albania under the guise of maintaining order. Therefore, the assertion that Italy had changed its stance should not be believed.

[Associated Press, Rome, 6th] According to official sources here, after Albania indicated that if Italy infringed upon Albanian territory, the King would abdicate and the people would unanimously resist, a compromise between Italy and Albania may be possible. Sources indicate that an agreement may be reached that respects Albanian territory. However, it is generally pointed out that if negotiations are unduly prolonged, Mussolini is prepared to take swift action.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Goes Fishing in Scotland; Reported in the House of Commons the Day Before on Hudson's Success in Visiting Northeast Europe

Chamberlain will leave London tonight for a fishing vacation in Scotland but will remain in close contact with the government and can return to London quickly if necessary.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Debates Sino-Japanese Issue; Johnson Opposes Cash-and-Carry System; Stimson Urges Improvement of Far East Relations

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today heatedly debated the Sino-Japanese war issue. Senator Borah said, "I am not entirely opposed to the 'cash-and-carry' system, but under this system, we are unfairly treating China and benefiting Japan." Senator Johnson stated, "I oppose the 'cash-and-carry' system because it would make us an ally of Japan in the Pacific and an ally of Britain in the Atlantic." Pittman urged the government to adopt the "cash-and-carry" system, stating that it would not change the current situation in the Sino-Japanese war. Baruch, responding to a question from Senator Hiram Johnson, said that cutting off the supply of iron ore to Japan would not be a practical form of aid.

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] US economic expert Baruch said today in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, "One cannot hope to maintain peace for long with a country subjected to economic oppression, for the nature of economic sanctions is extremely dangerous. If it fails, it will inevitably provoke war. Moreover, if an aggressor is determined to invade, economic pressure will hardly prevent the outbreak of conflict. If other countries have already begun to fight and the United States remains neutral, the 'cash-and-carry' system is most appropriate, as it avoids affecting the principles of neutrality laws. To say that Americans do not wish to fight even if their interests in the Western Hemisphere are threatened is a gross misrepresentation. Germany has already made this mistake. I firmly believe that the United States and the Western Hemisphere can avoid being drawn into European conflicts without burying their heads in the sand while loudly protesting against breaches of faith and acts of brutality." Baruch, who previously served as Chairman of the War Industries Board under President Wilson in 1918 and is now an advisor to President Roosevelt, stated that since true neutrality has become an unattainable ideal, the best course of action for the United States is to avoid becoming embroiled in war, treat belligerents fairly, and prevent economic collapse. If the American people believe they can protect the Western Hemisphere, then the argument for economic warfare will disappear. Baruch concluded by saying that world commerce, which originally flourished for peace and development, has now declined due to constant restrictions, tariffs, and other barriers. Secretary of State Hull is seeking to promote the prosperity of world trade, but current neutrality laws threaten to hinder this progress.

[Associated Press, New York, 6th] The Non-Participation Committee, led by former Secretary of State Stimson, today attacked Senator Pittman's proposed amendment to the neutrality laws, for the following reasons: (1) Pittman's proposal would make the United States the primary supplier of essential military supplies to Japan, so the constraints of neutrality laws would be less than they are now; (2) This would weaken China's reliance on foreign aid to obtain supplies and would prevent the United States from providing loans to China; (3) This would gradually weaken American commercial and cultural interests in China and the Pacific. The committee sent a letter to Senator Pittman, urging him to take necessary steps to improve relations in the Far East.

### Soviet Deputy Defense Minister's Important Speech: Prepared to Deal with Any Eventuality; Not Concerned About External Threats

His passing completes the work of a great statesman and patriot. With the help of his virtuous wife, he led all of Australia in a successful recovery. His death today was due to overwork and is truly regrettable."

A Brief Commentary

### The Siyi Save-Our-Homeland Movement

As the war in Jiangmen unfolds, the situation in Taishan, Xinhui, Enping, Kaiping, and the surrounding areas of Zhongshan and Heshan has suddenly become critical. Merchants from various towns and cities have successively launched a Save-Our-Homeland movement. The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry has established an account yesterday. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce is also meeting today to discuss aiding displaced citizens. The Heshan Chamber of Commerce has sent four representatives back to the area for urgent consultations. The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed overseas Chinese calling for the establishment of relief organizations.

Currently, the most important tasks of the Save-Our-Homeland movement are fundraising to provide disaster relief and mobilizing the people to protect their hometowns.

First, regarding overseas fundraising, we offer the following suggestions: First, it must be done in a planned and organized manner; a unified approach is essential; second, key figures must not only have strong confidence in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction but also possess high moral character and integrity; they must be respected by the government, local people, and overseas compatriots; third, all donations, large and small, must be publicly announced in a legitimate manner and deposited in reputable banks; fourth, funds should be used where they are most urgently needed, and administrative expenses should be kept to a minimum.

Second, regarding disaster relief for refugees and orphaned children, we believe that in addition to passive rescue efforts, it is essential to focus on active assistance, namely, implementing the reception, organization, and education of refugees and orphaned children, so that the vast number of refugees and orphaned children can contribute their efforts to the great cause of the War of Resistance, saving their hometown, and national reconstruction.

As for mobilizing the people to defend their homeland, this is the most urgent task at the current stage. First, domestically, under the leadership of the government, the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline should be universally implemented, and political mobilization work should be carried out as much as possible so that military-civilian cooperation can repel the enemy before they arrive; even when the enemy is approaching, evacuation and guerrilla warfare can be arranged calmly, avoiding the phenomenon of chaotic escapes and deaths. However, to achieve this, the realization of democratic politics is essential, including the establishment of local public opinion organs, the improvement of mobilization agencies and lower-level political organizations, and the appropriate improvement of people's livelihoods. Second, overseas, in addition to working hard to raise funds, overseas Chinese organizations and patriotic individuals should intensify efforts to mobilize young and promising overseas Chinese to return home to serve. To achieve this, the United Front of Overseas Chinese must be strengthened and developed. Everyone must put aside their differences and prejudices, trust each other, and help each other.

The birthplace of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, is under the threat of enemy aircraft and soldiers. Every Guangdong compatriot and Chinese citizen should implement the century-old benevolence with all our heart to defend the sacred land, to protect the homeland of our Father of the Nation, and to safeguard our own fields, houses, factories, shops, and all our property!

### A Glimpse of Albania

— Dong Ping

I.

Mussolini swallowed Abyssinia and found it a bit indigestible, not worth the effort. So now he has turned his gaze 45 degrees and wants to seize Albania. Of course, this is not an accident; everything has its historical background and current circumstances.

The Axis powers' conspiracy is always a give-and-take, creating a fluctuating situation on the world stage. I remember that when Italy invaded Abyssinia, all countries condemned it unanimously and advocated for sanctions, forcing Mussolini to restrain himself somewhat. But as soon as that subsided, Hitler immediately seized the opportunity to rise up and march into the Rhineland, tearing up the Treaty of Versailles. This situation has been repeated until today. Just as Germany is surrounded by the anti-German front of democratic countries and forced to retreat slightly, Italy has stepped in again, at the very least forcing Chamberlain to busy himself again.

The future of the situation is gradually unfolding. We would like to provide some information on Albania as a reference for future prospects.

II.

Albania is located on the western border of the Balkan Peninsula. It covers an area of ​​approximately 17,000 square miles. It is surrounded by Yugoslavia to the northeast, bordered by Greece to the south, and faces the Adriatic Sea to the west, separated from Italy by only 85 miles.

Most of the country is rugged mountains and deep ravines. Flat land is scarce, with only a narrow strip along the coast. The land is not as barren as imagined, but because the Albanians have historically neglected farming, much of it is desolate. Their traditional occupation is nomadic herding, and they are now gradually moving towards handicrafts.

Albania is a fairly young country, established in 1913 after the First Balkan War. As early as the 9th century, the area was under Bulgarian influence, and in the 15th century, it was seized and ruled by Turkey. This continued for four or five hundred years until the First Balkan War in 1913. With the support of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was able to declare independence and formally establish a country, with the German Prince William of Wied as king.

When the Great War broke out, neighboring countries invaded one after another, and the country fell into chaos. Britain, France, and Russia even signed a secret agreement to divide Albania. In 1917, Italy took the opportunity to send troops to Albania, ordering the Albanians to form a republic under Italian protection. In 1920, the League of Nations formally recognized Italy's protectorate, but in 1925, all countries recognized Albania as an independent republic. However, in 1926, it was changed back to an Italian protectorate. Finally, in 1938, Italy recognized Albania as a kingdom, with the former president, Zog, becoming king. At the same time, Italy's protectorate was abolished.

Although this protectorate changed back and forth, in reality, everything in Albania was no different from being an Italian protectorate. The country's resources and minerals were all in Italian hands. Military and political power was in the hands of those willing to be puppets. In this way, it is difficult for Albania to do anything if Italy wants to take action. Therefore, it is rumored that the Albanian king originally intended to surrender, but now with the support of Britain and France, perhaps there will be some way. But can London's reach be swift enough? (To be continued)

### Who Has No Native Village? Hong Kong's Various District Chambers of Commerce Launch Rescue Hometown Movements One After Another; The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry Resolved Yesterday to Urgently Form a Relief Committee; The Heshan Chamber of Commerce Sent Four Representatives Back to the County to Handle Emergency Relief

After the Jiangmen battle began, Kaiping, Xinhui, Enping, Taishan, Siyi, and Zhongshan, Heshan and other counties fell into a state of tension. Previously, they suffered from rice shortages and the poor were starving. Now, coupled with the disasters of war, the people in the war zones have been scattered and displaced. The situation is even more tragic. Overseas Chinese from various counties in Hong Kong, feeling deeply for the suffering of their hometowns, have now launched rescue hometown movements one after another. For this reason, the Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry convened a special meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday to discuss the implementation methods. They immediately established the Siyi Relief Committee. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to meet today to discuss relief methods. As for the Heshan overseas Chinese, they have also sent four representatives back to their hometown to handle emergency relief. The Xinhui Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to overseas Chinese in Zhouyi yesterday, appealing for help. The details are as follows:

Siyi Chamber of Commerce Met Yesterday to Discuss Relief

The Siyi Chamber of Commerce and Industry convened a meeting at 3 pm yesterday to discuss relief for their hometowns. More than 20 people attended, including Chairman Yu Zhuosheng, Directors Qu Sen, Zhang Lanzhou, Zhou Xingchi, and Lei Yin. After the meeting began, the chairman announced the reason for the meeting and then reported that the central government had allocated 20,000 yuan and discussed how to allocate it. Liu Yuyun, Zhang Lanzhou and others spoke successively, all saying that the disaster was serious, and 20,000 yuan was just a drop in the bucket. They should continue to find ways to raise more funds. On the one hand, they should send people back to investigate the detailed situation so as to plan, etc. According to the above opinions, Zhang Lanzhou and Liu Yuyun were sent to Macau to investigate. After the investigation, they would jointly form the Siyi Relief Committee in Hong Kong with overseas Chinese from Siyi, and report the Siyi disaster situation to Acting Chairman Shi Ying, requesting his assistance in handling it and begging him to allocate more relief funds to facilitate relief. On the one hand, the chairmen of the various county chambers of commerce sent telegrams to overseas Chinese groups in their respective counties, reporting the disaster situation and urging them to send money back to provide relief immediately. Regarding the organization of the relief committee, Lei Zisun was immediately appointed as the drafting committee member, and Zhang Lanzhou, Liu Yuyun, Wu Yaoyun, and Zhou Xingchi as the preparatory committee members. Then, Zhou Xingchi proposed that the Joint Relief Association had previously handled the economic difficulties of refugees in Shenzhen and still had some relief rice left. This relief rice is still stored in Hong Kong. Now, many refugees fleeing from Siyi are flowing to Macau, suffering from hunger and cold, and urgently need relief. Can we ask the Joint Relief Association to move this rice out for distribution? The public agreed, and it was decided to send a letter to the Joint Relief Association to request it.

Heshan Representatives Rush Back to County for Relief

With the Jiangmen stalemate, the counties of Siyi are under immediate tension. Heshan has become the front line of the South China war. Overseas Chinese from Heshan in Hong Kong are extremely concerned about the suffering of their hometown. The day before yesterday (6th), a special meeting was held at the Hong Kong Heshan Chamber of Commerce to discuss emergency relief measures. It was decided to send 10,000 yuan in national currency back to the county for emergency relief. Yesterday morning (7th), four representatives were sent back to Heshan via an indirect route to engage in relief work. The representatives will return to Hong Kong as soon as their work is completed. As for the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, it is currently raising funds for emergency relief. In addition to trying to settle refugees in Macau, it also sent a telegram to overseas Chinese in Fanshi, Canada, Asia, and other ports yesterday, asking them to quickly send money back to Hong Kong for relief. The telegram said: "Our county is in danger, the military and civilians are bravely resisting, and refugees are everywhere. Please send money for relief immediately." It is found that there are many overseas Chinese from the county in the United States. If they can work together and raise huge sums of money, it will not be difficult.

Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Holds Meeting to Discuss Further Plans

Overseas Chinese in Cuba have enthusiastically donated funds to return to the country. Currently, they have remitted funds for national salvation bonds, Guangdong national defense bonds, and relief for refugees. Recently, overseas Chinese from Zhongshan in Cuba raised more than 10,000 yuan to relieve refugees in their hometown and sent three representatives, Kuang He, Huang Shaoshen, and Mo Dashao, to Hong Kong to handle the matter. The representatives have arrived in Hong Kong for many days and have allocated 5,000 yuan to the Overseas Zhongshan Compatriots Relief Association in Hong Kong to handle relief. For this reason, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce believes that with the current war in Jiangmen and the tense situation in Zhongshan, relief work is urgent. It has specifically scheduled a meeting at 3 pm today at the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce to discuss further work and invite Kuang and other representatives to report on the fundraising situation in Cuba.

Thousands of Refugees Have Fled to Macau

According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, many refugees from Siyi have fled to Macau after the fall of Jiangmen. A portion of them have relatives in Macau who can take them in. However, those who have nowhere to live or have relatives in Hong Kong but lack the travel expenses and the 20 yuan entry guarantee fee have no choice but to wander in Macau. It is found that many refugees are gathered in various ancestral halls and temples in Macau. According to unofficial statistics, at least 3,000 refugees from Siyi have fled to Macau. Also, since the start of the battle at Tingmen, the traffic between Jiangmen and Macau has been cut off. The supply of vegetables and food that Hong Kong residents rely on for transportation and sustenance has been interrupted for a time. However, vegetables and fresh meat are still being transported because towns near Jiangmen, such as Zhanzhen, Shiqi, Xiaolan, Shunde, Jiangwei, and Gulao, are still able to change transportation routes and use the smallest waterways to directly transport goods to Macau and then to Hong Kong by boat. Because there are not many goods coming in, the prices are very expensive, especially fresh meat.

Postal Service in Siyi Has Been Suspended

Jiangmen is the outlet for all counties in Siyi. Since the war broke out there, the situation in Siyi has become tense. People from the counties in Hong Kong want to get accurate news from their hometowns and have sent letters and telegrams home to inquire. Last week, the Hong Kong Post Office still accepted mail to Jiangmen and Siyi because it had not received confirmation of the fall of Jiangmen, but it was not responsible for whether and when they would arrive. Recently, the local war has become increasingly tense. According to a reporter's investigation, the Hong Kong Post Office has recently announced that it has stopped accepting mail and postal remittances to Jiangmen and Siyi. It is not known when the receipt and delivery will resume. As for the banks in Hong Kong, which previously had dealings and remittances with banks in Jiangmen, they have also temporarily suspended remittances.

### Overseas Vietnamese Boy Scout Service Corps Returns to the Country Again to Serve; More Than 70 Members Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday One After Another; Bringing Back a Large Amount of Medicines to Depart for the War Zone During the Day

Overseas Vietnamese Chinese youth boy scouts, concerned about the national crisis, have specifically organized a battlefield service corps to return to the country to serve. More than 50 members of the first batch returned to the country the year before last to participate in the Battle of Huizhou in Dongjiang, moving in the hail of bullets. Because of the dangerous work, the losses were quite large. After returning to Vietnam for replenishment, the corps immediately gathered comrades from the youth league branches in various provinces in Vietnam, gave them considerable training, and selected 84 qualified male members and 6 female members. Deputy Corps Leader Zhang Lupeng led 15 members to Hong Kong a few days ago. Yesterday (7th), when the Pacific Wheel arrived, Corps Leader Lin Luying and Organization Director Wu Bingji led 60 male and female members to Hong Kong, stationed in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

It is found that the corps has brought back a large batch of medicines and military supplies this time, which were donated by the Annam National Salvation Association, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Qifu Guild Hall, the Kuomintang Vietnam Branch, and the Annam Branch of the Overseas Chinese War of Resistance Mobilization Association, as well as various overseas Chinese groups. Vietnamese people in the country have also enthusiastically supported them.

### Many People Traveled to Macau During the Four-Day Easter Holiday; Hong Kong Ferries Were Crowded and Macau Hotels Were Fully Booked; Happy Valley Used the Osmanthus Season for Two Days of Major Horse Racing

Yesterday was the annual Easter holiday. Government offices and major commercial banks in Hong Kong all had a four-day holiday starting yesterday. Usually, people in Hong Kong who get several long vacations either return to their hometowns to worship the graves of their ancestors or go to the provinces and Macau for sightseeing. However, this year, Guangdong is being ravaged by Japanese troops. Those who have fallen cannot return, and those who are still in our army are either in war zones where the flames of war are raging, lamenting that they cannot travel. Therefore, those who do not dare to forget their ancestors can only wait for the recovery of the mountains and rivers before fulfilling their filial piety.

Many People Travel to Macau During the Holiday

However, it is not appropriate to waste the four-day holiday. Therefore, there is only one way to go to Macau. Macau is also known as the second Monte Carlo of the East. The singing, dancing, wine, and women are pleasant everywhere. Those who have been working hard physically and mentally all year round can get a moment of pleasure in this place of recreation. Therefore, many people who get a holiday go on trips in groups. Fearing that there would be more demand than supply for accommodation, many people had someone reserve rooms in advance a few days ago to avoid being rejected at the last minute. High-end hotels in Macau such as "Li Wei Fang", "Dongya", "Central", "Wuzhou" etc. had all their rooms fully booked before the 5th. The Xian and Jiaotong ships that departed for Macau on the afternoon of the 8th were already crowded to the point where there was no space.

Unprecedented Crowding on Hong Kong-Macau Ships

The Taishan and Haojiang ships that departed yesterday morning were even more crowded. Before 7 o'clock, the docks and the sides of the ships were already so crowded that it was impossible to squeeze through. Unless one had reserved a seat a few days ago, it was impossible to board the stern or the hold. The Xian and Jiaotong ships that departed in the afternoon were still just as crowded. Because there are many people from government offices and major commercial banks in Hong Kong on holiday, and no fewer than 10,000 to 20,000 people are going to Macau for leisure. In addition, those who have to travel between Hong Kong and Macau for business and private affairs are even more difficult to count.

Christian Union Commemoration

Christian groups in Hong Kong jointly held a service commemorating Jesus's martyrdom at 11:30 am yesterday in an open space opposite Peace Cinema on Nathan Road, Kowloon. Salvation Army Commander Da Bi preached. At 8:30 am on the morning of the 10th, a service commemorating Christ's resurrection will be held at the Jia Lulu Mountain Huaqiu Stadium, where Dr. Wen Yuan, Secretary-General of the National Association of Chinese Christians, will preach.

Happy Valley Horse Racing Today

The Hong Kong Jockey Club is taking advantage of the holiday to hold horse racing for two days. From today and next Sunday, horses will be running from 12 noon to 12:30 pm, with two races, followed by a lunch break, and then racing again at 2:30 pm. There will be a total of ten races each day. In addition to the spring horse racing, this one is larger in scale. Jockey Li Wen fell from his horse and was injured on the first day of horse racing. Fortunately, he was treated by a Chinese doctor and fully recovered in just five weeks, and he will resume his work on horseback today. There is also a Zunchen, the son of the old foreman of Jardine Matheson, who, although a junior jockey, has good skills and has won many times in Shanghai. He will also have an excellent performance today.

### Giant Fishing Boat Burned and Robbed on XXX Waters; Only the Boat Owner Escaped by Swimming

Recently, Japanese warships have frequently wreaked havoc outside Hong Kong. On the 3rd of this month, another large fishing boat was looted by a Japanese warship in the waters of XXX and then set on fire. Of the eight crew members, only the boat owner escaped. The rest were killed, with losses amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. It is learned that the victim, Zhang Lao (30 years old), was working in the waters of XXX at about 2 pm on the 3rd of this month when a Japanese warship suddenly came roaring forward. Zhang and others were shocked and hurriedly turned to escape. Seeing the boat leaving, the Japanese warship fired several warning shots and chased after it, ordering it to stop. Seeing the fierce approach of the Japanese warship, Zhang and others dared not disobey and surrendered. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese warship approached, it shot and killed Zhang's wife. Then, it sent XX sailors swarming over Zhang's boat. First, they tied everyone up, pushed them to the bottom of the boat, and carried all the fresh fish on the boat to the Japanese warship without leaving anything behind. Zhang was tied to the stern. After looting, the Japanese warship dragged the boat out of the waters of Dan Gan Shan and poured electric fluid on it, set it on fire, and sailed away. The whole boat caught fire in an instant, and XXX was buried in deep water. Zhang desperately untied the rope and swam to escape. He floated in the sea for several hours before being rescued by a cargo boat passing by and towed back to Hong Kong. The loss this time amounted to more than 10,000 yuan.

### Shattering the Traitor Theory of Surrender and Subjugation: The Newborn China (Part 2)

— Qi Zhuo

Ms. Wang Ying Speaking at the Young Women's Christian Association

The above describes the situation on the front lines and in the countryside. Now, let me talk about a city we just passed through:

Guangxi has mobilized more than 500,000 soldiers to the front lines; it can continue to mobilize up to 2 million more. Women compatriots are very active in Guangxi, opening shops, working, women's militia training, everything seen is the brave and hardworking attitude of women.

The student army in Guangxi is also great. When Guangzhou fell and pessimism, wavering, and defeatist sentiments spread for a while, the Guangxi student army originally planned to recruit 1,200 people, but 11,000 people applied. If you said to him or her, "You're too young!", he would lie to you, "No, I'm 18 years old - I'm 20 years old!" Such a firm answer.

When they are training, they are really practicing combat, as if they are facing a great enemy.

The civil servants are also very clean. Everyone wears a set of cloth clothes, and the salary is very low, but the spirit is very admirable.

...Merchants Who Hate Traitors

It is even more interesting to talk about the merchants' hatred of traitors. Once, one of our group members went to a shop to buy gunpowder, preparing to use it as artillery fire to perform the "Battle of Taierzhuang." The shopkeeper told our comrade to wait, and he quietly went to inform a group of policemen to arrest him - saying that if he was not a traitor, why would he buy gunpowder? After many explanations, the arrested comrade was released, but the shopkeeper still didn't believe it and sold us gunpowder that didn't work. When it didn't catch fire on stage, we were really anxious! The next day, we personally went to the shop to explain the details and invited him to watch the play. He realized that this was for saving the country, so he quickly sent a lot of real gunpowder. How touching is this patriotic merchant who hates traitors - is this progressive fact of the common people not one of thousands?

Guilin was the most tragic city after being crazily bombed by the Japanese. At least two-thirds of the houses were turned into rubble. However, the people of Guangxi calmly responded. When Japanese planes came, they ran to the caves. When the Japanese planes left, they picked out some usable utensils from a scorched earth and built reed mats. After two or three days, business was resumed. Not only did it not shake their faith, and there was no pessimism. And it strengthened the anger of common hatred. As for commerce, it is as prosperous as usual. This prosperity is not the prosperity of the city, but the prosperity that symbolizes that China has infinite hope.

...Admirable Air Force Soldiers

Speaking of the army, the most advanced is the air force. Many of my friends are in the air force, and we are often together, so I know it in detail. They are all strong and handsome. In Hengyang, they once used one plane to fight against twenty-seven Japanese planes, and as a result, they shot down two Japanese planes, and they themselves were injured and forced to land.

When it was most dangerous, he was unwilling to parachute to escape, but insisted on colliding with the Japanese plane, causing them to perish together. When they set off to bomb the Japanese warships, they had already written their wills, using their own bodies, using their own planes, and heroically destroying the Japanese warships, showing the Japanese our Chinese nation's soul with a heroic sacrifice.

In Luoyang, I saw that when our aviation personnel took off to chase Japanese planes, none of them had any expression, only silence. This silence is not a sad silence, but a resolute silence. They didn't speak, and they had already decided in their hearts that they would never come back.

...The Optimism of the Soldiers

From the overall military situation, the quality of our army has made rapid progress.

On the front lines, I often saw soldiers lying down in the haystack to sleep during air raids. When the Japanese planes left, they picked up their machine guns and marched while singing and laughing, showing a very optimistic state of mind. If anyone said to our soldiers and people on the front lines that they wanted to make peace with the Japanese, he would immediately be hit mercilessly. As long as you have been to the front lines, you will definitely not be able to say the word "peace." China's ambition can only be believed if you have seen it with your own eyes.

...The Battle Situation After the Fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan

On the surface, it seems that we are very difficult after the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou. In fact, only because of the fall, we have changed from a passive position to an active position: before the fall, we had to accumulate a lot of strength at a central point and wait for the Japanese to attack with superior artillery fire. Now, when we attack a point, the Japanese have to fight back at that point, making him stuck in the mud and not knowing what to do. The cities occupied by the Japanese have absolutely no way to walk ten or twenty miles. This is a true fact in many cities.

In many cities, our entire military and civilians withdrew and let the Japanese enter. Then, we surrounded the Japanese from all directions, making the Japanese feel deeply difficult. If the Japanese reinforcements arrive, it will form a stalemate. Some people become frustrated and pessimistic after hearing about the loss of a city. This is completely because they do not know the real situation. What we are fighting for is not points and lines, but the entire surface. To win the victory of the all-out war of resistance, we must not divide men and women, old and young, or divide north and south, east and west. Military, political, economic, and cultural must all be all-out war of resistance.

...The Japanese Are At The End Of Their Rope

The Japanese's dream was initially to win without fighting. After we fought without surrendering, it was changed to a quick battle and quick decision. After we insisted on the war of resistance, it was changed to a quick peace and quick decision. After the serious blow of our resistance to the end, they talked about a hundred-year war to prop up their faces. This is a symbol of the Japanese's exhaustion. We will never stop this war until we drive the Japanese out of our territory. It is also absolutely possible to drive the Japanese out of our territory.

...Contribute Everything To The Motherland

Finally, I want to end with a story: In France, a juggler and a preacher went to a small chapel. The juggler desperately somersaulted and played combat methods in the auditorium. The preacher asked him why he did this? He said proudly: I have no other ability to contribute to God, all I have is my profession of somersaulting and playing tricks, in order to express his sincere and reverence for God.

Like this story, I myself use drama to dedicate to the motherland. You are the same, everyone has his own position and can serve the motherland.

When we came to Hong Kong this time, we often heard some friends say: "We are very ashamed in Hong Kong. We are really not as good as you who serve on the front lines." In fact, working in Hong Kong is equally important. We also admire the hardworking comrades. Goodbye.

——Everyone was very moved and followed "Goodbye" to disperse. But they still seemed reluctant to leave. These examples are living examples, not the "examples" cited by Wang Jingwei for Konoe. Excitement and emotion occupy the individual's mood and actively dominate everyone's future behavior. (End of continuation)

### Women's Disaster Relief Association Holds Welcome Meeting for the China National Salvation Drama Troupe at the Kyoto Hotel Yesterday - A Meeting of Comrades, a Meeting for Work!

— Huo Xi

Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Hong Kong China Women's Disaster Relief Association held a tea party to welcome all the members of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. All twenty-four of them (with a few absent due to other commitments), men, women, and children, including generals who had participated in the War of Resistance, all arrived punctually in neat and simple new attire, full of energy.

The venue was the grand ballroom on the sixth floor of the Kyoto Hotel, also a delicately decorated dance hall. The elegant musical instruments were still placed on the central platform. To the eyes of these workers from the front lines, accustomed to the broken houses and thatched huts of the front lines, this was simply another world. However, the hosts intended to make the comrades of the troupe feel comfortable and relaxed, as a small token of their appreciation.

More than ten hosts from the Women's Disaster Relief Association, the twenty-four members of the drama troupe, and over ten distinguished guests from the cultural, film, and drama circles, such as Cai Chusheng and Li Jianwu, attended the welcome. Everyone gathered around a rectangular table. Chairman Liu Qingxuan gave a sincere speech:

"Since our Sacred War of Resistance began twenty months ago, whether on the front lines or in the rear, all of our outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and those who refuse to be slaves of a conquered nation, have united to participate in the War of Resistance and diligently engage in various salvation efforts. This demonstrates that our Chinese nation will never perish, and it further demonstrates that our War of Resistance will ultimately be victorious. This time, the China National Salvation Drama Troupe, to expand publicity and advocate for the soldiers on the front lines, has decided to go abroad for propaganda. Passing through Hong Kong, we received letters of introduction from Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, which allowed us to understand more deeply the efforts and dedication of the troupe and its leaders: Mr. Jin Shan, Ms. Wang Ying, and Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the Guangdong Student Army, are among the bravest and most dedicated workers. In the future, their overseas promotion will undoubtedly have immeasurable effects. Besides admiration and inspiration, we also hope that we will work together with one heart and unite to cooperate and complete the great task of building our nation as soon as possible."

After the chairman's speech, she invited the head of the drama troupe, Mr. Jin Shan, to speak, and Mr. Fu Guang was invited to translate it into Cantonese:

"Before we arrived in Hong Kong, we had long admired the patriotism of the Hong Kong China Women's Disaster Relief Association. Generals Li and Bai had spoken of your efforts. General Yu Hanmou sent a ambulance this time to transport us from Shaoguan to Chaoan. This large vehicle was a donation from the Women's Disaster Relief Association. We feel ashamed and fortunate. We should express our gratitude here.

"Our meeting this time is a meeting of comrades, a meeting for work. Our trip abroad for propaganda is a pre-planned and consistent effort. If the War of Resistance is not victorious, our work will not stop. Although our time to stay in Hong Kong for sorting and preparation is only one or two months, we will not give up our responsibility here. If the Women's Disaster Relief Association and other salvation groups need us to do any work, we will do our best, because our mission is the same goal.

"The first goal of our trip abroad is to tell our allies about our vivid experiences over the past year, explaining that China will absolutely not perish; to tell our overseas compatriots that their past efforts to contribute money and effort will absolutely not be in vain, and will surely be rewarded in the future.

"Secondly, we want to mobilize more overseas compatriots to actively transport supplies and donate funds back to the country to establish military hospitals and nurse vehicles. That's why I say that meeting with the comrades of the Women's Disaster Relief Association is a meeting of comrades, a meeting for work. It is very appropriate. In the future, we hope to have more contact in our work."

Mr. Jin Shan's speech was followed by Mr. Lin Shu, who spoke in Cantonese: "We received cotton vests and comfort bags donated by women's organizations at the front line, which were very much needed and greatly appreciated. The ambulance I took when I was wounded was also donated by your women's organizations. I deeply feel that the blood of the front lines and the sweat of the rear will converge and bloom into the flower of freedom for the Chinese nation." – The whole audience applauded in agreement. Mr. Mu used his experience in the War of Resistance to explain that final victory will surely be achieved.

Ms. Wang Ying also gave a speech, which was translated by Mr. Fu Guang. Ms. Wang gave an impassioned speech about the relationship between the War of Resistance and women. The main point was: Now our women and men are participating together in the sacred work of the War of Resistance. The problem of women being bound and oppressed for more than 5,000 years can be solved. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we women can achieve true liberation and complete liberation. This is a very correct and insightful point of view, and I hope that female compatriots who demand liberation will keep it firmly in mind.

Mr. Cai Chusheng was also warmly welcomed to express his views. After summarizing the opinions of the previous three speakers, he hoped that enlightened women would mobilize women from all walks of life and awaken the group that is indulging in a life of pleasure and death. He also said that we should learn from the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. They are fighting on the front lines, and we must be their rearguard, working together hand in hand.

Mr. Li Jianwu said that in the past, most movie stars were despised because they lived a decadent life. However, the two stars, Jin Shan and Wang Ying, not only did not go along with the tide, but also kicked away a comfortable life with progressive thinking, creating a path for the film industry and fighting hard to save the country from destruction. This spirit is not only worthy of admiration by the general film and drama industry, but also deserves deep gratitude from our cultural workers.

After that, Fan Zheng, a child from the Salvation Drama Troupe, reported on the progress of the children's movement in the country. He is from the Northeast and is only thirteen years old this year. He has traveled many places and done many jobs in the New An Travel Troupe. He looks very innocent and lively, and speaks accurate and fluent Mandarin. This young warrior's thoughts, attitude, spirit… all aroused people's interest and deeply moved them. The atmosphere of the whole venue also became lively and warm, which is a symbol of the unlimited bright future of the Chinese nation.

Finally, Ms. Liu Qingxuan gave a reply, expressing her gratitude and stating her willingness to do her best to help the National Salvation Drama Troupe and establish close ties with the troupe in their work.

Even if they were tired, everyone was still chatting and encouraging each other, calling themselves outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. A meeting of comrades, a meeting for work, this was a rare opportunity.

### War Situation in the Lower Reaches of the Xijiang River: Counter-Offensives Launched Everywhere; Hui City Recaptured on the 5th; Taishan Guanghai Gradually Tightening; Our Forces Pursue the Victory and Engage in Fierce Battles in Ningyang; Shaping Has Been Recaptured; Longkou Remains in Our Hands

[Macau Special Dispatch] Since the enemy troops occupied Jiangmen and Xinhui, they have continued to transfer a large number of troops from the Guangzhou-Sanshui route to advance towards Taishan and Shaping, attempting to occupy Enping to control the southern route. They have also dispatched more than twenty large and small enemy warships to sail to Taishan Guanghai, and at the same time sent multiple aircraft to bombard Taishan wildly, attempting to force our military authorities into submission with the power of their naval, land, and air forces. Our military authorities, aware of the enemy's plot, have also actively dispatched various units to meet them on separate routes.

Recapturing Hui City When our troops withdrew from Hui City, they gathered in the suburban gentry lands to prepare for a counter-offensive. On the 4th, our reinforcements arrived and immediately joined forces with the Guangxi Army and the Fifth District Guerrilla Regiment to launch a counter-offensive against Hui City. At 2 PM that afternoon, they engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy at Gangguifeng Mountain. After a three-hour battle, many enemies were killed, and the enemy, unable to withstand the assault, retreated towards Hui City. Our troops simultaneously recaptured Yulesheng Dushan. On the 5th, our forces jointly besieged Hui City, with one route advancing eastward along the Ningyang Road and another route advancing southward along the Gangchuan Road, attacking Hui City from both front and rear. The enemy stubbornly resisted at the northeast railway station, resulting in a fierce battle. Our troops engaged in close combat, bravely charging forward. By 7 PM, we had captured the east station in one fell swoop. Because the enemy was unfamiliar with the terrain, their formation was in chaos. Our troops rushed into Hui City and engaged in street fighting throughout the night. The enemy retreated in confusion towards the Ningyang and Huazhan area. Hui City was then recaptured by our troops, who are still resisting in the north station area.

Chaos in Jiangmen In the vicinity of Jiangmen, our troops have engaged in fierce battles in Shuanglong, Jiaotou, Baolian Gang, Zini, Diaoyutai, and the Jiang-Foshan Road area for several days. The battles on the 4th and 5th were particularly intense, especially in Jiaotou. Many houses in these areas were destroyed by artillery fire, and corpses were scattered everywhere. It is estimated that the enemy has deployed more than a thousand vehicles and aircraft. According to refugees from Jiangmen seeking refuge in Hong Kong, who were hired by the enemy to move corpses, the number of enemy corpses left in Jiangmen was extremely large. The enemy troops were unable to clean them up, so they went around pulling in three to four hundred of our civilians to transport the corpses for them, transporting more than eight hundred bodies to Guangzhou for cremation. Fierce battles are still ongoing. The Jiaotou militia has always been known for their bravery. Previously, an enemy unit of about a hundred men, led by a lieutenant, detoured through Tangxia and Jiaotou to Jiangmen. Our Jiaotou team, stationed in both places, had more than six hundred men. They had set up ambushes in four directions in advance. When the enemy troops passed by, they did not make a sound. After the enemy troops had reached the appropriate location, they quickly launched an attack together. It was midnight, and the enemy was terrified. We then used hand grenades and bayonets to engage in close combat, capturing ninety-nine men on the spot. The rest were killed, and no one survived. In this battle, an estimated three hundred enemy soldiers were annihilated, and more than two hundred rifles, five machine guns, three small steel mortars, and countless bullets were captured. Japanese Ichiro, the captain of the Jinze team, was also killed.

Recent Situation in Shaping Before the enemy entered Shaping, our villagers, filled with righteous indignation, rose up to resist the enemy and donated all the pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks in their homes to the defense forces to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Our troops were all extraordinarily motivated, vowing to fight the enemy to the death. They soon recaptured Shaping. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in Shaping and could not gain a foothold. Longkou has never been captured by the enemy.

Taishan is Becoming Tense The situation in Taishan is also tense. On the 5th, enemy warships in Guanghai agitated towards Chixi, Xinhui, and cruised and spied outside Hutiaomen and Anmenkou. However, because our authorities had tightly blockaded Yamen in advance, the warships could not sail up the river, and the enemy ships retreated, not daring to act rashly. The enemy's ambitions have not diminished, and they have transferred enemy warships back to Taishan. As of the 6th, there were more than twenty enemy warships, dozens of speedboats, and armed fishing boats nesting in the waters of Chikan, Taishan, patrolling and spying, looking for an opportunity to land. At around 4 PM on the 6th, more than ten enemy speedboats, carrying hundreds of enemy soldiers, used enemy warship artillery fire as cover to advance south along the Nanhai Shadi coast, attempting to cross our defense line and land. Our coastal guards and security teams used machine guns and artillery to form a human net and bravely counterattack, engaging in a fierce sea battle with the enemy. The enemy boats could not get closer, but their ambition to land did not diminish slightly, and the situation was extraordinarily serious.

### Our Guerrilla Team Attacks the Street Edge Station; Enemy Soldiers Wake Up in a Dream, But It's Too Late; Flames Soar, Enemy Camp Burned Down

[Nanhai Quick News] The enemy troops entrenched along the Guangzhou-Sanshui line and the Foshan-Zhaoqing line, due to the tense war situation, continued to transfer to Dalang, Ronggui, Jiangmen, and other places to provide reinforcements. Therefore, the enemy's defenses there were extremely empty. Our guerrilla team nearby took the opportunity to actively contain the enemy. In recent days, they have been dispatched from their hidden locations to attack the teams, attacking the enemy. On the night of the 2nd of this month, the spring was full of atmosphere and the cold wind was bitter. More than 200 members of our guerrilla team, lurking near the streets and manning by the female captain Suo Qin (i.e. Blind Qin), stealthily approached the street edge station in the dark. When they arrived, each team placed dozens of loads of wood and grass soaked with large amounts of kerosene near the station. At a signal, they not only set the fire, but also used machine guns and hand grenades to sweep the dense enemy camp. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the enemy soldiers woke up from their dreams in panic. Because the north wind was strong, the fire spread rapidly, and the enemy camp was burned down in an instant. The enemy soldiers fled in panic, and our ambush troops lurking nearby also rose up to engage in close combat with the enemy. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy troops stationed in Zhangcha heard the news and dispatched troops to reinforce them. When they arrived, our guerrilla team had already retreated calmly. In this battle, in addition to destroying the street edge station and an enemy camp, capturing several long and short guns and enemy flags, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed and burned. Our guerrilla team also made eight heroic sacrifices.

### Reclamation of Nanshan Has Achieved Results; Education and Agriculture Have Both Improved; Receiving Refugees is Underway

[Shantou Quick News] Nanshan is a military reclamation area. Since Huang Duanru took over as the director of the administration, he has been actively rectifying idle reclamation, afforestation, animal husbandry, and mining, with remarkable results. Yesterday, the director came to Shantou on official business. When our reporter heard the news, he made a special visit to ask about the situation of managing the reclamation of Nanshan. Director Huang gave a detailed account, which is recorded as follows: Mr. Huang said that regarding the start of Nanshan, after I took office, the work I started can be roughly divided into three aspects: (1) reclamation and rectification of agriculture, (2) rectification of education, (3) receiving refugees. Regarding the reclamation business, after several industrialists went to inspect it recently, two companies have been formally established and started operations, reclaiming, afforestation, animal husbandry, and mining, with a capital of about 200,000 yuan each. The rectification of the agricultural industry is urged by the administration to increase the rice fields of farmers by more than a thousand acres. If the weather is favorable, the early rice harvest this year can increase by several thousand dans, which is a great help to the local food supply. In terms of education, many rural primary schools and short-term primary schools were closed in the past. After I took office, I considered education in the rear during the war to be very important, and urgently requested the provincial government to allocate funds. After the provincial government approved it, I started to rectify it, and all have been restored. At present, there are 42 rural primary schools, 16 short-term schools, and one middle school in the entire district. This middle school did not have dormitories in the past. After I took office, I was determined to build them. Now, I am designing and raising funds, and construction has already started, so as to accommodate refugees. Recently, I received an order from the provincial government to find ways to accommodate a number of refugees, but due to business relations, I can only accommodate one-third of them for the time being. Among those who are accommodated, I will set up jobs to make them engage in reclamation.

### After the Recapture of Shaping, the Traitors are Strictly Arrested; More Than One Hundred and Twenty People Captured

[Shiki Quick News] After our army recaptured Shaping, in addition to actively deploying defenses, monitoring the threat from Jiujiang, and suppressing the enemy, we also hired workers to start to organize the town's appearance, and to comfort the displaced people. At the same time, because shameless traitors were hiding in the town, Commander Deng Jun was afraid that they would harm the country and the village again, so he ordered a strict arrest. As of the evening of the 5th, more than one hundred and twenty people were arrested, and they were escorted by the defense army to the headquarters of the XXX Army for interrogation and strict punishment.

### The Municipal Overseas Chinese Puppet Chamber of Commerce Forcibly Collects Security Donations; Citizens Angrily Riot and Destroy the Puppet Association

[Panyu Quick News] After the Shiqiao puppet Chamber of Commerce was established, it was ordered by the enemy to pay five hundred yuan in military pay every day. The Chamber of Commerce then forced all stores in the city to pay two yuan in tax every day, euphemistically calling it "security donation." The people of Shiqiao were very frustrated because business was very sluggish and they were closing down one after another. For a time, 70-80% of the stores in Shiqiao closed. The puppet Chamber of Commerce could not collect security donations, and the enemy was pressing hard. He, the chairman of the puppet Chamber of Commerce, could not afford to let it go, so he convened a meeting of puppet committee members and business representatives on the 2nd of this month to discuss a solution. The merchants and people were angry. Huang and Dai, Hua merchants from the Xin Chang Copper and Iron Shop and the Xiang Ji Restaurant in the city, were particularly angry. They hid sharp weapons and went to the meeting. During the meeting, they pulled out the sharp weapons and stabbed the puppets who were present. The order was disrupted. Huang and Dai took the opportunity to escape from the back garden of the association. By the time the enemy soldiers arrived, they could not be captured. It is reported that four or five members of the puppet Chamber of Commerce were injured, including He and Li, and more than six hundred yuan was lost.

### Yuan Dai Talks About the Tranquility of Various Places in Zhongshan; The Fall of Xiaolan and the Landing at Dieshi are Not Confirmed

[Xiaolan Quick News] Since the bloody battle in Xinhui began, the enemy has tried to contain us by harassing various places in the ninth district of Zhongshan, Dahuangpu in the third district, and Xiaolan. However, our defenses are very solid, preventing the enemy from succeeding. In recent days, all parts of the county have been very peaceful. Our reporter met Yuan Dai, the commander of the mobile team of the first district, yesterday. According to him, since Jiangmen fell, the ninth and third districts of Zhongshan have been adjacent to Xinhui and Shunde, so they have been slightly affected. However, the guerrilla defenses of Zhongshan are well-organized, so the enemy cannot take advantage of them. Every time the enemy raids, they are defeated by our teams and cannot succeed. The recent rumors that enemy shallow ships sailed from Wugui Hill to Dieshi, sent troops to land, and attempted to invade Shiqi are all false. They are actually rumors made by shameless traitors. At that time, because the enemy was attacking Jiangmen, enemy ships were cruising here for cover, and then they immediately sailed back to the Tianhe River. It is even more ridiculous to say that Xiaolan has fallen. Previously, the enemy troops stationed in Dongma Ning once sent troops to invade, but they were bravely blocked by our teams and immediately retreated, leaving countless corpses behind. At present, various places in Zhongshan, such as Dahuangpu, Huanggang, Xiaolan, Guzhen, and Dieshi, are very quiet, and the enemy does not dare to disturb them. There are also no enemy ships in the waters of Tangjiawan and Hongao. Water and land transportation in Xiaolan, Shiqi, and Qiguan Road is also as usual.

### Amidst the General Counter-Offensive of Guangdong, Our Eastern Route is Making Full Progress; The Three Routes of Counter-Offensive in Dongguan Cut Off the Connection Between Wan and Tai; Artillery Exerts its Power to Cover the Army's Advance to Zengcheng; Our Air Force Displays Great Power and Fiercely Bombs Enemy Positions and Enemy Ships

[Dongjiang Quick News] The military counter-offensive in Guangdong Province, after five months of preparation, has matured. According to military sources, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, with all military forces properly deployed, issued an order for a full-scale general counter-offensive yesterday evening, the 5th, directing all the major armies on the east, west, and north routes to advance towards Guangzhou, and ordering the Fifth Attack Detachment Commander to supervise the attack detachments, cooperate with the masses to launch widespread guerrilla warfare, and assist the regular army in the counter-offensive. The commanders of the north route, Yu Hanmou and Ye Zhao, the commander-in-chief of the west route, Xia Wei and Deng Longguang, and the commanders of the east route, Wu Qiwu and Ou Zhen, were ordered to lead their respective armies, with Guangzhou as their target, to attack the enemy entrenched in Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng, Sanshui, and Dongguan. On the north route, our army had captured important strongholds such as Xinjie in the county, Taipingchang in Conghua, Nan'an, Shijiao, and Yangcun by the evening of the 6th. On the west route, our army had also crossed the river on multiple routes on the morning of the 6th to counter-attack Sanshui, capturing Guanyao. All the above routes have made great progress. On the east route, our army, relying on Luofu Mountain, pounced on Zengcheng, with the force of bamboo, drumming bravely westward. The force is strong and the momentum is strong. The situation of the full-scale general offensive is changing rapidly, and there will be even greater performances in the near future to comfort our Guangdong people. Now, the report of the East Route Army is recorded as follows:

Our Army Counter-Attacks Dongguan on Three Routes

Upon receiving the general offensive order, the commanders of the east route, Wu Qiwu and Ou Zhen, immediately supervised their troops and vehicles to advance towards Dongguan County. On the south bank of the Dongjiang River, the central army's Wu troops, the independent detachment of the Fourth District Guerrilla Team's Yuan troops, and the third battalion of the Second District Guerrilla Column's Luo troops were divided into three routes to attack the enemy in Dongguan, Shilong, and Taiping. Huo Rongji, the commander of the Dongjiang South Bank, Wang Ruozhou, the commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, and Zhang Wodong had already mobilized and set off overnight on the 5th to supervise the battle on the front line. Another staff officer, Deng Xiang, was sent to be responsible for the liaison between the various military forces. It is now found that our army has obliquely exited the Ling Mountain and Xiashanmen, directly approaching Chiling, destroying the Tai-Gong highway, and cutting off the connection between Dongguan and Taiping in order to cut off the enemy's rear. The left wing exited Huangsonggang and Xiaobian, destroying the Bao-Tai highway and suppressing Taiping. The right wing occupied the west side of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and advanced towards the Nanshe and Chashan area. It has broken through the enemy's alert line. Another unit crossed the north bank of the Dongjiang River, crossed Masi, and went south to attack Youlong from both sides. At the same time, it also blocked the Qishi River in the lower reaches of Dongguan to prevent the enemy from using it to advance eastward, and sent hundreds of commando reconnaissance team members to mix into Shizhai, Taiping, and Dongguan to respond to our army's counter-attack. On the evening of the 4th and 5th, our commando team had carried out many activities, using large hand grenades to kill dozens of enemy soldiers and traitors. On the evening of the 6th, the vanguard of our army had reached the enemy's defense line and made contact, and a great battle was imminent.

Crossing the Zeng River and Assaulting Zengcheng

According to front-line military reports, the main force of Wu Qiwu's army on the east route had all joined the front line, and the foothills of Luofu Mountain were filled with our counter-attacking army, launching an offensive and advancing towards Zengcheng step by step. The commander of the Third Attack Column, Luo Fengxiang, and the commander of the Dongjiang Special Operations Team, Liang Xia, also dispatched Lin Junsheng's troops along the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway, occupying the Zhuguling line, six miles northeast of Zengcheng, and carrying out active ambush attacks to respond to the attack on the enemy. On the 3rd, the enemy in the Hulong area attached to Zengcheng tried to break through our encirclement line, and sent more than 200 infantry and cavalry, with two cannons, to attack the Hulu Hill where our army was stationed. It was severely attacked by a regiment of the 12th Army Group guarding the area, and the remnant enemy retreated to Zengcheng. Now our army is sweeping forward, seeking to eliminate the stubborn enemy in one fell swoop. In recent days, plainclothes teams have been sent out to mix into the Snake Ridge and Guanyin Pavilion in the suburbs of Zengcheng to contain our army's counter-attack. On the 4th and 5th, the artillery positions of our army in the east of the Zeng River and the foothills of Luofu Mountain exerted their power, firing artillery towards the enemy in Zengcheng all day long, covering our army's crossing of the Zeng River and advancing towards Zengcheng. The enemy also fired artillery to resist stubbornly, so a fierce artillery battle broke out. Our army's spirit is strong and the battle is fierce. It is said that the enemy in Zengcheng has become panicked, concentrating its main force in the suburbs, preparing to defend stubbornly.

Our New Air Force Displays Great Power

The Air Force, which has come south to assist in the counter-offensive, has launched many attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and establishing miraculous achievements. After our general offensive order was issued on the 6th, it became even more active. On the 5th, ten of our aircraft flew to Dongguan, Taiping, Shilong, Shitan and other places, and with acute postures, fiercely bombed the enemy's positions at various points, dropping twenty or thirty bombs, destroying most of the enemy's positions. The greatest effect was achieved in Shitan and Shilong. Whenever our aircraft flew over Dongguan, the enemy troops in various places were frightened and fled in panic, not daring to resist. Our aircraft slowly circled and selected the target, accurately dropping bombs. On the morning of the 6th, another squadron of our aircraft went to the waters of Humen and Taiping to hunt down enemy ships. At that time, more than ten enemy ships and boats were gathering in the waters of Humen Dachan. As soon as they saw our aircraft, they fled and released smoke screens to cover their escape. Our pilots immediately observed clearly and flew low to drop bombs, continuing to drop more than a dozen bombs in about a minute, destroying an enemy ship and two enemy armed fishing boats, achieving great results. After our army completed its mission, it flew back to its position.

Film and Drama

### First Round New Movie Introduction - Floating Life Like a Dream

— Yun

Frank Capra's "Secrets of the Louvre" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," we shouldn't be unfamiliar with them, right? Now, "You Can't Take It With You" is another one of his works. There are many characters in the entire drama, and the acting opportunities are also very evenly distributed. The general idea of the plot is about a family. The grandfather, Wen Chihe (played by Lionel Barrymore), is an old man who used to do business and has accumulated wealth. Because he suddenly feels that he lacks the true meaning of life in the arena where he runs for fame and fortune all day long, he retires to his hometown and lives with his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughters to enjoy his old age. His daughter, Ni, is typing non-stop all day long. She seems very busy, but she does not aspire to be a famous writer. The reason why she types is simply because someone mistakenly sent her a typewriter eight years ago, and she just likes to use it. Her husband, Paul, tirelessly studies firework manufacturing methods, and his comrade, Di Pina (played by Halliwell Hobbes), both work hard, not because they can sell them, but simply because this is their interest. The granddaughter, Bian Miao (played by Ann Miller), stays at home every day, never taking off her dance shoes. She has never been and has no hope of performing on stage in the past, but she still hired a former boxing instructor (played by Mischa Auer) to guide her in dancing. Her husband also doesn't go out to work, and spends all day studying printing and playing the dulcimer. Among such a crazy and silly family, only one has a job, which is another granddaughter, Ya Lisi (played by Jean Arthur). Niu works as a secretary under Tony (played by James Stewart), the son of a big entrepreneur, Anthony (played by Edward Arnold), but she doesn't take this job seriously. She and Tony fall in love and secretly get engaged. One day, Ya Lisi invites Tang and his parents to her house for dinner, but Tony deliberately takes his parents to her house a day earlier, and when they are unprepared, they see this family's unpretentious life. However, this nature will naturally not satisfy Tony's parents. Of course, after a series of twists and turns, this couple finally gets what they want, and the whole family is reunited. The whole film is filled with laughter, but if we treat this film as a comedy, it is more like a satirical film. Perhaps this is also a characteristic of Frank Capra's films. He always makes people able to savor another kind of taste after laughing.

The dialogue of the whole film is very brilliant, especially the words spoken by Leon Barrymore, such as his criticism of the popular doctrine frenzy, telling Qin Yase about his early love history, and the conversation with the income tax collectors, those are all gimmicks that attract people to laugh, but they are all extremely meaningful.

Qin Yase is not very outstanding in this film, probably because the character in the play does not match her personality. James Stewart still retains his unique and undivided appearance. Edward Menno's performance as a big entrepreneur is of course the most suitable. Especially later, when he and the Wen Chihe family played the harmonica, the expression was truly perfect. The others were all wonderful. Watching this film makes us believe that a film cannot be completed by two or three headlining stars. The screenwriter, director, and even every actor cannot be neglected.

In addition, the angle of the entire screen is exceptionally good, which is also Frank Capra's old trick.

All in all, this is a film worth watching. His winning the award is by no means accidental.

### Trivial Matters That Make Several Stars Regretful: A Momentary Mistake Unforgettable for Life

What people fear most is the discovery of conscience, because the spiritual impact is often more unbearable than physical punishment. This is what is meant by "a momentary mistake, regret for eternity." What can most easily make us repent of our behavior is often not the intentional evildoing, but rather the unintentional negligence. For example, a military criminal who went to jail for many years for embezzling huge sums of public funds does not regret the fault of using people's money, but he deeply regrets that he did not fulfill his promise to give a small employee a pension when he was a foreman.

The big stars of Hollywood also have the same facts. Their life's great regrets are often unimaginable to ordinary movie fans.

A certain producer asked the female star, Gan Er Pandelie, to have dinner on Sunday and asked his female secretary to call Gan Er. When the pliers were given to Er, Qian Er asked her, "Is it a formal banquet? Do I need a dress?" The female secretary replied, "It's not a formal banquet, you don't need to wear one." So when the day came, Gan Er went in casual clothes, but I didn't know that when I arrived there, I saw that the female guests were all wearing dresses, and my eyes were definitely formal banquets. Of course she felt very embarrassed. Therefore, she explained to Shangren about her questioning the female secretary. The number producer immediately dismissed her and apologized to Gan. After thinking about this matter, Gan Er regretted it very much, because she said a true word in order to save her own face, and did not think that the female secretary would lose her job because of this. The next day, although she interceded with a certain producer for the female secretary, it was in vain. Therefore, she still regrets it very much when she thinks about it. She said, "Although there are many things I have done that are inevitably subject to severe criticism, I will not forgive myself for the sin of selling people for a wife because of this."

Betty Davis and Hanna Er met and traveled together, but because everyone was burdened with their duties, they did not realize their dreams for a long time. Later, one time they both unexpectedly did not film, so they were overjoyed to pack some luggage, take a car and go together. Of course, there was endless beautiful scenery all the way until they reached their destination. In a hotel, because it was full, they couldn't find a seat for a while, so she quarreled with a waiter. Nelson persuaded her not to listen, but the result was drinking without drinking, defeated and returned. However, Davis later regretted her impulsiveness very much, turning such a happy outing into an unpleasant day of regret for life. I don't know if they can still afford it after they broke up.

Diana Ping also had a regret in her life. According to her, it was still four or five years ago. One day, she came back from school and ran into a movie theater with a classmate to watch a movie. She thought at the time that her mother was going to be in the association until 7 o'clock before returning home. Unfortunately, her mother did not go to the meeting that day. When she saw Diana Dou was still not back after 4 o'clock, she called around to ask, and on the one hand, she sent people to look around. Later, when the theater was over, she learned from her father's mouth that her mother had been frightened. Although she was not scolded when she went back, she still felt uneasy.

### MGM's Shanghai Representative Talks About Shanghai Audiences

A spokesperson for MGM's office in Shanghai recently made a statement to reporters from the mainland, stating the Shanghai film audiences' inclinations towards the company's films and stars. Because what he said was not without considerable insight, the author has translated the spokesperson's statements below to inform readers in the entertainment industry.

"The most important thing that general Chinese film audiences value about American stars is action. Perhaps the only reason is that action is the easiest to understand in a film. Even those who don't understand English dialogue can understand the plot of the whole film by watching the actors' actions," the spokesperson said.

"For example, Chinese moviegoers are very welcome to musical comedies," the spokesperson continued, "These kinds of films usually have a very simple story structure, and in addition to inserting music, the scenery is quite bizarre and magnificent."

"However, you will never know when these films are released," he said, "Sometimes the crowding of the audience will surprise you. To give an example, 'Marie Antoinette' has this tendency."

### Today's Special Silver Plate Final: South China and South Vow to Win the Championship; Police Also Harbor Ambition and Resolve to Do Everything to Win; The Outcome of the Group B American Military vs. Tugger is Difficult to Predict

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Special Silver Plate Football Tournament is the most historic of the six major championships. The first edition was in 1897, and the British warship Sunderland team won the championship.

In the past ten years, South China has had good luck with the Silver Plate, winning the championship seven times. In particular, South China has won three consecutive championships, which is the most commendable.

This year, South China South has once again won the final qualification. It seems that the glorious record of four consecutive victories will be created today.

This time in the final, the opposing team is the Police Association. In terms of strength, South China is much stronger and victory is guaranteed. However, the police have enough "luck" to reach the final stage unexpectedly, and therefore are ambitious and determined to use their personnel to compete with South China for the championship.

They know that their skills are not as good as South China, so they have already decided to concentrate on practicing their strength, hoping to use this trick to defeat South China. However, South China also knows that "the old ones who come are not good" and is also prepared.

Since the police "combined Chinese and Western", their performance has been getting better day by day. This proves that those few Chinese generals have contributed a lot. However, Fan Guicai has recently suffered from eye disease and has not yet recovered. He may not play today. If he is absent, Mo Shi will be the center forward. This "bald general" has enough power in his feet. If he suddenly unleashes a fierce shot, the goalkeeper will be surprised.

In the previous league, the police were lucky to win against South China. This time, when they meet on a narrow road, they are here to settle the score. South China remembers the revenge of the previous defeat and will definitely take this opportunity to kill them and wash away their shame.

The police have been dreaming about this championship. After obtaining the final qualification, they practiced hard and urged Hou Lu, who went to Singapore for business, to return to Hong Kong to respond to this battle. It is said that the two veterans, Goff and Brooks, have also started practicing. Although they are not necessarily going to play, their ambition can be seen.

Hou Lu plays the inside forward, which is the same as playing the midfielder. He retreats well and moves slowly, so he is not a dangerous person. However, because of his height and long legs, he occasionally sprints and uses his head skills, which is quite scary. Therefore, South China's defenders must be careful of this.

Fan Zeicai is agile and good at sprinting, but center forward is not his forte and he lacks experience. Under the surveillance of the Mai and Liang defenders, he will have difficulty moving. On the contrary, if he is absent due to eye disease and Mo Shi is transferred to center forward, relying on his big body, a rush and a shot will be fiercer than Lao Fan.

In fact, the most worrying thing about the police's front line is still that fellow Hualiya. He is lively enough and has considerable skills in passing and dribbling. Therefore, South China's defenders must be careful of this person and not let him have any loopholes to exploit, which may lead to trouble.

I believe that the most important strategy for South China's defenders to deal with the police's attack is to avoid being held by force, to control the enemy with skill, and to resist their sprints, not losing in the header. If that is the case, their shooting skills are not good, and they will not break Bao Jiaping's "closed-door policy."

The three midfielders, Pa Jia, Bi Lie Dian, and Nuo Fu, have enough experience and are good at interception. Therefore, I advise South China's forwards not to use too many short passes in the midfield. Even with Feng Jingxiang's wisdom and Li Zhaorong's agility, they will definitely have a way to get past this line. To go a step further, the quickest way to win is to use the strategy of flanking attacks on both wings. If there are too many short passes, it will eventually be slow.

In the match between Xinghua and Hong Kong, I saw that Chen Guangyu's performance was still lacking. Deng Guangsen ran fast and Zhaorong was cunning enough. I believe that Lao Chen will be very busy today.

Luo Douwen must use swift attacks to break through Bi Liban's final defense. If he attacks roundaboutly, I am afraid it will be ineffective, because Lao Luo's control of the ball is not very reliable and he can easily be intercepted by the experienced Bi.

Guo Yingqi should always move forward to attack, and with Jingxiang's supply from the middle, there is no lack of opportunities.

In short, South China has a 90% chance of winning. Work hard, the glory of four consecutive championships depends on today's victory.

The strength of Tugger and Middleton in Group B is about the same. It is expected that the fierce battle will be no less than the Group A match. It is difficult to predict who will win the championship. The lineups of South China and the Police are recorded as follows (Football Field God)

### Xinghua Team Left Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Manila for Another Charity Match

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Singapore Chinese Football Team, which came to Hong Kong aggressively, had two losses and one win, leaving a so-so impression.

The day before yesterday, the team went to Macau for sightseeing. Originally, they had no intention of challenging the Macau army. However, when the news came out, the Macau General Association said that it was an opportunity to learn from each other since the guests were here. Therefore, they strongly invited the visiting team to play a performance. Xinghua agreed to the request because of the hospitality. They fought fiercely. However, the Xinghua players were half tired and did not perform well. Although they took the lead with a score of 2 to 1, the Han Lian team counterattacked and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. They used the advantage of a penalty kick to tie the score. In the last minute, they scored another goal and defeated Xinghua with a score of 3 to 2.

Yesterday morning, the Xinghua team returned to Hong Kong and immediately packed their luggage to prepare to return south. At 3:30 in the afternoon, the entire team took the Star Ferry across the sea and boarded the "Gan De Zui Di" ship.

Those who came to see them off included Mo Qing, Lin Shaohua, Zhou Runnian, and Bao Jiaping, Liang Rongzhao, Zhu Zhaohang and others from the South China Association. In the first-class hall, everyone sat around the table. Team leader Deng Yuehan asked the waiter for drinks and had a big drink.

They talked and laughed, and enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot to return. When the whistle sounded, the people who came to see them off shook hands with the Xinghua players and said goodbye.

According to team leader Deng, "We will go to Manila again and play a charity match with the All-Philippines United team. The income will be used to help the refugees in Cheng. Our initial intention was to play against the Sha Shua College team again, because last time in Manila, we defeated Sha Shua. If we fight again, we can hope to wash away our shame. However, Manila telegraphed, saying that Lasha was unwilling to fight again and specified that they wanted to play against the United team. This is also fine. Besides, it is a charity event, so why should we begrudge the effort? After the match in Manila, we will return to Singapore on the original ship."

### Open Baseball Tournament Registration Deadline is the 14th

This year's football season can be completely concluded within this month. What follows is the Hong Kong Open Baseball League. It is learned that the registration for this league has begun and will close on the 14th of this month. Those who wish to register can contact Liu Guozhang, the honorary secretary of the Baseball Association (Tian Wei Yang Da Nei).

### The Next Week's Tennis Schedule is Rich

The next week's schedule for the open singles and doubles tennis tournament is extremely rich. Strong players will meet each other, and hard players will collide. It is bound to be a fierce battle. On Monday, the 11th, the pair Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi will fight with Gao Shanshu and Remidi. One is good at attacking and the other is good at defending. There will definitely be good shots. On Wednesday, the 12th, the defending doubles champions, the Xu brothers, will meet Lin Huang or Gao Lei on a narrow road. A fierce battle is expected. On Thursday, the 13th, the match between Xu Weipei and Lin Zhen can be said to be one of the most exciting scenes in this tennis tournament. Little Lin Zhen has performed extremely well this week, almost surpassing his brother. And Xu is the dictator of the singles and doubles on the hard court last year. If he can get past this hurdle, then the future is smooth. Therefore, both sides will do their best. On the 14th (Friday), Da Linzhen will play against Lin Tiande. Its importance is not as great as the battle between Xiao Linzhen and Da Xu. Lin is a good player in Nanyang. When he first came to Hong Kong, he repeatedly defeated famous players and won praise. However, what is the highest peak of his skills? It has not been revealed to the audience yet. This time, he is facing Da Linzhen. He often has stubborn methods to control the enemy. At the same time, Da Linzhen will definitely work hard to assassinate in order to preserve his reputation and break through the difficulties. A fierce battle is expected at that time. The entire schedule for the next week is recorded below.

### Xuhuai Cup Second Competition: South China's Ideal Lineup; Li Huitang Again Serves as Frontline Commander

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Although the Xuhuai Cup Football Tournament is limited to the participation of the South China, Army, and Navy teams, all three teams are powerful and have always competed fiercely.

In the first battle of this year, the Army was defeated by the Navy with a score of 1 to 2. The second battle will be held on the 10th of this month (Monday), with South China playing against the Army. If the Army loses again, they will have no hope for the championship.

As the war is approaching, the Army selected its personnel the day before yesterday to prepare to play against South China. However, the list is mostly composed of Group B players. What is even more surprising is that the midfield line does not include the three outstanding players from Middleton, but instead uses Group B players. This point is worth paying attention to.

South China's generals have not yet been decided. According to Mo Qing's intention, the lineup is roughly as follows:

Tan Junqian

Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan

Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai

Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang He Guangsen

This ideal lineup will definitely be more than enough to deal with the Army. However, the competition is based on a 90-minute system, and the soldiers have enough stamina, so precautions must be taken.

Li Huitang has been appearing and exerting his strength in all charity matches this season. This competition is precisely of a charitable nature, so he is also listed.

Among the eleven players in the Army lineup, we only know the skills of Su Shu and Mei. The rest have often been seen. The lineup is recorded as follows: (Huan Yu)

Deng Qin

Fei Sha Shi Han

Mei Shi Su Shu Li Shi

Da Feilu Su Shi Ge Lu Ge Ni Yan Bachen

Reinforcements: Mo Shi Xian, Bo Shi, Jia Shi, Fa Lan Da Shi, Wei Jian Chen, Mai Dang Nuo Ling Shi

Tonight's Basketball Schedule

6:30 PM (Group B) Chuncao vs. Guangzhong

7:30 PM (Group A) Xiangdao vs. Peiying

8:30 PM (Group B) Peiying vs. Qingzhi

### South China's Expedition to Australia May Become a Reality Next Year; This Year the Jewish Team Took the Lead

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Last autumn, I heard that the South China Athletic Association had a motion to send a football team to revisit Australia. If this becomes a reality, the army can set off this summer, first conquering the South Seas, and then moving to Australia.

This news has been circulating for many months, and it is already summer. Is there any possibility that South China's motion will be realized, or will it end up as empty talk? As far as I know, this matter is currently stranded and I believe it will be difficult to achieve this year. However, there will be opportunities in the future.

Yesterday, I met Mr. Liu Guangfu, who returned to China from Australia not long ago. He is the "matchmaker" for South China's plan to revisit Australia. According to him, "The reason why South China could not go to Australia this year is not because of other obstacles, but because the motion was a bit late and was taken the lead by a purely Jewish football team, so South China could not go this year. It is said that it may become a reality next year."

This Mr. Liu has extensive social connections in Australia. Since he is willing to work hard to help South China make contact with former players, the matter may be successful. (Dong Lang)

### Significant Impact of the War on China's Fresh Egg Exports

Chicken eggs are a major export product of our country, sold in large quantities to various regions. Before the war, an average of 9,759,000 eggs were shipped from Guangdong to Hong Kong each month, valued at 215,690 yuan in national currency; 1,640,000 to Macau, valued at 37,701 yuan; 3,600,000 to the Philippines, valued at 35,763 yuan; and 1,782,000 to Singapore, valued at 43,917 yuan. In addition, significant quantities were transported from Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo to Hong Kong, Singapore, and even Germany. However, since the outbreak of the war, after Chinese egg-producing cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai fell one after another, China's egg exports plummeted. The exports from Guangdong alone have decreased to 9,619,000 eggs (valued at 247,803 yuan). Compared to February 1937, which saw 33,324,000 eggs (valued at 1,269,842 yuan), the difference is significant. In February of this year, only 5,260,000 Guangdong eggs were shipped to Hong Kong (valued at 118,264 yuan). At that time, the Hong Kong egg market was experiencing a situation where demand exceeded supply. Fortunately, shipments arrived from Shantou, Shanwei, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon farms were also producing eggs, so the market did not experience a serious egg shortage.

### Hong Kong's Qingming Festival Amidst the Bright Spring Scenery

— Cai Lusheng

A Silent Visit to Several Cemeteries and Burial Grounds

Time slips away like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, the "Qingming Festival," a tradition passed down for thousands of years, has arrived once again. "Do not stir up feelings of melancholy with black clothes, still in time to go home for Qingming," we recite the poems of our predecessors, reminding us of our own hometowns and the legacy of our ancestors. Everyone inevitably feels a longing to return home. However, among the many people who have been bombed out of their homes and have come to "safe havens" to "seek refuge," how many still have a "home" to return to?

The custom of sweeping tombs during Qingming is practiced throughout the country, and Hong Kong is no exception. During the holiday yesterday and today, the sun, which had been hidden behind the clouds for many days, surprisingly emerged, and under its radiant light, the weather changed from cold and gloomy to warm and bright, adding a lot of vibrant spring scenery to the land. On the narrow paths leading to several cemeteries, an endless stream of people, like endless chariots, came and went from early morning. Although the number of "buses" has been increased several times, they are still overcrowded, and each bus displays a "no more passengers" sign. Other "taxis" and private cars also came and went continuously. By noon, every cemetery was filled with thousands upon thousands of people sweeping tombs.

Here, to understand the "living" conditions of the countless compatriots who are sleeping in this foreign land and the grand occasion of the "Qingming Festival," I mingled among the tomb sweepers and paid a silent visit to several cemeteries and burial grounds. Amidst the tide of tomb sweepers, I visited: Xinhui, Taishan, Zengcheng, Dongguan, Chaozhou Bayi, Huizhou Shishu, Fujian Dakouhuan, Tung Wah Coffin Home, Ap Lei Chau, and several cemeteries and burial grounds. In front of each simple tomb, there was a variety of offerings, both large and small—sacrifices, cakes, rice, wine, roasted meat, chicken, duck, fish...things prepared for the "ghosts" to eat. And they burned large amounts of "money" for the "ghosts" to use—paper ingots, paper silver, "Banknotes of the Netherworld," as well as incense and firecrackers, creating swirling smoke and echoing sounds. What surprised us "outsiders" the most was the crying of a few women in front of the tombs—they seemed to be in great sorrow, wailing and lamenting. At first, it sounded quite sad, but upon closer listening, we realized that they were actually "singing"—"dry crying" without tears.

Near every cemetery, there were always a few seasonal businesses—selling incense and candles, offering wonton noodles, taking quick photos...many stalls of various sizes. In addition, because a cemetery contains tens of thousands of graves, tomb sweepers often cannot find the exact location of the tomb and need the cemetery caretakers to help them find it. Therefore, these caretakers were able to make a very profitable "business" that was almost pure profit. There were also some who were engaged in "costless business"—selling fresh flowers. When tomb sweepers placed fresh flowers on the tomb and left, they would pick them up again and sell them to the next person, circulating the business in this way, and they were also able to earn some "windfall profits."

Since the start of the war of resistance, the increase in Hong Kong's population has been directly proportional to the increase in graves. All burial grounds have become so overcrowded due to the increasing number of graves that there is no room for "coffins," and the method of "demolish the old to build the new" is being implemented—by notifying them to relocate. However, in one place called the Chinese Permanent Cemetery, burial can remain fixed there forever.

The entire construction of the permanent cemetery is extremely luxurious and magnificent, a stark contrast to the cramped and dilapidated burial grounds in other cemeteries. There, not only is there a spacious grand hall—where tomb sweepers bring wine and food to feast and drink, but there are also many delicately built pavilions, as well as exquisite tomb chambers attached to the graves. The location of these graves, it is said, has been carefully considered by feng shui masters. Therefore, on the finely carved tombstones, one can often see inscribed "feng shui" terms such as "facing direction ×, sitting direction ×," etc. I really cannot understand why there are still people who harbor such wishful thinking—relying on "feng shui" to scheme for some kind of "success and prosperity"? If the theory of "feng shui" were true, then the world would be in danger of the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer. What nonsense!

Looking back at our motherland, where the smoke of war is rising and the flames of battle are raging, how many soldiers are wrapped in horsehide and returned to their homes, and how many compatriots who have died resisting × are lying in ditches and ravines, are melting into the soil of our motherland, becoming the soil of the Republic of China—they are living on in death, they do not need "graves." Therefore, seeing these "wealthy" people here, busily building luxurious tombs for those who died a "righteous" death, one cannot help but feel that people have too much "leisure and elegance"!

### On the Truth of Art

— Jie

The task of art is to reflect and express objective truth. The basis of the success of art, and the reason why it can attract a wide audience, lies in its ability to keenly and vividly reflect objective truth, transforming objective truth into artistic truth and presenting it to the broad masses in a clear and dynamic manner. Using artistic truth to incite the masses to cry and laugh, to stir up joy and anger, and allowing the masses to gain new stimulation and see all the truths of the past and present in art—these are the powers of art, and these are the tasks of art. The success or failure of a work of art depends on the depth, height, and breadth of the objective truth it reflects. Therefore, the most important condition for an artist in the creative process, and also the condition for their success, is to grasp objective truth and create artistic truth from objective truth.

The truth of art is not the same as the truth of reality. Some people often confuse the truth of reality with the truth of art, believing that the truth of reality is the truth of art, and that art only needs to replicate the truth of reality onto a work like a camera. But there is no such thing as "artistic truth." Some even believe that many "facts" in reality become "artistic truth" when reflected in art. These are all mistakes. The truth of art is different from the truth of reality. It is a truth that is more advanced, clearer, and more compelling than the truth of reality. Because it is based on an objective foundation, it purifies the truth of reality from its randomness. It has removed the unwarranted elements that breed in reality, and eliminated all accidental factors. It synthesizes and generalizes objective facts, thereby creating something new and more advanced. Therefore, the truth of art is comprehensive and complete. It already contains all aspects of objective reality, while the truth of reality is only one-sided and individual. It can only represent one side or one corner of the entire objective reality. The truth of art, because it has undergone artistic processing, has become something more advanced than the truth of reality.

The truth of art is the grasping of the comprehensive and entire process of objective reality, but at the same time, the scientific truth of grasping the comprehensive process of objective reality is not the same as the truth of art. Although both scientific truth and artistic truth seek to grasp the "truth" of the objective and express the "truth" of the objective by purifying the randomness of the objective, the truth of art is the unity of objective truth and image, while scientific truth is a fusion of objective truth and abstract concepts. In other words, art grasps "truth" from the form of sensory entity and expresses "truth" from vivid images, while science grasps "truth" from the logical and general form and expresses "truth" with abstract concepts and laws. This is the significant difference between the two, and the distinguishing line between art and science, clearly differentiating artistic truth from scientific truth. Artistic truth, due to its inherently specific nature, must be the unity of objective truth and image.

Objective reality is developing, and the truth of art, as a reflection of objective reality, must naturally also be developing. As Lunacharsky once said: "He who does not recognize development will never see the truth—because the truth does not resemble its original state, does not stop moving forward, but leaps forward; the truth is progressing, the truth is contradictory, the truth is struggling, the truth—it is of tomorrow, and it must be recognized as such." These words clearly point out the tomorrow-ness, future-ness, and developmental-ness of truth. The truth in art must include this future-ness and tomorrow-ness in order to grasp development and grasp truth. An excellent artistic creation not only needs to reflect the reality of its time, but also needs to reflect the future development of this reality, using the brilliance of tomorrow and the future to guide the practical path of the masses. This is to create the truth of art.

The truth of art is creation, and it is the basic task of human art. However, when reality undergoes drastic changes, such as the great national revolutionary struggle that is currently taking place in our motherland, if an artist wants to speak of the truth of reality and create the truth of art, they must throw themselves into that great upheaval. Because only from our own life practice can we experience all the changes in reality, can we more intimately feel all the transformations, and can we, in the wilderness of reality, discover the truth of reality, grasp the truth of reality, and thereby create the truth of reality!

### A Place to Stand

— Hua Fu

A person born into this world, according to common sense, should always have a place to stand. However, there are people who are crying out that they don't even have a place to stand. What is the reason for this? Clever people say that such people have reached this point because they are too stupid. Besides, heaven and earth are inherently vast, how could such a thing happen?

The way of the world for clever people is indeed wonderfully indescribable. In short, the first step is to blow, to blow with their mouths. Their mouths are better than the dragon's mouth that blows breath into clouds. With a blow, they can cause heaven and earth to change color. If they apply it in a small way, stirring it into a breeze, they can make the people around them scatter in the wind, giving them space to move around. Isn't the use of blowing great?

The second step is to pat, to pat with their hands. They know that blowing is for dealing with people on the same level as them, but for people above them, blowing is sometimes ineffective. If they only blow, they cannot stop them from pressing down. This requires the use of patting, patting upwards. Fortunately, the people above all enjoy this flattery. As long as you pat, they will rise lightly like a rubber ball or a balloon, leaving ample space above you for you to stand out.

Ordinary clever people, having mastered the arts of blowing and patting, will find themselves in a comfortable position and can enjoy themselves without seeking other skills and stopping there. However, there are also some kind-hearted clever people who want to take it a step further to expand their space. This further third step is to use stepping, to step with their feet.

The wonderful use of stepping seems to surpass blowing and patting. Those who are particular about establishing themselves in the world should not be unaware of this. Stepping means placing other people under one's feet. Suppose the area around you has already been cleared by blowing, and the space above you has already been loosened by patting, now if you step on something under your feet, you can stand tall and be the only one to be respected. Even further, if you are indeed busy and have not yet mastered blowing and patting, then as long as you know how to step, and step forcefully, the more you step under your feet, the higher you can rise, like a tree that has just been rained on, towering above the loft. At that time, those who look up to you from below will certainly be unable to catch up, and those above you, if they cooperate with you, you will naturally rise higher and higher. Otherwise, sooner or later they will be pushed down by you, and you can "take their place."

Why are these clever people with good skills also kind-hearted? There is no other reason; it would be a waste of resources not to make use of it, which is a bit of a pity. So they have great compassion and use everything as a stepping stone, turning rottenness into magic, enabling them to do their best and get what they deserve. They have simply done a great good deed, so they are called kind-hearted.

Nowadays, there are many clever people, but kind-hearted clever people are even more numerous. So everyone is a great philanthropist. And those who are completely stupid are of course still there, it is impossible not to have them, but there are very few. They have no place to stand, which is what they deserve. Who told them not to understand the three movements of blowing, patting, and stepping?

Stupid people are simply the leftovers and waste of the world. Wouldn't the world be even more spacious without them, allowing clever people to run rampant? In all fairness, clever people should not give these stupid people a place to stand, much less a place to stand. Some clever people are still willing to give them a space under their feet so that they can settle down. Aren't these clever people kind-hearted!

It is very good that clever people say that the earth is very vast. Isn't it because they themselves have a place to stand and even stupid people have a place to stand because of them! Amitabha, clever people are both clever and kind, how rare, how rare!

### Japan's Stance During the War

— Gong Huai

It has been twenty-one months since the Japanese army lit the flames of aggression at the Lugou Bridge. When the war first started, the Japanese military expected to "win quickly" and "succeed immediately," using "small forces" to seize "large benefits." They believed that with their new-style weapons such as airplanes, artillery, and tanks, coupled with planned political conspiracies, it would not be difficult to make our country "kneel." But as our army continued to fight strongly, the "quick victory" has become a pipe dream. This was of course beyond the expectations of the warmongers.

So, what is Japan's stance during the war actually showing? Please see the following news, although they are all "trivial" social dynamics, seemingly "unimportant," but using the "small" to illustrate the "big," it is not difficult to imagine the results obtained by the aggressors from here.

Professor Famine

According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, recently, in universities across the country, many professors and assistant teachers have been arrested for participating in people's front groups or being suspected of anti-war thoughts, and have been suspended or arrested. As a result, universities are feeling the pinch of a professor shortage. The Minister of Education, Araki, is having a difficult time coping with this. Currently, six universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, have a total shortage of 169 professors and 162 assistant teachers. This is truly an unprecedented phenomenon in the Japanese education world.

Unable to Marry. Japanese women have not yet escaped the shackles of feudal society. "Good wife, wise mother" is their highest moral indicator. Most women take "marriage" as a shortcut to solve their lives. However, recently, due to the prolonged and unresolved war against China, young men have been conscripted to the front lines in China, and the number of casualties is so high that it has invisibly deprived many Japanese girls of their husbands, making it impossible for girls who have reached marriageable age to find a marriage partner. According to a recent survey by the Tokyo City Social Affairs Bureau, there are 200,000 such young women in Tokyo alone. These young women, unable to marry, have to wander around looking for jobs, but where are there so many ready-made positions to place these unmarried women?

Horse-Drawn Carriages Reappear. Gasoline is an important fuel during wartime, and resource-poor Japan naturally regards it as a treasure and is unwilling to waste even a drop of it. Therefore, the number of cars appearing in Tokyo recently is very small, and most of them use charcoal as a substitute. And the horse-drawn carriages, which had disappeared from Tokyo for decades, have reappeared, used to replace cars and trucks, as if returning to the early Meiji era. If the war does not stop, horse-drawn carriages will inevitably flood Japan.

Cutting off Collars and Sleeves. The result of the shortage of textiles will bring about a change in Japanese clothing. Soon, the new clothes for Japanese women must be shortened uniformly. This is a government order. In the future, Japanese girls will wear fashionable clothes without "collars" and "sleeves." Their underwear will be cut short to a shocking degree. This "unique" dress is a special embellishment on the streets of Tokyo.

Decreasing Infant Population. In the Japanese House of Representatives, Ito Iwao, a member of the Seiyukai, asked Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose about the declining birth rate in Japan, expressing concern and asking the government to explain its countermeasures. According to Hirose's reply, in this war of aggression, the birth rate of children has indeed decreased "considerably." The normal "annual production of nearly two million" has probably decreased by 300,000 to 400,000. This is still the so-called official report. The actual number is certainly more than this. Moreover, due to the difficult lives of the people, the mortality rate of infants and young children is also higher than usual. This is a serious social problem.

"The happy, flower-like Japan has disappeared, and a shadow of sadness covers every inch of land, with drops of melancholy tears falling on everyone's heart!" These words of Sano Keisaku are an accurate description.

### Tomb

— Lin Ling

Everyone has such a day...

Carrying traces of disillusionment

Entering the final palace of life.

At that time, what is left behind

Is only the memories shining in the hearts of descendants,

And the sins and glories imprinted on the tombstone.

You must remember:

After Yue Fei's death,

People built temples for him,

And reverently worship him every year and every season.

You must remember,

Although Qin Hui has turned to dust,

But people have made a kneeling statue of him,

Striking his head fiercely every day,

Punishing his wickedness in life!

You bandits of the nation,

Why not deeply, deeply repent

Before you enter your graves?

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"Go, frozen ghosts have no warm graves!" Then, he secretly said again: "I can spare you from becoming a frozen ghost, but I can't stop them from arresting you and making you a criminal!"

So, he felt a terror that was even more threatening than the cold. He calmly looked around, but his vision was blurred by the dim night after only a few feet. He listened again, as if he heard the sound of shoes grinding against the snowy road, gradually getting closer. As he stared into the distance, he did not see any differently colored figures on the white road, but the sound was still ringing, getting closer, right beside him. A few dead leaves were stirred by the wind, rubbing against each other and swirling on the snowy road. To reassure himself, he crushed those dead leaves that were nearing their end. Soon, there was a new sound coming from afar. He listened quietly, and he believed it was the sound of a patrolling police chief—the sound of the leather sheath of his saber rubbing against the leather leggings tied to his legs as he walked. He became anxious and finally began to ask her again:

"Can't you come with me?"

"Ask yourself!" she snorted. "I've already told you!"

"I can't let you go either, so are you just going to stand here?"

"I'd rather stand here!"

"Here, do you think a police chief will pass by?"

"What are you so nervous about?"

"It's not 'nervous,' it's a police chief. A police chief, that is, a detective. Do you want to wait for a detective to come and inform on me?"

"No! Why would I want to make others suffer? I don't want others to be unlucky because of me. But, I can't let others harm me either. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, when you leave, you'll be alone!"

At this time, there was no sound to be heard, far or near. What was bothering him was only the wind and snow around him—sometimes pulling at his clothes with force, sometimes stimulating his face with cold. But this was natural for someone who was born in the frigid zone, accustomed to living in the frigid zone. Especially him—a sufferer of cold, who looked forward to winter every year, like a polar bear, finding joy in frolicking in the wind and snow every year. However, this time he felt annoyed by the wind and snow. Because this wind and snow not only did not give him the joy of previous years, but also made him uneasy. He had to constantly shield his ears with his hands or brush away the snow in front of his eyes, not letting the wind and snow disturb or blur his hearing and vision. He was doing all this to watch her. He was worried that in a moment of inattentiveness, she would disregard everything and escape. Although he believed that he still had the strength to restrain her, making it difficult for her to escape, he was afraid that the escape would lead to even more unexpected ruptures and failures.
