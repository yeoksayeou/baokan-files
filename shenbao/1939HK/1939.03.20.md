### United States Statement and British Prime Minister's Speech

Hitler's adventurous actions indeed exceeded the expectations of some world politicians. In the short period of less than half a year after the division of Czechoslovakia, the fact of annexing the entire Czech Republic shocked the world again. The small countries of Eastern Europe are increasingly approaching the tiger's mouth, and they all feel precarious. Although this stomach-risking action by Hitler seems superficially calmer than in September of last year, its danger has deepened even more. The countries most deeply involved in this incident are undoubtedly Britain, the United States, and France, so the attitudes expressed by these three countries towards this incident are filled with extraordinary shock and vigilance. Chamberlain, who had always trusted Hitler most deeply, is no longer very optimistic, France is also preparing to adopt a tough stance following Britain, and the expression of the United States government is even more concrete and powerful.

Chamberlain already had considerable realization in his speech in Birmingham on the 17th, acknowledging that "Germany's atrocities this time were truly unexpected"; regretting Hitler's "earnest promises" of that day, "who knew that his fickleness would be so extreme." This expression is much better than his previous feigned ignorance. But today the problem is no longer about quibbling over past mistakes, as Mr. Zhang said in his speech, but about how to change course and actively research effective ways to sanction the aggressor. There are two key points in Mr. Zhang's speech that are worth noting; one is the realization that "Germany's plan to conquer foreign lands has now begun, or will accelerate aggression outwards in the future," and the other is the realization that "Britain must unite the strength within the British Empire and join hands with France to cope with this situation." Germany's aggression against foreign lands did not begin today, but it is not too late for Mr. Zhang to speak from the heart and save the crisis in the European situation. As for the countries that should be closely linked, it should not be limited to France; the United States and the Soviet Union also have important relationships. Hitler's eastward advance today is also a preparation for a westward advance to oppress Britain and France tomorrow, but the French border, as President Roosevelt said, "is the first line of defense of the United States," and the depth of its relationship with the United States can be imagined. Germany's eastward advance will eventually lead to a direct conflict with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has a linked relationship with Britain and France. More importantly, Hitler's actions are indeed part of a conspiracy by an international aggression group. It is foreseeable that Italy will soon launch an offensive in Western Europe, and Japan will become more restless in the Far East. Then, to deal with the violence of this aggression group, Britain and France alone cannot bear the brunt. Mr. Zhang and other British people should deeply recognize this point.

Therefore, the thorough understanding of this incident and the practicality of the proposed methods should be attributed to the statement of the United States government and the proposals of insightful people in the United States.

The State Department, with the consent of the President, issued a formal statement, denouncing Germany's "insidious tricks, which have threatened world peace and modern cultural institutions." Senator Pittman of the United States even declared in the Senate: "The three dictatorial countries clearly have sufficient tacit understanding in their actions, so one should no longer harbor ridicule about the views on the crises encountered by Latin America." This is indeed a pointed remark. Mr. Bi also strongly advocated: "In order to cope with this serious situation and seek our own defense, we must not delay the necessary political and preparation work." Germany's aggression is not limited to Europe. The fact that it colludes with the Japanese aggressors in the Far East to invade and oppress Central and South America is well known to the general public in the United States. If Hitler's plan to occupy Europe succeeds to a certain extent, his power will inevitably swell, and his fingers will inevitably reach Africa. Therefore, preventing Hitler's tyranny today is also for the sake of the United States' own defense. But the method of defense should focus on what Mr. Bi said: "The three dictatorial countries clearly have sufficient tacit understanding in their actions." If observed in this way, the United States bears even greater responsibility in the Pacific. Therefore, the entire United States should promote military facilities in the Pacific, especially in Guam and other places. Whether the United States can stand firm in the Pacific and exert its greatest strength can determine whether the democratic group can gain an advantage in the Pacific, thereby reducing the restraint of Germany's accomplices on Britain and France in the East.

Now, Britain has recalled its ambassador to Germany, and France has taken the same action. Germany has also retaliated by recalling its ambassador to Britain. On the other hand, Italy's sharp eagle eyes are looking around for opportunities. The aggressor in the East has also sent the Director-General of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, KawaSogo Hifu, who advocates the "Three Kingdoms Theory," to stay for as long as two weeks, and it is rumored that he has a certain diplomatic mission. It can be asserted that there will be greater developments in international conspiracies. The tension of this situation has been revealed, and countries around the world are at the point of drawing swords over a major war, and the war is very likely to break out. In this situation, Britain and France may be somewhat hesitant, but what should be more clearly recognized is that if Britain and France can deal with the aggressor firmly, they can sometimes prevent the aggressor's atrocities and maintain true peace. The aggressor is taking advantage of this weakness of Britain, France, and other countries. If democratic countries cannot use a common "armed force" to maintain "peace," then the world will never have peace!

### Development of Politics in Wartime Shanxi

Since the "July 7th" Incident last year, China's War of Resistance Against Japan has undergone eight months of heroic struggle and arduous efforts. The result is today's empty victory. Politically, the prejudices of all strata and parties across the country have gradually been unified, and they are going to the national crisis together. In terms of civil movement, a wide range of people have been mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance. The prerequisite for our inevitable victory in the War of Resistance has been fully met in the initial process of the War of Resistance. Although we cannot resist the fierce invasion of the Japanese army militarily and are retreating step by step, if we correctly estimate the development of the vast guerrilla warfare in the future, what disadvantages will it have for the Japanese, and recognize the objective conditions that the Japanese will not be able to continue to support in the long-term War of Resistance, then we are very optimistic about the future of the War of Resistance.

All correct observations tell us that the true development of a comprehensive war of resistance is the first act of a protracted war of resistance to win the final victory. Therefore, in the early stage of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, being able to promote all the forces of the country to move towards the open road of the War of Resistance, and being able to mobilize the people of the whole country to participate in our War of Resistance team, fully grasps the prerequisite for inevitable victory in the war. Otherwise, it will be a war of resistance without a foundation, a blind war of resistance, which will eventually suffer serious losses and turn to a counter-revolutionary road halfway. Therefore, in the current stage, whether each war of resistance team in the country and each war of resistance area has been soundly organized by themselves; whether there is a solid foundation in all aspects of mobilization, this is what we should urgently review in the current stage when our war of resistance is about to change.

Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, what is most exciting and satisfying is the awakening of our entire nation, especially the people of North China, who have suffered from the oppression of Japan more deeply and for a longer time, so their anti-Japanese sentiments are even higher. Now the people of Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan and other provinces have been universally organized. Not only can they fully exert their strength in the task of defending their homes, but they have also made indelible contributions in military activities such as attacking and harassing the Japanese army. Undoubtedly, they will inevitably become the backbone of our War of Resistance in the future. Therefore, in all areas of the War of Resistance in North China, attention is paid to active civil movement work, and many solid guerrilla base areas are based on the people.

Originally, the purpose of the Japanese warlords in launching this war of aggression was to seize North China. Since the beginning of the war, there have been fierce battles on various routes such as Suiyuan, Pinghan, and Datong. After the Japanese army captured southern Shanxi, guerrilla warfare was widely launched in Shanxi, attacking the enemy anytime and anywhere. We can see this from newspapers. No matter where the main force of the Sino-Japanese war is, the guerrilla battles in Shanxi have always been carried out in coordination. This is partly due to the geographical importance of Shanxi, which creates military conditions that must be contested by both sides, and partly because the Shanxi War of Resistance authorities can quickly reform the political structure of the past and mobilize new forces to implement new War of Resistance plans, so that they can create today's new environment of constantly attacking the enemy.

Politics is in a leading position, and all other implementations must be able to take effect through the use of political power. Therefore, to study all the new implementations and new reforms in Shanxi, we must understand the historical development of the work of the Shanxi regime.

We can analyze the development of the work of the Shanxi regime in the past year of the War of Resistance into two periods: 1. The initial mobilization period. 2. The implementation period of the mobilization decree: 3. The guerrilla warfare period. These three periods all have their special political environments, and of course they also show their respective characteristics in the work of the regime.

1. The initial mobilization period—from the "July 7th" Incident to the loss of Taiyuan.

All new changes and new implementations in politics are completely adapted to the new environment, and are also restricted by the historical foundation of politics itself. Therefore, to study this new change and implementation, we must understand the situation of the times. After the "July 7th" Incident, the comprehensive War of Resistance began. Militarily, the Japanese army, with its superior weapons, occupied an absolute advantage. Politically, the old institutions could not adapt to the new environment and accelerated their collapse. In terms of mobilization, it showed fundamental incompetence. To implement new plans politically to adapt to the needs of the objective environment at that time was the most urgent task at that time. Therefore, the various emergency measures in the initial stage of politics were the initial prototype of the work of the Shanxi regime and opened up the prelude to the initial War of Resistance in Shanxi.

1. Establishment of provincial general mobilization agency: Since the old political institutions lacked the ability to mobilize, it was very important to establish a provincial general mobilization agency for the purpose of preparing for a long-term War of Resistance. After the establishment of the "General Mobilization Committee," the government, the army, and civil groups were unified under one goal, completely breaking the old habit of political neglect of the people in the past, and providing a lot of assistance to people's organizations, political reforms, and people's lives. However, due to the backwardness of administrative personnel in various counties at that time and the lack of lower-level cadres, they did not know how to use or intend to use all new tasks, which was the only shortcoming.

2. Implementation of wartime financial policy: The first step was to promulgate the reasonable burden implementation plan, which formally specified the three major principles of reasonable burden: "Those who have wealth should bear a heavy burden," "Those who have property should bear a large burden," and "Those who earn more money should bear a large burden." This was a major revolution in China's entire financial policy. At the same time, in the process of the War of Resistance, the people's understanding gradually awakened, and they tacitly agreed with the slogan "Those who have money contribute money, and everyone gives their lives." Therefore, after the implementation of this plan, it was quite effective in improving the people's lives.

3. The new plan for organizing the people: In the early stage of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, there were bound to be heavy sacrifices in the military. In order to mobilize a large number of new soldiers to go to the battlefield, the Shanxi authorities promulgated the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers Fighting Against Japan." This was the most powerful weapon for mobilizing new soldiers and the best way to enable every soldier to spontaneously join the War of Resistance. However, in the continuous development of the war, it was foreseen that it would not be enough to rely solely on regular army operations. In addition, the entire people must be mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance in order to continue to support it. Therefore, at that time, the "Outline of Village Organization" was published to completely organize all men, women, old, and young people. However, in reality, the objective environment was not yet mature, and the old social life of the general public had not been thoroughly destroyed, so there was no further awakening. Therefore, the organization of the people could not be completed. However, it is worth noting the great measures of opening up agriculture, industry, and education, and arming the Taiyuan Yuci Workers' Self-Defense Force. This shows the Shanxi authorities' greatest determination to organize and arm the people.

4. Evacuation of Taiyuan residents and relocation of national defense industry, which has great significance in preparing for a long-term War of Resistance. Within a week, the population of Taiyuan was evacuated from 150,000 to about 70,000. All industries such as ordnance factories and textile and paper mills were moved to the rear. Although Taiyuan was lost, there was not much loss in terms of materials for the enemy to use.

5. The division of guerrilla areas is the first act in preparing for a protracted war of resistance. Before the loss of Taiyuan, the province was divided into seven administrative regions as bases for guerrilla warfare. The guerrilla units that are constantly attacking and harassing the enemy in the current stage were all established at that time.

2. The implementation period of the mobilization decree—from the loss of Taiyuan to the Japanese invasion of southern Shanxi.

After the loss of Taiyuan, the center of gravity of the Chinese war shifted to the south. Both sides in Shanxi focused on reorganizing their troops. Although the Japanese army had launched an attack on the northern Shanxi guerrilla area, the war was generally at a standstill. This was a transitional period for the entire Shanxi to a new aspect. At that time, the situation of protracted war and guerrilla war began to develop in front of everyone. Therefore, the Shanxi army and the people began to become guerrilla, and all work styles gradually tended to a new aspect. This is due to the superior achievements made in the early stage of the War of Resistance, although due to the conditions of the times and the environment, the political measures are still the main reason. All political establishments can meet the needs of the times and the environment, and can use this opportunity to recuperate and implement a great revolutionary mobilization plan:

1. Implementing the second phase of the emergency mobilization decree was the most urgent task at that time. This was the responsibility of the administrative offices in each district to be implemented to every county, district, village, and neighborhood. Their work totaled: A. Removing incompetent officials. Eliminating corrupt officials, bad gentry, and bad people. B. Implementation of the new financial policy—"Implementing the Reasonable Burden Plan" was actively implemented. At the same time, "Handling the Property of Traitors" and "Safeguarding the Property of Fugitive Wealthy Households" were also brought into the financial problem as the war deepened. C. Reorganizing and repairing machinery factories, military uniforms, medical clinics, etc. to establish the national defense industry. D. Implementing preferential treatment regulations, and universally organizing self-defense teams and guerrilla teams that are separated from production. E. Promulgating methods to reduce rent and interest to improve the lives of the people.

2. Thoroughly reform the old political institutions, remove the old county magistrates, and appoint strong revolutionary comrades to thoroughly promote the Ten Outlines of the People's Revolution to seek further development.

3. Further implementation of the wartime financial policy: All miscellaneous taxes, such as taxes on livestock slaughter, etc., were exempted and stopped being levied from January 1, 1938. In the past, due to the special exploitation system of feudal tax authorities, such as "brokers" and other people, they were also cleared by the people. In addition, the new method of reasonable burden was indeed promoted, and the financial problem was solved under the principle of "Those who have money contribute money."

4. The establishment of the ethnic revolutionary education is a new plan that was produced in response to the needs of the times. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, revolutionary comrades and young intellectuals across the country, under the slogan of "The War of Resistance is above all else" and the national revolutionary united front, urgently wanted to join the War of Resistance team to seek the ultimate goal of national liberation. However, in reality, our early military failures and the successive fall of major cities led to the serious fact that young intellectuals in the cities were wandering and had no way to go to the battlefield. This was a great loss at that time. Therefore, the slogan of national revolution still needs to be loudly and urgently promoted to call on revolutionary comrades across the country to quickly embark on the road of resistance. We can fully illustrate the practicality and correctness of the ethnic revolutionary education from the grand occasion of the ethnic revolutionary university's establishment in Linfen.

5. The establishment of the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region Government was also a major product of this period. In order to support the protracted war of resistance, we need to have solid guerrilla bases. However, the characteristics of the border region government are not limited to this. It is a united government jointly organized by various parties and factions. The financial, social, and economic policies are completely based on the basic principle of "Those who have money contribute." This kind of institution has already formed an indispensable part of the national war of resistance strategy.

6. The time when the guerrilla strategy was launched—After the Japanese invaded southern Shanxi and after the invasion.

The Japanese invaded southern Shanxi in an attempt to open up Shanxi to lay the foundation for invading North China. But in fact, the Japanese can only occupy places along the railway line. Other towns and villages that are slightly further away cannot be occupied by the Japanese army at all. Even if they are occupied, they will inevitably be attacked by us and quickly withdraw. This is the fact that the Japanese invaders have always felt most disturbed about. But we can grasp the weaknesses of the enemy, and have planned to launch a provincial guerrilla strategy, on the military I of the guerrilla units were transferred in the enemy's rear, at any time, anywhere to give the enemy a heavy blow, on the political I noted in the destruction of puppet organizations, destroying the enemy's plot, Since the provincial government was relocated to the west, the progress of county district leadership, administrative institutional change, the establishment and promotion of democratic political system, the reasonable implementation of financial system, the enhancement of industry and commerce, all show a new style, showing the development of the war of resistance and national construction work in the enemy's rear during the war of resistance.

1. If the political director general is also really assume the task of consolidating guerrilla regime search, all political and financial planning, unified Political Director Office processing, their necessary task in:

A. Recovery of war order - Management of military relations, maintain financial and attention to the acceptance of refugees and other matters.

B. Establishing civil will open in order to promote the spirit of democracy, the implementation of political leadership, collective leadership, common destroy personnel destroy salary, financial openness in order to develop a new style of new regime.

C. Step up the mobilization of the people, with the army operations, to participate in the destruction of traffic and investigation of guides consolation work, so that from the strength of the defense force itself to strengthen in order to prepare the basis of the guerrilla base.

2. The attack on the puppet organizations and the destruction is taking the main position on the work of the regime, which can be said from several aspects:

A. The restoration of the various regimes, so that the traitor maintenance will be lost in the people deceive, to deceive the appeal, and try to expose the various plots of the Japanese invaders, so that the enemy's political rule attempts are not realized.

B. Launch guerrilla war, the enemy's strength is reduced to within the city circle.

C. on the enemy's work of development, so that the enemy's internal organization continues to disintegrate.

3. The implementation of the wartime financial and economic program: is a revolutionary combat significance, in full accordance with the state of wartime, reasonable to determine the implementation of the methods of tax trade land.

A. The war through to the main from the implementation of a reasonable burden of confiscation of traitor property and corruption financial peak aspects of raising funds, in addition to support, industry and commerce, development of cooperative movement.

B. Set to transfer into the enemy's rear change the principle, control left change, prohibit food such as military supplies input enemy area, prohibited and enemy trade and use of counterfeit currency.

C. Determine the wartime land use law, the land does not fall into disuse of the original aid, will escape the rich households and land all public property - unconditional by the village office to the labor force of the people farming, this is 'tillers' land proposition of the realization, is 'land village public' under the war of resistance a new development.

4. The further implementation of the People's Revolutionary Education, in order to create the youth cadres of the sustained resistance, we are deeply aware of - the importance of young knowledge people: it is the vanguard in the war of resistance, it is the new force to mobilize the people, so the rapid launch of the young intellectuals is today a matter of urgency, but only the implementation of the national revolutionary education. In order to correct the wrong ideas of the youth, strong youth anti - will, since the enemy besieged southern Jin after, such as the administrative district the establishment of revolutionary high school elementary school, and uniform the development of teaching materials subject, the content of pure anti - applicable knowledge and anti - must win the theory - and taught saving the country claims and the Three People's Principles by labor doctrine and other theories,

The above-mentioned various great political measures, based on the objective situation at the time and the implementation of the puppet regime, a large number of unsteady elements escaped, the activities of the traitor organization in the cities along the railway and the occupied areas of the enemy were brewing, and at the same time, most of our troops also began guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, but the relationship with the people still can not be further strengthened the work of the people's movement, so how to win the people, how to launch the province The participation of the people in the anti-war team is a very important and urgent issue at the time, and the great order of 'May 1' is the main execution of this sacred mission, which is the goal of General Commander Yan's reminder to the whole province's military, political and civilian sectors on May 1.

1. Improve our regime

2. Destroy the enemy's puppet organization

3. Improve the vehicle discipline to win the sympathy of the people

4. Mobilize the people to resist the war to the end

In fact, after 'May 1', the work of the People's Movement is universally unfolding, under the principle of "political leadership military", the army also bears the task of propagating to the people, organizing the people, the people of the whole Shanxi under the oppression of the enemy, has a universal sense, coupled with the active political leadership military organization, undoubtedly is a strong anti-war force, they will always fight with the enemy: struggle to the end:

### The Flying Leap Forward in Jinhua Lanxi

Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang

One is the Center of Resistance, the Other is a Commercial Hub

Jinhua

The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway trunk line is 62.30 kilometers long, with the Yongkang to Jinhua section accounting for two-thirds. The reporter took a bus from the Shuikang Bus Station with a total of nine passengers. It is said that although there are few passengers these days, the buses are still able to run on time, which is indeed the spirit of the transportation industry. In recent years, under the active construction of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the trunk and branch lines of highways and county roads in eastern Zhejiang have completed the planned route, and are connected to the important strongholds of various highways in Jiangxi. Most of the usual construction work is requisitioned from the people. Those who are able-bodied are conscripted themselves, and those who are not able-bodied hire workers to do it. Today, the highways of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have made a great contribution to transportation. Because the highway is half-flat, even though the car travels very fast, the seats do not feel bumpy. On both sides of the highway are towering mountain peaks, and the car seems to be traveling between huge rocks. There are many villages along the way, and the car stops for a few minutes at each small station. When the car is about to arrive at Jinhua Station, there are many mud houses under construction by the roadside. According to the locals, due to the recent increase in population, these simple mud and grass houses are being built everywhere to solve the housing problem.

Transportation Hub

Today, Jinhua is not only the center of military activities in eastern Zhejiang, but also a transportation hub in the interior. Jinhua is the center of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the Jinhua-Wuyi Highway and the Jinhua-Lanxi Highway also start from here. The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway starts from Shangqiao across the river south of Jinhua, passes through Zhuzhen in Lingxia and enters Wuyi, and reaches Yongkang. This road is the only important route to Wenzhou on the Zhejiang coast. Its importance is now very significant, and those going to the interior all transfer via this road. The Jinhua-Lanxi Highway extends westward to Lanxi County, starting from Jinguting on the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway and branching into Lanxi. Because this highway runs parallel to the Lanxi branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, there are no scheduled bus services at present. However, its importance is no less than that of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway when necessary. The Beishan Highway was built by the county government to facilitate tourists visiting Jinhua Beishan Mountain. The Zhejiang-Guilin inter-provincial railway is now open to traffic after active preparation, with Jinhua Station as the starting point. Today's Jinhua is in an important position in inland transportation.

Abundant Products

Jinhua County's main products are agricultural products, and special products are also mainly agricultural by-products. The county's annual production is 1,630,000 dan. In terms of ordinary agricultural products, the annual production of wheat is 80,000 dan, barley is 70,000 dan, miscellaneous grains are 360,000 dan, and there are other products such as soybeans and glutinous rice. The total annual production of ordinary crops exceeds 1.8 million dan. Therefore, although Jinhua is a large city with a dense population today, it can definitely provide for itself in terms of food. The agricultural areas in the urban area of Jinhua are full of prosperity everywhere. The streets, hotels, and restaurants are all crowded with people. Jinhua is a developed area for cultural undertakings in eastern Zhejiang. In terms of primary education, there are more than 180 private primary schools and 24 county-run schools. In terms of secondary education, there is the Provincial Jinhua Middle School with more than 900 male and female students and more than 70 teachers. The Provincial Jinhua Vocational School has more than 100 students, and the Jinhua County Junior High School has 384 students. There are also private junior high schools such as Zuoxin Junior High School with 220 students and Chengmei Girls' Junior High School with more than 60 students. In Jinhua, which has a large number of intellectuals, it is conceivable that their enthusiasm for resisting the war and their efforts in saving the country are intense. In Jinhua, not only local graduates have organized national salvation groups, but also many national salvation groups, singing teams, and national salvation drama troupes from the Shanghai resistance area. They have all come together to arouse the people of Jinhua and neighboring counties.

Ardent Popular Sentiment

There are several military hospitals in the urban area of Jinhua, with good facilities. Many of the nursing duties are undertaken by local young women. In the anti-war theater in Jinhua city, there are often performances and speeches promoting national salvation. In addition to dramas, the most popular are songs. The people of Jinhua feel very honored to be able to sing a few national salvation songs, such as "Young Men Go to the Front Line" and "Protecting Our Homeland". Not only does every school in Jinhua have a national salvation singing team or drama troupe, but other organizations such as the County Women's Association and the County Party Headquarters also have organizations. There are no fewer than twenty or thirty such organizations in the entire county. Therefore, the atmosphere of national salvation propaganda is particularly strong in Jinhua today. They not only work in the county, but also spread propaganda in various parts of eastern Zhejiang. Undoubtedly, Jinhua is an active center in eastern Zhejiang. The most prosperous section of the city, from West Market Street to Lotus Well, is also full of a new atmosphere. The county has more than 60,000 able-bodied men. All men of military age, regardless of class, must be organized and trained, and the results are excellent. Every morning and evening, there are groups of trained able-bodied men drilling under the leadership of instructors in the suburbs. According to the reporter, the able-bodied men in each team are neatly dressed and move quickly. It is worth mentioning that, in view of the importance of grain storage during wartime and to adjust grain prices, the Jinhua County Government authorities have recently built a grain storage warehouse and two agricultural and poultry warehouses in addition to the old warehouses, which can normally hold more than 9,000 dan of grain. There is also a new-style warehouse with an area of 7.3 mu, which can also be completed in a short period of time.

Scenic Area

Jinhua has Beishan Mountain, whose range comes from Dabayan Mountain in Dongyang County, winding and undulating for more than 40 kilometers. Famous scholars of past dynasties have admired it and many have lived in seclusion here to study. Therefore, the historical sites and scenic spots of Jinhua Mountain are scattered everywhere. The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously designated this as a scenic area, and the Beishan Highway was built for this purpose. The reporter admired its scenic spots and walked from the west gate of Jinhua along the Beishan Highway. After fifteen li, he reached Luodian, and then circled along the mountain path for three li to reach Shuanglong Cave and Binghu Cave. Because it was very cold at the time, he could not enter the cave. He only hired someone from Shuanglong Tea Shop to guide him around the area for a week. It was a pity that he did not see the crystal curtain of the Binghu Cave's stunning scenery.

Lanxi

From Jinhua to Lanxi, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line, which can be reached in only two hours. Lanxi used to belong to Jinhua Prefecture, but it was abolished as a county after the Republic of China. In the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Government designated it as an experimental county. After several years of hard work, each township in Lanxi County has a good organization and order. Lanxi is a large city with hundreds of thousands of people. In addition to the county seat, Youbu, Zhuge, Yongchang, Nubu, and other places are very lively market towns. Each town is connected to the county seat by highway bus, and it is also an important place in eastern Zhejiang.

Establishing an Alcohol Factory

Lanxi is the hub of the Wu, Qu, and Yong three ports. The county seat is located at the junction of the three ports. Therefore, Zhejiang's commerce is centered on Ningbo along the coast, Hangzhou in the interior, and Lanxi for freight transportation in the canal region of eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, due to the war-time environment, Lanxi is not only an important place for waterway transportation in various places, but also a collection point for commerce in eastern Zhejiang today, making it even more prosperous. Lanxi County's annual agricultural output is more than 2.6 million dan, with sugarcane as the most important product, with an annual output of about 160,000. There are also handicrafts such as papermaking, oil extraction, tobacco silk, sugar, ham, and livestock. In terms of industry, there are also several factories. Recently, people from Jinhua and Lanxi jointly established an alcohol factory. It is said that the quality of the products is good, and this newly emerging industrial undertaking is also worthy of our attention. (The End)

### Enemy Troops Attacking Lushan Are Exhausted and Weary Repeated Attacks Repelled by Us Now Stationed at the Foot of the Mountain Without the Strength to Attack

[Central 社 Nanchang, 19th] The enemy in northern Jiangxi has repeatedly attempted to harass our isolated troops in Lushan, but has failed and suffered heavy casualties. Because our army has good cover, the enemy is attacked by our stones and rocks when they reach the mountainside, causing countless casualties. Each time they are defeated, those who are wounded or killed grab branches, often filling three or four trucks.

### China's Unification - Retrospect and Recent Developments

- By Mao Na, Representative of the International Anti-Aggression League

In 1932, Sukorski published a book entitled "Asia's Tinderbox," in which he said on page 52:

"China's previous history of internal strife has not been a pleasant thing to look back on. Individually, the Chinese are a lovely people; as a group, they are in a state of anarchy and disorganization in the current situation."

Mr. Su's readers call him the author who knows the Chinese situation best, so his words are worthy of attention. On page 293, he also said:

"Internal wars and revolutions, China will have several more years, which can be said to be a natural and immutable public opinion. In China, internal wars have become commonplace, and people are not surprised. Through this way, China slightly changes its political and social system."

On pages 317 to 318, it is further said:

"China's constantly unchanged internal wars promote foreign aggression and the danger of disintegration. Perhaps the Chinese do not know it, but the internal wars will continue."

Japan painstakingly prepared to invade China, split China, and annex China. Sukorski saw these step-by-step plans clearly. The foreign troubles were so serious, but China's civil war continued for four years after 1932 until it suddenly stopped at the end of 1936. The first half of the following year (1937) can be said to be China's model year. Why? Please see the writings of the American Commercial Counselor, Mr. Bret:

"China's financial stability has been maintained, and there has been progress in the unification of the currency system. ...The harvest of rice, the output of tung oil and cotton are all very good. In mid-July 1937, in general, things were more optimistic and exciting than at any time in previous years."

In addition to the items listed on the right, there is an even more important fact: for the first time in Chinese history, she could borrow money from the West in the summer of 1937 without collateral. But then the Japanese came, and the notorious July 7th Incident broke out!

But this is not surprising. In 1931, the opportunity for China's revival once came, because at that time, the League of Nations prepared a large-scale and multi-faceted aid program to China, which was about to be implemented. However, Japan seized this important opportunity and quickly used the Nakamura Incident as an excuse to attack Shenyang and seize Manchuria in order to destroy it.

At the end of 1936, the Communist Party and the Central Government no longer fought. The last of the groups that could not cooperate in the past were also gone, and China was about to be unified. However, eight months later, Japan came again and did another big thing. This time, it was not occupying Manchuria but advancing into North China. The devil's hand stretched into the interior of China. At this time, China had no civil war. Did Japan advance because of China's civil war and need to maintain order? Or was it afraid of greater rebellion against the Central Government? Although these excuses could not be found, Japan also rushed to attack, regardless of everything. With such aggression, China naturally had to rise up and resist. Seeing that it could no longer slowly nibble on the country, Japan changed its policy of gradual encroachment and even妄wanted to annex the whole of China. (To be continued)

### Journey to Sui and Zao

— Special Correspondent Ya of This Newspaper

Victory is at Hand

In Xiangyang, I heard that the Division No. ×× had several vehicles to transport military supplies to Sui County. This county is a stronghold that threatens the × people to the northeast to protect Wuhan, and in the south, it shields an important battlefield for our resistance in central Hubei -- the opportunity was rare, so I went to contact them to hitch a ride for an inspection.

The vehicle was at Village ××, ×× li outside Fancheng, and we went there around 3 p.m. or so. Along the way, the setting sun was in the west, and military songs rose from all around, the sound waves were exciting and majestic, which made people excited. When we arrived, I contacted Mr. Wen, who was in charge, and he agreed to let me hitch a ride early the next morning. Mr. Wen also said that although the troops stationed in the surrounding countryside were far away from the city, each had a radio, so the news from all sides was not isolated. The number of our main force has now increased to more than 200 divisions, and all the old-fashioned guns have been replaced with new and sharp weapons. One-third of the strength is equipped for guerrilla warfare behind the ×, one-third is fighting on various battlefields, and the rest are stepping up training in the rear near the war zone. In short, all the strength of the war of resistance is stronger than in the first stage, and victory is at hand.

The Heroic Words of Honor Soldiers

The next morning, we took the car eastward from Fancheng. The weather was clear and pleasant, which made people more wary, fearing that enemy planes would come to welcome us. After passing Zhangjia Village and Shuangdian, everything was still peaceful. When we were about to reach Zao Yang, we suddenly saw large groups of soldiers marching on foot on the road. We saw rabbits and deer in the wheat fields and bushes, and everyone scattered to hunt them. The driver knew what was going on and stopped the car to tell us to disperse. At that time, the bells in the wild villages were ringing very urgently, and soon we saw enemy planes circling in the sky.

Several soldiers insisted on leaving, saying that it was just an unimportant reconnaissance plane. The officer did not allow them to move, saying that the sound of the plane was very heavy and turbid, and he was afraid that there would be other bombers coming. So they impatiently lay down on the grass again.

"Comrades! You are truly admirable, your injuries have just healed and you are going to bravely step onto the front line again." I already knew that they were brothers of the Honor Brigade.

"What are you talking about? We are very ashamed that we didn't drive away the Japanese invaders and we were wounded. Damn it! Now it's finally better, and we're really happy to be back on the front line. This time, we will definitely kill all the Japanese, or we will fight to the death on the front line -- I've been wounded twice, and I'm too embarrassed to come down with injuries again this time."

"...We don't hold guns and do the same as you, that's really..."

"You're too kind!" Another brother immediately jumped in and said, "Now fighting a war, the front and the rear are equally important. If there are no people working hard in the rear, helping the front line in combat, such as stretcher transport, construction, etc., we can't win by ourselves."

"Yes," the one who spoke to me earlier said again, "What's more, now that we are fighting a war, soldiers and civilians should be as one. Soldiers are the people, and the people are the soldiers. If we love each other and work together, we can drive away the Japanese."

They also told me, "When we were fighting in Shanghai, the Air Defense Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs issued gas masks, which were well-made, durable, and beautiful, each costing about 16 yuan in national currency. Unfortunately, some brothers were not used to using them. They thought they were cumbersome to carry, so they casually discarded them or removed the glass parts and used them as dry food bags. But now everyone knows the stakes, and no matter what cruel weapons the Japanese use, everyone will be careful to guard against them." It can be seen that in the second phase of the war of resistance, the spirit and equipment of our frontline soldiers have made great progress compared with the first phase.

Towns are More Prosperous Than Cities

The air raid alert was lifted, and we continued to advance. We only knew that the enemy planes had bombed and wreaked havoc in the city when we passed Zao Yang Station. Along the main roads, there were old and newly built bunkers. There were especially many from Zao Yang to Sui County. Many mountain villages and fortresses had been planned early and well-prepared for emergencies. Folk weapons in Sui and Zao counties total more than ten thousand rifles. There are also the Huangdao Society, the Big Knife Society, and the Red Spear Society, which were all the rage for a time. They use common weapons such as broadswords, spears, and long guns, which have not yet been included in the statistics. Their latent power in the Henan-Hubei border area is very large, and they have been reorganized into the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Guards, led by the county government, to assist the army and participate in guerrilla warfare. Other formal guerrilla teams under the command of the Guerrilla Headquarters in the Henan-Hubei border area and the Guerrilla Headquarters in northern Hubei have a political foundation, strong cadres, and good discipline, just like the frontline resistance army.

The civilian houses, agencies, and even the city walls in Sui County have been changed from their old appearance. The collapsed and broken walls are covered with blood stains, all bearing the inevitable honorable wounds of national revival. This is not entirely due to the enemy planes' wanton destruction, because since the enemy army has been waiting across the Ze River south of the city since last winter, their artillery positions high on the Red Clay Mountain in eastern Hebei can bombard the city. But etiquette dictates reciprocity, and our artillery can also fire at the enemy artillery surveying stations from afar, repeatedly hitting their vital points, so the rumbling sound is intermittent.

The population in the city has been evacuated to the rear, especially the towns and cities in the four villages. Most of the commercial and economic agencies have moved west to Village ××. That night, we detoured from Sui County to Village ××, and it was already past 10 o'clock. At night, the lights in the town were like paintings, and the noise of people was boiling. They were still rushing to the night market. The prices of cloth, foreign goods, and Japanese goods transported from Wuhan were more than twice as low as in Xiangfan. In addition, many members of the political work teams of various divisions and regiments and the battlefield service corps gathered there to work, and they had the support of the excellent local farmers. Whether it was performing dramas and singing, organizing and training the masses, or escorting new recruits to the rear, the work could proceed smoothly and achieve great success. The good social order and the stability of the general public's hearts made people from the rear all the more praised.

### The Silk Industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces is Almost Completely Destroyed, Silk Factories in Various Places Have Been Looted by the Japanese Side, and Silk is Collected at Low Prices, Sucking the Marrow and Blood of Our Farmers

[Shanghai Correspondence] In recent years, the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been actively promoted by the government to improve production, and output has greatly increased, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total and a major part of foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of the two provinces, the silk industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been ravaged. The Japanese side is also carrying out economic aggression, plotting to plunder and control it. The silk industry has now been almost completely destroyed. The details are as follows after inquiring from various relevant parties:

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Abundant Silk Production

Due to the suitable climate and fertile land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are very suitable for the breeding of silkworms and mulberries, their output accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's total and occupies an important position in foreign trade. Since the Ministry of Industry of the government carefully planned and established silk districts in order to improve the silk industry and increase production in the 21st year of the Republic of China, it ordered improved silkworm species from the United States, established training institutes for silkworm rearing personnel, and organized large-scale silk factories. Production has made even greater progress. It can produce more than 3.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs and export more than 1 million dans of raw silk every year, breaking previous production records and laying the foundation for overseas markets.

After the Fall, It Was Tragically Ravaged

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the mulberry fields in various districts have been tragically ravaged, and the Japanese army has forcibly uprooted the mulberry seedlings, making the damage difficult to estimate. Later, in order to plot to plunder China's silk industry, the Japanese side sent Mukuno, Kubota Masashi, and Sase Akira, who were familiar with the situation in China, to various silkworm-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to conduct surveys. Suzuki Kakuzaburo, a former employee of Mitsui & Co., colluded with the traitor Zhang Zizhen and others, and organized the "Huiming Company" in Wuxi last summer, merging the original Heyan, Zhenyi, Anyu, Fulun, Zhenyuan and other silk factories, with a total of more than 2,000 silk factories. The capital was set at 50 million, with Hoshi Chuyu, a Japanese, as the manager, and Zhang Zizhen as the assistant manager. The source of its raw materials is all forcibly seized from the people in various districts, or forced to buy at low prices. All silkworm cocoons are also looted. Therefore, the company has only been in operation for a few months by the end of last year, but it has made a huge profit of more than 2 million. In fact, it is all the marrow and blood of the silkworm farmers.

China Central Company Plots to Control

The "Huiming Company" was reorganized into the "China Central Silk Company" after August last year, and intensified its aggressive conspiracy, hoping to implement control of the silk industry in Central China, and formulated various plans to manage silkworm eggs and mulberry fields. Starting from January this year, the fake "China Central Company" has put forward the following conditions to various seedbeds: (1) The company must send one Japanese manager to each seedbed to stay there permanently and manage everything, and the salary is borne by the seedbed; (2) The silkworm eggs are distributed by the company, and must not be reproduced or distributed; (3) The silkworm eggs are purchased by the company; (4) Half of the payment for the eggs is paid first when the eggs are made, and the rest depends on the silkworm harvest; (5) The company has the right to modify the regulations at any time. The above measures have been repeatedly convened by the Japanese side to hold meetings for various seedbed owners, but because the general seedbed owners are well aware of the righteous cause and are motivated by patriotic indignation and are unwilling to be slaughtered by them, they have refused to participate. Therefore, this conspiracy of the Japanese side has not yet been fully implemented.

Only Small Silk Factories Remain in the Interior

Under the heavy pressure of the Japanese side on the silk production of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the larger silk factories originally opened in Hang, Jia, Hu, Xi, and Chang and other places have been looted. However, the Japanese side does not attach importance to small silk factories with ten or twenty silk machines. Therefore, some silk industry personnel and farmers have scraped together a small amount of capital to purchase several silk machines and set up small silk factories in various villages. Because the processing fees are low, they can still make a slight profit. Those with more capital have moved to the Shanghai concession and set up factories to start work. According to the survey, there are 37 silk factories in Shanghai, including Yihe Silk Factory, Shanghai Silk Factory, and Tongren Silk Factory, with a total of more than 6,000 silk machines. Currently, the overseas Chinese market price is 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per dan, so the business of each factory is still going well. Since the establishment of the "China Central Company", the source of raw materials will become a problem in the future.

### The Situation in Europe is Increasingly Urgent, Romania Prepares for Protection, and Peaceful Countries Cooperate

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] After Romania refused the economic ultimatum proposed by Germany, and seeing the serious situation, King Carol of Romania quickly convened a royal conference last night. The leaders of the Romanian army attended the meeting. The meeting expressed satisfaction with the diplomatic and military steps taken by the authorities, believing that they were sufficient to guarantee the integrity of Romanian territory. As a result, a "sacred union" similar to that of France in 1914 appeared, bringing together leaders from all factions.

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Official sources have confirmed that the Romanian authorities have recently taken "certain steps" to defend the country's borders, but said that these steps are of a "peacetime" nature. It is also said that Romanian soldiers have not crossed the border, and the army has not been mobilized. According to another official report, the economic delegation of Sweden (led by Mr. Huldah) is conducting commercial negotiations in Romania, which will end in two days. The negotiations are continuing in accordance with the commercial agreement between Germany and Romania in November last year. The purpose is to exchange certain products.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Today, the official announcement of the German-Romanian economic negotiations: "The German-Romanian economic negotiations are held in Rome. The situation is still normal. The subject of the negotiations and the problems of this kind of negotiation are nothing special. What is discussed is how to increase the exchange of goods, etc. If there is anything beyond this scope, as reported by the British press, it can be regarded as an act of deliberately strengthening the international tension and spreading malicious air. From this, it can be seen that the so-called German ultimatum to Romania is completely unfounded."

British Cabinet Meets to Review the Overall Situation

[Reuters, London, 18th] The British Cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 5 p.m. this afternoon. All cabinet members attended except for Simmonds, who was on a nautical vacation, and Hoare, who was unable to attend due to stomach problems. It is heard that the overall situation has been reviewed. Hundreds of people gathered on Downing Street to await news, which required the deployment of additional police to maintain order. This shows the attention of the general public. It has not yet been decided when to hold another cabinet meeting, but the Prime Minister will remain in the city this weekend to maintain contact.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] The inner pavilion held an important meeting in the afternoon to discuss the situation in Europe, which lasted until 7:25 p.m. Prime Minister Chamberlain rushed back from the city of Birmingham to preside over the meeting. All cabinet members attended except for Privy Counselor Simmonds, who is currently traveling abroad. Olsen, the leader of the Conservative Party in the Lower House, was also invited to participate. Although the cabinet may not meet tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain has asked all cabinet members to stay in the capital so that meetings can be held at any time. The Prime Minister himself will also suspend the usual weekend vacation and stay at home. The Imperial Defense Committee held a meeting before the cabinet meeting.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Eden and Foreign Secretary Halifax had a meeting for 20 minutes before the cabinet meeting today.

[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, "Foreign Secretary Halifax received the ambassadors of France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Germany today to discuss the situation caused by Germany's economic demands on Romania and Romania's request for guarantees from Britain. The Romanian ambassador, Tilia, visited Halifax last night to inform him of the note presented by Germany to Romania and to state the importance of Anglo-Romanian relations. Romania has decided to resist with all its strength any German or other territorial aggression. When the information about the German military mobilization spread throughout London, London immediately denied it completely, with the intention of making Germany change its attitude. Recalling the Czech incident in September last year, Germany made a similar request to Hungary, namely, Hungary should maintain its agricultural status and limit the number of its troops. From this, it can be seen that Germany has already involved Hungary in its economic sphere of influence and knows its limited military strength. Now, it is making further preparations to control Romania from an economic and political perspective. After Halifax discussed with the representatives of various countries this morning, it can be used as a reference when the cabinet meeting is held this afternoon to discuss the attitude of the Central State. Although the German side strongly stated that the German ambassador's visit to the Foreign Secretary was a diplomatic custom, Halifax took this opportunity to repeatedly express to the German ambassador that Britain still could not regard Germany's forcible occupation of Czechoslovakia as a legitimate act."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] Foreign Minister Bonnet received Romanian Ambassador Tilia, British Ambassador Phipps, and Soviet Ambassador Surits this afternoon to discuss the situation in Europe. His meeting with the Romanian Ambassador lasted for more than an hour. The ambassador immediately stated that the rumors that the Romanian army had been mobilized and that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Romania were all unfounded. In addition, British Ambassador Sir Phipps had a brief conversation with Prime Minister Daladier in the House of Commons.

Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union Will Adopt a Common Policy

[Reuters, London, 19th] Today, the newspapers here are publishing the news that Romania is seeking help from Britain regarding Germany's economic ultimatum and its possible consequences. The general readers have learned of the crisis in Europe from the newspapers. The newspapers are also discussing the unity and cooperation of several countries in a prominent position, saying that a group has been formed, led by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and supported by Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. According to some diplomatic correspondents, the British cabinet meeting last night discussed this proposal, but since it needs to be discussed with the autonomous region, there is no decision yet. It is also widely rumored that peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will hold a meeting to adopt a common and consistent policy. What actions the countries will take in the future are still unknown. It is generally believed that Hitler and his close advisors gathered in Vienna last night to hold a meeting, keeping their future actions strictly secret. However, the people everywhere know that German troops are currently advancing eastward, and the destination is unknown. According to a Times reporter in Warsaw, Poland and Hungary have a common border, and Germany can use this to reach Romania. Poland and Hungary have begun military and political negotiations. According to a report from a certain place, the general staff of Poland and Romania will begin negotiations today. In addition, the Times reporter learned that the Romanian ambassador here, Tilia, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax on Friday and said that the 44th German Division (half in Czechoslovakia and the other half mobilized in Germany) is currently preparing to advance eastward. The reporter also said that Romania believes that even if Germany intends to attack Romania, it will not be able to do anything within ten days.

[Haitong Agency, London, 19th] British Autonomous Region Minister Inskipp notified the governors of South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia yesterday afternoon of the British government's attitude towards the situation in Central Europe.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] All sectors in Britain recognize that the situation in Central Europe may become more severe after Germany made economic demands on Romania. However, there is no expression of panic here. The stock market has also stabilized after Chamberlain's speech, and all sectors are increasingly convinced that Britain will take a tougher stance. However, Britain will carefully avoid getting involved in the war unless its main interests are directly harmed.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Tonight, the newspapers here are using Romania's construction of national defense as the main headline. Although Romanian officials have denied mobilization, the foreign editor of the "Standard Evening News" published that Romania has indeed ordered the mobilization of five military regiments, and said that King Carol has expressed to the British government that if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can strongly assist, he can guarantee to attract Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia to form a united front and cooperate.

### Britain and the Soviet Union Will Begin Political Cooperation, Hudsons Arrives in Warsaw Last Night, Britain and Poland Discuss Economic Cooperation

[Haitong Agency, London, 18th] The Times published an article commenting on the importance of Commerce Minister Hudson's planned visits to Warsaw, Moscow, and the capitals of Northern Europe, saying that economic cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is getting closer, which is also the beginning of political cooperation between the two countries. Hudson will go directly to Warsaw and Moscow without stopping in the German capital. According to news from Warsaw, the Polish side attaches great importance to it. Hudson left Britain today and will arrive in Poland on the evening of the 19th. Hudson and his party will meet Gu Huajin, Laikeer, and Kehan in Beijing. After arriving in Poland, Hudson will separately visit Minister of Industry and Commerce Roman, Foreign Minister Colonel Burke, and Finance Minister Jiaduofuya, and sign the guest book in the palace. The purpose of the talks in Warsaw is to make economic cooperation between Britain and Poland closer. It is heard that the Polish side is most concerned about seeking the assistance of British financial resources to develop the automobile industry. Another more important issue is the development of the Vistula River and the full improvement of the ports in the inland of Pilan. Poland will seek a loan of 100 million Polish coins from Britain and give Poland the convenience of purchasing a large amount of raw materials. The departure of the British commercial delegation has caused great diplomatic activity among the countries of the Baltic Sea. According to a "Jiebao" report from Beijing, the Polish Minister to Kaunas (Lithuanian capital) visited the Prime Minister of Lithuania yesterday. At the same time, the Polish Minister to Latvia also met with the Latvian Foreign Minister. According to political sources here, when the Lithuanian Foreign Minister returns to his country from Italy via Berlin, he will also meet with the Nazis.

### It is rumored that Hitler Advised the Italian Prime Minister Not to Impose on France and Somalia Temporarily

[Reuters, London, 18th] After Sweden annexed Czechoslovakia, the attitudes of Hungary and Italy are still unclear. It is also unknown what new moves Germany may take in the future. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Observer" said that Hitler has stated to Mussolini that he should not make any territorial demands on France at present, but can make demands regarding Tunisia, so that he can apply the method of Hitler's seizure of the Sudetenland in the future.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] Italian newspapers have resumed their attacks on France today, saying that the authorities in Tunisia have treated Italians improperly. The newspapers report that 1,500 Italian overseas Chinese in Tunisia have decided to return to their country within this week.

### The United States Implements Economic Pressure on Germany, Levies Additional Taxes on German Goods Immediately, and Will Announce the Exchange of Documents between the United States and Germany

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] The Treasury Department announced that starting from March 23, an additional tax of 25% will be levied on imported German goods. Responsible officials here recently elaborated that this move is actually the first step in the United States taking an offensive against the German economy. US trade has fallen sharply since the President canceled the most-favored-nation treatment for Germany last year, and will almost completely stop thereafter. US business circles originally planned to exchange goods with Germany, but now there is no way to realize it. The blow to German trade will inevitably be more serious.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Undersecretary of State Welles said today that the U.S. Department of State is prepared to announce the exchange of official documents between the U.S. and Germany to clarify the U.S.'s position. The U.S.'s notification of Germany's launch of a political coup in Central Europe was sent out last night in a reply. The U.S. Department of State expects to decide on the future status of the current Minister to Czechoslovakia within a few days.

### Pittman to Propose New Neutrality Act

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will propose a new neutrality bill to the Senate on the 20th, advocating the repeal of the current neutrality law and authorizing the President to: (1) designate belligerents within 30 days of the outbreak of war; (2) prohibit American merchant ships from carrying any goods to the designated belligerent countries; (3) allow belligerent countries to purchase various items, including armaments, from the United States, but only for cash and self-transportation; (4) prohibit lending credit to belligerent countries; (5) exempt American countries that do not participate in the war in the Americas from the above provisions.

### Benes to Organize Provisional Government in the US

[Reuters, Los Angeles, 10th] According to the Czech consul here, former Czech President Dr. Benes will soon announce the formation of a provisional government in the United States.

### Hitler Arrives in Berlin, German Troops Advance East from Prague, Hungarian Troops Occupy Ruthenia, Germany Expresses Willingness to Recognize

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 19th] Official sources report that Hitler is scheduled to return to Berlin at 6:30 PM tonight.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Hitler appeared on the balcony of a hotel in Linz today, where he was greeted with cheers from the crowd. He then toured the area in a military vehicle and visited several new factories. Therefore, his return to Berlin has been postponed.

[Reuters, Prague, 18th] Most of the German troops have left Prague, reportedly moving eastward. Prague is calm today, with no mechanized units moving through the streets and traffic flowing freely. However, planes have been circling overhead all day, creating a constant rumble.

[Reuters, Prague, 19th] According to reports from Bratislava, the German section of the Slovak Ministry of Education has decided that the education of Slovak children must be conducted in the spirit of the Nazi Party from now on. From May onwards, teachers must be Aryan, portraits of Hitler must be hung in all schools, and the Nazi salute must be enforced.

[Central News Agency, Hungary, 18th] Hungarian troops have completely occupied Ruthenia.

[Reuters, Sighetu Marmatiei, Romania, 18th] Today, near Borsa, Ruthenia, fierce fighting broke out between Ukrainians and Hungarian troops. The Ukrainian guard units put up strong resistance, forcing the Hungarians to quickly send reinforcements from Rakhiv until 4:30 AM. The guard units have been repelled, and 350 of them fled into Romania. Many Ruthenian cabinet members, along with their families, have left for Zagreb to meet with Prime Minister Volosin. They will then go to Vienna, where the Ukrainian propaganda department is located, which is the center of the Ukrainian independence movement.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Well-informed sources here have recently stated that the German government has informed Hungary that it is willing to recognize the annexation of Ruthenia.

### British Military Aircraft Crashes, Four Killed

[Haitong Agency, London, 19th] A British military aircraft crashed near Glasgow yesterday, killing four people.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 19th] It has been learned that the Soviet ambassador, Surits, still refuses to hand over the property of the former Czech embassy to the German embassy. The French government will remain silent on this matter.

### Soviet Union Protests to Germany, Does Not Recognize Annexation of Czech Republic, Promises Aid to Romania if Invaded, Germany Rejects French Protest

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has protested to Germany that the Soviet Union cannot recognize Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The Soviet Union remains silent on Germany's pressure on Romania, awaiting official information. However, this silence does not mean that the Soviet authorities are not deeply concerned about their most dangerous enemy, Germany, getting closer to its borders. Well-informed sources believe that if Romania's integrity is threatened, the Soviet Union's interests in Ukraine will be greatly affected, and strong measures will inevitably be taken. These strong measures may be similar to those taken against China. The Soviet Union established friendly relations with China and has provided material assistance to China since Japan's invasion of China. In view of Stalin's speech at the Communist Party Congress on the 10th of this month, recognizing that Germany's outward expansion is westward, Germany's actions may surprise the Soviet Union. However, since the Munich Conference, the division of Czechoslovakia has long been anticipated. Another passage from Stalin's speech is also important: "We are willing to help countries that are invaded and fighting for independence."

### Fall of Czechoslovakia Shocks Switzerland, President Etter Broadcasts, Resolves to Uphold Freedom and Independence

[Reuters, Bern, Switzerland, 18th] Swiss President Etter said in a broadcast today that Switzerland is shocked by the fall of Czechoslovakia. Although the Swiss people declare their rights and obligations of neutrality, they are determined to uphold freedom and independence at any cost.

[Reuters, Pretoria, South Africa, 18th] It has been learned from official sources that the South African authorities canceled police leave this weekend and ordered reservists to report, reportedly in response to the Czech incident.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Officials announced that Germany has informed the British and French ambassadors that the government considers the protests from the two countries to be completely lacking in political, legal, and moral basis, and therefore refuses to accept them.

### Henderson Returns to England, French Ambassador Also to Return Home, Germany Recalls Ambassador to England

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] British Ambassador Henderson looked unusually cheerful when he left Germany for England tonight. Embassy staff went to the port to see him off, but no German officials were present, proving that Henderson's return was completely unofficial. French Ambassador Coulondre will return to France on Monday.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] German Ambassador to England Dirksen has been ordered to return home for consultations.

### France Intensifies Preparations, Chamber of Deputies Grants Premier Special Powers, Newspapers Comment on Significant Meaning

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Official sources report that after the Senate approved the Daladier plenary powers bill, the cabinet will hold a meeting this afternoon.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The Chamber of Deputies passed the Premier plenary powers bill by a vote of 321 to 264. An amendment proposed by former cabinet member Monnet was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 313 to 262.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The Chamber of Deputies has approved in principle the bill granting special powers to the government. Daladier will use his special powers to abolish the 40-hour work week system, obtain mandatory increased credit security, and extend military service from two to three years.

Daladier: Defend the Borders

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The Senate Finance Committee passed the Daladier plenary powers bill this morning, with only two dissenting votes. Daladier said, "The seriousness of the foreign situation makes it extremely reasonable for me to make this request. I must be able to take immediate military and economic steps to defend our country's borders." It is generally believed that the important steps are: (1) increasing the number of troops; (2) increasing arms production; (3) stockpiling raw materials; (4) giving priority to the military nature of privately funded industries; (5) establishing new industries and their financial management; (6) revising laws so that the government can requisition labor and buildings in wartime; (7) increasing working hours in private industries related to arms manufacturing.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 18th] According to comments in Parisian newspapers, the recent events in Central Europe have greatly shaken the French government. The fact that the Chamber of Deputies Finance Committee was able to pass the Daladier authorization bill by a vote of 26 to 10 is of great significance. The government is currently seeking full powers to increase the country's military strength. The Prime Minister's current plan is to concentrate on eliminating the 40-hour work week system in the arms industry. Although the government's issue of confidence with the Chamber of Deputies has been severely hit, it is heard that the current cabinet will still be unanimously supported when the meeting is held this afternoon. The "Matin" newspaper commented that since the Prague incident, France must intensify preparations and strengthen unity. French fascist leader Rocque published an article in the "Petit Journal," demanding the election of a true French leader and the establishment of a new government on a broad basis.

### US Army Begins Recruitment Drive, Training Young Pilots

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The US Army today began a large-scale nationwide recruitment drive to train young pilots and supplement the congressional bill to increase the Army by 3,000 aircraft. The military will send commissioners to various universities to examine and recruit graduates in June to participate in training.

### Suicide Cases Increasing in Prague, Thanks to Hitler!

[Reuters, Prague, 19th] Suicide cases are increasing here. Renowned surgeon Miel and his wife committed suicide by taking poison after learning of the German invasion of the city. Twenty Jews were sent to the hospital after attempting suicide, including a High Court judge and a former bank manager. Another person committed suicide by jumping from the roof of the radio station building.

Short Commentary

### Strengthening the Line of Peace

After Germany once again broke its promises and annexed the Czech Republic, the situation in Europe has become more serious and critical. The democratic and peaceful countries are also facing increasing difficulties and dangers. Therefore, news of the great unity of democratic countries and the strengthening of the line of peace has repeatedly appeared in the newspapers. Among the most noteworthy facts are:

1.  The United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union have successively declared that they will not recognize Germany's illegal annexation of Czechoslovakia.

2.  The US government formally sent a note on the 19th pointing out Germany's actions, and the US Treasury Department also announced an increase in import duties on German goods.

3.  Diplomatic circles in London criticized Chamberlain's policy on the 19th as a complete failure.

4.  The London Times commented on the 18th on the importance of Commerce Minister Hudson's plan to visit Warsaw, Moscow, and the capitals of Northern Europe, pointing out that closer Anglo-Soviet economic cooperation is the beginning of Anglo-Soviet political cooperation.

5.  The French President is scheduled to visit the United States on the 21st to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the unity of democratic countries. We cannot yet fully trust the power of the peace front today, and we cannot help but feel that it is too late. However, if we simultaneously observe the aggressive group's appearance of strength but internal weakness, and simultaneously observe that the broad masses of people in democratic and peaceful countries who seek freedom and the broad masses of oppressed people around the world will unanimously strive to support the peace front, then success or failure will be known without waiting for the alarm. I sincerely hope that my compatriots in our country who are bravely resisting the war will each make greater efforts!

### Germany Continues Eastern Aggression!

After occupying Czechoslovakia, the German aggressors are now actively preparing to continue their eastward aggression. A large number of German troops have left Prague and are moving east, with Romania and Yugoslavia as potential targets. Romania has already begun mobilization to prepare for resistance and has requested assistance from the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. According to observations from prominent newspapers in London (including The Times), Hitler's ambition is insatiable. After one success, he immediately makes a second advance. It is especially noteworthy that the target of the German invasion today is not the often-propagated invasion of Soviet Russia, but rather a move towards the southeast, attempting to create a Germany that dominates the Mediterranean and Central Europe! This should especially serve as a warning to democratic and peaceful countries. We must especially point out here that, first, due to the internal difficulties and crises of the aggressors themselves, they do not yet have the courage to immediately invade the powerful Soviet Union; second, the aggressors' future ambitions are no longer to redistribute colonies, but to re-divide Europe. After several small and weak nations are conquered, their blade will be directed towards the capitalist democracies that have previously assisted the aggressors with their policy of compromise!

### Congratulations to the New Writing Society

Although the Latinized New Writing is only an attempt in China to eliminate illiteracy and develop a mass culture, experimental results from various parties have shown that it is more complete than past Romanized spelling methods, and it is an easier-to-teach, easier-to-learn, and easier-to-use tool. The Central Propaganda Department praised it last year, and the experimental results in Shanghai and other valleys were especially satisfactory. In the past, enthusiastic people in Hong Kong have worked hard to promote it, but it has long lacked a complete plan. Furthermore, it has been viewed with suspicion by some people. It has not achieved the results it should have. It is now learned that the Hong Kong government has approved the registration of the New Writing Society, and the inaugural meeting is being prepared. It has also been decided to open more day and night classes for enrollment. While we are pleased, we hope that the association can stand on a purely academic and literary research position to develop the mass culture, and that the media should work to serve the people and promote culture. Do your best to help each other.

### After the Partition of Czechoslovakia, Will Germany and Hungary Reach a Compromise? (Part 2)

— Dong Pingduo

The Inside Story of Hungary's Seizure of Ruthenia

Here, Hungary should be mentioned. She will never forget that today's Carpatho-Ukraine is her former territory. This is the reason for her military advance and forceful occupation and joint division. Moreover, she, like Germany, is adept at promoting secret struggles.

Because in recent years, German-Hungarian relations have been very close, so everyone is embarrassed to publicly break faces. Both sides are secretly mobilizing troops and generals, and fighting each other with a heart of balance.

In Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary has also long ago set up her spy network. A few years ago, in Vienna, I met an unusually famous Czech journalist whose title was the editor-in-chief of the Ruthenian "Truth Newspaper." He often traveled to Vienna. Later, I learned that he was actually the mastermind of the Ukrainian independence movement, highly respected by the Ukrainian people. He had tried his best to promote the idea of a Greater Ukrainian independence within Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union. If Ukraine were to truly declare independence, he would definitely be the first Prime Minister. His name was Bai Luodi.

Later, I met him again. One day, I was walking with him on the streets of Vienna when suddenly he said, "Excuse me," and walked away. I saw him enter the Hungarian embassy.

Soon, I fully understood that Bai Luodi and the Hungarian embassy, moreover as expected, that was extremely important.

After the Munich Agreement, Ruthenia formally became the Carpatho-Ukraine Autonomous Region within Czechoslovakia, and its first Prime Minister was none other than Bai Luodi.

Bai Luodi ran to Prague to meet with the then Czech Prime Minister, the one-eyed General Sirovy. He suddenly made an astonishing request: for the Carpatho-Ukrainians to hold a referendum to decide the fate of their country themselves. Undoubtedly, the result of this referendum would not help Czechoslovakia but would instead help Hungary.

Sirovy was furious and jumped up, calling Bai Luodi a traitor to Czechoslovakia: "Get out of here and never let me see you again!"

Bai Luodi returned to Khust, where he immediately discovered that he had been dismissed from his post. His successor, Volosin, was an orthodox cleric.

When Hitler heard the news of Bai Luodi's unreasonable demands, he immediately ordered his secret police to search for all information and materials about Bai Luodi. They rushed to Vienna and thoroughly searched Bai Luodi's residence, eventually finding a piece of evidence: a signed agreement between Bai Luodi and the Hungarian government. In it, Bai Luodi agreed to hand over Carpatho-Ukraine to Hungary. His reward was 600,000 yuan, two fiefs, and the title of Baron.

So, Hitler sent this evidence to the Czech government, which immediately ordered Bai Luodi's arrest. The next morning, among the planes taking off from the newly built airport in Khust, one carried the first Prime Minister of Carpatho-Ukraine, now as a prisoner, to Prague.

Bai Luodi was accused of treason, disloyalty, and corruption and was prepared to be sentenced to a severe punishment. Germany repeatedly exerted pressure from behind, demanding that Bai Luodi be executed. However, by Christmas, Bai Luodi had been released.

So now it is time to pay attention to the successor, Volosin. He is a Catholic missionary. In Carpatho-Ukraine, few people other than priests can read and write, so it is not surprising that a missionary official is appointed as Prime Minister.

Although Volosin had no reputation before the Munich Agreement, he rose to high office in one step. He is now a key figure in the current new crisis in Europe.

Volosin's goal is to do his best to establish the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine. This is exactly what Hitler approved and deeply encouraged.

The Hungarian government naturally does not agree with this. Not long ago, the Hungarian people paraded and demonstrated on the streets of Khust, and their attitude was extremely excited, often making demands. Finally, this time, they took advantage of the fire to rob, marched in and occupied the entire Carpatho-Ukraine, finally fulfilling their long-cherished wish.

But things are definitely not that simple. Although everything seems to have come to an end and is peaceful, Hitler will never generously give away a piece of land that he has worked so hard to cultivate for many years. What's more, with this piece of land as a pillar, there is a more distant goal - to seize the rich Soviet Ukraine - to achieve!

Hitler will not be too quiet. Wait. In that small place, it will eventually be a source of international news.

### Japanese Goods Flood Hong Kong, European and American Goods Suffer a Major Blow, Japanese Goods Worth 6-7 Million Dollars Sold Last Summer and Autumn Alone, European and American Merchants Urging Payment for Sales Sites, Over 20 Million Dollars Owed

Hong Kong is the general distribution center for goods in and out of southern China. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell last year, various transportation lines have been controlled by Japan, and the transportation of various goods has been difficult. At the same time, Japan has monopolized the markets in the occupied areas, so 98% of European and American goods have been occupied by Japan. Hong Kong's trade has suffered enormous losses, estimated at over 20 million dollars. It has been found that in addition to being transported to the mainland, Japanese goods also take advantage of Hong Kong's free business operations and use Hong Kong as a distribution center. Taking textiles as an example, annual sales in Hong Kong can reach 6-7 million dollars. The business situation of the entire textile industry in Hong Kong in the past year is investigated below. The textile industry in Hong Kong has always had a textile association. It has been found that there are about 120 stores in Hong Kong engaged in this industry, but only 40 have registered to join the association. Those who have not joined exceed half, amounting to about 60-70 stores. Their business nature also varies. All members of the textile association are deeply aware of the importance of opposing Japan and resisting Japan and do not sell Japanese goods. In order to make it easier for customers to identify them, they publicly hang the association certificate in front of the store to show that they are different from those who operate Japanese goods. The quantity of domestic goods they sell is larger than that of European and American goods. It has been found that in the past year, the market for European and American goods in Hong Kong was about 1 million dollars in the summer and over 3 million dollars in the autumn, while the sales of Japanese goods reached 6-7 million dollars in the summer and autumn combined. From this alone, the extent to which Hong Kong is flooded with Japanese textiles can be seen. As for European and American textiles transferred from Hong Kong to our country, the numbers were also considerable when Wuhan and Guangzhou were lost, totaling around 1 million to 1.8 million dollars. Now, only Macau and Guangzhou are left. Furthermore, it has been found that because the domestic market has been lost, the import of European and American goods has greatly decreased. It is estimated that the orders for European and American goods in the summer and autumn have decreased by about 25% to 30%, amounting to 1.5 million to 2 million dollars. Secondly, the market for Japanese goods in Hong Kong is increasing day by day. In total, Japanese goods have occupied about 20 million dollars of the textile market for European and American goods in Hong Kong.

### Abolishing Old Nickel Coins, Implementation Rescheduled for Next Month

The Hong Kong authorities, in view of the excessive complexity of circulating currencies and the mixing in of counterfeit coins, which greatly inconvenienced merchants and residents, have ordered the casting of new nickel coins in England in preparation for the conversion. It was originally planned to implement this after the Lunar New Year, but the Financial Secretary, Mr. Philip Haddon-Cave, felt that the current situation was too critical and he had no time for this. The implementation has been postponed to about a month later, at which time a public announcement will be made to inform the public. However, before the announcement to abolish the nickel coins, all nickel coins will continue to be valid as usual.

### Ma Tau Chung Public Housing Formally Opened Yesterday: Residents Must Meet Two Conditions

The Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, considering that Hong Kong has little land and a large population, and that refugees are constantly arriving, and that ordinary buildings are already full, has built forty units of public housing in Ma Tau Chung for the purpose of rescuing those who are living on the streets and those with relatively low living standards. These units will be rented out at the lowest possible rent to allow ordinary people to live there. The facilities include electric lights, water pipes, and hygiene equipment, and they were officially opened yesterday, the 19th. Currently, nearly three hundred people have registered to rent. However, the rental requirements are somewhat restrictive. Residents must have a legitimate occupation in Hong Kong and be affected by the wartime situation and housing problems. Among the three hundred-odd registered applicants, there are not many who meet the above conditions.

### Four Robbers with Weapons Rob a Cargo Boat Off the Coast of Tsz Wan: 200 Yuan Worth of Goods Stolen, Boat Driven Away

Cargo boat No. T-115, owned by Chen Lai (45 years old) from Taiping Village, Dongguan, was carrying a large quantity of timber, bamboo silk, bed frames and other goods from Taiping Village to Hong Kong on the morning of the 18th of this month. At about 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, when it sailed to the sea off Tsz Wan, a pirate boat suddenly approached head-on. There were four pirates on the boat, two with rifles and two with Mauser rifles. As soon as they got close, they ordered Chen's boat to stop. Seeing that the pirates all had guns, Chen and his crew had no choice but to stop moving forward. The pirate boat then docked alongside the cargo boat. Two pirates with rifles jumped onto the cargo boat and threatened Chen and his crew to steer the boat along with them. After the two pirates returned to the pirate boat, Chen and his crew turned the boat around and headed straight for the shore. The pirates, seeing that Chen and his crew had disobeyed, opened fire. Chen and his crew immediately jumped into the water and swam to shore to escape. Then, they saw the pirates dragging the cargo boat south. Chen and his crew had to walk to Hong Kong and arrived yesterday afternoon, and immediately went to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station to report the case. The cargo boat was worth 100 silver dollars, and the goods were worth 200 silver dollars.

### Britain Determined Not to Give Up Rights, Striving for Navigation Rights on the Pearl River: The Jinshan Steamer Will Now Operate Passenger and Cargo Services

Foreign Vessels Remaining in Guangdong Still Have No News of Returning to Hong Kong

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Jinshan steamer has sailed to Guangzhou for the third time. The first two times were for carrying food to supply foreigners on Shamian, so it only carried a small number of passengers. It was not until the third time that the number of passengers increased slightly. Now, the shipping company has decided to send a vessel back and forth every two weeks to carry passengers and cargo. According to reporters, the Jinshan steamer's resumption of service between "Guangdong" and Hong Kong is purely to fight for navigation rights on the Pearl River, to prevent the [enemy] from using Britain's abandonment as an excuse to block the waterway and achieve their sinister plan. Regarding the formal opening of the waterway, the British side is still negotiating with the [enemy], and the outcome is still unpredictable. As for the foreign vessels remaining in Guangdong, they are currently still in the river in Guangdong and there is no news of their return to Hong Kong.

### Five Hand Grenades Discovered in Yau Ma Tei Yesterday Morning

Placed in the Stairwell of a House on Shanghai Street: A Large Number of Detectives Dispatched for Thorough Investigation

At about 1:00 a.m. yesterday, Cheung Ming, a detective from the Mong Kok Chinese Detective Team, was patrolling near No. 613 Shanghai Street when he discovered a cigarette box placed at the entrance of the stairwell. Since it was right at the entrance of the stairs, it seemed to have been stored there by someone else. So, he stepped forward and inspected it with a flashlight. Unexpectedly, when he opened the box, he was shocked to find five hand grenades inside. Detective Cheung believed that the grenades were dangerous items and dared not move them rashly. So, he blew his whistle to summon his colleagues to the scene to monitor, and then telegraphed back to the Mong Kok Police Station to report. The duty assistant officer, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives and a general assistant officer to the scene to investigate. Everyone believed that the grenades were dangerous and feared that an accident would occur, so they still dared not move them. They telegraphed back to the Hong Kong Central Police Station to report. After receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched an assistant officer from the Ordnance Examination Department, accompanied by various key figures, to the discovery site to examine. It was not until about 2:00 a.m. yesterday that the five hand grenades were taken back to the police station. At the same time, an emergency order was issued, ordering police officers to set out overnight to conduct a thorough search in various places for suspicious persons. As a result, the streets adjacent to the area were in a state of martial law. Anyone coming and going who looked suspicious was immediately searched, but no results were obtained. The police are paying special attention to this hand grenade case and are determined to thoroughly investigate the owner of the grenades in order to reveal the truth.

### New Look of the Orphanage Sponsored by the Hong Kong Emergency Relief Committee Branch: A Conversation with Director He Zehong Who Arrived in Hong Kong

— Qi Zhuo

"Mom! I'm hungry!" After the calamity in Huizhou, such cries can be heard everywhere!

"After a washing, there is no money to send to Chinese schools! Only a few schools can resume classes—so they have to wander around to survive, running down the road to depravity day by day!"

——After the calamity in Huizhou, such scenes can also be seen everywhere—the disaster area ravaged by the [enemy] is painful—but the abandonment and lack of education of the little masters who will inherit our generation makes us heartbroken—and worried about the future of the nation!

After the recovery of Huizhou, some kind people who "love the young as their own" have privately donated money to entrust the towns and villages to manage the education and upbringing of orphans. However, the number of people accommodated is very small, and they tend to passively raise them, neglecting active education. The Huizhou branch of the Hong Kong Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, in the spirit of compassion, extended a helping hand to help the children in the disaster area. It has first established an orphanage in Huiyang, with the aim of combining "education" and "raising." Orphans admitted to the school are not only exempted from all tuition and miscellaneous fees, but also provided with two meals a day by the orphanage. Taking on the task of educating and raising orphans in the recovered occupied areas is, needless to say, an urgent need, and contains far-reaching significance.

In the devastated occupied areas, orphans crying for food heard this good news. In Huiyang City alone, 981 orphans immediately flocked to them. The association only allocated 1,600 yuan per month, which could only accommodate 300 people. After examinations and reviews, 683 people were rejected! This is not without regret!

The selection criteria are orphans with higher intelligence and academic ability who have suffered the most robbery. Applicants are eager to be on the list. Most of them are junior high school students applying for senior high school, and senior high school students applying for junior high school. The "struggle and suffering of the students, I wonder how the extravagant compatriots in Hong Kong would feel after hearing it!

The orphanage is located in the Huiyang Xiushui Lake County Women's Normal School, which is a good environment for educating children. The director, He Zehong, and the deputy director, Liu Yaozi, are both young people who are serious about their work. One appeals for help from the outside, and the other specializes in educational affairs internally. The two cooperate with each other and complement each other. The teachers only receive a living allowance of 20 yuan per month, and their spirit of serving the children is also admirable. The class system is divided into six classes from the first to the sixth grade, with 50 people in each class, like a complete elementary school. The organization of the orphanage is divided into educational affairs, training, and general affairs departments under the director and deputy director, which is similar to the administration of a general elementary school. As for the curriculum, it is slightly different from that of a general elementary school. The orphanage offers six subjects: 1. Mandarin (including the Three Principles of the People), 2. Wartime Knowledge, 3. Spiritual Speeches, 4. Current Affairs Explanation, 5. Simple Crafts, and 6. Physical Education (including national defense games).

It is very difficult to implement wartime child education in the recovered occupied areas. Therefore, the colleagues of the orphanage have agreed to mutually encourage each other: 1. Enduring hardship without complaint; 2. Being tireless in teaching; 3. Working hard for the cause and work; 4. Being loyal to education; 5. Creating benefits for orphans. - This is naturally a heartfelt attitude to life.

As for the principles of teaching, they are: 1. Taking doing as the center; 2. Taking initiative and self-motivation as the learning principle; 3. Taking collective self-education as the educational indicator; 4. Adapting to the needs of the War of Resistance and children. This is also a new aspect of wartime children's education. Their daily life starts with morning exercises at dawn. In the beginning, the order and hygiene of the 300-strong "mixed force" were problematic. After a week of training, it immediately showed a neat, serious, lively, and intense atmosphere. When lining up to eat in the canteen, the order is very good, like a children's army (as shown in the picture). Bowls and chopsticks are brought from home by each person, which is the only smile of the parents in their worried faces.

There are three characteristics in their entire life: (1) The curriculum is as much as possible in line with the War of Resistance, and after accepting the lessons of occupation, every child has a high degree of national awareness; (2) Simple crafts, focusing on production training, hiring skilled talents to train various small handicrafts, and now there are successive products such as woven bamboo baskets, chicken cages, and bamboo baskets for daily use (as shown in the picture). The manufacture of ink and fragrant paste is also being planned; (3) In terms of group activities, there are small group discussions and collective criticisms every day. This group of innocent and lively little masters is also using songs, dramas, propaganda... to promote the reconstruction of their homeland and the upsurge of common hatred for the enemy in Huizhou after the calamity. They are truly a group growing up in hardship. The reporter was deeply moved when listening to Mr. He's report and seeing their photos, and became more convinced of the greatness of the latent national power.

The orphanage was originally scheduled to operate on a trial basis for one month, which expired on the 12th of this month. After Director He's painstaking management and appeals in all directions, it has been decided to continue to operate for four months with the support of charitable organizations. The children and their parents are deeply grateful for their kindness.

Director He believes that it is also necessary to quickly establish orphanages in various rural areas after the calamity, such as Ping Mountain and Danshui. Therefore, he came to Hong Kong again to request assistance from the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee and Mr. Xu Shiying. The progress was quite smooth, and he will return to Huizhou during the day to continue his work.

Director He, in order to make the teaching staff of the orphanage sound and to take on the great task of training young national heroes, will use the name of the Huiyang County Party Department - he himself is the Secretary-General of the County Party Department - to set up a social service worker training class, recruit high school graduates to enter the class for training, which is scheduled to open on the 25th of this month, so that they will be assigned to various rural areas in the future to serve as teachers in orphanages and handle social services, becoming cadres of the lower-level organization. The national spirit of the post-calamity is gradually reviving. I sincerely hope that those who have money will enthusiastically donate money, and those who have the ability will work hard in earnest! So that the people can be comforted; so that the [enemy] can be warned!

### After Visiting the "Dog" Exhibition First Discovered in Hong Kong

Leisurely Pastime of the Bourgeoisie

In the morning, before eleven o'clock, luxurious cars appeared one after another in front of St. John's Square on Garden Road. Chinese and foreign men and women got out of the cars, joyfully and proudly dragging or holding their beloved dogs, as close as a loving mother taking her child for a walk outside; this kind of enjoyment, this kind of tenderness, makes some people who see it inevitably feel a little "inferior to dogs"!

A dog show is still a first in Hong Kong. The new thing has attracted many curious spectators. A one-dollar ticket cannot be said to be cheap, but the proceeds from this exhibition will be entirely allocated to the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for expenses. Although it is a narrow charitable cause, it is much better than a simple exhibition for profit.

The types of dogs participating can be roughly divided into four types: (A) Hunting Dogs: (1) Hounds (hunting dogs), which include eighteen types such as Afghan hounds, Finnish hounds, and Irish hounds; (2) Hunting dogs, divided into fifteen types; (3) Hounds, divided into ten types. (B) Non-Hunting Dogs: divided into twenty-four types such as wolfhounds, Chinese dogs, bull dogs, and St. Bernards. (C) Toy Dogs: divided into eleven types such as Pekingese and small dogs. (D) Others, including six types. The total number of dogs participating is 115, several of which were absent due to circumstances. In addition, there were fourteen cats on display in the field. Several of the female dogs in the field also brought their newly born puppies. According to their owners, they would not agree if the puppies were left at home. The dog owners or the male and female workers hired to serve them all sat with the dogs on display, constantly feeding them food or water, brushing their fur with brushes, and using silver combs to fluff up the fur to increase their beauty. The venue also displays dog food, such as biscuits; dog medicines, such as egg exterminating lotion; the completeness of food and utensils is admirable. If the packaging instructions are removed, who would know that this is specially for dogs to enjoy?

There are really many kinds of dogs displayed at the venue. Unfortunately, the reporter is not a dog breeding expert, so I cannot introduce them to the readers in detail. It is really a pity. All I can see is the difference in size. Many of them I have never seen before, which is really an eye-opener. In my opinion, each one has the qualification to be a champion. The small ones, such as Pekingese and small dogs, weigh about four or five pounds; the large ones, such as Danish dogs and St. Bernard dogs, generally weigh more than seventy or eighty pounds. The psychology of dog owners varies from person to person. Women mostly prefer petite and exquisite toy dogs, while men prefer large dogs. Naturally, there are exceptions. However, raising large dogs is quite expensive. Take the two St. Bernard dogs sent by the famous wealthy businessman Yu Dongxuan as an example. They have only been out for less than a year and are called "puppies," but they have grown almost as big as calves. It is said that these "puppies" that are less than one year old have a very good appetite and need at least one pound of beef and one pound of biscuits a day to fill their stomachs. His family also has older St. Bernard dogs, and their appetite is much greater than these "puppies." From this, we can know that raising dogs is not an easy pastime!

The judges worked hard from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, except for a short break for lunch, classifying and judging the merits of each. Each dog that wins the first prize in each category is given a blue ribbon by the exhibition, with the word "Champion" written on it, with a certificate stating the type of dog, the owner's surname, and a silver cup. The dog that wins the second prize receives a red ribbon and a certificate; the dog that wins the third prize receives a green ribbon and a certificate; and the dog that wins the finalist award receives a white ribbon and a certificate. When the Governor's wife presented the awards, the owners were naturally overjoyed. The dogs held "or dragged" by their owners seemed to have a little bit of humanity and proudly wished to be proud, which is "a hundred times the price after climbing the dragon gate"!

After the awards, the dog show was declared closed. The successful people and dogs, the frustrated people and dogs, and the calm people who came to see the excitement left the exhibition hall in the midst of the noisy human voices and the barking of pigs and dogs. St. John's Square also returned to its original tranquility. (New)

### Situation in Various Parts of Guangdong: Shengang [Enemy] Surrounded by Our Forces; [Enemy]'s Main Force Gathers at Taiping Field; [Enemy]'s Military Actions Still Focus on Hainan Island: At Most, They Are Nothing More Than Harassment

[Fast Report from the North River] The [enemy] forces on the east, west and north lines of Guangdong Province have been busy deploying recently, showing signs of activity. However, in reality, it is more of a smokescreen. Observing their military actions, they still focus on Hainan Island, with the main objective of occupying the entire island. On other lines, they are currently adopting a defensive posture. Here is a report on the recent situation in the North River area:

[Enemy]'s Main Force Gathers at Taiping Field

According to a military report from the front line between Conghua and Huaxian, there are currently about 4,000 [enemy] troops, with the main force gathered at Taiping and Xin Street, to prevent our troops from advancing from Guizui Street to Ping Mountain. The remaining strongholds at Shengang, Luotan, Hengtan, Longkou, Xiaobu, Xiangshan, and Shijiao each have between three hundred and three hundred [enemy] troops. The [enemy] troops in the above-mentioned places occasionally come out to harass the villages, but they retreat quickly and do not dare to take large-scale actions. It can be seen that the [enemy] troops are still in a defensive phase, and it seems that there is no plan to continue advancing northward on a large scale in the short term.

The [Enemy] at Shengang Surrounded by Our Forces

It has been found that our army took advantage of the [enemy]'s retreat on the night of the 4th and launched an attack on Shengang's Xiagang Ridge. With one vigorous advance, they captured the stronghold of Xiagang. After our army captured Xiagang Ridge, they completed their replenishment and immediately advanced towards Shengang. According to a military report from the front line fifteen days ago, a certain unit of our army had approached the area at 5:00 am that morning and had a fierce battle with an [enemy] battalion. Until dawn, our army automatically withdrew according to the original plan. It is estimated that many [enemy] troops were killed in this battle, and our side also suffered some casualties. It has been found that our army has now coordinated with a certain unit of the 2nd District guerrillas to surround and control the [enemy] troops at Shengang. It should not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

The [Enemy] Troops at Guanyao Actively Building Defenses

The [enemy] troops entrenched at Guanyao Fengyong have been forcibly dragging our people to build a highway from Guanyao to Yaobian for days. 200+ [enemy] soldiers drove dozens of transport vehicles and drove from Fengyong to the villages near Tanbu Wuhe to collect a large amount of fir wood and various building wood on a daily basis. For several days, they have also forcibly dragged 1-400+ civilians to use transport vehicles to transport materials to the Tanbu line to build defensive works, day and night without stopping. The busy situation is unprecedented. Looking at the dynamics of the [enemy] troops on all lines, they are still actively engaged in the deployment of defensive works. At most, they are nothing more than harassment.

### A Certain Military Officer Speaks: It's Easy to Invade Guangxi; We Have the Best Defense; Roads in the War Zone are Being Actively Destroyed

[Zhaoqing Correspondence] Recently, the enemy troops have been frequently mobilizing, seemingly with the intention of invading Guangxi. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet a certain staff officer at a road defense post. When asked about the enemy's recent attempts to invade Guangxi, he discussed the matter in detail as follows: (The following is the account of a certain staff officer.)

In recent days, the enemy troops have been using the captured Hainan Island as a military base and have been dispatching troops to attempt to invade Guangxi. One route is via Huaiji, another via Wuzhou, another via Lianzhou, and another via Shangsi. The enemy has no chance of succeeding on any of these three routes, but the Beihai route deserves close attention.

Although the enemy is trying to use troops in the southern route, our military authorities have long made full preparations. Now, we are further studying the situation from all aspects as follows:

1.  To spy on Wuzhou along the Xijiang River is the supreme shortcut for the enemy to invade Guangxi. However, our army, guarding this line, numbers over 100,000. The enemy dares not launch a frontal attack and pay a heavy price. Moreover, west of Zhaoqing, the blockade line along the river is heavily guarded, especially the Langjiang Dam in Jilongzhou, which stretches for ten miles and can never be breached by the enemy's shallow-water ships.

2.  Using the navy to take the route through the Gulf of Tonkin, landing at Beihai, passing through (Hepu) Qinzhou, Xixiang, Yongning, and Longzhou, cutting off Sino-Vietnamese communications, and hindering our international transport. Then, following the extension of the Xiang-Gui Railway, emerging from Liuzhou, and attacking Guilin from the rear. This line is the most noticeable to the general public. However, according to those familiar with the terrain there, Beihai has a lot of sand and shallow water. It is difficult for the enemy's larger warships to approach the shore, and it is especially difficult to land troops with heavy weapons. Moreover, west of Qinlian, there are tens of thousands of people acting as a natural barrier, and the enemy's mechanized units will definitely have difficulty advancing. Our national defense works along the line have been nearly completed, and certain elite divisions are stationed there.

3.  If using the navy, landing near Guangzhou (eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula), and invading westward along the highway, passing through Rongxian to attack Cangwu from the rear, our side has not only dispatched heavy troops to garrison there, but also thoroughly destroyed all highways south of Yulin. Furthermore, there is the natural barrier of the Goulou Mountain Range, and the Shiwan Mountains, both of which are praised by Chairman Chiang as favorable terrain.

4.  Using the army, advancing northwest from Sanshui, passing through Sihui and Guangning along the Suijiang River, entering the Guangxi territory of Huaiji, and then heading straight for Kaijian to attack Cangwu. However, the highways along the line have been destroyed by us, and there is also the Mengling Mountain Range, which the enemy troops cannot cross.

According to estimates by several strategists, the general public believes that the enemy will use its main force to attack Beihai, and use the Xijiang River as a supporting attack. However, the enemy's strategy is the opposite. After all, the Xijiang River is indeed a shortcut, but the distance between it and the Beihai landing is vast.

At present, the roads in the war zone of Guangdong Province are being actively destroyed, but unfortunately, many are not thoroughly destroyed. The roads in Guangxi Province close to the war zone are being thoroughly destroyed or turned into agricultural swamps by various methods, making it difficult for the enemy to use them and hindering the development of their mechanized units.

In short, in terms of geographical conditions, we are already absolutely in a superior position. Moreover, the enemy's troop strength is consistently insufficient, preventing them from launching large-scale offensives. Therefore, the enemy's invasion of Guangxi, no matter which route they take, will be difficult to find any development.

### Reviving Commerce: Huiyang Provides Loans, Temporarily Allocating 70,000 National Currency; Loan Standards are Divided into Three Grades

[Huiyang Correspondence] After the incident in Southern China, Huiyang was the first to be ravaged. The core commercial districts were all reduced to ashes. Although it was recaptured in winter, the heavy losses in all aspects made it difficult for shops to resume business, and unemployment was extremely widespread. The Guangdong Relief Huiyang Branch has specially decided to petition the government authorities to launch a movement to revive commerce in Huiyang and provide loans to rescue merchants. The initial loan amount is temporarily set at 70,000 national currency, which will be launched in the short term. The measures are as follows:

1.  Loan Use: The loan is interest-free and is used to subsidize the simple construction of destroyed shops and restore commerce.

2.  Loan Scope: Limited to destroyed shops in cities and market towns under Huiyang County. First, it will be launched in Huizhou City, followed by market towns.

3.  Loan Amount: A total of 320 shops were destroyed in Huiyang. The amount is temporarily set at 70,000 national currency. The amounts for other market towns will be determined separately with reference to these measures.

4.  Loan Standards: Divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Construction costs of 800 national currency or more are Grade A, 400 national currency or more are Grade B, and 200 national currency or more are Grade C. Grade A loans are 300 national currency, Grade B loans are 200 national currency, and Grade C loans are 100 national currency.

5.  Construction Responsibility: The destroyed shops will first be constructed by the shop owners with loans. If they do not build, they will be constructed by the branch with loans. If they still do not build, they will be built by this branch. However, for those built by this branch, the branch will rent them out, and the annual rental income, after deducting the loan repayment, will be returned to the shop owner.

6.  Determining Rental Amounts: For shop owners who borrow loans or do not borrow loans but build, if the monthly rent is less than 8 yuan, the original rent will be charged. If it is less than 12 yuan, 90% of the rent will be charged. If it is less than 20 yuan, 80% of the rent will be charged. If it is more than 20 yuan, 70% of the rent will be charged, in order to help the merchants. If the shop tenants borrow loans to build, 50% of the original rent will be charged. However, the original shop tenants of the constructed shops should have priority in renting.

7.  Loan Repayment Schedule: The borrowers will repay one-tenth of the loan annually, to be fully repaid in ten years.

8.  Lease Term: From the date of lease, the landlord shall not increase the rent within ten years.

9.  Those who have agreed upon the construction between the landlord and tenant are not subject to these restrictions.

### Wu Jufang Ordered to Rescue Guangdong Refugee Children; Establishing Nurseries to Accommodate Refugee Children; Also Including Children of Soldiers on Expedition

[Shaoguan Express News] Wu Jufang, standing committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, returned to Shaoguan from Chongqing. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about everything. According to Wu, regarding the various relief plans, she met with Madame Chiang in Chongqing and received instructions, distinguishing between urgent and less urgent matters for implementation. Madame Chiang paid special attention to the issue of wartime children's care and emphasized that rescuing children in war zones was the most urgent task.

Furthermore, since the Chinese Wartime Children's Relief Association was relocated to Guangning after the fall of Guangzhou and subsequently dissolved, except for the Hong Kong branch which accommodated some refugee children, the provincial branch has not yet been restored. Madame Chiang instructed that children's rescue work should be prioritized, and various measures have been finalized to be swiftly implemented upon returning to Guangdong.

It has been decided to first rescue and then accommodate, with personnel dispatched from the provincial government, the New Life Movement, and the provincial relief committee to various war zones and near occupied areas to quickly rescue children. Initially, a temporary nursery will be established in Shaoguan, followed by six nurseries in various regions of the province to accommodate as many as possible. In addition to refugee children, children of soldiers and laborers on expedition will also be accommodated to alleviate the educational burden and concerns of frontline soldiers and to assist the government in wartime education responsibilities.

### Guanshan Market; Enemy Troops Harass

It has been found that on the 12th and 13th of this month, the enemy troops who attacked Guanshan Market, also divided part of their force, over 120 people, and harassed villages around Lizhi Garden, Huaxia, Baihe, Lin Village, and Caowei, forcing the villagers to organize local puppet maintenance associations and elect village and town chiefs. At the same time, they also ordered merchants in Minle City to pay 100 yuan in military supplies every day, or pay with food and livestock; otherwise, they would be "severely punished."

Currently, the people in that area are under this oppressive force, extremely frightened. The young and strong are fleeing to find refuge, the scene is desolate, and the situation is tragic.

### Enemy Troops in Sanshui Forcibly Recruit People to Participate in the So-Called "Sino-Japanese Friendship Gathering"; Deploying a Poisonous Policy of Appeasement in Occupied Areas; Many Soldiers in the Enemy's Itata Unit are Anti-War

[Zhaoqing Express News] Recently, the enemy in the Xijiang River area has been actively implementing an appeasement policy in the occupied areas, trying to lure the people in our occupied areas and implement a poisonous policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. In recent days, so-called "Sino-Japanese Friendship Gatherings" have been held in various parts of Sanshui. It has been found that the enemy in Xin Market held gatherings at the Xiafenghuangshan Village for two consecutive days on the 12th of this month, forcing villagers to participate, with all kinds of threats, saying that those who did not go would be suspected of other intentions and would be arrested by soldiers. The villagers, being under the sphere of influence, had no choice but to comply.

Moreover, the enemy in Ge Wei comes and goes from time to time. On the 12th, their numbers increased to more than 300 people. At about 3 pm on the 13th, more than 200 people returned to Hekou. Currently, there are still more than 100 people stationed in the village.

It is now known that the enemy troops in Sanshui have recently increased to more than 4,000, but they are there for relief purposes. At the moment, the enemy troops are in the middle of an exchange. It has been found that the enemy troops in Sanshui a few weeks ago were the Itata Unit, but because many soldiers in that unit were anti-war and there was a trend of instability, the enemy commander, An Teng, reassigned the Zhongyuan Brigade to relieve them in Sanshui. It has been found that the commander of the Zhongyuan Brigade arrived at Hekou on the 15th. The enemy headquarters is still located at the customs. At the moment, the enemy's entire Xijiang military affairs have been reassigned under the command of the Zhongyuan Unit.

The Zhaming Steamboat Company's Xiansheng wheel, which is now docked at the Kowloon port, will soon be dismantled and sold. Because the wheel has been in operation for 34 years and there is no possibility of repairing the various parts, the company has specially decided to scrap it. The original Tawau route will reportedly be replaced by the Hulujia wheel.

The Zhushidan wheel, represented by the Most Time Foreign Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Xiaoluzon late last night and is currently docked at the Kowloon Warehouse. It is scheduled to depart for Japan and Shanghai and other places at 9:00 AM this morning.

The Thai Sheng Company's Haojiang wheel is scheduled to leave the dock tomorrow, and will resume its regular service between Hong Kong and Macau the day after tomorrow.

### Zhongshan During the War

— Huang Wenkai

(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper) In the twenty months since the start of the War of Resistance, Zhongshan has long been coveted by the enemy. The enemy planes' bombing and the enemy ships' circling reconnaissance have occurred countless times, but each time, the dangers have been overcome with composure. At the same time, Zhongshan's resistance strength has grown in this difficult environment. The current situation is clearly a significant improvement from the initial stage. Before the enemy troops began their invasion of South China, it was generally estimated that the enemy's invasion route might be through Tangjiawan, which belongs to Zhongshan, because at that time, quite a few enemy ships had gathered in Tangjiawan. Logically speaking, Zhongshan also faced a great danger.

However, the Japanese finally landed in Daya Bay. After the fall of Guangzhou, they advanced along the Xijiang River. Although Zhongshan was not isolated, its contact with the inland was greatly affected, and its position became even more serious. In the current situation of the South China battlefield, it is worth considerable attention.

Improved Air Defense

Zhongshan's air raids were once as common as daily meals, causing alarm several times a day. In the hail of bombs, considerable losses were unavoidable. However, Zhongshan also gained valuable experience from this. During each air raid, Zhou Keming, the head of the transportation regiment, Zhou Shouheng, the director of the air defense office, and all the staff members were required to personally maintain order under the alarm. The rickshaw drivers, carpenters, blacksmiths, porters, and coolies under the transportation regiment's jurisdiction had the task of guiding people to shelters during air raids. Children and women on the streets were taken to air raid shelters by rickshaw drivers. Those inside houses were persuaded to enter air raid shelters by carpenters and blacksmiths. This planned evacuation was very effective. Although Shekki has also been subjected to many air raids recently, the casualties have not been as heavy as before, and only the civilian houses have suffered slight damage.

Shekki has many mountains, and the terrain is quite high. These natural terrains are used as natural air raid shelters. Although the enemy has consumed a lot of ammunition, they have rarely been able to achieve the goal of slaughtering our compatriots.

Food Problem

Regarding the food problem, it has become very serious recently in Zhongshan. Originally, Zhongshan County belonged to the rice-producing area. The amount of rice produced each year, in addition to meeting the needs of the county, could also be transported to neighboring areas to provide assistance. This time, a rice shortage suddenly broke out, which was truly unexpected. According to those familiar with the details, the main reason for the Zhongshan rice shortage is the concentration of hoarding by rice merchants.

It was originally difficult to strictly refuse to assist neighboring counties with grain. However, the rice in Zhongshan was ultimately limited. To supply the unlimited needs of neighboring counties with it was practically impossible. Recently, some rice merchants, because the prices in other counties are higher and there is a profit to be made, have disregarded everything and sold the rice secretly, thus forming the serious problem of a food panic in Zhongshan County today.

The reporter met Yuan Dai in the second district and casually talked to him about the food problem in Zhongshan. He said with some emotion, "Because of the war, many people in Zhongshan have moved to safe places. Due to the decrease in population, Zhongshan's food supply should have been more abundant. This rice shortage is naturally an unexpected event. However, one thing is most regrettable. As far as I know, some unscrupulous rice merchants have secretly sold stored rice to the enemy. Selling grain to the enemy is equivalent to increasing the enemy's strength. This cannot be ignored."

The Armed Forces of Zhongshan

As soon as you step into Zhongshan territory, you will feel that Zhongshan seems to be a county of soldiers. Coming and going are soldiers in military uniform, equipped with weapons. These soldiers are the self-defense forces. They are scattered throughout the districts, supporting the strength of the protracted resistance. Their weapons are self-provided, and their expenses are borne by the districts. This fully demonstrates the spirit of resistance of the people of Zhongshan.

One day, the reporter was talking about war issues with Deputy Officer Huang in a Zhongshan teahouse. He said frankly, "According to military theory, the enemy is clearly failing. First, sending troops on a long expedition is the most taboo thing in military operations. On the contrary, we can wait for the enemy to exhaust themselves and will inevitably achieve victory. Second, the most taboo thing in military operations is plundering, because soldiers should aim to fight, and they should not infringe on the people. The behavior of the enemy troops in the occupied areas is precisely a major mistake. Third, the thinness of the ranks is also a major weakness of the enemy troops. Fourth, the key to supporting the war is the economy. Japan's economy is gradually on the verge of collapse. Therefore, in our view, we are more certain of the ultimate victory."

Movies and Drama

### Introducing Several Stunt Doubles and Stand-Ins; The Work is Heavy and Unrecognized

When every audience member, after appreciating a certain film, attributes the reason for the film's popularity to the acting skills of the male and female leads, although this viewpoint has its existing value, in fact, it is not absolutely correct. This is because there is also a group of behind-the-scenes heroes, such as directors, cinematographers, set designers, sound engineers, script supervisors, production assistants, prop masters, lighting directors, stunt doubles, and stand-ins, who also make great contributions to the success of each film. However, except for the directors and cinematographers, who may have the happiness of being admired, the hard work of other personnel is erased. The biggest reason, of course, is that they do not appear on the screen. Even the stunt doubles and stand-ins who have the opportunity to appear on the screen are often unable to get a word of praise, which seems even more unfair, especially since their work is more difficult and dangerous than that of the stars. However, in the Hollywood film city, there are many people engaged in this work of substituting for others, and they seem to enjoy it, because they all hold the hope that one day they can become big stars instead of being just the "stunt doubles" or "stand-ins" of film stars.

Serving as a film star's "stunt double" or "stand-in" is not an easy task. The prerequisite is to have the same figure, appearance, complexion, and height as the film star, because they have to represent the film stars in front of the camera for lighting or take on dangerous shots for the film stars. For example, when a passionate couple is kissing, the lighting is always handled by two "stand-ins" for the stars. Sometimes, for the sake of angle and lighting, they even have to kiss fifty or sixty times before the male and female stars themselves are allowed to perform the actual shot. Similarly, scenes such as a celebrity falling down the stairs or being attacked are not actually performed by the expensive film stars themselves, but by those unlucky "stunt doubles." In addition, if there is a scene that needs to be re-shot, but the protagonist has already left on a long trip, they have no choice but to have their "stand-in" take the shot. However, the audience below the screen thinks it is the film star himself. Almost all the big stars in Hollywood have their own "stunt doubles" and "stand-ins." Here, we briefly mention a few of them who are specifically big stars' "stunt doubles" or "stand-ins," and who make important contributions in the film process, but whose names are unknown.

Connie Lynn

Is Joan Blondell's "stunt double," a doll-like beauty with red hair and yellow eyes, a pure American girl, born in Los Angeles. Her original goal was to become a lawyer, but after studying at university for two years, she changed her mind and wanted to become an actress. Before becoming Joan's "stunt double," she also had some small stage experience, but she felt that her current job was the most suitable and could also gain some real skills. She accompanies Joan every day to rehearse, read scripts, and do movements. Whether in the studio or at home, Connie Lynn dresses the same as Joan Blondell, but she is a little shorter, so she wears higher heels to make up for the difference. Her current salary is fifty dollars a week. Connie is already married, and Joan Blondell was her bridesmaid at the wedding. Her husband is Dick Powell's manager.

Lee "Huck" Forest

Is Lee Strasberg Howard's "stunt double." This bachelor lives with his mother and sister and has studied business calculation and business management at Ohio and Southern California University. His idea of becoming Howard's "stunt double" is that he can see the real situation of film production and prepare a foundation for dedicating himself to the screen in the future. Lee Huck's entry into the film industry was very unexpected. It turned out that one night he went to a dance hall and met a director who said to Lee Huck, "Come to the studio to find me, I have work for you." At that time, Lee Huck did not expect to work in the film industry at all, so when he went to see the director a few days later, he was assigned to be Lee Strasberg's "stunt double." From Howard and Mona Loa's "Animal Kingdom," he has been working as his "stunt double." A "stunt double" must be very close to the star, so Lee Huck knows that Lee Strasberg is a thoroughly British man. He is the most interesting figure in Hollywood.

Tay Garnett

Six-foot-three and thin, he is also Gary Cooper's "stunt double" and "stand-in." They are old friends from the Montana ranch. Tay Garnett not only resembles Cooper in face and figure, but also in temperament and personality. He walks beautifully and is taciturn. He once enlisted as a soldier and was a pilot during the European War. Even now, he is still a member of the Aviation Association. Initially, he and Cooper entered the film industry together as extras, but due to the arrangement of fate, he can only be a "stunt double." When Cooper goes out hunting, he also has to go with him. This is the only thing they have in common today. Tay Garnett has a wish to join the Air Force in China and fight for human justice.

Don Miro

Fate, this illusory thing, is always playing tricks on people. Five years ago, two young people shared a room due to economic problems, and they even exchanged underwear and ties. These two people both had ambitions to enter the film industry. One of them was Don Miro, and the other was his "original self," the famous young man Robert Taylor. Four years ago, Taylor said to others that his good friend was Don. Although the environment has changed and he has become the number one superstar, he still regards Miro as his best friend. As proven by the facts, when Taylor went to England to shoot a film, the British government restricted him from bringing technical personnel with him and could only bring one friend, he did not go with Bai Beilan Stanfei, but went with Don Miro.

Ann Rutherford

She is Olivia de Havilland's "stand-in." The contract between Havilland and Warner Bros. stipulated her "stand-in." She lived with Havilland before Havilland entered the film industry. Ann regards Olivia as a leader, and Olivia treats Ann like a sister, always giving her expensive gifts on her birthday. Because of the relationship between "stand-in" and "original self," and because they have lived together for a long time, Ann knows everything about Havilland very well. She said, "Havilland is really troubled because she doesn't like to go out with a group of unsatisfactory boyfriends, so someone spread rumors that she has an arrogant temper, which makes Havilland have to go out with unsatisfactory men and women in order to please people." Ann came from Tennessee and majored in piano at Tennessee Women's College. Later, she came to Hollywood to be an extra, and was introduced by a staff member of the company's public relations department to be a Stock Girl, with a salary of only sixteen dollars a week. But after becoming Havilland's "stand-in," she had fifty dollars a week. When her "original self" misses a film, she often plays unimportant supporting roles in other films. Now she admits to being deeply attached to an important employee of Warner Bros. and will be getting married soon.

Mayer Morlay

Is Cary Grant's "stunt double" and "stand-in," a student at Case Western Reserve University. Before walking out of the campus and into the film city, he worked as a professional baseball player. Later, in a major competition, he broke his finger, so he had to end his life as an athlete and came to Hollywood to be Cary's "stand-in" and manage all his chores. In addition to the salary paid to him by the company, Cary himself also gave him the same compensation. This young man, who received double the salary, married a beautiful young lady from Los Angeles. Although he is only twenty-six years old this year, he is already the father of a four-year-old child. Some people weep sadly for his work as a "stunt double," but Mayer believes that it is of great help to his artistic cultivation. In his free time, he often studies scripts with Cary, Katharine Hepburn, and others, and has gained a lot of benefits. Recently, when Mayer went to the hospital to have his finger operated on, Cary paid for the medical expenses.

### International Tournament: England Eliminated, China Wins Championship Right, 4-1: China Wins After Initial Loss, Li Huitang Shows Sportsmanship

[Report from our Correspondent] In yesterday afternoon's international football semi-final held in Jia Shan, as expected, the Chinese team eliminated the English team with a score of 4-1, securing the final. The entire match unfolded as follows: Less than five minutes after the start, the Chinese team conceded a goal, at which point the English team's momentum was at its peak, with more attacks than defense. The situation soon changed, and the Chinese team launched a fierce counterattack. However, Li Huitang's four brilliant shots were all thwarted by the goalkeeper, Hayle, unable to penetrate the net. This period was the most tense. Shortly after, Feng Jingxiang scored a goal for the Chinese team, retaliating in kind. From this point on, the Chinese team's turnaround from defeat to victory accelerated rapidly. As the first half drew to a close, the Chinese team was already leading 2-1, but the offensive momentum did not diminish. In front of the English goal, there were countless close calls. Hayle injured his left hand while saving Liang Rongzhao's powerful shot, fracturing two fingers. It is believed that he will not recover for at least half a month. After Hayle's injury, Li Zhaorong took the opportunity to score another goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-1. Changing sides for the second half, the Chinese team consistently held the advantage, but the English team resisted strongly, leading to a chaotic state. Later, Li Huitang scored another goal, sealing the victory at 4-1.

In this match, one event is most worthy of recording: Li Huitang's exemplary sportsmanship. Every move of his revealed this. In the second half, with Hayle injured and guarding the goal, the Chinese team launched frequent attacks. In theory, the Chinese team could have won by at least three or four goals. Especially with Li Huitang's several solo runs, and his confident shooting skills, it seemed that every shot would find its mark. However, seeing Hayle was injured, and knowing his team had a firm grip on victory, even though he had further opportunities to score, he did not want to take advantage of the situation and continued to approach the goal for several more shots, only lightly flicking the ball. General fans who did not understand his intentions thought his shots were weak. Little did they know the reason he did not shoot forcefully was not out of "false mercy," but rather to leave room, not wanting to subject the already injured Hayle to further pain. Therefore, Li Huitang's benevolent act was something no ordinary footballer could have achieved.

Regarding the Chinese team's performance, apart from Huang Jingcong, who was unremarkable, the rest were all competent. In terms of the front line, Li Huitang's successful central breakthroughs were thanks to Feng Jingxiang's accurate passes. Deng Guangsen's frequent movement also relied on Feng Jingxiang's supply. Li Zhaorong, knowing that the left wing was not useful, often used short triangular passes with Li Huitang and Feng Jingxiang. This tactic was a specialty of the Chinese team, and its proper execution in yesterday's match led to a great victory. As for the defense, the three midfielders were quite erratic in the first ten minutes, but later improved, with coordinated advances and retreats. The two inside backs, especially Hou Rongsheng, were particularly noticeable due to his excellent performance, earning praise from the spectators. Tan Jun'gan's several brilliant saves were a great contribution, especially his save of Duffy's excellent shot in the first half, which showed great skill. The English army's defeat was inherently limited by the degree of its technical skill, unable to compete with China for supremacy. However, the performance of its members was extremely dedicated. The former inside back was steadfast and firm. Only the members of the front line, except for Amberson who had a unique performance, played like midfielders, with poor passing and weak rushes.

Parker, rich in experience, used skill to overcome others, a performance that surprised us. Hayle, before his injury, also made many good plays. Geddes, who replaced Cole, was also adequate.

First Half

(4 minutes) The Chinese team fought against the wind, with exceptional difficulty. English right-winger Marsh broke through during a fierce attack. The naturally gifted Jun'gan left the city to save, obstructed by the opposing forward. Fortunately, Rongsheng covered by himself, kicking the ball out of bounds, preferring to concede a corner kick. After the kick, the ball was again obtained by the English army and forced another corner kick. Duffy sent the ball out from the baseline. Amberson shot among the crowd, scoring a goal. (1-0)

(17 minutes) Li Huitang had four fierce shots, all saved by Hayle. Feng Jingxiang then opened up a new path, suddenly passing the ball to Zhaorong. Zhaorong was overjoyed and thought he could score with one shot, but unfortunately, he was judged offside and returned dejectedly.

(23 minutes) Liang Xiang moved quickly and transported the ball well. Li Huitang was able to break through the trenches and charge forward. Jingcong also took the opportunity to sneak into the enemy territory. Li Huitang, realizing the opportunity was unmissable, shot directly with force. The cannonball had just entered, but was caught again by Hayle.

(25 minutes) Rongzhao seized the ball from Erskin Landridge and passed it diagonally to Zhaorong. Zhaorong quickly sent it to Jingxiang. Jingxiang found an opportunity and shot hard. The speed was as fast as electricity. Hayle was unable to save it, and the score was tied at 1-1.

(30 minutes) Rongzhao received a pass from Jingcheng, looked left and right, and found that Li Huitang was standing in a safe zone. He immediately sent the ball over a long distance. Li Huitang skillfully passed Parker and went solo to the meeting. Geddes and Parker were unable to catch up. The English army lost ground again, and the score became 2-1. The Chinese army turned defeat into victory.

(35 minutes) Li Huitang and Rongzhao temporarily switched positions. Rongzhao, acting as center forward, showed off his skills, forcing his way into the shooting area during a fierce attack. The momentum was extremely strong. Hayle pushed the ball away with both hands. Parker quickly kicked it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick. At this point, Hayle injured his finger while saving the ball. He bandaged it and continued to fight, but his performance was much worse than before.

(40 minutes) Zhaorong and Jingcong launched attacks on the left and right. Fei Shi and Wo Da suppressed the front. Zhaorong received Jingcong's help and sneaked in front of the goal, shooting the ball into the net, making the score 3-1.

Second Half

(10 minutes) The Chinese army moved to a new position, taking advantage of the favorable wind. The offensive momentum was very sharp, but because the English army's defense was tight, it was impossible to break through.

(15 minutes) The English army launched a counterattack, forcing three corner kicks in a row, and besieging the city. Jun, with a miraculous hand, saved the day. Rongsheng added a foot, and the English army retreated.

(32 minutes) The Chinese army attacked more than defended, and victory was in sight. Their skill was exceptional. Li Huitang received a wonderful pass from Huixiang and scored from a long distance, making the score 4-1, eliminating the English army and winning the right to the final. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Great China)

Tan Jun'gan

Ji Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng

Xu Jingcheng, Liang Rong, Zeng Zhongyun

Huang Jingcong, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

(England)

Parker, Tedi Leeds

### Men's Basketball Tournament: Group A Guangda Defeats Hong Kong University, Three More Games Tonight

The public men's basketball tournament started at 3:30 PM yesterday. In the first game of Group B, Hongxing faced Chenguang. The strength of the two teams was not far apart, so the competition was fierce. In the first half, Hongxing led 18-13. Although Chenguang tried hard to counterattack in the second half, their skills were inferior, and as a result, they were defeated by Hongxing 29-44. In the second game of Group A, Hong Kong University faced Guangda. Although Hong Kong University has participated in previous competitions, their results have not been high. Although Guangda cannot be called a strong team in Group A, Chen Zhaolu, Lu Dong, Wu Xuanzhao, and others have considerable skills in shooting, guarding, and passing. Therefore, the strength of the two sides in this game was very different, and there was not much exciting performance. Guangda had been leading by a large margin from beginning to end. Although Zhang Shaomian and Xu Kunlun of Hong Kong University tried hard to counterattack, it did not help the overall situation.

After the opening, within a few minutes, Chen Zhaolu and Wu Xuanzhao of Guangdong successively shot baskets, creating a record of 10-0. Hong Kong University only managed to score two points through Xu Kunlun after several attacks. Soon, Chen Zhaolu of Guangdong showed his strength again, successively making the score 18-2 and 36-4. By the time Zhang Shaomian scored twice, Hong Kong University had already lost the first half 9-49. After changing sides and fighting again, Guangda's offensive was slightly weakened. Hong Kong University had a good momentum to reverse the decline. Unexpectedly, Lu Dong of Guangda showed his power again, creating records of 58-13 and 62-13. By the end of the game, Guangda won by a large margin of 80-17.

In the last game of Group B, Kangyuan faced Guangzhong. The two teams were evenly matched. Although Guangzhong won the first half 15-10, Kangyuan tried hard to counterattack in the second half, and once led 25-21 in the last ten minutes. Afterwards, the two sides fought even more fiercely, and the scores rose and fell, leveling each other many times. In the last minute, Shizhong narrowly won Kangyuan 30-28.

### South China Seeks Members, Awards Flags Last Night

Xu Shiying and others participate

The South China Athletic Association held its second membership solicitation flag-awarding departure meeting at 7:30 last night at the Confucian Hall on Caroline Hill. Hundreds of people, including Xu Shiying, Zhou Wenzhi, lawyer Luo Xie Dong, Du Yuesheng, Mo Qing, Huo Bao Cai, and Mrs. Chen Fengwei, attended. Lawyer Luo chaired the meeting. At the time, after performing the rituals, the chairman announced the reasons, briefly stating that tonight is the South China Athletic Association's membership solicitation flag-awarding departure meeting. Everyone, as the name implies, should know the reason for tonight's meeting. The South China Association is organized by a majority of members, so it holds a membership solicitation every year. The strength and work of the Association each year depend on the results of the solicitation. The strength of the Association depends on the number of members, and the progress of the work depends on the amount of funds received. Membership solicitation has a great relationship with the Association, so the ceremony of awarding the flag at the beginning of the solicitation departure expresses the grand occasion of the departure and also wishes each team a good start. Tonight, we are very honored and excited that Mr. Xu Shiying is here to award the flags. It can be predicted that the results of this solicitation will exceed previous ones. At present, the country is in a difficult time, and many domestic sports organizations have been sacrificed. The Association is fortunate to be able to promote sports overseas, and the mission it shoulders should be even greater than before. The chairman hopes that the comrades of each team will work harder on this solicitation so as to achieve unprecedented results, so that the Association can carry out considerable development. This is the chairman's earnest hope. After the speech, Xu Shiyang awarded the flags. Dozens of teams, including the Zhou Zhizhi team, accepted the flags. Xu Shiying and the chairman of the association, Zhou Wenzhi, gave words of encouragement. Finally, there was a wonderful recreational program to help celebrate, and the meeting adjourned at 10 PM.

### Let's Also Talk About Children's Sports (4)

— Zou Falu

It is certainly harmful to a child's health to eat without restriction, but it is even more harmful to eat in moderation without regard to whether the food is clean or filthy, fresh or stale, to eat indiscriminately without choice. Unlimited eating only damages the digestive organs, while filthy and rotten food can bring lethal microorganisms into the stomach, sending you home in a few days or even hours. We can see children everywhere who, after handling dirty things, with their hands covered in dust, use those hands, the headquarters of microorganisms, to put food in their mouths, even eating rotten food without aversion. Parents often do not know how to guide them, watching helplessly as they eat this great enemy of health.

The purpose of wearing clothes is to protect body temperature. The degree of clothing should be increased or decreased with the warmth or coldness of the climate, always being appropriate. Too little or too much clothing not only defeats the purpose of wearing clothes, but can also affect health. How do Chinese children dress? When it gets cold, they put on cotton-padded clothes and fur coats, making the children swollen, clumsy, and unable to move. When it gets hot, they wear thin shirts and trousers, even stripping naked, regardless of whether they can tolerate it. In one day, a child's clothing can go from winter to summer, from summer to winter. Such a sudden cold and sudden heat in clothing can cause adults to catch a cold, let alone children?

"Melancholy breeds disease" is an old saying that worry can affect health. Children are naturally optimistic and do not know what it means to be sad. This old saying does not seem to apply to children, but because the nerves that govern their muscles are not yet fully developed, their movements are often inaccurate. Because their brains have not yet matured, their actions and words are often wrong. Parents often hope their children will arrive too quickly. Therefore, when children have inaccurate movements and wrong words and deeds, they do not forgive them, scolding them lightly and beating them severely, even adding beatings after scolding. This makes children feel that there is no right place for them. Their repressed and unequal anger, which they dare not speak, accumulates in their chests and cannot be vented. This invisible stimulation in spirit is more harmful to the body than any kind of tangible, unhappy environment. Coupled with children's weak constitution, how can they withstand such ruthless treatment?

All of this may be enough to extinguish children's active nature, making them dull and wooden, figures who can only be passive and cannot be active. Or it may not give children timely and appropriate exercise, making them all angels of iron, shouldering the heavy task of national rejuvenation. Or it may be enough to affect children's health, making their exercise work do more with less, unable to achieve quick and effective results. If we do not talk about children's sports, then so be it. If we want to discuss children's sports, I think we must first get rid of all of these things, then research a suitable method to implement according to the needs. Otherwise, it is not a truly fundamental solution. (The End)

### From Primitive Swindling to the Final Stage

— Prism

The method is ancient. The alchemy swindle. In the city, there's a scam where one-dollar bills are turned into two. Some swindlers are Westerners, so like alchemy, whether it originated from one dollar or two remains to be investigated. If there's an interest in investigating, it's easier to start now, but it seems only a thousand years later will such investigation have value. Now, we can only feel that this isn't even a rare form of swindling. What makes it rare is the deceived. How could they believe in such a primitive scam? Isn't that too foolish? However, while we seem confident in not falling into the same trap, we have no guarantee of not falling into a similar one. The circle of knowledge indeed varies in size, but at the edge of the circle, the chance of stepping into foolishness is equal.

To argue a bit, we don't believe one bill can turn into two. Rather, we should look at our foolishness. Business behavior, in fact, is based on the principle of turning one bill into two. In business, seeking both principal and profit is a perfectly legitimate desire. If we read the essays of great economists on savings, we'll see them say that prize savings are unfavorable. Depositing two thousand yuan for fifteen years still only yields two thousand yuan. But with fixed savings, fifteen years could yield eight thousand yuan. That is, three times the principal and profit in fifteen years, or once every five years. The interest rate is a perfectly normal one cent and two li per month. This is naturally not a swindle, but economics. Yet this is all advertising. Those who are swayed by this advertising to save are not seen as good at managing money, but merely as low-ability individuals incapable of managing money. We know there's something called a trust business, right? This name clearly tells us that those with low knowledge trust the superior insights of others.

Superior insights naturally exceed our circle of knowledge, but let's foolishly ask within our circle: Why would the trustee give the depositor principal and profit? Here, if we want to glimpse the profoundness of superior insights, we might as well marvel at the cleverness of a magic trick. Five years, to a businessman, is truly a long time. If principal and profit came only once every five years, a businessman would starve. One return in two or three years is considered perfectly normal. One year is just average. When things go smoothly, half a year, three months, ten days, five days aren't rare. Even the hope of gaining principal and profit in one day can be excluded from dreams. Only realizing it instantly is considered fantasy, right? But the distance between an instant and a day is much smaller than the distance between a day and five years. Here, should I believe that one yuan can turn into principal and profit in a day? Don't believe it? Leaving aside speculation, every small exchange shop buys in one hao and can turn it into ten cents. If someone exchanges hao for cents every six minutes, then after an hour, their original ten hao becomes ten cents and one hao. This isn't an illusion at all, but rather a business that carries a strong hint of illusion. However, tricks that have already been exposed can be ignored, while those not yet exposed, under the protection of superior insights, are hard to believe even if set up.

We generally all know about the issuance of pre-sale coupons, right? If you have fifty thousand yuan worth of goods, and you can sell ten thousand yuan worth of coupons, then use that money to buy more goods, the fifty thousand yuan clearly becomes a hundred thousand yuan. If you could sell a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand yuan worth of coupons, then turning fifty thousand yuan into three times that amount is possible. Selling this many coupons naturally doesn't seem like a fact. However, many methods result in the same outcome. Why bother with retail sales using coupons when you can exchange the whole batch for one certificate? For example, mortgaging to a bank. Bankers naturally say verbally that they are unwilling to do such improper transactions, but in reality, they may consider it a good business. Lenders worry about losing money, but even if they lose money, they must first repay the loan before closing the door. The loss is the boss's problem. Borrowers hope to make money. Making money repays the principal and still leaves profit in their pockets. In fact, during business operations, making or losing money is indiscernible. So in times without special changes, goods always accumulate more and more until they become complete waste, and only then comes the final reckoning. At that time, silver coins have already become the most worthless among the waste.

Here, the foolishness of the above statement should be pointed out. Saying that there's a way to turn fifty thousand yuan into a hundred thousand yuan by including money obtained from others on the boss's account is something that should belong to others. Coupons can be used to temporarily occupy the funds, taking advantage of the fact that many people don't come to redeem them. And borrowing money is clearly incurring debt, which cannot be included in one's assets. Correct! But theoretically, debts must be repaid, while in fact, debts grow larger and larger, which is a measure of business development. Turning it around is equivalent to not having to repay A, as it is offset with goods, which share the same final fate as money. Looking at commerce as a whole, it can be said that it is purely this way. If looked at individually, there are also many cases of paying off debts, losing all capital, and thus going bankrupt. The reason, of course, is that expenses exceed income. And the total amount of these expenses is definitely no less than one or two times the amount of capital. If we don't want to defend the necessity of capitalism's wastefulness, then the tactic of turning one into two is still successful. It just doesn't dissipate as quickly.

This basic, clever trick of commerce has been consistently applied to finance in fascist countries. This is something that they themselves know is not applicable, because in finance, spending routinely exceeds use. In terms of business nature, it's bound to lead to bankruptcy. But other than this, there's no way out, so they can't worry about it anymore. This further proves the law that fascism is the final stage of capitalism.

### Fortuitous Peace

— Chen Ren

To wager decades of hard-earned energy in a desperate gamble for luck is undoubtedly a suicidal policy. Confronted with strength, failing to resist valiantly and merely seeking temporary peace is tantamount to sitting and awaiting death.

Luck and complacency are both unacceptable. Yet the world is full of people seeking luck, and the sole hope of the lucky rests upon the complacent.

However, the world is even more full of elements greedy for complacency, and the sole hope of the complacent turns out to be peace.

The foundation of peace is not built upon complacency. All who cherish peace should seek survival in struggle and strike the lucky with a painful blow at every opportunity. To seek compromise through concession, to seek complacency through compromise, and to seek peace through complacency is simply courting self-destruction.

The lucky have opened their bloody mouths, visibly devouring Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and Southern China, piece by piece. Yet the complacent still dream of peace. But where is peace? The answer is a flurry of bombs, the sound of artillery fire, and the blood and flesh of tens of millions of innocent people flying everywhere.

When peace is hopeless and the psychology of the complacent loses its basis, the hopes of the lucky inevitably fall through. Only when the final desperate gamble is cast can the dawn of true peace re-emerge in the world. Zhang Chunfeng

### Remembering Mr. Chen Yinque

— Zhang Chunfeng

Mr. Chen was the least Westernized and least pretentious professor among the faculty, completely embodying the demeanor of a scholar. Whether going to or from class, or going out, he never carried a leather briefcase, but rather a large book bag made of coarse cloth. The wrapping cloth came in several colors: red, purple, and yellow. Depending on the subject being taught that day, the color of the cloth wrapping his books would be different. However, he was one of the most internationally renowned scholars. He could freely use English and French. He had lived in Germany for years, and his German was also excellent. He had also studied Buddhism in India, and could read and speak Sanskrit. At Tsinghua University, he was not only a history professor, but also a mentor for Buddhist studies, teaching Sanskrit. His breadth of knowledge was evident.

Among the professors in Tsinghua's Faculty of Arts, Mr. Wen Yiduo was the best at making connections between research topics. But Mr. Chen was the most difficult to connect with, which shows the rigor of his scholarship. Mr. Chen could recite ancient texts from memory. He specialized in the history of the Sui, Tang, and Northern and Southern Dynasties, especially the Tang Dynasty. He could even recite the Old and New Tang Books with his eyes closed. Japanese sinologists admired and respected Mr. Chen, regarding him as an authority on the history of the Sui, Tang, and Northern and Southern Dynasties, which shows his great reputation. Mr. Feng Youlan, who rose to fame both domestically and internationally for his History of Chinese Philosophy, was also Mr. Chen's student. Therefore, one could always see Mr. Feng bowing respectfully to his teacher. In the review report that Mr. Chen wrote for Mr. Feng's History of Chinese Philosophy, Mr. Chen had this self-deprecating remark: "Yinque's studies in his life have been neither ancient nor modern, his thoughts confined to the eras of Xianfeng and Tongzhi, and his arguments resembling those between Xiangxiang and Nanpi..." In fact, it was entirely a humble statement. His research scope was not "neither modern nor ancient," but rather both modern and ancient, with broad thoughts and far-reaching insights.

He was the only famous historian in contemporary China. He also had unique views on historical research: He advocated that "historians all believe that historical theories are irrelevant to historical research and even harmful. However, the authors of historical theories, intentionally or unintentionally, imprint the author and the background of their era when they express their views, which is no different from today's newspaper editorials and commentaries. If used universally, they will all help to examine history." As for the evaluation of the authenticity of ancient Chinese works, he advocated: "With today's textual research in China, it is enough to distinguish the authenticity of ancient books. However, authenticity is merely a relative issue, and the most important thing is to be able to determine the era and author of false materials and utilize them. False materials can sometimes be as valuable as true materials. If one directly recognizes them as the genuine products of the era and author they rely on, it is unacceptable. But if one can find out the era and author of the forgery to explain the thoughts of this era and author, it will become a true material." Due to Mr. Chen's insightful views, the object and scope of materials for the study of Chinese history have become increasingly broad. Therefore, even in his class on the history of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, he not only studied the contemporary politics, economy, and cultural system, etc. from a macro perspective, but also researched that Li Bai was a foreigner, Liu Chong was a Persian, and even the origins of solitary graves, the eastward transmission of Turkish bath methods to the Tang Dynasty, and the construction of imperial palaces after An Lushan and Shi Siming's rebellions, etc., all of which were the objects of his careful research. I remember that in Tsinghua, in Mr. Chen's class, he always talked about the poets Du Fu and Bai Juyi's Changhenge, Qi Xing, Nineteen Ancient Poems, etc., all of which had new inventions that were convincing.

Perhaps it was a good habit he learned from the West, but he was never a second late for class, no matter the time. Among the common diseases of professors who are unpunctual, he was an oddity. All year round, he always wore "splendid" clothes and "splendid" shoes. In winter, he wore two fur robes, but the robe surface was coarse cloth, completely the true colors of a Chinese scholar.

Since Mr. Chen's father died for the country in the ancient city, Mr. Chen went south in a roundabout way, writing the Port defense system, and the sorrow of his family and country weighed on his heart. How could a sickly body bear it? It seems that Mr. Chen will soon be heading abroad again. I would like to wish him good health here.

### Sheep and Wolf

— Zhao Zhang

If Czechoslovakia can be compared to the last docile sheep in Europe, then Germany is the mad wolf, and England and France are the shepherds. Standing in the position of shepherds, England and France wanted to scare away this wild beast with whips before June. Later, seeing that the wolf was perhaps really hungry, they thought that if they didn't give it something to eat, it might cause even greater chaos. They sacrificed the Sudetenland, thinking it wouldn't come again. From then on, they thought they could be smug when seeing this beast and come to a "appeasement" "agreement" with it in Europe, thinking that the world could be at peace. But they didn't expect that six months later, the wolf would gradually grow stronger and its appetite would increase. The shepherds were then frightened into silence.

How regrettable and hateful this is!

The lovable sheep were sacrificed tragically. On the one hand, we regret their painful encounter, but on the other hand, we hate their own weakness. We deeply hate the wolf's ferocity and England and France's indulgence.

Czechoslovakia itself was not without the ability to resist. Although it was a weak and oppressed country, it had a foundation of heavy industry, substantial military equipment, and especially a population with a firm sense of patriotism. This failure was due to a group of confused governing leaders who didn't understand the principle of "too many cooks spoil the broth," couldn't think of a way for the sheep's strength to resist a mad wolf, and only kowtowed to the greedy, thinking that sacrificing a little was okay, so that they could gain the pity of the eater, leading to today's tragic situation. The authorities in Czechoslovakia, such as President Hacha, who only knew how to compromise and seek complete security, cannot shirk their responsibility.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

When she was about to leave, she wanted to say a few words to him, but her throat was choked with a handkerchief, and she couldn't speak. So, she picked up a pencil from the table and wrote a few words on the white tablecloth:

"I want to say a few words. Please take the handkerchief away and let me take it myself, if you want."

"No!" After he said that, she wrote again:

"Please tell me, have we ever had any grievances between us?"

"No!"

"Then why do you insist on taking me away?"

"For money, money!"

What she wanted to continue writing was:

"Ah, so you're a bandit!"

But he thought:

"Ah, so you're a hero of the greenwood!"

"Tell you, I'm a volunteer army soldier!"

The three words "volunteer army soldier" sounded familiar to her. Hadn't she heard many stories of the volunteer army? Hadn't their failures saddened her? Hadn't their victories brought her joy? Hadn't she placed her emotions in their experiences? Didn't she still remember? The photos of them that she kept, some wearing long robes, some wearing only shorts, some without "Wula" using women's red shirts to wrap their feet, these people pulling strings for their homeland were as poor as beggars. Hadn't she secretly donated money in school for them? Hadn't she tolerated her father's strict reprimands in order to save them from poverty?

"Communicating secretly with the volunteer army is a capital crime! Don't you know that?"

Yes, even if her father didn't tell him, he would know. Couldn't he see the young people who were often sentenced to death? Dying under the knife, dying in the ice caves of the Songhua River, dying in sacks (putting people in sacks, sewing up the opening, and having two or four people hold the corners of the sack and constantly throw it to the ground until death.) Dying in various newly invented cruel methods - death performances in the era of tyranny.

"If you don't listen to me again, I'll lock you at home to prevent you from causing trouble for me." (Twelve) After suffering bombing Hong Feng carves
