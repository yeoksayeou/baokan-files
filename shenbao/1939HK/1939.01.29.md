### The Responsibility of the National Gentry

— Wang Xiaolai

From "August 13th" until now, our country has been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the × people, it's either us or them. The life of the nation is now hanging by a thread, and every citizen should rise up and bravely face the difficulty! Now, our divinely gifted and valiant leader is bending over backwards and exhausting himself in dealing with the ×, how should we, as members of the nation, ponder deeply, sharpen our resolve, and exert ourselves to serve the country's needs? Perhaps the blood shed by soldiers and civilians for the war of resistance will not have been shed in vain, and the nation will be able to find a glimmer of hope amidst the myriad difficulties.

However, our supreme leader is handling a myriad of affairs every day and has no time to spare, making it difficult for him to personally connect with the people in various regions one by one. Therefore, it is essential that outstanding local talents emerge to advocate and expand the scope of their service to their hometowns, and to fulfill their responsibility to defend the nation. I previously read the leader's telegram to the national gentry, which repeatedly emphasized this point with earnestness, and I admire it immensely. The telegram particularly focuses on "promoting military service" and "developing the local economy." Please elaborate on these two matters:

(1) Today, since the war has become a national war of resistance, everyone should take up arms to defend the country. The local gentry and their children, who are usually accustomed to a life of comfort and luxury, can now set an example and be pioneers for the people. The masses will naturally follow suit, which is more effective than government decrees, I dare say. I, though not talented, participated in the citizen training in Shanghai before the "August 13th" battle, regardless of my age. Not only did my physique get trained and become stronger, but I also felt particularly happy spiritually. Furthermore, I sent my children to military school several years ago, hoping that they would be able to serve the country on the battlefield after they finish their studies. There are countless national gentry who deeply understand the greater good, and if they can demonstrate it with actions and respond to our leader's call, I am confident that it can become a trend in the shortest possible time. Then, the government can seize the opportunity and guide it, achieving twice the result with half the effort.

(2) Our leader also declared to the people: "With the abundance of our country's products and the strength of our manpower, if we can organize meticulously and utilize them flexibly, then the sustained economic strength alone will be enough to deal a fatal blow to the × people." This is why he encourages our gentry to actively assist the government in developing the local economy to replenish resources for a long-term war of resistance and lay the foundation for future nation-building. I feel that although the capital of our ethnic minorities has been unable to develop normally due to the economic oppression of a powerful neighbor, and North and Southeast China have been destroyed by the Japanese military and economic invasion, fortunately, the products and manpower of our Southwest and Northwest are no less than those of North and Southeast China. Moreover, the country's need to develop wartime resources is extremely urgent. We should seize this opportunity, follow the leader's telegram and government decrees, and vigorously correct the past mistake of focusing solely on urban construction, and actively develop the inland according to a certain plan and organization. However, we must pay attention to the fact that economic construction must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and should not only be for the benefit of a few, but should aim to realize "everyone has work to do, and everyone has food to eat." This not only addresses the current problems, but also reduces countless bloodshed and friction in the construction of a new China and the transformation of a new society in the future. Our gentry should pay close attention to this.

I often think to myself: The greatest power in the world cannot be estimated by numbers. The Japanese aggressors have always been known for their love of grand achievements, but after these nineteen months of war, their financial and military strength has been stretched thin, and their state of poverty and distress can be evidenced by numbers. Their inevitable disastrous defeat and collapse is a matter of course. On the contrary, our country's greatness cannot be measured by numbers. I have recently traveled to various provinces in the Southwest and am even more convinced that our country's greatness cannot be measured by numbers, and the greatness of the Northwest provinces is no less than that of the Southwest provinces. However, this vast virgin land cannot be developed in a day or two, or by the efforts of one person alone. Our gentry should widely publicize this to all sectors at home and abroad, so that they know that our country not only has the strength to persist in the war of resistance, but also has the conditions to win the war. The day of final victory will not be far away. As I write this, I cannot help but feel infinite excitement and anticipation, hoping that everyone will strive to embody the "four diligences" proclaimed in the leader's telegram and reject the "four wastes" that he warned against. May all compatriots, especially the gentry, encourage each other.

### The Rebirth of the Chinese Nation (Part 2)

— Chiang Soong Mei-ling

In the previous article (see the second edition of the 19th), I explained that we have a firm belief in the rebirth of the Chinese nation. However, to turn belief into reality, we must evolve from ideal reasoning into practical action.

The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates trained his disciples to 'understand themselves.' Undoubtedly, he wanted everyone to do an objective, calm self-analysis as the basis for improving themselves.

To build a novel, strong, and unified Republic of China, each of us must first engage in deep introspection. We must strictly examine and frankly admit our past failures and mistakes, so that we can remedy failures and correct mistakes in the days to come.

The bad results we reap are the seeds we ourselves have sown. In the past few years, our lax atmosphere has developed into a stagnant custom that is not universal. If our country has become a laggard in the international arena, then we can only blame ourselves and cannot complain about others.

If a new China with a glorious life can emerge from blue blood and ashes in the future, then those in responsible positions will realize that they must automatically shoulder the burden and devote their greatest obligations, all their energy, thoughts, and wisdom to the work of benefiting the country and the people. Otherwise, he should resign and take the blame.

To clean up the post-war mess and rebuild China, character is extremely important. We need the integrity of the mind, the purity of behavior, and most importantly, a clear conscience. Of course, we also need practical wisdom.

Personal behavior is the model for continuing a good personality. Therefore, as long as we improve our lives and revive our sense of responsibility for public and private matters, we can personally establish lofty morals, thereby generating a force that can make an effective contribution to the regeneration of the entire nation. If we cannot carve out our own path to self-salvation, then we will disgrace our ancestors.

All those in responsible positions, even if they only have one point of ability, must do their best with that ability. This is not only for the country, but also for personal consideration, in order to avoid the ugly name of being a sinecure and to avoid the accusation of deliberately shirking responsibility in the face of national crisis.

We should strictly criticize all actions that violate the interests of the public, and we must conduct a review without favoritism of those who superficially pretend to be enthusiastic about public affairs but live off the state. On the other hand, those who are supported by the national treasury, registered as officials, but abandon their responsibilities and bear guilt will be severely punished.

Giving commendation and rewards to those who are responsible and wise is the least amount of compensation.

All of our compatriots have a responsibility to cleanse and wash away the flaws of corruption and bribery that our country once had. Closely following corruption is the shadow of cowardice. We should always remember that our national humiliation and the shame of our territory being ceded after the Sino-Japanese War were the result of the combination of corruption and cowardice. Now, we have the opportunity to wash away this historical stain. The heroic soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing their lives, which is enough to make us no longer worry about our own safety. Only the traitors who have lost their conscience, who take advantage of safety to directly or indirectly embezzle public funds for saving the country and resisting the war, and disappoint the heroic soldiers, will not be ashamed. Everyone in the rear should pay attention without hiding that all the strength and all the money are completely used for the work of resisting the war and building the country. This work is causing many soldiers to sacrifice and countless people to suffer. Not only because our country's fate is in a more dangerous situation than it was in the Sino-Japanese War, but also because we want to leave a reputation of integrity and courage in the historical record.

Our past flaws were described long ago by Edmund Burke in his writings. He said: 'Food and filth give us more harm than hundreds of millions of debts; it expels the courage of our soldiers, deprives the wisdom of our authorities, and the credit of the most important parts of our political machinery.' Who would want to relive this old lesson of pain? Everyone will of course say "no." Then, is there anything more urgent and important than that every official should tremble and always regard the reward he receives, the salary he receives from the national treasury, that is, the blood and sweat directly and indirectly contributed by the people, as something that cannot be taken lightly!

No one who receives a salary from the state can forget, nor can they be allowed to forget, that since he enjoys the people's taxes, he is the people's servant. We must use the two concepts of improving purity and truly serving the people as the criterion for all actions.

The corrupt idea that officials are the masters of the people should be driven out of our minds as far as possible.

From the flames of freedom, we will forge a new understanding: all people who pay taxes have the right to enjoy the grace of a good and just government, and this government must truly work for the benefit of the people at any cost.

If the government can do this, the people will inevitably be rich, and if the people are rich, the country will inevitably be prosperous. A prosperous country must be peaceful and strong.

When the country reaches a state of peace and prosperity, then a new China will be like the legendary phoenix, resurrected from her ashes, truly achieving the purpose predicted by the Latin word (RESURGAN): "I will be reborn."

### China in Battle (II)

— Written by Karlman of the Soviet Union

—Translated from the January 1st Moscow News—

The Soldiers of the New China

In the morning, I met Mr. Zhou Enlai at General Chen Cheng's headquarters. He was very thin and looked very tired, looking around at the people with his red eyes due to lack of sleep. He was ordered by President Chiang to preside over the investigation into the truth of the Changsha fire.

Chen Yiji (transliteration), the commander of the Yuezhou army, personally told me about the battle situation along the railway. He was already thirty-one years old, but he looked no more than twenty-five. He was very lively and optimistic. He paced back and forth in the room. His laughter was very clear, and he gestured enthusiastically when he spoke. He is known as the "General Who Never Retreats" in the country and in the army. When the Sino-Japanese War began, the superior × army attacked the regiment he commanded in Hebei. This area was in the western wing of the Chinese army, and its mission was to defend Baoding. The Japanese army attacked Baoding in three routes to eliminate this regiment. At that time, the Chinese artillery had not yet arrived from the rear, while the × air force and heavy artillery had already been fully deployed. Chen Yiji and his soldiers held out against the × people for four days and nights under constant shelling and bombing. On the fourth day, only a few dozen soldiers were left. He personally led them in close combat. Unfortunately, he was hit by a bullet in the shoulder and fell down. The news spread to the ears of every soldier in an instant. After "The regimental commander is injured!" someone shouted, "The regimental commander is dead!" The advancing ranks stopped unexpectedly. He woke up, stood up straight, and shouted: "The regimental commander is here, charge!"

In the panic, the Japanese army quickly left the highlands, losing countless rifles and machine guns. The soldiers occupied the highlands and guarded them for six more hours according to the received orders. But the second bullet pierced through the chest of Regimental Commander Chen again. Several lightly injured soldiers carried him to the rear. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties.

Chen Yiji left the hospital and returned to the team before the end of his recuperation period. In Taierzhuang, he led a brigade to participate in the annihilation of the Japanese × war. In Xuzhou, his brigade intercepted the Japanese army that wanted to encircle the Chinese army. He was ordered to cover the large army until it was out of the encirclement. The Japanese army used planes to bomb his brigade and released poison gas. After most of his subordinates died guarding the position due to poisoning, he helped a few personal followers to personally go to the Chen site to fight.

The Chinese army finally left the country, but he still led some soldiers to continue to support and inflict heavy blows on the Japanese. The bold statement "It is easier to shake a mountain than to shake the Chinese army" resonated throughout the country.

Brigade Commander Chen said: "The Japanese are finished, we have stopped them. Many times they wanted to forcefully cross the river to enter Changsha, but every attack was repelled. On the other side of the river, they are building strong fortifications; laying barbed wire; repairing the railways that we automatically destroyed into highways; and sending spies to our side every day. Often, they just grab a villager and give him an injection in his hand, and send him to the front line. They tell him that the poison is fatal, and say: If you bring back news of the Chinese army within ten days, we will give you another antidote injection, and you can live. Those villagers went all the way to the Chinese army headquarters to tell this situation. Yesterday, two such muddleheads gave up their lives and died very miserably. The villagers talked about the various terrorist methods of the Japanese army in the occupied areas. Because the Japanese could not find food or places to live in those places, nor could they find roads, they retaliated on the residents who had not had time to avoid them. They killed hundreds and thousands of people, first subjecting them to all kinds of abuses. This requires people to... to..."

Brigade Commander Chen broke the... and someone helped a fashionable woman in, and the woman was crying. She was the wife of one of the masterminds of the Changsha fire who was executed this time. The sound of crying still came from outside the window in waves. Three gunshots came from behind the tree. Brigade Commander Chen listened attentively and closed the window and said: "This is them being shot." (Continued on page 3)

### The Northwestern War is Approaching. A Certain Official Inspects the Front Lines. Our Strength is Several Times Greater Than the × Army. There Have Been Skirmishes in Southern Shanxi

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th of this month] Shaanxi Electric Dispatch: Because the × have repeatedly increased their troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan, we have also strengthened our defenses in the Northwest. Now our strength is several times greater than that of the ×, and our weapons are also quite sophisticated. It is impossible for the × to break through. A certain official recently went to the front again for inspection, greatly boosting morale. It is confirmed that the × have suffered a total of 10,000 casualties in their harassment of western Shanxi. Recently, they have been constantly mobilizing on the Tongpu Road and various highways, and fierce battles will resume. Currently, there are small contacts in the vicinity of Yuxiang, Jiexian, Anyi, Xiaxian, Wenxi, Jiangxian, and Quwo. Our guerrillas once occupied the Songdian Station. The capture of Xiaxian has not been confirmed. Between Zhongyang and Lishi, we annihilated more than 100 × soldiers and are still in fierce battle.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th of this month] The military situation in the Northwest is gradually becoming tight. The × have launched fierce attacks in southern Shanxi and have amassed a total of four and a half divisions, plus two reserve general team divisions. There will be a major battle soon.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th of this month] The Fifth Division of the × Army in Taiwan has opened to Shantou and Zhelin, plotting to invade Raoping and Chao'an. Kondo's Fifth Fleet has also gathered towards Weizhou Island, attempting to invade from Beihai. We have made strict preparations.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] Nearly 1,000 × have recently been added to Fenyang. The commander resides in Diaoshi, commanding the troops in Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Zhongyang, and Lishi. There is no change in the Jiugu Hujia Rong area. The × in Linfen recently held a military meeting in the city, reporting on the losses in their recent invasion of Jixian, totaling more than 600 officers and soldiers killed and wounded, mainly including an artillery colonel, and the loss of 27 mountain guns and more than 700 machine guns and rifles. They also said that they suffered from hunger and cold in the mountains and gained nothing. The Chinese army's hand grenades are very lethal, it was said. In addition, a guerrilla team of our department in central Shanxi attacked the × in Pingyao and Jiexiu for several days in a row, achieving considerable gains, and destroyed more than four miles of the railway between Beiliang Rubiqiao and Jichengdian, and destroyed a turret.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] Military News: The × have added a total of eight or nine thousand troops in Anyi, Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Jiangxian in southern Shanxi. Our troops have made contact with the × at various passes in Zhongtiao Mountain. There are more than 1,000 × near Wenxi. Since the 20th, they have been divided into Wangshan and our troops have been fighting fiercely for a day and night. The × suffered heavy casualties, and we also suffered considerable losses. Our reinforcements have arrived and are still fighting against the ×.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 28th] The ×, who had invaded Yangyi in the south, sneaked into the Niuchuan Nanyang Yang area on the 22nd, with a vanguard of more than 1,000 troops, and advanced towards Heshun. They were intercepted by our troops near Qianjiaying and fought fiercely for more than five hours, killing more than 200 × soldiers. By evening, the × successively reinforced and bombarded our positions with heavy artillery. Our army then moved its position for battle reasons. That night, the × advanced to Heshun City and Yaboping (east of Heshun) and still showed signs of advancing south.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 28th] More than 1,000 × have been added to Lingshi in recent days, with seven or eight artillery pieces, stationed in the Shagu Shangcun area east of the city, plotting to commit Jingzhen Le. The × in Huoxian have also increased. One unit of more than 700 crossed the Fenhe River and invaded the west. They were intercepted by our troops in the Liaozhuang Chencun area, killing many × soldiers. Another unit of more than 600 × sneaked to the Dazhangcun Yucun area and are fighting with our troops. The × in Linfen have been actively building fortifications on the west bank of the Fen River for days to prevent our attacks.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 28th] The × in Taiyuan have been conducting air defense exercises for days because they fear attacks by our air force, and have secretly built a tunnel near Shanxi University, leading directly to the outside of the city for escape. More than 20 landmines have been installed on each street in the city, and the general control center is located in a certain headquarters in Ningbei Prefecture.

[Reuters, London, 28th] It is rumored that the Japanese government has decided to annex the Xisha Islands. The Japanese decision has been approved by the Japanese Emperor on the 28th of this month. London is consulting on this matter, which has not yet been confirmed. Diplomatic officials believe that it is not very reliable. According to what is known, France occupies the island, which is undoubtedly the case. There are only a few fishermen on the island. It is reported that when Japan wanted to occupy Hainan Island some time ago, the French government decided to take steps to guarantee its rights to the Xisha Islands. France sent a warship to the area and saw a Japanese warship docked there. After exchanging courtesies, the Japanese warship withdrew within a few hours.

[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 27th] After all the Gui Sui × bandits moved to Xincheng, several members of our plainclothes team sneaked into the city and burned many houses where the × were stationed, causing heavy losses to the ×. Near Dengkou Station, a landmine recently exploded, destroying several × military vehicles and killing about 100 ×, including one × general.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 28th of this month] A certain unit of our troops, 10,000 strong, has now advanced to a certain area in Hebei Province and is now advancing to a certain province. Our certain units have coordinated their attacks, and a major battle is expected in the Suiyuan-Chahar area.

### The Victory Report of Our Army in Hangzhou's Suburbs: Twice Attacking the × Army in Gongbu, Fierce Battles in Changan and Tangqi

[Special Dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th of this month] Special News from Hangzhou: Liu's troops and Jiang Shuwei's troops of the Jiaxing Militia Volunteers in the suburbs of Hangzhou took advantage of their victory on the 20th and advanced from the Yu Hang Highway and other places. The Gongzhan Bridge was captured and continued to advance towards Hangzhou City. On the 21st, more than 1,000 soldiers from the × army suddenly came from Shanghai, covered by artillery and aircraft, and pounced on the Gongbu position. In order to avoid sacrifices, we temporarily retreated to ××. On the 21st, we took the opportunity to rush into Gongbu again, and then released the fruit. The area has been extremely chaotic in recent days. In addition to rushing to build fortifications in the city, the × army has also transferred a large number of reinforcements from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, stationed in Jibomen, Qiantangmen, Yongjinmen, and other places. Since the 23rd, the × army in Tangqi in the suburbs of Hangzhou has been attacked by our army from Huzhou in four routes. The × army's defense works have been completely destroyed, and a barracks of × soldiers has been burned down. Fierce battles are still going on. Water and land transportation are completely cut off. An encounter battle occurred in the suburbs of Changan along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line some time ago.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 27th] A certain division of our army launched a fierce night attack on the × in the vicinity of Xuancheng the night before last, taking advantage of the ×'s unpreparedness, and charged bravely, heading straight for the ×'s headquarters. The × army was caught sleeping, woke up in a panic, and fled in all directions. Our army took the opportunity to kill, killing several important officials of the ×, and seizing a large number of military equipment, documents, and supplies. The × were scattered by our attack and were unable to regroup for several days.

### Promoting Secondary Education in Yunnan Province

### Chongqing Churches Telegraph the League of Nations to Expose the Crimes of Japanese ×, The Residences of Foreign Nationals in Xi'an Were Also Destroyed by × Aircraft

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The churches in Chongqing telegraphed the League of Nations to protest that the × aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of urban areas in Chongqing on the 15th caused hundreds of innocent civilians to be killed or injured, which is a great crime against humanity, and requested the League of Nations to awaken world opinion and unanimously condemn the Japanese side's atrocities. The well-known organizations in the telegram are the American Methodist Mission in the Inland, the Anglican Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Canadian Church, and the Friends Church.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] When Japanese aircraft bombed Xi'an on the 28th of this month, the residence of Ms. Franklin, a female missionary of the Central Baptist Church, collapsed due to the shock. Ms. Franklin herself was fortunate enough to hide in the church's air-raid shelter and was not injured. A bomb also fell in the garden of the Xi'an Postmaster's residence, and the windows were destroyed. A bomb also fell on a thatched shed near the residence, killing one worker. The postal staff were all hiding in the air-raid shelter at the time, and the candlelight in the shelter was completely extinguished due to the shock of the bombing. Several people were killed or injured in an air-raid shelter near the post office courtyard.

### Rumors that Shao Lizi Was Kidnapped Is Actually a Misunderstanding. This Newspaper Sent Special Telegrams to Chongqing and Shanghai to Investigate the Truth. The Kidnapped Person Was Wool Merchant Zhao Lianchi

[Special News from This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, Reuters and Associated Press reported that Shao Lizi was kidnapped by × at his residence on Avenyi Road, Dahua Road, Shanghai. This newspaper sent special telegrams to Chongqing and Shanghai to investigate the truth. After receiving replies last night, it was confirmed that it was a misunderstanding. The Chongqing reply said, "Regarding the kidnapping of Shao Lizi in Shanghai, after inquiring from people close to Shao, it was confirmed to be completely untrue. Shao has not yet gone to Shanghai, let alone been kidnapped by ×. Chongqing finds this unfounded rumor ridiculous." The Shanghai reply said, "After careful investigation, Shao Lizi did not come to Shanghai. According to foreign telegrams, the kidnapped person was actually wool merchant Lu Huanchi. The Shanghai English Da Mei Evening News mistakenly identified him as Shao Lizi due to translation issues."

### × Maneuvers Exhausted: Forged Telegram from Wu Peifu Attempting to Force Wu to Assume a Puppet Position; Wu's Spokesperson Denies

[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] Japanese sources spread rumors that Wu Peifu has accepted a position under Japanese protection. Today, Wu's spokesperson angrily denied it, stating, "Wu sent a telegram to several of his friends, but Japanese inspectors recklessly altered it, turning it into a telegram to deceive the entire nation." Neutral observers explain that the Japanese are doing this to force Wu to betray his integrity.

[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] According to reports from here, people in both the Northern and Southern puppet governments deeply fear that Wu Peifu will take up a puppet military position, thus losing their power. The news released by the Domei News Agency, requesting Wu to take a position, was entirely issued by the traitorous side. Neutral observers believe that the Japanese are spreading this news with the aim of having the traitor Liang issue a declaration, enraging Wu and making him accept Japanese conditions, thereby excluding the traitor Liang.

[Associated Press, Beijing, 28th] The puppet government continues to try to entice Wu Peifu to take a position. However, the various puppets within the puppet organization fear that once Wu takes office, he will seize their power. Therefore, they only nominally promote Wu to head North China military affairs. The Japanese still have their final chess move in mind, that is, if they cannot induce Wang Jingwei to take a puppet position in the Central China government, they will utilize Wu. Wu met with a group of traitors from the puppet provisional government on the 24th of this month, but the meeting ended unhappily. The traitors in the puppet government suggested to Wu that he should leave Beiping for Kaifeng to take up a military position, with Kaifeng as his base. Wu angrily said that this was not inviting him to take a position, but actually exiling him.

× Failure to Entice Wu Peifu; Now Attempting to Entice Wang Zhaoming

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to political figures, the Japanese military is paying close attention to Wang Jingwei. They currently believe that Wang is still residing in Hanoi. Although Wang recently announced the so-called "Three No's Doctrine," the Japanese still hope that he can emerge to form a puppet regime under their control. At that time, Wang could obtain the title of "President." It is also rumored that Japanese agents are still urging Wang to take a position immediately and not stay in Hanoi for long. Furthermore, the plan advocated by the previous Konoe cabinet in Japan to merge puppet regimes or organize a joint Chinese puppet regime has been completely abandoned by the Hiranuma cabinet. Hiranuma and others believe that the merger of puppet organizations is of no importance, and the most important issue is how to make the Chinese people willing to accept Japanese rule. Therefore, they should utilize their past influence over Wang to preside over the South China puppet regime and assist Japan in ruling all of China.

### Central Committee Members Assigned to Serve on the Battlefield and Preside Over Political Training Work

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to political figures, members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees without fixed duties will be immediately dispatched to various guerrilla units to preside over political training work for the military and the people. (Editor's Note: This news was first recorded in this newspaper's special dispatch on the 26th.) According to recent reports received here, battles are occurring in various guerrilla areas, and as a result, Japan cannot but step up its response.

### Baoshan Guerrillas Execute Spies; Shanghai × Lacks Strength

[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 28th] In the Yanghang area of Baoshan County, our army's guerrillas have entered and are active, controlling land and water transportation in the surrounding villages. The county town's × army does not dare to underestimate and attack this force and remains motionless due to its limited strength. In order to actively carry out anti-traitor work, the guerrillas recently selected two individuals from among the several pseudo-investigators sent by Shanghai's pseudo-"Detective Weaving Team" who were loyal as slaves and acted as spies for the × side to investigate the guerrillas' movements. After interrogation, the two pseudo-"investigators" admitted to engaging in sabotage work against the guerrillas and have been executed in a certain location. Before long, the translator of the pseudo-"Police Station" was also arrested by the guerrillas the day before yesterday. The reason for the arrest was also for specializing in espionage work for the × army. After the two cases occurred, the × pseudo-authorities were greatly alarmed and have been stepping up precautions in the Songbao area in recent days.

### × Occupation; Reopening of the Yangtze River Indefinitely Postponed; German Ship Robbed Near Zhanghuabin

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 28th] According to the chairman of the Wuhan Pseudo-Maintenance of Public Order Committee, the Japanese side is determined to reopen Yangtze River navigation within a month. However, business circles in that area do not believe this news. It is heard that British merchants in Hankou have requested the British authorities to send ships to transport British expatriate families from Shanghai back to Hankou. However, the British ambassador advised British expatriates not to board Japanese ships on the Yangtze River to avoid affecting the issue of demanding the reopening of waterways from Japan.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Shanghai dispatch: The German ship "Hensha" was robbed by pirates near Zhanghuabin at the mouth of the Yangtze River yesterday at midnight. Several Chinese passengers and a barge loaded with goods were taken away. The pirates have not yet made a ransom demand.

### Ministry of Propaganda Commends Fang Canglang

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 27th] The Ministry of Propaganda, considering that Fang Canglang, a former Wuhan Daily reporter who recently escaped from Tianjin to Guizhou, was captured when Xuzhou fell and remained unyielding in the face of danger, hereby issues a formal commendation and grants a consolation fund of two hundred yuan to inspire and encourage others.

From early morning, Chinese people in the Public Concession and the French Concession all flew flags at half-mast. All newspapers, except those run by the Japanese, published articles praising the 19th Route Army and advocating continued resistance against Japan. Security was tightened today in the concessions and Japanese-occupied areas, but no unexpected incidents have occurred so far.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 28th] On the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Incident, the concession authorities are heavily guarded, with patrols densely deployed. The volunteer corps' soldiers, equipped with machine guns, are patrolling the streets, and some small intersections are blocked with barbed wire. As of the time of the dispatch, no accidents have occurred in the concessions.

Commemorating January 28th in Various Places

### China at War Continued from Page 2

Hengshan Military Conference

Traveling from Changsha to Hengshan must be done at night. The journey is one hundred and twenty kilometers. Crossing the river is the most dangerous, because dozens of cars always line up waiting for the ferry, making it a conspicuous target. Hengshan has recently been bombed flat by × planes. Even the magnificent ancient temple on the outskirts of Hengshan was not spared. Dozens of people fled into the temple during the air raid, and many of them died under the ruins.

A spacious old school has now become a dense, impassable forest. Dozens of cypress and pine trees cut from the mountains are planted in the ground, and the entire courtyard is covered with a thick layer of pine and cypress branches. Commanders from all war fronts gathered here to exchange experiences, compile statistics on the completed first phase of the war of resistance, and plan the path for future resistance. This is the essence of the Chinese army, with commanders of all armies, divisions, and brigades gathered in one place.

The meeting started at dawn and stopped when the planes could operate, continuing again in the evening.

Before the meeting started, the representatives walked around in groups in the courtyard, discussing or sitting on the surrounding rocks waiting for the meeting to begin. The large number of young people was most noticeable. Many young officers were promoted to important positions within a few months of the war because of their courage and resourcefulness. If a famous senior general passed by in the courtyard, they would stand at attention and salute. Among the representatives, General Chen Cheng, the commander of the Ninth War Zone and the Minister of the Political Department, was of a slender build and not very tall. He had just arrived from Changsha with Chairman Chiang. General Bai Chongxi, tall, handsome, and refined, was also Chairman Chiang's closest comrade in the war of resistance. The training of new recruits that he was responsible for was the most important task in the war of resistance. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin hurried past the rows of people, walking into the meeting hall. The hall was full, and everyone sat down in order, but after a shout of "Attention," everyone stood up straight. Chairman Chiang strode in and sat on the high platform decorated with flags, indicating for the officers to sit down. After each speaker saluted the Chairman, they began to speak. Each commander spoke in turn about the × people's strengths and vulnerable points. The × people were afraid of bad weather and darkness and could not fight in the mountains or in places far from transportation lines. In short, they could not withstand the loss of even one condition for battle: if the Japanese army did not have artillery support, they would completely lose their fighting ability. They often concentrated their forces on one point, losing contact with the rear, and thus suffered losses from the guerrillas.

All speakers at the meeting unanimously praised the Chinese soldiers' courage and perseverance when discussing their strengths. They hated the × people and were not afraid of death. They fought very well in the mountains without artillery support and often launched two-pronged attacks, which the Japanese invariably could not resist.

The commanders also noted their own shortcomings. They all said that they must accelerate communication in the war zone, strengthen communication between various units, and improve the treatment of wounded soldiers.

When there was an air raid alert, the officers would leave their seats and take refuge in the mountain caves, listening to the rattling sound of the × planes. Once, fifteen bombers flew overhead, unaware of the rich target below them, unaware that in these caves, the best military commanders in China were discussing plans to destroy the Japanese army.

Chairman Chiang said at this historically significant meeting:

"The first phase of the war of resistance has ended, and we have entered a new stage of the war of resistance. In order to plan how to strengthen our forces in the future war of resistance, our officers and soldiers must analyze the lessons and experiences of the first phase of the war of resistance. We lured the Japanese army deep into our country, dispersed their forces everywhere, and shattered their dream of a quick victory. Therefore, we were victorious in this phase. The Japanese plot to conquer China has become a bubble."

Dozens of camouflaged cars flashed their lights and made a humming sound in the mountains in the middle of the night. The commanders bid farewell in a hurry and went to the front lines.

The Changsha government's bulletin board was filled with the steps taken to relieve the victims of the Changsha fire and the news of the severe punishment of those responsible. So now the road is again crowded with groups of refugees returning to the city.

Reserve Army Headquarters

After crossing the river in the middle of the night, we entered Guangxi Province. Young male and female sentries carefully checked all vehicles crossing the border and inspected documents.

Guangxi Province in southwestern China occupies a special position in the country. Its administration, geography, living conditions, residents' work habits, and even clothing are very unique. So once you enter Guangxi Province, you feel like you have crossed a border. Even the mountains here do not look like mountains: tall, straight obelisks rise from the flat plateau. They appear one after another in the thousands on the azure, misty horizon. This peculiar and magnificent landscape is very similar to the polychrome stone columns in a mysterious ancient Greek building that an artist is trying to express. The people of Guangxi say that according to scientific research, Guangxi Province was actually the bottom of the ocean, and these stone pillars were formed by the currents in the water. There are many caves in the mountains, several kilometers long, with dazzling scenery inside, magnificent underground palaces, magnificent arched main halls, steep cliffs, and cascading waterfalls, truly a wondrous sight. The scenery created by nature here is a virtual dream that architectural genius cannot realize.

The people of Guangxi use these caves to avoid air raids. Guilin, the provincial capital of Guangxi, is bombed violently by the × people almost every day. They have completely destroyed street after street. Thousands of people have become homeless, and it is all thanks to the timely issuance of each air raid alert that the loss of life in the city is relatively small.

As soon as each alarm is issued, the entire city is immediately vacated. Tens of thousands of people surge through the streets like a tide. Store owners and residents hurriedly board up their doors, and after a quarter of an hour, the entire city is like death. The crowds have already left the city and are heading into the mountains. Looking down on the entire city from the mountain peaks is like holding it in your palm. The sound of airplanes is getting closer. Eighteen twin-engine bombers, with fighter escorts, are flying at high altitude. After a while, there should be the sound of explosions, but unexpectedly, the planes do not drop bombs and just pass over our heads like this. After a while, the mountains and the city are filled with leaflets falling from the sky, with absurd words written on them.

The people hiding in the mountains are extremely angry. They tear up the leaflets before they finish reading them and pile them up on the spot to burn. Those eighteen planes turn around and fly over the city again, and dozens of heavy bombs fall into the city. The mountains shake as if they have been shaken. The planes, in order to avoid the bombardment of anti-aircraft guns, disperse individually and bomb the urban area back and forth. People watch their houses collapse with stunned eyes, and many people even cry.

It is no coincidence that the Japanese dropped leaflets on the residents of Guangxi Province, and it is no coincidence that the people of Guangxi put down their guns.

Guangxi Province is the headquarters of China's people's reserve army. Of the province's population of fourteen million, two and a half million can fight and have received military training. Villagers in every village receive two hours of military training after work. Those receiving military training include university students, middle school students, government agency service personnel, and women. Five hundred thousand soldiers in the Chinese army are from Guangxi. Every high school graduate in Guangxi is qualified to be a squad leader.

The literacy rate is very high in this relatively poor province. Sixty-four percent of Guangxi residents have received education. Every Guangxi person is very proud of the province's fighting ability and talks about the glorious responsibilities that Guangxi people have in the war of self-defense. Guangxi people are strong, healthy, able to endure hardship and stand hard work. The women here have never bound their feet and carry burdens like men, which is rarely seen in Hunan and Hubei. When you see the flying beauty of Guangxi women, you cannot help but admire them. A pair of large, intelligent eyes sparkle in their ivory-colored faces. They use their strong, muscular hands to row heavy oars on boats, carrying heavy buckets of burdens, and still walk so briskly. Guangxi women are also excellent at shooting. They can endure all the hardships of marching like men. All the way to the border of Guizhou Province, we kept seeing teams of young male and female student soldiers fully armed receiving training in strategy, shooting, construction, and marching.

The Curse of Compromise

We gradually turned into the mountains, sometimes with a layer of milky white clouds hovering beneath our feet. The road was built a few years ago, and there is a monument on the rocks beside the road commemorating the workers who died while building this road due to heatstroke, illness, and falling. These mountains contain infinite treasures. Coal seams are on the surface, almost everywhere. One day, the fires of smelting furnaces will be lit here, and trains loaded with coal and metals will come and go in the mountain caves. The sound of waterfalls will come from the power plant's boilers. Today, only a small amount of coal is extracted from these millions of tons of rich reserves, only to warm a poor man's thatched hut.

After crossing another border, we left Guizhou. From the gray, high, cloud-covered rocks, we descended into the fertile Sichuan valley. The orchards and endless rice fields on both sides of the Yangtze River are all covered by a layer of gray mist. We have already traveled one thousand five hundred kilometers since leaving Changsha. The road descends very steeply towards the Yangtze River. The turns protrude over the river. Spreading above the mountains is a large city, covered by low gray clouds, that is Chongqing!—China's temporary capital.

Even before the fall of Hankou, Chongqing had in fact become an important center of China. All political organizations, central agencies, and famous artists, writers, and scientists from Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai, as long as they were not directly participating in frontline work, were concentrated in Chongqing.

You can tell at a glance that Chongqing is densely populated. The roads are crowded with cars, rickshaws, and thousands of people. The people on the streets are very active and excited. It is currently propaganda week, and at every street corner, groups of people are gathered around propagandists listening to their reports on war news and the popular voices from all over the country responding urgently to the government's military arrangements. This war has promoted the consolidation of the Chinese people at an unprecedented speed. They believe in their inevitable victory. The year 1939 coincided with the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. China is examining and measuring its strength, compiling statistics, and mobilizing China's trained army of 240 divisions.

Less than two months after the fall of Wuhan, all the army losses in the battle to defend Wuhan had been completely replenished, and hundreds of thousands of fresh troops were ready to join the ranks.

All army necessities are abundant. Last year's harvest was bountiful, and large amounts of food were able to be hoarded to supply soldiers and residents.

The Chinese people know that the × people are exhausted and that tens of millions of people in the occupied areas have risen up to fight.

The Chinese people curse all traitors who dream of "peace" and surrender.

"Resolutely resist to the end until the × people are completely destroyed." These two sentences, like raging flames, are burning in the hearts of the Chinese people, who are using all their strength to overthrow the × people.

### × Financial Situation on the Brink of Bankruptcy; Intending to Increase Taxes Again in Mid-February; Desperate for War Funds

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to official news agency reports, in order to cope with the specially increased military expenditure, the Ministry of Finance will implement an increase in income tax, transaction tax, and sugar monopoly tax in mid-January to raise 200,000 yen.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese Minister of Finance proposed a case that stipulates that the government will purchase all gold in the country, and all privately held gold ornaments should also be presented to the government. The Japanese government's new establishment of this regulation and the application of new taxes show that the Japanese side is searching for ways to support the war expenses against China.

Japan Sends Tani Masayuki as Ambassador to France; French Authorities Reject

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo News: Japan sent Tani Masayuki as ambassador to France and sought France's consent. The French authorities refused because Tani had publicly attacked France to reporters in Shanghai. Hiranuma and Arita were very embarrassed and convened a cabinet meeting on the 27th to discuss countermeasures. It was reportedly decided that Arita would handle the situation as circumstances required, temporarily dispatching its minister-counselor in France as acting envoy, and the Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that France's refusal to consent was incomprehensible. During the plenary session of the House of Peers, member Sakatani also raised questions about Tani's case, but Arita only said that he was currently watching France's attitude and had no intention of replacing the ambassador.

House of Representatives Foreign Policy Questions; × Cabinet Members Struggling to Cope

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo News: The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session on the 27th, with the most questions about foreign policy. First, Tsurumi Yusuke of the Democratic Party, known for his foreign affairs expertise, raised questions about the notes from the UK, the US, and France. Tsurumi said that since the views of the three countries were different from Japan's, what methods would the cabinet use to make them understand? Arita replied that he would deal with it with an unyielding spirit, and that long-term endurance was needed not only in armed warfare but also in ideological and cultural warfare. Tsurumi also asked why the cabinet did not make further efforts since the US note of December 31 was milder than before. Arita replied that he would adopt specific policies after the end of the war to make them understand. This answer showed that Arita still had room for flexibility, with the intention being to be both willing and cautious. Kasai Heiji questioned whether there was a solution to the issue of Yangtze River navigation and the interests of various countries in China. Arita replied that the pending issues between Japan and the UK and the US were being resolved as quickly as possible. Kasai also asked whether it was true that the army advocated northward expansion and the navy advocated southward expansion. Hiranuma replied that both the army and the navy sought the development of national power based on national policy, and there was no distinction between northward and southward expansion. Kasai's words were an indirect question about friction with the navy, but Hiranuma's reply was irrelevant. Morita of the Seiyukai questioned that if work on rear construction was not fully promoted, would it hinder "long-term construction?" Hiranuma replied that rear construction would inevitably be suspended due to the increase in military spending, and he would try his best to save other expenses to meet the needs of rear construction. From this question and answer, it can be seen that the × people's rear construction has completely stopped, and the so-called "long-term construction" has no extra strength. ×'s predicament is more than half over.

Fukuoka Coal Mine Explosion; Dozens of Miners Buried Alive

[Central News Agency, Fukuoka, 28th] A coal mine in Fukuoka, Kyushu, suddenly exploded today. Sixty-one miners were in the mine, all of whom were buried. As a result, twenty-five people were rescued, twenty-four died, and twelve were injured. The remains of the deceased have been exhumed.

### British Authorities Order Resumption of Naval Emergency Reserve; French and British Foreign Ministers Separately Meet Soviet Ambassadors; Soviets Decide to Maintain Franco-Soviet Alliance

[Reuters, London, 28th] It is learned that British authorities have announced that the Royal Navy's "Emergency" Reserve Force is to be reinstated. This reserve force was established in 1912 and abolished after the war. Its purpose is to be able to quickly summon personnel of all ranks (including signalmen and telegraph operators) in times of emergency. They will serve for a period of five years before the Royal Proclamation for the conscription of all reserve forces, and will be paid one shilling per day.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz yesterday. It is rumored that the talks were related to the recent news of trade negotiations between the Soviet Union and Germany.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this evening, for reasons unknown. What is noteworthy is that Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz also happened to visit French Foreign Minister Bonnet at the same time.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon and briefed him on the details of the Rome talks. Maisky, in turn, explained the commercial negotiations that the Soviet Union and Germany were about to undertake. Regarding this matter, Soviet sources here say that these negotiations were initiated by Germany, and the German side may take the opportunity to inquire about the Soviet Union's attitude should something happen in Western Europe in the future. As for the Soviet Union, it will maintain close contact with Poland. During talks with German leader Hitler earlier this month, information was provided regarding the situation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and it was stated that it was unlikely to promote the separation of the Ukrainian republic. The intention was to shift Germany's attention to the West, which is greatly appreciated. Furthermore, the current Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should provide military assistance to France if Germany attacks France. However, if France is attacked by Italy, this mutual assistance treaty cannot be implemented. If the member states of the League of Nations can invoke the covenant at that time, the Soviet Union can still provide assistance to France in accordance with the terms of the covenant.

British Three Ministers Roar Like Lions: Military Strength "Unmatchable"

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] British First Lord of the Admiralty Stanhope published an article in the newspaper today, stating that after the beginning of 1939, Britain will launch at least one new warship every week. The shipbuilding plans of Japan, France, Germany, and Italy cannot catch up with Britain. Therefore, in the next two or three years, Britain will be superior to any other country in terms of warships. The scale of Britain's naval expansion today is unprecedented in British peacetime history. The most important warships currently under construction include seven battleships, twenty-one cruisers, fifteen destroyers, fifteen harbor patrol boats, and five aircraft carriers. Of the seven battleships under construction, four can be launched within this year. Air Minister Wood said today at the opening ceremony of a newly established aircraft factory that the monthly production of aircraft in Britain in 1938 has doubled compared to before, and the quantity this year may double again. The quality of the aircraft will also be better than before. Furthermore, Home Secretary Hoare gave a speech in Harwich yesterday, saying that the British army, navy, and air force will be "unmatchable." Note: Since last September, when the European situation became tense, Britain has remained silent. Now, the ministers of the navy, air force, and home affairs are all roaring like lions at the same time. Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a speech in Birmingham tomorrow, and at that time, Britain will have another opportunity to roar. Has the British Cabinet decided to adopt a tough stance in order to arouse the people's patriotism, while at the same time warning the dictators of the world? The Prime Minister may express this during his speech.

### Four-Power Conference; France Opposes Holding It; Italy Denies Convening

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] How to resolve Italy's various demands is a major problem at present. According to well-informed sources, the French government is unwilling to convene a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, following the Munich conference method, to find a solution. When Foreign Minister Bonnet and Premier Daladier gave speeches in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, they expressed the idea of convening an international conference, the purpose of which was to solve all the problems related to various countries, and should not be confused with a four-power conference. However, German newspapers took the opportunity to attach themselves and said that the French officialdom had approved the four-power conference, which is not true. According to sources in Rome, the Italian government will propose to convene this conference in the near future. As for France, it refuses to recognize Italy's unilateral abolition of the 1935 agreement, and the only acceptable solution is to hold direct talks with Italy, and is unwilling to submit this dispute to any conference for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] It was previously rumored that Mussolini intended to propose convening a four-power conference after the fall of Barcelona to resolve the Spanish problem. Officials here have now denied it in a statement. They also fear that French Foreign Minister Bonnet's advocacy of convening an international conference in his speech to the Chamber of Deputies is not yet the right time.

### The U.S. Supplies France with a Large Number of Aircraft; Roosevelt Has Agreed

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] U.S. President Roosevelt announced today that U.S. aircraft manufacturers have obtained government approval to supply a large number of aircraft to France, the quantity of which is not limited.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee will investigate the matter that the President and the government have allowed France to purchase 600 U.S. aircraft worth $65 million.

[Foreign News] A U.S. Curtiss Hawk pursuit aircraft made a free flight in Buffalo, New York, with a speed of over 575 miles per hour. All previous speed records cannot be compared with it. According to Curtiss factory personnel, this aircraft can even fly 600 miles per hour. It is reported that this aircraft is one of the hundred ordered by the French government. The pilot said that he did not feel any adverse effects during the flight.

### The All-Union Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Will Be Held on October 3rd; Stalin Will Report on the Five-Year Plan

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th] The plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party is scheduled to be held on October 3rd, before the National Congress of the Communist Party. The agenda of this plenary session includes the report of the Central Executive Committee, the report on the Five-Year Plan by Stalin, and the implementation report by Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov. Furthermore, the drafting of amendments to the Communist Party's political program by a special committee has also been included in the agenda.

### Maintaining Peace; Opposing Aggression; U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles Gives a Speech on Current Foreign Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Under Secretary of State Welles gave a speech at a banquet of the New York State Bar Association this evening, briefly stating that the current foreign policy of the U.S. government focuses on maintaining peace. The attitude of our government and people towards the policies implemented by certain governments has not changed. In other words, whenever humanity suffers from cruel and inhumane treatment, the United States has the right to protest and provide assistance. This has been clearly expressed before, and this right should be exercised in the future. If the foreign policy of any country threatens the peace and security of the United States, infringes on the United States or infringes on American citizens, the United States should also resist it when necessary, in accordance with the rights it possesses under existing treaties. In short, the goals of the U.S. government are nothing more than (1) to promote friendship with all countries, (2) to promote foreign trade, (3) to maintain the legitimate rights of American expatriates in foreign countries in accordance with existing treaties, (4) to restore the rule of international law to resist violence, (5) to restrict and reduce various economic barriers that hinder international trade, and (6) to establish international agreements to limit land, sea, and air force armaments. Welles then summarized various international events since the Great War and concluded that events in which humanity inflicts certain cruel behaviors on their fellow humans, even during the European War, are difficult to believe to be true, but are now commonplace. Before 1914, if a government dared to kill women and children, or kill ordinary people during wartime, it would definitely be despised. At this point, we see this kind of practice every day.

### Spanish Rebels Continue to Advance Northward; The Government's New Capital Is Again Bombed; Mussolini Rewards Aggression

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 28th of This Newspaper] A person in charge of external debt discussed that the Spanish Civil War has taken a sharp turn for the worse due to the fall of Barcelona. The situation in the Mediterranean has changed immediately. Italy, in its triumph, will further demand colonies, etc., from Britain and France. Europe will be in turmoil from now on.

[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 28th] Spanish rebels are advancing along the Mediterranean coast and have reached the small town of Sant Celoni de Vilasar, 35 kilometers from Barcelona. Furthermore, Spanish rebels occupied the industrial town of Badalone yesterday, on the north coast of Barcelona, with a population of about 25,000. The rebels are still advancing north, about 25 kilometers away, chasing the retreating government forces.

[Central News Agency, Perpignan, France, 28th] The city of Figueres, the location of the Spanish government, was bombed yesterday morning. Details are unknown, but there must be hundreds of deaths.

[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] Yesterday at noon, Spanish rebel aircraft bombed Valencia. A British ship was sunk, but there were no casualties.

[Reuters, Perpignan, 28th] The situation in Figueres, the location of the headquarters of the Spanish government forces, was extremely chaotic yesterday. Government personnel were looking for their departments, ministers were looking for their colleagues, and weeping mothers were looking for their lost children, and begging for bread to fill their stomachs. Refugees have nowhere to settle, crowding together to avoid the cold of war. The authorities are now working hard to organize them and prevent refugees from fleeing chaotically into France. Guard posts have been set up along the Franco-Spanish border, and warning lights flash at night to indicate the border. The snow on the roads is very thick, sometimes up to ten feet. Some people are working hard to clear the thick snow on the roads. Many believe that the retreat of the government forces this time was very orderly, but its ability to resist seems to be only enough to cover the transfer of a large number of military supplies to the south.

[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Mussolini personally telegraphed General Gambara, commander of the Italian forces in Spain, and appointed him as a division commander.

[Reuters, Beijing, 27th] Belgium and the Spanish government have resolved their differences. Chargé d'affaires of the Spanish Embassy in Belgium, Mr. Triva Zhenuo, has returned to Beijing as the country's chargé d'affaires in Belgium. Belgium has appointed its chargé d'affaires in Spain to return to his post.

[Central News Agency, Prague, 27th] The Czech government has decided to recognize the Spanish National Army government as the legitimate government and establish formal diplomatic relations with it.

[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 27th] General Franco's representatives here held a "victory celebration" today to celebrate the fall of Barcelona. Guests gathered to sing the rebel "national anthem" and cheer "Long live Franco," "Long live Mussolini, Hitler." About 300 people on the street below who sympathized with the government forces responded with insults in English. Soon, a low-ranking rebel officer brandished a pistol to demonstrate, and the crowd mocked him again, resulting in a brawl. The city police were dispatched to suppress the fighting.

### Another Thousand German Jews Go to Shanghai

[Reuters, Naples, 27th] A thousand Jews (mostly German) boarded the Italian ship "Berncamanono" today bound for Shanghai. They will seek refuge in China.

### Prominent Figures from All Walks of Life in Britain Broadcast to Germany; Appealing for Efforts to Prevent War; Sincere Cooperation to Build the Future

[Reuters, London, 27th] Today, "British Broadcasting Corporation" representatives of twelve famous figures from all walks of life in Britain delivered speeches in German to Germany, asking German leaders and people to "make their utmost efforts to prevent the scourge of war." The above-mentioned famous figures include: (1) Former Governor-General of India, Sir Wellington; (2) Sir Poppey; (3) Governor of the Bank of England, Norman; (4) Poet Laureate Masefield; (5) Famous Doctor, Sir Dawson; (6) Famous Doctor, Sir Horder; (7) Famous Athlete, Sir Burghley; (8) Architect, Sir Lutyens. The leaders appealed to Germany, "We ask the leaders and people of Germany to join hands with us at this time of great authority, and to make the greatest efforts to prevent the outbreak of war and the growth of international hostility. Let us each, in a spirit of freedom and willingness, cooperate sincerely to build a bright and splendid 'future,' so that we can not only preserve the existing civilization, but also pass it on to future generations, so that they will have one more experience."

### Roosevelt Asks for Emergency Appropriation; To Purchase a Large Number of Fighter Planes; The Senate Rejects the Relief Bill

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] President Roosevelt asked Congress for an emergency appropriation of $50 million to purchase 565 new-style army fighter planes. Roosevelt previously proposed a $552 million military expansion plan, and this emergency appropriation is only the beginning.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The government's relief amendment has been rejected by the Senate. According to the amendment, the United States' relief funds should be increased from $72.5 million to $87.5 million. The bill was proposed by the Senate committee and passed by the House of Representatives.

### The Recent Internal Situation in Japan

Summer Cloud, translated from Soviet Truth Teaching (Continued)

This kind of declaration is to persuade the general public to endure hunger without complaining. However, the result of malnutrition has made the health of the Japanese working masses increasingly weakened. According to a newspaper report, there are currently 154,000 people in Tokyo suffering from tuberculosis. The number of deaths due to tuberculosis is also increasing daily. In 1936, in Tokyo alone, 14,925 out of 80,836 deaths were due to tuberculosis.

Under this harsh environment, the Japanese working masses only saw one way out. However, those reorganizationists who were supported by the ruling class betrayed the interests of the working class, causing their strikes to fail and being subdued by the rulers.

The Japanese working masses also wanted to turn the Social Democratic Party into a united front party. Therefore, during the general election on April 30, 1937, the Social Democratic Party won 37 votes due to the support of the workers, more than half of the 18 votes in 1936. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party once again betrayed the working class. One of the leaders even openly declared that "the cabinet should adopt resolute policies like Hitler and Mussolini."

Within this year (1938), many workers in large factories went ahead of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party and prepared to launch a strong strike to demand a salary increase. Japanese newspapers reported that "labor unrest is growing, the number of strikes is increasing month by month, and the scope of the strikes is gradually expanding, with participants including doctors and female workers, almost all walks of life."

A large amount of ××

In Japan, as long as there is a slight criticism of the warlords, there is a possibility of being arrested (many workers have already received this treatment). From this point, we can see that this ×× invasion war of Japan is not protected by the general public. Where can we see the rise of this anti-war sentiment? We all know that Japan has announced the implementation of the National Conscription Mobilization Law. However, after the announcement of this law, many workers refused to report to the mobilization station. This is one example. At the same time, the tragic situation of the soldiers who returned wounded from the front gave them a deep impression, making them further realize that the beneficiaries of this ×× invasion war are only the bourgeois and military adventurers, and they themselves only suffer.

Is now leading the heroic struggle of the general working masses to carry out anti-fascist and anti-warlord adventures.

Now, the growth of the proletariat's political power in Japan and the wave of strikes are the main forces that make the Japanese government panic. At the same time, if Japan's military adventures in China continue to be undermined, then its internal situation will inevitably move towards a more serious and deteriorating stage.

A Short Comment

### Wu Peifu Denies × Rumors

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 28th, Wu Peifu's spokesman angrily denied the recent propaganda by the Japanese side regarding rumors about Wu being a puppet. This further shows the shamelessness and boredom of the × treacherous conspiracy. However, it also shows the viciousness of the × traitors in resorting to rumors and criticisms of those who are unwilling to be used by them. Wu was able to uphold national righteousness in the past and was not insulted by Japanese × and traitors, which is not only Wu's personal glory, but also the glory of the Chinese nation. We have always hoped that Wu will adhere to righteousness, love the motherland, and "preserve his integrity in his later years, and preserve justice in the world." We also hope that others who are surrounded and threatened by Japanese × traitors can write about their great benevolence and courage, preserve their purity, firmly uphold righteousness, eliminate party prejudices, and recognize the common × Japanese invaders and ×× Japanese aggressors."

### ×× Traitors' New Ugly Drama

The Japanese invaders, in view of the increasingly serious internal and external crises, and in view of our country's insistence on uniting to resist the war to the end, and will fundamentally break their "quick battle and quick decision" plan, therefore, on the one hand, they inevitably have to "exhaust the pond to get the fish" and intensify the search for and exploitation of domestic and occupied areas, preparing for and supplementing their greater offensive; on the other hand, they have to intensify the implementation of the conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" and rehearse the ugly drama of "establishing a new central regime in China."

The intention of the × treacherous people to rush to rehearse the ugly drama of the "new central regime" is, first, to attempt to unify the puppet regimes of the traitors in the occupied areas, strengthen their ruling power, in order to control and plunder all living and non-living forces to support more crazy aggressive military forces. Second, to use slogans such as "seeking peace" and "anti-communism" to paralyze our people, split our unity, stop our resistance, and then reach the point of destroying our country and nation.

Recently, in the north, they have expanded the propaganda of "Wu Peifu being pro-Japanese and seeking peace," while in the south, they have used the Japanese-owned newspapers ×× Daily and Wang Jingwei's privately run ×× Daily as the center to expand the propaganda of "anti-communism," "ceasefire," "peace negotiations," and "pro-Japanese," and fabricate rumors and heavy bribes. The urgency of their conspiracy to establish a pseudo-central regime is unprecedented.

The Japanese × and traitors' conspiracy activities will inevitably become more crazy and vicious when they are on the verge of desperation, which is to be expected and not surprising. But we still need to pay attention to, first, any Chinese sons and daughters, we all hope that they will respect themselves and Wu Peifu was a former old warlord, but in recent years, he has been able to stand in the demon's cave and be awe-inspiring and not be used by × traitors, so we express our special respect to him. Second, we should know that all those who cannot overcome the × temptation of benefit, threat, or willingly attach themselves to adversity are abandoning themselves in their individual capacity, and are enemies of the nation if measured by righteousness. They have been abandoned by the people of the whole country and cannot exert a ruling role through any organization. Third, Wang Jingwei has lost his capital to swindle and sell the nation since he exposed his pro-Japanese surrender face, and the general theory is fortunate for it, and the seal is indeed appropriate. However, if we do not pay attention to it, it is not only a mistake, but also a crime. Chen Cheng, Zhang Fakui and other telegrams to request the arrest of Mr. ×××× is an important appeal based on the blood and tears experience of more than a year of resistance. Now, Wang is not only unaware of repentance, but also uses his propaganda tools to spread rumors, incite chaos, sow discord, and secretly collude with Japanese × and traitors in the north and south. This can be seen as a state of lenient policy. Fourth, the lurking pro-Japanese traitors will inevitably use the smokescreens of "peace" and "anti-communism" more unscrupulously in the future to carry out their tricks of betraying the nation and the country. Our authorities at all levels and compatriots from all walks of life should always be vigilant and expose and crack down on them.

### Singapore Strictly Restricts the Import of Chinese Laborers; Ship Tickets to Singapore Suddenly Rise; One-Third Increase in Tickets for Men and Women Compared to Three Months Ago; Men's Tickets Rise to $280 Per Ticket

The Singapore government previously repeatedly promulgated many new restrictions to maintain local unemployed workers, strictly limiting the entry of Chinese laborers, and reducing the number of male and female praying guests allowed to enter each month to 500. After the ban was issued, the number of male laborers going south from Hong Kong was greatly reduced, and the price of ship tickets suddenly rose. Recently, the (new passenger) male ticket has actually risen to $278, and the female ticket has also risen to $178, which is more than a hundred dollars more expensive for men's tickets and forty or fifty dollars more expensive for women's tickets compared to three months ago.

### Air Defense Authorities Set Up Classes in Different Districts; To Train Air Raid Wardens; Residents Are Encouraged to Actively Participate in Air Defense Lectures; Lecture Locations and Times Have Been Announced Separately

### Chen Gongzhe's Calligraphy and Writings Exhibition - Contributing Forty Years of Research to the Public

Special Report from This Newspaper - A calligraphy exhibition is usually a commonplace affair. However, an exhibition that combines calligraphy with writings is quite extraordinary. Just such an extraordinary personal exhibition opened yesterday at the Jinling Hotel.

According to Mr. Chen, speaking to the reporter: "This exhibition does not aim to attract business or promote myself. Rather, it focuses on contributing my research findings to society, providing a reference for those who come after, so that the 'later' ones can 'surpass' us. This is precisely the attitude that cultural workers should have."

Mr. Chen stated that he has studied calligraphy for forty years, during which he spent fifteen years on a dark and unjust detour. If one were to learn calligraphy using his scientific method, it would take ten years to achieve what he achieved in twenty-five years. By extrapolation, three years would be equivalent to ten years using ordinary methods, and one year would be equivalent to three years using ordinary methods. His method involves using firm bristles like wolf hair or rabbit hair, instead of soft sheep hair brushes. As for judging the quality of a character, he uses geometric curves as the standard. Mr. Chen describes himself as a semi-scientist and humbly claims not to be a calligrapher. He has authored books like "Scientific Calligraphy," of which four have already been published by the Commercial Press, with several more in the process of being printed.

Regarding the analysis of calligraphy, Mr. Chen stated that the importance of dots accounts for 60%, the importance of structure accounts for 30%, and the importance of the flow of energy accounts for 10%. If one were to spend ten years learning calligraphy, according to the above proportions, six years should be spent on dots and strokes, three years on structure, and only one year on the flow of energy. It can be seen that the biggest problem with most calligraphy today lies in the inaccuracy of dots and strokes.

As for the content of this exhibition: there are eleven kinds of calligraphy writings, ten kinds of calligraphy tools, and nine kinds of calligraphy works, totaling about one hundred and several tens of pieces, all of which are very refined. But the most valuable are his inventions and creations: the scientific ink grinder, the center of gravity proof diagram, the calligraphy element system diagram, and the jade seal brush testing diagram.

In a social environment with a weak academic atmosphere, Mr. Chen's spirit of dedicating himself to research and invention is clearly worthy of our admiration.

### Yesterday Departed for Shantou and Ganzhou - Delegation Composed of Twenty-Five Members

The newly formed third and fourth teams of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Youth Association Military Service Corps, after many days of preparation, yesterday (the 27th) set off with twenty-five male and female members on the Qingxing steamship for Shantou. It is said that after arriving in Shantou, they will pass through Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Xingning, detour into Jiangxi, and first go to Nanchang to join the second team, and then meet with military commanders to await orders for assigned work. It is reported that this delegation is carrying many tools, including a record player, a movie projector, films, bicycles, books, pictorials, and medical supplies. They are also carrying about three thousand cotton-padded jackets and vests donated by the people of the rear to the soldiers at the front, over twelve thousand comfort bags, and dozens of boxes of biscuits and candies.

### Western and Chinese Prostitution Den Raided on the Third Floor of the Asia Hotel - Female Chinese Affairs Secretary Xia Lixin Personally Led the Raid - Three Young Women and One American Girl Rescued

Last Friday night, the Female Chinese Affairs Secretary, Xia Lixin, raided a case of private prostitution in the Asia Hotel on Connaught Road Central. At the same time, an American girl was discovered to be engaged in the same profession. It started when Xia received a tip from an informant that someone was hiding young girls in a certain room in the Asia Hotel. She immediately went with police detectives to conduct the raid. Upon arriving at the hotel, they went straight to the third floor and entered a certain room, where they indeed saw three young girls, about twenty years old, heavily made up. There was also a woman who appeared to be a madam inside. She immediately ordered people to watch over them and then searched another room, where she found a middle-aged man and a beautiful American girl living together. The girl was only fifteen years old. Xia questioned her and found that although she was American, she did not speak English, but she spoke fluent Chinese. Apparently, the girl had been brought back to China by her Chinese adoptive father when she was young and raised there. After further questioning, Xia learned that the girl, along with the three young women mentioned above, were being raised by the madam in the room. At the same time, another woman claimed to be the girl's manager. Xia arrested all of them and took them back to the Chinese Affairs Office for questioning. Later, the American girl was transferred to the Salvation Army camp for care, while the three Chinese girls were sent to Po Leung Kuk. As for the two women and the man, they were temporarily detained at the police station for questioning.

### Vietnamese Drivers and Mechanics - Go to Guilin to Serve - Du Qizhang Sends Them Off Yesterday

Several dozen members of the Vietnamese Chinese Driver Service Corps, led by Ye Jian, arrived in Hong Kong a month ago, but because Guangzhou and Wuhan fell in succession, they stayed in Hong Kong. Fortunately, they received assistance from Mr. Du Qizhang, a local businessman, who introduced them to Chairman Zhou. They were selected into the Chinese Rescue Team, and the corps has now departed for places like KaiPing to serve. As for the drivers and mechanics, Li Jinshui, Du Zuzhen, and He Junpei, all four were also introduced by Mr. Du and recruited by the Political Department. They departed from Hong Kong yesterday to take a French postal ship to Haiphong and enter Guilin. Mr. Du, considering that these drivers and mechanics were serving the country, held a farewell banquet for them at the Wuchang Restaurant. During the banquet, he offered much encouragement and introduced them to the French postal office staff and Chinese community leaders in Hanoi and Haiphong to take care of everything.

### British Waters off Tonggu Island - Sudden Encounter with Hurricane - Cargo Boat Capsizes - Three Companions Missing - Boat Owner Rescued

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter received news that a cargo boat had capsized near Tonggu in British waters, with three of the four people on board missing. Only the boat owner was rescued by another fishing boat and reported the case to the local police station. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below. The cargo boat had no registration number. The boat owner's name is Chen Er, 39 years old. There were three partners on the boat: Liang Jinzhen, 51 years old; Gan Cheng, 26 years old; and Zhong, 38 years old. They set sail from near Tung Lo Wan in Chinese territory on the 24th of this month, fully loaded with fresh fruit and sundries worth a total of 140 yuan. At about 7:00 PM, when they were sailing near Tonggu in British waters, a sudden storm arose. The helmsman, seeing the situation, immediately turned the helm to avoid it and immediately lowered the sails. However, it was too late, and the entire boat was blown over by the gale. Everyone on board fell into the sea. But it was nighttime, and there were very few fishing boats. Their calls for help were ineffective. The boat owner clung to a wooden plank and drifted with the waves. However, he could no longer see any trace of his three companions. It is likely they were taken by the sea gods. Chen drifted on the sea all night. Until the morning of the 25th, he saw a fishing boat in the distance. Chen shouted for help, and the fishing boat rescued Chen and brought him aboard. After being rescued for a long time, his spirits finally calmed down a bit. Later, the fishing boat returned to the Hong Kong police station to report the case. The on-duty assistant stated that he would send a water police boat to patrol the sea area where the accident occurred to search for the three missing companions.

### Hainanese Overseas Chinese Congress - Successfully Concluded - Special Meeting Held Late Last Night - Executive and Supervisory Committee to Meet Today

The Overseas Hainanese Chinese Representatives Congress concluded last night after a declaration. The congress held nine meetings in ten consecutive days. More than thirty motions from representatives of various ports were fully discussed and passed. Yesterday was the last day of the congress, and more than forty representatives attended, chaired by Fu Zhifeng. In the morning session, after the second reading of the constitution was passed, discussions focused on membership fees. The representatives conducted detailed research on this issue, which took a long time. It was originally planned to start the election in the afternoon, but it could not be held as scheduled due to issues with the election law. The representatives believed that the executive and supervisory committee members of the general association must be separately elected by representatives from various ports. Only in this way could the strength of the general association be increased. Therefore, the election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the general association was postponed until last night. A special meeting was held at 8:00 PM, and the election was not completed until around 11:00 PM. The congress then concluded last night. Today, the executive and supervisory committee members will hold a meeting.

### Fishermen's Free School - Preparations Begin - Relief Committee Provides Monthly Aid of One Thousand Yuan

The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association previously submitted a detailed plan to Mr. Xu Shiying, Acting Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, stating that the number of fishermen in distress has been increasing in recent years, and their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse, requesting relief. In the plan, in addition to establishing a fishing reclamation area, establishing a fishermen's free school is also a key item in the relief plan. It is now known that Mr. Xu Shiying has accepted this plan. The person in charge of the Fish Association received a reply from Mr. Xu yesterday, stating that preparations will begin on February 1st, with 1,500 yuan in national currency for start-up costs and 1,000 yuan in national currency per month for expenses. The Fish Association is currently proceeding with all preparations. The plan is to first establish one school in each of the three major fishing areas: Shau Kei Wan, Aberdeen, and Cheung Chau, with a temporary enrollment of 100 students per school. The Aberdeen and Cheung Chau Fishermen's Associations already have two existing fishermen's schools, but they are very small in scale, with only dozens of students. It has now been decided to expand them. New methods will be used in the Shau Kei Wan area. It is hoped that classes can begin around March of this year.

### Unemployed Seamen in Hong Kong Prepare to Return to China - To Participate in Transportation Work - Seamen's Leaders Have Begun Organizing

Since the Anti-Japanese War began, the seamen in Hong Kong have been extremely active in patriotic movements. However, since the Seamen's Union was disbanded, this activity has come to a virtual standstill due to the lack of leadership. Recently, Feng Yongyou, the founder of the former Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Association, came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou via a roundabout route, intending to join forces with Hong Kong seamen's leaders Wang De, and Guan Yusheng, to organize Hong Kong seamen to return to northern Guangdong and assist the government in undertaking transportation work. Preparations are now complete, and they will likely depart during the day.

### Refugees in Guangxi Are Everywhere - Suffering from Hunger and Cold, Urgently Awaiting Relief - Guangxi Refugee Association Sends Letter to Relief Association - Calling for Allocation of Funds to Relieve Refugees in the Province

Refugees are everywhere in Guangxi, urgently awaiting relief. Zhang Zhaotang, Zong Jun, and He Haiyu of the Guangxi Refugee Association yesterday presented a letter to the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association, requesting that funds be allocated to relieve the refugees in the province. The letter stated (excerpt): Since the establishment of the Southwest Military Headquarters, Guangxi has become the center of the Anti-Japanese War in the Southwest. Therefore, enemy aircraft frequently fly over and bomb, causing severe damage. Refugees are displaced and suffering from hunger and cold. Although the government is rushing to provide emergency relief, the disaster area is vast, and it is difficult to provide widespread assistance. We have long admired your association's compassion and far-reaching benevolence. Therefore, we dare to write a special letter, appealing for your assistance. Please find a way to quickly raise large sums of money and remit them for relief, so that the dying victims of the disaster can be revived and forever grateful. Looking forward to good news from afar.

Special Report from This Newspaper

### Residents' Association Established

— Luoxia

Hoping it can truly benefit the residents

In the midst of a slight lull in the tidal wave of rent increases and forced evictions by landlords, the issue of water bill payments has once again stirred up many waves between landlords and tenants. At a time when these waves are growing, the official establishment of the Hong Kong Residents' Association has suddenly been announced. This is such happy news for the general residents!

Yesterday, the sun was hiding in the clouds, and Old Man Sun seemed to be putting on an ominous and cold face, making people shiver. It was a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, and the top of the Sihao Hotel suddenly became lively. Representatives from the trade union, shop owners, and people from the education sector were threading their way up to the second floor. The spacious hall was almost full of people. It was still early for the meeting, and everyone chatted idly, gradually shifting from national affairs to the issue of water bills. Inevitably, many disputes have arisen between landlords and tenants. Everyone sighed in despair when they talked about this!

After the music was played, lawyer Ma Gu-Si Lu-Hua stood up and unveiled the red curtain, and the golden characters of the Hong Kong Kowloon Residents' Association were brilliantly reflected in everyone's eyes. After the unveiling, he began to announce the purpose of the Residents' Association: "The purpose of this association is charitable. It is not only a legal advisor for residents, but it will also continue to plan free medical care for residents, establish free schools for residents' children, and protect all the interests of residents." At this point, he paused and continued to tell a story about a woodcutter, children, and branches, the gist of which was that a single branch is easy to break, while many branches are difficult to break, so he hoped that everyone would work together to benefit the community!

Next was the chairman's speech, but because the chairman had not arrived, it was given by Li Zeyie as a representative. After that, Jian Bingquan reported on the preparations. He clearly explained the benefits of joining this association: in the future, if a member is subjected to forced eviction and needs legal resolution without success, the general association will come forward and handle it on behalf of the resident according to the law. This method is quite good, although it has not yet been determined who will bear the litigation costs!

In addition, it is said that if anyone who joins the Residents' Association has any difficult problems or emergencies, the association will provide assistance in planning and offering solutions. The benefits for members are said to be numerous, so there is a great rush to join. As of last month, there were already 4,487 people, and with an entrance fee of three dollars per person, there are already over ten thousand dollars. The solicitation of new members continues, and it is unknown how many more there will be. With such abundant financial resources and such strong manpower, everyone hopes that this Residents' Association can achieve great results!

It is said that before the association was established, there were already more than 200 cases of members being subjected to forced eviction and water meters being cut off who requested legal assistance, which shows the seriousness of the forced eviction and water bill trend, and the concern of the community for this association. Finally, the vice-chairman earnestly said that the association should be more universalized to benefit the working masses of the lower classes!

After the vice-chairman's report, the guests continued to give speeches, which were generally expressions of their great expectations for this association. When the meeting ended, everyone went home with joy, and at the same time, they also hoped that the association would soon show results!

### The Active Huibao People's Guerrilla Force (1)

— Rouzhi

Special Correspondence from This Newspaper - The emergence and development of the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force sent a signal to all the people of the East River region - a signal that the people are automatically participating in the Anti-Japanese War to defend their homes and strive for the liberation and victory of the people. The significance is very important.

Many of the people in the Huibao area participated in the struggles of the Great Revolution era. After the failure of the Great Revolution, there was considerable hidden strength for struggle. Moreover, many young people from the Huibao area who left their hometowns accepted the mission of the times and automatically took on the responsibility of saving the nation. Under the promotion of several groups such as the Huiyang Youth Association and the Chuxian Le Society, when the situation in South China became critical, they actively participated in the work team to return to their hometowns. They returned to the Huibao area to carry out the work of propagandizing and organizing the masses, and mobilizing the masses to defend their homes. Thanks to their efforts, the work progressed extremely rapidly, and the initial foundation for the armed organization of the masses was laid.

On October 12th of last year, the sounds of enemy artillery attacking South China rang out near Aotou. In Danshui, Pingshan, Longgang, Kengzi, Kuiyong and other places, which were closest to Aotou and where work had been carried out most thoroughly, the people, under the leadership of the work team, mobilized and prepared to strike at the enemy. The small number of armed forces concentrated at this time were the early form of the current Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. When the enemy harassed this area, Zhu Changcheng's guerrilla force at any time carried out attacks on the enemy by selecting favorable terrain and time. Although they did not achieve a great victory due to insufficient strength, they did pose a considerable threat to the enemy. At the same time, they also coordinated with the 151st Division of the regular army, led by Wen Brigade and Ma Battalion, in combat. Their resolute and courageous actions had a significant impact on the regular soldiers. Each battle expanded the number of troops and increased their weapons. At first, there were only a dozen people with a few guns, but now it has developed to hundreds of people with hundreds of guns. Moreover, they also have heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and hand-held machine guns. This is very obvious: the Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force grew and developed in battle. What does it show? It shows that the Anti-Japanese War is not weakening our strength, but strengthening it. Who says the strength of the people is not great? Who says that victory cannot be achieved after the Anti-Japanese War?

The Huibao Guerrilla Force was organized by a group of resolute members of the returning work team and some brave local cadres. Before its official establishment, it automatically fought several battles in places such as Mayuan, Bagang, Henggang, and Sanshitian. Because their actions were correct, they gained the love, support, and endorsement of the local people. Furthermore, they gained the trust of the local defense forces. At the beginning of last month, they submitted a request to the government and were officially established as the "Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force." Zeng Shengjun, an active anti-Japanese youth from Huiyang and a leader of the Southern Seamen, was appointed as the commander-in-chief in charge of command. From this point on, a batch of young and strong seamen workers were mobilized to join, expand the organization, and accelerate development. Many members of the village militia self-defense teams also voluntarily joined with their guns. At the same time, a portion of the Dongguan Baoan self-defense force, after withdrawing from Dongguan Baoan, because they lost contact, also came here to join forces. Therefore, the momentum of the guerrilla force became increasingly strong.

Danshui City was recovered on the 7th of last month. The first to enter the city was the Huibao Guerrilla Force. As soon as the guerrillas saw that the enemy was retreating, they sent a group of soldiers in civilian clothes to enter the city first. As a result, the traitors of the Maintenance Association were preparing to escape, but they were captured alive. After the enemy retreated, the guerrilla force entered the city in formation and then called on the residents to return and held a grand mass meeting. They shot and killed these three dogs, and did not seize their property. The hearts of the whole city were greatly delighted.

The actions of the guerrilla force are always active. Although the enemy has retreated far away, and this area is no longer the front line, they are constantly preparing for the new wars of the future. Every day after getting up at dawn, they gather to practice running and basic techniques. After breakfast, they attend political and military classes. In the afternoon, they hold exercises, field operations, or street fighting. In the evening, they hold meetings to discuss and review, and sometimes they also camp out to practice night battles.

The Significance of the Symposium

Lu Fu: Since the expansion of our Shen Bao at the end of last year, it has become a new cultural department for promoting the War of Resistance and national reconstruction! In order to promote film and drama, we have specially published this Film and Drama Weekly. Since its inception, we have received enthusiastic love and help, encouragement and cultivation from all seniors and comrades, which on the one hand makes us infinitely grateful, and on the other hand makes us more aware of the importance of our own responsibilities.

Everyone is certainly well aware of the important role of the film and drama movement in the national liberation struggle at this stage; and everyone also knows that the current state of film and drama, such as the inability of the northern and southern film circles to shoulder the task of wartime art, and the struggling and suffering of emerging drama in the nascent stage, requires us to make greater efforts to correct and promote it. Therefore, in order to pool our wisdom, connect our feelings, launch collective discussions, establish correct theories and criticisms, and promote the film and drama at this stage, we have specially initiated this "Film and Drama Symposium." We are very honored that all seniors and comrades have enthusiastically come to participate!

The format of our symposium is very casual. We hope that we can hold it regularly once a week or every two weeks. Each time, over tea and laughter, we will determine a working theme as the center of discussion. On the one hand, we hope that this symposium can comprehensively review the current situation of the film and drama industry, and on the other hand, enable our comrades to have closer ties with each other. In this way, everyone will also feel it is very meaningful!

Key Topics for Discussion

A few days ago, I talked about this issue with several seniors, and everyone agreed. At the same time, they also pointed out several main tasks in front of us, such as: 1. Establishing progressive film and drama criticism; 2. Establishing correct film and drama theories; 3. Promoting the new stage of film and drama movement; 4. Launching a film and drama purification movement...etc. We need to conduct detailed collective discussions.

Today, the central topic of our discussion is "Establishing Progressive Film and Drama Criticism" because criticism plays a very important role in promoting the film and drama movement. We know that without criticism and review, it is impossible to expect anything to have normal development and progress. The leap forward of the Shanghai film industry after January 28th was largely driven by the efforts of progressive film critics. This work is, of course, urgently needed in Hong Kong, where the cultural level is so low. Now, what we need to discuss is how to establish this critical work, as well as how to recognize the needs of the environment and the times, and determine the criteria for criticism. At the same time, after the principles of this issue are decided, we will further try to use the current performance of the China Art Drama Troupe as the object of our criticism, because it is the emerging central group of the Hong Kong drama movement, and this is its first official performance. It is of great significance to the drama movement in Hong Kong. I hope all seniors and comrades will not hesitate to express their opinions on this issue and conduct detailed collective discussions.

Several Important Principles

Ouyang Yuqian: The Shen Bao Film and Drama Weekly organizing this symposium is of great significance. The topic to be discussed today is also an important task. We know that progressive film and drama criticism plays a very important role in the film and drama movement at this stage. In order to enable critical work to play a greater role, we should establish a critical center and establish a critical goal. First, the content of the critical center is the most important, but there are also many things to pay attention to in the content. As the War of Resistance has progressed to the current stage, the scripts that initially praised the War of Resistance are no longer sufficient. Now we need newer forms, newer styles, and newer content. This is what we should pay special attention to. After the content is determined, the critical evaluation of performance techniques is also very important, because only with good techniques can good content be expressed, making it more substantial and powerful. Second, criticism has a propaganda effect, so we cannot arbitrarily praise or criticize based on personal preferences. We should have a correct common goal. This goal, of course, is to use whether it benefits the national War of Resistance as the criterion. In this way, we will have a basis for determining what should be promoted and what should not be promoted. Third, film and drama criticism cannot be uniform, because the material conditions for film are much more complicated. At the same time, emerging drama is now struggling in its nascent stage and has not yet gained social status, so our attitude towards criticism should be more tolerant and supportive of its growth. At the same time, there is also a distinction between professional and non-professional theater troupes in drama. The techniques of professional troupes are certainly more skilled, and the material conditions are certainly better. However, the working attitude of non-professional troupes is more courageous, and the audience is more extensive, so our critical attitude is also somewhat different. Fourth, due to environmental reasons, there are some things that we should criticize but cannot. For example, in the Shanghai film and drama circles after August 13th, there were few good things and many bad things. However, the bad things were supported by certain forces, making it impossible for us to carry out correct criticism. In this case, we should criticize the good things and not criticize the bad things, letting them live or die in front of the eyes of the audience. This is a good way.

Film in Destruction

Cai Chusheng: Film and drama, these two sister arts, have great differences in quality and quantity because they are used and grown in different environments. Just now, Mr. Ouyang said that film and drama criticism should be separated, which is very correct. Now, I will also talk about this issue separately: First, let's talk about film. After January 28th, film critics made great contributions to the progress of Chinese film. Under the supervision of progressive intellectuals and the establishment of progressive film theories and criticisms, and stimulated by this moment of national life and death, and inspired by progressive intellectuals, film workers had an unprecedented awakening, which made the past films for art have a very obvious transformation, abandoning the old dross and coordinating with the new cultural movement. However, after the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, the general new cultural movement unfolded with the War of Resistance, but film, as an important part of the new culture, declined with the unfolding of the War of Resistance. Now, except for the China Film Studio and the Central Film Studio, which are supported by the government and bravely shoulder the glorious task, the once vigorous film culture movement, regardless of north or south, is all on the road to destruction. From the perspective of historical evolution, film, as an integral part of the new cultural movement, should have been more heroic and active, following the people's resistance and bravely moving forward, shouldering the greater tasks it should have shouldered, but why, on the contrary, did most of it embark on the path of decline, and some can even be said to be anesthetizing our people and enslaving our people for the benefit of the × people? What a painful fact this is!

Two Reasons for Destruction

Here, to determine how to establish progressive film criticism, we must understand why film has become the weakest link in this War of Resistance, even avoiding it and embarking on a path of betrayal. The reason for this is: First, film production is not as simple as other arts, and requires more capital to support it. Behind every film worker stands an investor, a film merchant, who can control everything about you. Because the current Chinese film merchants still maintain the operating methods of the handicraft industry, everything is only conservative, without development, only seeking profit, without understanding, and even less knowing the important mission of film culture and the tasks that wartime merchants should shoulder in the national liberation struggle. Therefore, under the storm of the great era, they are naturally unable to resist and "resigned to fate, tending to collapse and destruction, even going to the path of depravity at will." Second, because most of the Chinese film workers lack strict training, sufficient cultivation, correct understanding, and firm will, and at the same time, they value their personal life and enjoyment too much, so when they encounter the turmoil of extraordinary times, they rarely do not panic and do not know what to do, and instead let others manipulate them!

Advising Merchants to Wake Up

Based on the above two reasons, Chinese film during the War of Resistance will inevitably lead to tragic results. This is an inevitable law. Therefore, to remedy this tragic situation and correct this serious mistake, we must address these reasons and immediately establish progressive film criticism. Use our sincerity, our tongues, and our pens to awaken every film merchant and film worker, and awaken every anesthetized audience.

First, we must tell all film merchants that in any country or nation, when encountering an unprecedented life-and-death crisis in history, all works that face reality, have content, have life, and are full of encouragement for combat emotions will be enthusiastically supported by their people. In the past, some film merchants spread the atmosphere of the disastrous business of national defense films as a cover for the production of toxic films. Here, we must solemnly and sincerely point out that the national defense films they are referring to are not real national defense films, and most of them are pseudo-national defense films that ruin the reputation of real national defense films. Real, substantial, and meaningful national defense films will never fail to make money. Under the principle of determining that national defense films will definitely make money, encourage them to engage in the creation of real national defense films, awaken and work hard to obtain greater profits. At the same time, point out the serious crisis if they do not wake up!

Overcoming Slogans and Formulas

Second, we must overcome the production of all sloganized and formulaic national defense films. We must solemnly point out to all film workers that real national defense films do not necessarily have to shout "Down with ××" or be full of scenes of war or beating × people and traitors. Instead, they must realistically and realistically report to the audience the story of how we are oppressed and how we should seek survival. We must tell every film worker that if they do not have sufficient skills, correct understanding, plus a lack of practical life experience, the result will be just an accumulation of rote slogans and formulas, and they will not be able to produce moving good works, even if they have a good theme. As for mistakenly seeing the so-called "business acumen" and incorporating some low-level taste materials into it, that is even more undesirable. Such "pseudo-national defense films" will inevitably make the masses feel that the content is empty and superficial, and feel tasteless, and even feel disgusted and avoid them. As for the production of sensual, low-level, folk tales, and toxic films, we must severely point out the darkness ahead.

Unleashing the Power of the Masses

Third, our critical work must go deep into the audience class. We must give detailed, sincere, and popular criticism of the content and technology of every film production in order to improve the audience's level of appreciation and choice. We must certainly promote the good ones, and we must strictly criticize the bad ones, so that every audience does not run into the cinema in a muddle. At the same time, we must make every knowledgeable mass understand how to get good spiritual food in the struggle for national liberation, and how to help establish national defense films, starting from themselves, and persuade close relatives and friends not to watch toxic films, and actively encourage them to watch meaningful and real national defense films. In this way, our criticism will have the greatest effect. Even if film merchants and film workers still do not wake up and want to continue to do things in a muddle, it will no longer be possible!

Promoting Mass Drama Movement

Regarding drama, because this sector has not yet achieved the so-called "commercial status" in society, and capitalists do not have a close relationship with it, it still relies on some art workers who are interested in drama itself or who regard drama as an effective propaganda tool to firmly support it in difficult and arduous environments. Also, because these art workers have a more pure attitude and clearer understanding, although drama in China is still in its infancy, and is even constantly shaking in the wind and rain, after the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, it has grown up in this great beacon, and has achieved brilliant achievements that surpass the past twenty years. Not to mention the domestic situation, just in Hong Kong, this cultural desert, under the vigorous promotion of cultural organizations such as the China Art Association, the national defense drama movement has also leaped forward. Looking back on the Hong Kong drama movement in the past year, the number of performances that can be counted has reached more than 200, and there are now 30 to 40 large and small theater troupes. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, in this cultural desert, because of the low cultural level, drama does not yet have a considerable social status, and has not yet won the love of the masses. Our criticism in this regard must certainly be more tolerant, and take an attitude of promotion and encouragement. The most important thing, in addition to improving the technical aspects, is to overcome the past mistakes of some drama workers who only engaged in art for art's sake and only rolled around in a small cultural circle, and vigorously promote the practice of popularizing drama, so that it can develop universally. Especially for the general small theater troupes, we must give greater encouragement and provide guidance with experience in all aspects, so that they can exert their passion and strength as much as possible among the broad masses. Although most of them are inevitably naive, they can easily grow up in the struggle.

Drama Movement Status

### Youth Drama Association's Second Joint Performance

The Youth Drama Association is a general organization of youth drama groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Under the urgent requirements of a united front and improved work efficiency, the association appeared in Hong Kong, a "cultural desert," with a brand-new attitude. We should express our infinite wishes while feeling gratified.

They held a joint performance last year. Now, they have again selected to hold a joint performance for three nights starting today (January 29th) at South China Middle School. The performing groups and plays for the first night tonight are: New Voice Theater's "Contributing Strength"; Lushui Theater's "Reunion"; Dingchou Theater's "Under the Sun Flag"; Whirlwind Theater's "The Hatred of the Blind and Mute"; and Red and White Theater's "Reporting Blood and Loyal Souls," five one-act plays in total. The second night tomorrow night will feature: Xuezhen Society's "Three Rivers Good"; August 13th's "Our Guerrilla"; Amateur Friendship Society's "Black Shadow"; China Amateur's "The Last Plan"; and Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong Fellow Association's "Chinese Daughter." The third night the day after tomorrow will feature: Gong Theater's "Seeking Life from Death"; Ordinary Theater's "Return Our Children"; and Rendou Theater's "Spring's Smile." It is reported that at the same time, the China Amateur Choir, the Youth Tongle Society, the Guangzhou Fengshe Chorus, and the China Bookstore Fellow Chorus will also participate in singing. This is a very meaningful joint performance on the Hong Kong drama scene.

### Long Live the Youth Drama Association

— Cai Chusheng

This is a very honorable thing. I have had the opportunity to occupy a seat in the sea of people in the audience at almost every one of the several performances by the Youth Drama Association of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and even the various units participating in this organization. Seeing their spirit of not avoiding any difficulties and hardships, and their attitude of always working conscientiously, I am truly ashamed—because of their absolute meticulousness, the performance results are very good, and I am given infinite emotion every time.

In the past, Hong Kong was considered a "cultural desert"; drama was even considered a "no-man's land." Now, not only do the larger-scale drama groups have good performances; the smaller-scale groups are also booming. In Kowloon, there are more than 20 drama organizations, and these organizations have broken through the most difficult barrier to unite - the establishment of a general institution, and the establishment of the "Youth Drama Association", continuing to do large-scale joint performances, which and the "Sunday Small Theater" composed of more than 20 small theater troupes in Shanghai after the War of Resistance, are enough to shine north and south.

Hong Kong, this "desert" is now full of many drama flowers. This phenomenon should be a matter of great pleasure for everyone who pays attention to the cultural movement on this island.

Naturally, these newly budding flowers are inevitably fragile. Most of them do not have much experience, not much financial resources, and not many talents, and paper relies on the youth's enthusiasm for the country and nation to irrigate and cultivate them. It is certainly more difficult for them to develop and grow quickly. Therefore, I especially hope that they can often gather all their experience, manpower, and financial resources in a general organization, and work together to irrigate and cultivate, which can not only play a great role in the entire drama movement, but also enable the workers of each fighting unit to make rapid progress in experience and technology. This is a work that is needed and necessary in launching a mass drama movement.

The Youth Drama Association should be a very ideal organization for youth drama workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. No matter how many unavoidable difficulties and unavoidable gaps there are temporarily, as long as we recognize that this work is correct in the big premise, then we should take out the heart of loving our own unit to love this general institution, and under the perseverance and enthusiasm of everyone, all difficulties can be overcome!

On the occasion of the Youth Drama Association's second large-scale joint performance, I loudly shout:

Long live the Youth Drama Association!

### Planning Improvements for This Spring's Tea Production and Sales

— Xie Yaoyuan

Specifically speaking, Shanghai's foreign tea firms are a distribution mechanism, while tea factories in tea-producing areas are the actual operators of the tea business. Shanghai's foreign tea firms provide financial support to tea factories and distribute their manufactured tea leaves (i.e., boxed tea). Since Shanghai's foreign tea firms bear economic responsibility, they should provide necessary supervision and guidance to tea factories. However, the organization of Shanghai's foreign tea firms is not yet sound, and they cannot fully fulfill their responsibilities. In tea-producing areas, tea factory operations primarily focus on technical aspects. However, those managing them are often not specialists, and their education levels are extremely low. I have often encountered such tea merchants who even ask what foreigners need these tea leaves for, which is very regrettable. As for the state of overseas markets, they are even more ignorant. Such lamentable phenomena, I don't want to deliberately overstate, but there's no way to avoid mentioning it. Both internal and external operations are perfunctory and aimed solely at maximizing profits. Old habits are followed, and old rules are adhered to, which is not conducive to the development of the tea industry. This is by no means accidental.

III

Since the tea industry is declining due to the aforementioned reasons, it is difficult to revitalize it because merchants have limited capital and knowledge. Therefore, government control is urgently needed. However, the idea of control has been around for years, but partly because merchants are limited by immediate interests and have many unnecessary suspicions, failing to genuinely cooperate with the government, and partly because the government has not actually implemented it, it has not achieved significant results. This year, the government established a Trade Commission under the Ministry of Finance to control foreign exchange and adjust international trade, and tea is included as one of the items managed by the commission. Thus, control is being realized. Now, let's try to comprehensively review the current state of control.

Tea leaves are seasonal agricultural products. Merchants operate by raising capital in advance to establish factories, produce, and sell. This inherently involves certain operational steps. The Trade Commission's control over tea transportation and sales was implemented in the later stage of this year's tea business. The tea leaves manufactured by merchants had already become finished products and had been transported to export ports, ready to be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The Trade Commission issued an order to implement control, suddenly preventing transportation and export. Although merchants obeyed the order, they were filled with apprehension because they did not understand the true meaning of control. Therefore, business in progress was completely halted.

### Intense Football Match Today: South China South Faces Eastern Again; Police vs. Scots Also Evenly Matched

[Our Report] South China has returned, and football affairs are heating up again. Today's league features two first division matches. South China South, after a brief hiatus of over twenty days, will appear and showcase their skills amid the eager anticipation of fans.

South China South vs. Eastern is a good show that is sure to be pleasing to the eye. Remember when the two teams first met, South China South won 5-0. But today, as they meet again, South China South may find it difficult to repeat that previous achievement. Moreover, South China South players Li Tiansheng and Mai Shaohan have returned from injuries and are not yet fully recovered. They are勉强 appearing today.

Since Sun Jinshun's mid-season departure to Shanghai, Eastern's strength has not been affected in the slightest. In fact, their record has been even better. This is because of their unity and singleness of purpose.

Li Si said: "My right foot has not yet healed. I've been practicing with my left foot lately, and it's been quite satisfactory."

In short, Eastern wants to avenge their previous defeat, while South China South wants to consolidate their position as champions. Therefore, an intense battle is inevitable.

The Police vs. Scots match, because it is unrelated to the championship situation, the outcome is not important. However, the two teams are evenly matched and there will also be a fierce fight. (Football Grand Duke)

### Shanghai Student Tennis Team Arrives in Hong Kong for Challenge; Six-Member Team, Match Schedule Under Negotiation

[Our Report] Although Shanghai has become an "isolated island," sports are still active and full of vitality.

Tang Baojia (John's), Li Guofan (Jiao Tong), Cai Guoji (John's), Wei Zhenxing (John's), and Xu Peizhi (Shanghai University), who are quite reputable in the Shanghai tennis scene, were selected by the Chinese Tennis Association to form a student tennis team to challenge Hong Kong, the "second isolated island."

The team's trip to the south was sponsored by Black Brothers Toothpaste Company. A Shanghai newspaper also specially made uniforms to present to the five players to boost morale.

Secretary Jiang Jiehe and a group of six people left Shanghai on the Empress of Canada on the 26th and arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning. They are staying at Room 410, Hotel des Nations.

They will stay in Hong Kong for about ten days and play about four or five matches. However, the match schedule is undecided and is still being negotiated. Tentatively: (1) against the Hong Kong University student team, (2) against the South China team, (3) against the Hong Kong Football Club team, and (4) against the Chinese Recreation Club team. After competing in Hong Kong, they will go to Macau for one or two matches and then return to Shanghai.

According to Li Guofan, they were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the south on the 31st of this month. However, as they were free during the winter vacation, they came to Hong Kong early. During the voyage, Guo Ji caught a cold and fevered up to 103 degrees. He is currently recuperating and may not be fully recovered and able to perform.

This afternoon, lawyers Luo Wenjin and Luo Wenhui hosted a welcome reception for them. Cai Yongshan, the He family team, and others accompanied them to Stanley Villa for practice.

These tennis players are very energetic and have considerable tennis skills. In particular, Tang Baojia and Li Guofan's doubles partnership has been well-known in Shanghai. They were selected for the Shanghai-Tianjin intercity competition last year. This time, they will contribute a lot.

The match against the South China team is said to be scheduled for 2:30 PM on February 5th (Sunday) at the Kowloon Recreation Ground tennis court. South China has already selected (singles) Chen Zhiqiang, Chen Funan, Chen Jinman, (doubles) Lü Guifang, Ma Nai , Li Junxiong, and He Xianqin to compete. The five players are listed below: Tang Baojia: All-Shanghai Chinese Singles Champion, Li Guofan: All-Shanghai Chinese Singles Runner-up.

(Note: Tang and Li have won the All-Shanghai Chinese Hard Court Doubles Championship and the All-Shanghai Open Hard Court Championship and were selected for last year's Tianjin-Shanghai intercity competition.)

Wei Zhenxiang: St. John's University Singles Champion

Xu Peizhi: Shanghai University Singles Champion

Cai Guoji: All-Shanghai Junior Singles Runner-up

### South China Hua vs. Hong Kong Football Club

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the First Division League match between South China Hua and the Hong Kong Football Club was held at the Caroline Hill Ground. The stands were deserted, the atmosphere was relaxed, and there was nothing much to say. Hong Kong Football Club was missing key players. "Big Daan" Fopula was tired and out of form, and Yi Shidulanqi was drafted to fill his position. "Little Daan" E Fopula resembled his brother and played with his brother's style. The Hong Kong Football Club did not have enough players, so they used Second Division players to form a team. The Second Division players, who had fought two battles in a row, looked dejected. South China Hua's center midfielder Lin Depu injured his foot, and Yang Genbao returned to defend the center. At the same time, Lu Dakeng replaced Li Shuoyou, who had been imprisoned for a year, and the left-wing offense was somewhat reduced. However, the whole team played well together and, against the weak Hong Kong Football Club, they not only did not expose any flaws but also played with ease. Eighteen minutes after the start of the game, Chen Dehui led a fierce attack, dribbled deep, and shot hard, hitting Gao Lusi's body and bouncing out. Gao Lusi pounced again from the goal, and Song Sheng, who had been waiting in front of the goal, lightly added a kick, and the ball rolled into the empty net. 1-0, South China scored first. At 30 minutes, Jin Hong crossed from the wing, and Shui Yi copied it into the corner of the city, casually scoring another goal (2-0). Then the half-time whistle blew. Changing sides and fighting again, Hong Kong made some progress, but it was short-lived. Mo Shen was in distress. At 25 minutes, Dehui dribbled close to the goal, aimed accurately, and scored again (3-0). At 28 minutes, Hong Kong Football Club's left inside midfielder Mei Ling committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Shi Kua took the penalty and scored with a powerful shot (4-0). Two minutes later, Shui Yi took advantage of the transportation from the rear and shot coldly from the right wing, the ball flew into the net (5-0). Gao Lusi could not help but be dumbfounded. Until the end of the game, South China won 5-0. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:

(South China Hua)

### Football Intelligence

[Hong Kong Special Report] The Hong Kong Football Club has been declining in recent years, and its strength has been greatly reduced. The "Great Altar" prestige has disappeared. Especially in this season, since the team's expedition, they have lost more than they have won, and there is nothing much to say. "Fat Shi," who was once famous, has seen that the situation is over and is no longer interested. He has not often participated in the war lately. It is learned that the team's pillars, Bickford and Skinner, will soon leave Hong Kong to return to England. If so, the team's lineup will be even more incomplete. It is also heard that Liao Yazhen of the Kowloon Football Club has also left.

Yesterday, a letter from a Filipino reader in Hong Kong was published in the South China Morning Post, stating that the Hong Kong-Philippines intercity football match is approaching, but it is not known whether Li Huitang and Da Gaoshanu have been selected for the Hong Kong team. The Filipino people have always admired these two famous football players in the Far East. If they are selected this time, many Filipinos will come specifically to see them.

The Philippine intercity football team will have three matches in Hong Kong in the future. The first match is the intercity match, and the second and third matches are exhibition matches. Someone suggested that any player who has represented Hong Kong in the intercity match should not be selected for the exhibition matches. If this is the case, players with good skills who have not been selected for the intercity match can have the opportunity to show their skills in the exhibition matches. This suggestion is very reasonable. However, if our China United team adopts this method, its strength will be greatly affected.

The Shanghai International Relief Committee invited Li Huitang to go north to participate in a football charity match, which is scheduled to be held on the 20th and 21st of next month. However, Huitang will have the intercity match in Hong Kong at that time, and there will be a charity match on the 26th, so he cannot go north on schedule. According to Huitang yesterday, going to Shanghai is an unavoidable duty, but he hopes that the Shanghai side will reschedule the match to March 4th or 5th, otherwise it will be difficult to comply.

### Guanghua Valiantly Resists Middlesex; Three to Three, Spring Colors Evenly Divided

Guanghua and Middlesex played against each other at So Kon Po Ground yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. As a result, each team scored three goals, dividing the spring colors evenly. Yesterday, Guanghua's rear defense was very solid, especially Li Guoqi and Hou Rongsheng, who performed very well. The three midfielders were criticized for their lack of energy and slow movements, which prevented them from resisting Pearson and Shushi's attacks. The five forwards coordinated better than before. Shi Jin, Wenzhi, and Chifen all had tacit cooperation, so they were able to draw with the strong Middlesex team. On the Middlesex side, because Generals Watson and Gegen left Hong Kong to return to England, although there were replacements, their strength was affected. There was a reason why they did not win. As soon as the battle began, Guanghua attacked first. Shi Jin and Jiao Zhi jumped forward, like fish in water, and rolled into the hinterland, but they were eliminated by Bidi's kick. Middlesex launched a division to invade. De di took the lead and passed through several passes. When he reached the last kick in front of the goal, he shot diagonally into the wilderness. After that, Guanghua was attacked very quickly. Seeing the enemy riding vertically and horizontally, the danger was everywhere. Fortunately, all the generals were able to do their best and fight to the end, and the capital was temporarily protected. After a period of fierce fighting, Guanghua counterattacked in the meantime. Jing Cong smuggled in from the side, but the Middlesex midfielder line was strong and was eventually defeated. Without what, the Middlesex army came to invade again, forcing a corner kick. Marabu took the main kick. The ball fell to the left of the goal. Pearson intercepted it and passed it back to the center. De di rushed to the top in time and slanted into the net, winning the first goal. After Guanghua's loss, they tried their best to counterattack. Chi played the ball forward, passed short to Wenzhi to shoot, but was caught by Ji Chen and kicked back to the center. Pearson intercepted and passed over Zixiang and shot at the goal. The ball came from the left corner of the goal, as fast as a shooting star. Fortunately, Guoqi reacted quickly and jumped up to save it. Soon, Guanghua was in a hurry again. A melee broke out in front of the fight. In the killing, the referee suddenly whistled and punished Guanghua with a penalty kick. Pearson shot the ball in the net. Before long, the first half ended. After resting, they fought again. The Middlesex army continued to attack, but Guanghua's generals gradually became active and changed to low-ball short-pass counterattacks. The ball was kicked far by Wenzhi and passed to Shijin. Zuhan's resistance was ineffective, and Shijin sloped into the net, paying the Middlesex army back one. Before long, Guanghua turned bad luck into good luck. Bingjin's teacher rose from the frontier, cut the ball in the middle, and Fenji flew over people, and rushed to it in time, and then hit it into the door, leveling the game again. At this time, the battle situation gradually became tense, Mi put all his strength into the attack, surrounded and attacked for a while, and finally Chen Shishi took the opportunity of Marabu's pass in the middle and scored a goal, and Guanghua was not weak, taking advantage of the opportunity, and Wenzhi shot at the goal, Guba intercepted it, Jing Cong rushed, took the ball and before the plate, buckled and shot in, and became a tie again. Before long, the battle ended, dividing six goals.

### Alice Marble's Tennis Ascent Secrets (5): Old Court Lovers

Regarding the serve technique, I also advocate using the Continental grip. This has considerable assistance in speed, accuracy, and spin. Based on my experience, I think it is enough for women to learn two serving methods: flat serve and slice serve. And never learn the American-style serving method, because in women's physiology, the muscles of the back are definitely not as strong as men's. Making forced twists and turns is prone to injury to the back muscles and tendons.

The slice serve technique I use myself has no mentor. I learned it myself by watching men's ball games in the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. But now I think that the benefits of this serving method do not compensate for the depletion of physical strength, so I also hope that one day I can completely get rid of this serving habit. In other words, this is not a good example. Now that I'm used to it, it has become a bad habit, but it's difficult to change it for a while.

Many female tennis players think that if they can use the topspin serve, it will be a killer trick in hard court competitions. However, I want to advise you not to think like this. If this method is not used properly, it is no better than the flat serve and the bottom-cutting serve that are not laborious. At the same time, I want to make further forceful admonitions. The topspin serve can be said to be completely useless on grass.

I firmly believe that one day, most of our American female tennis players will have an effortless serving method, because serving is based on being effortless and avoiding being forced. I hope that my female comrades will not doubt that I am selfish and thinking of secretly trying to develop a serving method to seek self-achievement. You must know that I am a born athlete, and I am lucky to have a teacher who saw that I had a natural athletic ability, and with her patient guidance and my own long-term hard practice, I was able to play this trick. If a person without these conditions wants to learn from me, I dare to believe that he will eventually ruin himself, not to mention that I also feel that I should abandon this serving method. In short, the topspin serve is really too difficult to learn and is by no means necessary for women.

The secret of serving is to never hit the ball low. If you toss the ball three feet above your head when serving, and the movement of the racket should wrap around below the neck, then when hitting, the racket should first face the sky and then forward to hit the ball. As for after hitting, the racket should follow the remaining momentum around to the left of the body and hang down in front of the left foot, which is to use this remaining momentum to make the ball fly out quickly. It is a natural need that the racket's remaining momentum must be lowered before it is finished, otherwise the ball will not be powerful. For me, whether the serve is effective is more important than whether other techniques are good, because this is the focus of defense. Whether the serve is effective affects the outcome of the game, just like the serving in baseball and the moment of using the club in golf. It all depends on the power and method you use when you are about to serve.

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... First Love

Love Finds Andy Hardy

Every film about the Hardy family offers the audience fresh enjoyment. These films are filled with authenticity and can reasonably portray a wealth of interesting life experiences. Their vivid depictions almost allow the audience to personally experience everything in the film, moved by the family's joys and sorrows. This film, "First Love," the fourth about Judge Hardy, offers a profound and realistic depiction of the romantic psychology of young men and women. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is caught up in a love affair, juggling three women: one he genuinely loves, one he is looking after for a friend, and another who is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who offers him much help. At the same time, the family faces an unfortunate event: Andy's grandmother is seriously ill, her life hanging in the balance, and his mother has left home to care for her. In this situation, they prepare for a somber Christmas. But suddenly, the mother returns with good news, bringing them a gift of "comfort," and the family celebrates a joyous Christmas.

Mickey Rooney puts in extra effort in this film, achieving even better results than in previous films. Louis Stone, as a thoughtful and sincere elder, is the most outstanding character in the film. In addition to the original cast, a singing child star, Judy Garland, is added. Her sincere and moving expressions, and her clear and delightful voice, also occupy an important position in the film.

Queen's Cinema... Paris Honeymoon

Paris Honeymoon

The story is simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is lighthearted and delightful, and the cast is quite complete. Unfortunately, the actors are not used to their best advantage, and some of them fail to fully showcase their talents.

The story tells of a millionaire from the American West who brings his fiancée to Paris because she needs to finalize her divorce with her former husband there. He first stays in a rose village, where he meets the local Rose Queen, a little girl who constantly causes him trouble, whom he calls "Little Headache." They unintentionally fall in love. Meanwhile, his fiancée in Paris rekindles her romance with her former husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.

The film features several lovely songs sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the film. Akim Tamiroff, a star known for playing villains, plays a comedic role here, and does quite well. Franciska Gaal gives a lively and excellent performance.

Oriental... Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

The story is simple, about two rat poison merchants (Laurel and Hardy) who suddenly have the idea to do business in Switzerland. However, not only do they not succeed in business, but they end up having to work as waiters in a hotel. These two foolishly clever guys create many jokes.

There are two European singers in this film, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.

Grand China... Everybody Sing

Everybody Sing

Starring Judy Garland. Her singing voice may not be as moving as Deanna Durbin's, but she is still an extremely talented newcomer. The film is about a family of theater enthusiasts, and the performance is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is a typical Hollywood musical in color. Besides singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also good. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."

New World... The Real and Fake Empress Wu Zetian

Cantonese film

A commodity film that attempts to attract viewers with its sensuality. It centers on a stage actress with a strange sexual proclivity, using her performance as Empress Wu Zetian on stage and her licentious private life as material. The content is strange and absurd, but it may cater to low tastes. The so-called sensual scenes are not thorough, disappointing viewers interested in such things and disgusting ordinary viewers.

Central... The Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum

Cantonese film

Viewers who have seen the previous installment will remember that at the end, Golden Chrysanthemum was still being fought over by Zhou Zhicheng. This sequel picks up from there, continuing until Golden Chrysanthemum returns home. The plot is not as tense or convoluted as the previous installment, and the performance is also very lax. However, there are still many moments that can evoke tears from some foolish viewers, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting him in prison. The consistent style of folk tales is unavoidable. We can guess the plot of the film without having seen it, and indeed, that prediction is not wrong. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for this type of film. The set design and cinematography are passable for South China, but the sound recording is a failure.

### "X Horse"

— Cao Zhongren

— New Impressions from Battlefield Travel —

A certain gentleman came to talk and asked me, "When the horses of the X people are captured by our army, do they lower their heads to show shame and repentance?" I was very ashamed; I had neither seen nor heard of such a thing. I showed him many photographs of our generals riding captured X horses, looking proud, with no sign of repentance. However, it would be interesting to see an X horse that had come from the battlefield and was determined to become a monk, but unfortunately, we do not have that fortune.

Because the gentleman brought up the topic of X horses, many friends who live on the battlefield shared their own observations. In a village near Lanling, a squadron of X cavalry was surrounded by our army. By the third day, in a tight iron enclosure, there was obviously no hope of breaking through. On the morning of the third day, an X plane flew low over the village and dropped a signal. An hour after the X plane flew back, there was a burst of intermittent gunfire in the village, followed by silence. Soon, our army broke into the village, where they found more than forty X soldiers lying dead, along with more than fifty X horses: some of the horses had only one ear left, and some had only one eye left, standing there drenched in blood. Several of them truly became one-eyed dragons, and are still pulling carts in our herds today. The X people's horses are quite handsome, plump, and with shiny coats.

Chief of Staff G recounted an incident he personally witnessed in southern Shandong, which sparked a new topic from Military Commander W. He said, "The X people's horses are too beautiful, making it difficult for us. The horses given to us by the 106th Division are enough to form a guerrilla team, and a dozen of them are so beautiful that they are said to be a precious breed, requiring special fodder brought from their own country. We cannot afford to raise these noble horses, and they are too heavy to lift, so we can only let them starve to death in the fields." The gentleman laughed, "Perhaps the X people's artists can paint a picture of righteous horses, saying that these young master horses were captured but unyielding, and died of starvation." After a burst of laughter, I added the words used by the X people themselves to criticize their own horses in "The Dead Soldiers of Zhu," they themselves said: "The mules and horses of China look like ghosts, skinny and small, dragging one step after another; but when it comes to walking, especially on muddy and rugged long distances, our top-notch horses are not as good as those ghostly mules and horses, enduring hardship and able to walk without falling down." This is a general explanation of the future fate of the Sino-Japanese war; the horses of the X people symbolize the fighting power of the X people.

Staff Officer T fought in Lanfeng, entering and leaving the cavalry column commanded by the notorious wanderer Doihara for more than ten days. He captured many horses one after another, and the horse he rode and the one the army commander rode were both captured at that time. His "Theory of X Horses" is also quite interesting, he said: "The character of the master is often expressed through the objects he loves; young ladies like pugs, and bandits want to keep a ferocious, wolf-like dog, these are all reflections of the master's character. The enemy has a common mindset about horses, which is why the "X Army's" horses must be fat and shiny, but they don't pay much attention to whether they are solid inside. We usually treat enemy horses as decorations; but when we go to the battlefield, I have to make another choice." Using the appearance of horses to depict the psychology of the nouveau riche, is quite profound when thought about deeply.

On the Japanese side, there were also people who saw this point; wasn't Takahashi, the finance minister who was sacrificed in the February 26th Incident, talking about the emptiness of their own economic foundations? Lu Jin

### Alas! Alas!

— Lu Jin

The "Far-reaching Force" that boasted of "occupying Shanghai in three days and capturing Nanjing in ten days" is naturally a bit stretched after a year and a half. However, the Chinese army is fighting more and more vigorously, and their political views are unified. Even if they want to encourage a puppet to open a "door of peace," it only exposes their own panic and baseness—this is called "riding a tiger and finding it difficult to dismount."

While guarding such a vast area and unable to advance, and with financial resources exhausted, the only options are to open opium dens, traffic in drugs, and make the expeditionary soldiers do some work to extract a little money. This "policy" called "prosperity" is also the last resort. However, with scorched earth and rubble everywhere, there is no way to "prosper," and no wealth to extract. Let the "slippery characters" beckon the Chinese people, "Come, come!" But unfortunately, a guerrilla team came, and the resident people suddenly all turned into "stubborn people." The wishful thinking of "numbing the people's minds" and "local requisitioning" is like lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot. This is called "a situation that is both funny and sad."

And now, even further, not only are financial resources exhausted, but even the troops will not be enough to distribute. However, there are still many methods to think of, such as organizing "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" and "forcing 1.35 million people" into service, which is indeed a poisonous policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." However, whether the Chinese youth in the guerrilla areas can be easily dealt with, they themselves are afraid that "whether it is safe to trust these armed Chinese is still in question"—this is "caught between a rock and a hard place."

In short, Konoe cannot protect the "guard" society, and Hiranuma Kiichirō probably cannot "pacify" this great disaster. Even if they loudly proclaim a "long-term war," it will be like drinking a hallucinogenic liquor, and they will soon see "Alas! Alas!" Li Huiying

### Military Notes

— Li Huiying

Looking at the new-style building top, someone exclaimed in surprise.

"How can there be a building in this small mountain ravine?"

"Yes, what would they use a building for here? Could it be a villa for keeping people captive?"

"It's a chapel, right? The influence of foreign missionaries has always been deep into the countryside."

Gradually, we rounded the mountain bend, allowing us to see the entire facade of the building. It was a white two-story building, with an upside-down bucket-shaped Western roof, covered with red Western tiles, which were very dazzling. Because the length of the building was more than eight or nine bays, it looked spacious and grand. The windows upstairs were square, and the corridor ran horizontally in front of them, wide and stately, making the facade of the building look very imposing.

Our guesses failed to produce a satisfactory answer. If it were a Confucius temple, it would never be built in a Western style; a church building would not look like this either. Rich people would not raise silkworms here, and transportation is too inconvenient. So, besides these, what else could we guess?

Humans are curious animals, isn't that right? Just take our group as an example. When we first saw the building top standing in this small mountain village, we felt as curious as children; it is even rarer to see a building in a remote village than to go to the countryside to buy sugar. Now that the team has entered the small market street, to satisfy our curiosity, we put down our backpacks and ration bags and rushed over.

"That's the Confucius Temple."

The people on the street pointed us in the direction. In a small mountain village, to have the opportunity to visit the Most Sagely Teacher in a Western-style Confucius temple, isn't that rare?

Just after walking behind the street, a stone tablet by the roadside stopped us. "The place where Zilu asked for directions"—the writing was eroded by wind and rain and was unclear.

And so, I, a military man, remembered a story from the past about the Cultural Sage. Confucius got lost, not knowing which way was east, west, south, or north, and sent Zilu to ask for directions, which is how he found his way. This—all happened in the past.

The white Western-style building was still about 80% new, indicating that it hadn't been repaired long ago. Above the entrance, the four large characters "Wenjin Academy" were carved, the "Wenjin" used here is probably meant for the current students, because there was a small school wooden sign hanging next to it. On the tall lime wall outside the building, the slogan "Suppress the Communists" written by the "Bao Ba Tuan" remained.

This building was not a Confucius temple, but a small school. The paint on the floors upstairs was still very shiny. Occupying a whole building, the school's scale was not small, but now it was empty. The school was probably closed due to the current situation. Zou Xiao

### Hu Shaobao's War Achievements in Pacifying the X People

— Zou Xiao

— National Novel Talks

The last volume, Volume 34, of Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection of West Lake" from the Ming Dynasty is "Hu Shaobao's War Achievements in Pacifying the X People," with methods for "Important Coastal Defense" attached at the end. Does it have a deeper meaning within? Otherwise, why would he make a story about pacifying the X people the final volume, and repeatedly tell the reader about methods of defending against the X people?

This short story is mostly based on Mao Kun's "Chronicle of the Suppression and Elimination of Xu Hai," from the Ming Dynasty. Many places are simply the literary language changed to vernacular, with some descriptions added.

One section tells the story of Wang Cuicao, a courtesan who entices Xu Hai to surrender, harming Xu Hai and it is quite moving. Her behavior is similar to that of Concubine Fei in the late Ming Dynasty. Kunqu Opera "The Tiger Assassin" is a famous play often performed on stage, and Wang Cuicao should also be excellent dramatic material.

Regarding Wang Cuicao, the "General Record of Pacifying the X People in the Southeast in the Jiajing Era" simply does not mention her, and Zhu Jiude's "Brief History of the X People's Rebellion" only has these few sentences: "On the 19th day of the eighth month of the 35th year of Jiajing, Hai knew that danger was imminent and an attack was coming that evening, so at the second watch, he secretly sent his two beloved concubines out of the camp to escape." The so-called two beloved concubines are Wang Cuicao and Green Sister.

The story of Cuicao is as follows: "Wang Cuicao was a prostitute from Lin'an. When the X pirates invaded Jiangnan, they captured Cuicao. The camp leader Xu Hai greatly favored and doted on her, respecting her as his wife. All plans were dictated by Cuicao. However, Cuicao pretended to be intimate with him, secretly hoping for his defeat. The governor's office sent Hua the Elder to persuade Hai to surrender. Hai was going to kill him, but Cuicao untied his bonds and gave him gold. Hua the Elder returned and told the governor's office, which sent Zhongjun Luo to persuade Hai, and also secretly bribed Cuicao with gold, jewels, and jade. Cuicao said calmly in the camp every day that great things were bound to fail and that it would be better to surrender. Hai made his decision. The governor's office mobilized troops, feigning surrender. They attacked Hai's camp. Hai, trusting Cuicao's words, did not prepare. The government troops rushed in, beheaded Hai, captured Cuicao alive, and annihilated the X people. The governor's office gifted Cuicao to the Yongshun chieftain. Cuicao left, crossed the Qiantang River, and said: 'Ming Shan treated me with learning, and I used state affairs to entice him to kill him; killing one chieftain and then belonging to another, how can I live?' She drowned herself in the river at midnight." (Excerpt from Mao Kun's Chronicle of the Suppression and Elimination of Xu Hai)

Ouyang Yuqian wants to adapt this story into a new Peking opera. With his skill in writing "A Biography of Liang Hongyu," to write about Wang Cuicao causing dissent between Ye Ma and Chen Dong, there must be some excellent and witty words. However, the fact that "she bribed Cuicao with gold, jewels, and jade" (Ji Qing's "Complete History of Sino-Japanese Wars Through the Ages" also says: "They sent spies holding hairpins and earrings to leave for Hai's two maids, who persuaded Hai day and night.") inevitably lowers Wang Cuicao's status and ambitions. Judging from the context, Cuicao had previously "pretended to be intimate with him, secretly hoping for his defeat," and later said herself, "I used state affairs to entice him to kill him." It can be seen that her determination was made before she was bribed, and she clearly stated that it was for the sake of the country, so how could gold, jewels, and jade move her? I hope that when Yuqian writes this play in the future, he can emphasize Wang Cuicao's killing of Xu Hai for the sake of the country.

Xu Hai was originally a Chinese, helping the wicked to do evil. This reminds us of the fishermen of Shidongkou, our country, during the August 13th Shanghai Battle, who led the enemy deep into the area, causing us to lose Luodian. Southern Jiangsu also quickly lost the dangerous areas of Suzhou and Wuxi because fishermen acted as traitors. Proving the present with the past, they are exactly the same. Yuqian has already vividly portrayed Wang Zhi in "Liang Hongyu," so he will surely be able to give us a "satirical painting" of a great traitor like Xu Hai.

### After Reading the "Challenge"

— Zhang Chunfeng

Last December, I seemed to have read a piece of news in a certain newspaper saying that the commander of the X people's military headquarters in South China had sent a challenge to Chairman Chiang, but unfortunately, I did not have the good fortune to see the contents of the X people's challenge. I thought that the X people were good at writing, and could also be innovative and unique, and that the X people could justify all the ugly things that humans are ashamed to do with formal documents. Yesterday I bought a recent issue of "Literature," and it happened to reprint this "great work." This piece in the 1938 World Literature will add a lot of color.

No matter how carefully you examine the three words "Challenge," they don't seem like a Chinese product. It's probably a foreign product. I haven't heard of these three words before. Let's start with a few sentences and famous lines from the challenge:

"The sky is clear, as bright as the great sun, what fear is there of wind and clouds? Chiang XX secretly commits atrocities, plunging innocent people into the misery of charcoal..." This is the beginning of the challenge. After all, the people of the island nation are imposing as soon as they speak. At the same time, they repeatedly mention "the people," saying that the X people's invasion and aggression against other people's national sovereignty is justified, but we are not, and they are also "acting on behalf of heaven" and "relieving the people's plight," making them seem like benevolent teachers. I remember that on the morning of the "September 18th Incident," notices to reassure the people were posted everywhere on the streets of Shenyang, and their tone and wording were almost the same as this challenge. The bandits' behavior of the Kwantung Army was also to "relieve the people's plight," bullying the weak and plundering the strong. The X people claimed to be driving out the "evil warlords" for the people. It is true that the Japanese people's skill in playing with words and fabricating rumors is something that the people of the world should avoid. Now let me copy a paragraph from Honjō Shigeru's notice to reassure the people on the second day of the "September 18th Incident":

"...Our army only wants to punish the Northeastern military authority. Regarding the well-being of all people, this officer is most concerned and attentive. I have specifically instructed my subordinates to protect their welfare and cherish their lives. I hope that the Northeastern people will all take care of themselves and have no worries..."

This paragraph is a masterpiece from Japan in 1931 and is of course an important document that cannot be discarded lightly. Comparing it with the challenge issued by the South China commander last year, there is still not much difference. "Punishment" and "the people" are said too much, and they have become commonplace and uninteresting. However, there are still remarkable sentences in the challenge that must be mentioned. Such as:

"The fall of Guangzhou was achieved by the Japanese army with only one or two battalions. It is truly a sigh of pity... At that time, the Lingnan was full of fertile fields in the deep autumn, driving the refreshing wind, and advancing the army to decide the victory..."

The small people of the island nation are happy when they win, and their complacent and complacent ugly state is overflowing in words, much like a village child who picks up a nugget of gold and sells his advantage when he gets a bargain.

But what expresses the utmost pain is not in these high-sounding boasts, but in the ending:

"Claiming to fear protracted resistance and only showing one's back, merely invites the slander of being base and cowardly."

In fact, the strategy of protracted resistance is the tactic of "not attacking head-on" but "only showing one's back." Yesterday (23rd), X chieftain Itagaki, the Army Minister, gave a speech in the parliament, in which he estimated China's existing troop configuration, saying that there were still 110 divisions of troops that had not suffered any damage and were extremely strong in combat. Therefore, X chieftain had to tell the people of the entire island nation the most urgent request with the faithful words that "this Sino-Japanese war requires not only the efforts of the navy and army, but also the joint responsibility of the entire nation." Die chieftain Itagaki suffered greatly in the Battle of Taierzhuang and truly knows the advantages and disadvantages of China, is a senior officer of the X army, then his words can arouse the attention of all islanders. If we take Itagaki's words and compare them with the words "merely invites the slander of being base and cowardly" in the challenge, then the most ugly, base, and cowardly is not China, but Japan.

Last October, the Japanese army lost tens of thousands of soldiers in the Battle of De'an, fighting bloody battles for seven days and nights. If we talk about "sigh of pity," it is truly disgusting, a great over-war. However, the X army commander sent out a letter of surrender, asking for mercy and sparing of lives. The contemptible and pitiful ugliness is beyond measure compared to the challenge.

I often hear people say that the Japanese are the most capable of cheating the world, but they are also the most shameless people in the world. I will not be disappointed after reading "Challenge".
