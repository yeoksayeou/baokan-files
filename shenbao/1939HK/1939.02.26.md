### Lasting Resistance Will Surely Achieve Final Victory

— Feng Yuxiang

The heroic resistance of the past nineteen and a half months proves more than anything else that as long as we intensify our efforts and persevere in our resistance, we will surely achieve final victory. Since the start of the war, the [Japanese] have been deteriorating day by day, while we have been progressing day by day. Looking at the current facts is enough to prove this point.

What the [Japanese] used to boast about was their "brave" imperial army, but today's imperial army is afraid of fighting, afraid of the Chinese army, afraid of the guerrillas, and even afraid of the Chinese people. Their "bravery" is only expressed in their anti-war actions. On January 22nd, more than 3,000 [Japanese] soldiers rioted in Dagukou over anti-war sentiments. More than 500 [Japanese] soldiers in Jiangyin also mutinied at the beginning of this month, killing the [Japanese] commander. A unit of the Japanese army in Hankou was preparing to riot, but the plan was leaked, and 150 military police and soldiers were arrested. Japanese soldiers in Shanghai organized a Youth Party and distributed leaflets in Hongkou advocating the Three Principles of the People. Five [Japanese] officers and soldiers in Taiyuan committed suicide outside the East Gate due to "extreme war-weariness"! Japanese naval senior advisor Vice Admiral Yamasaka composed a poem in Xiamen expressing his war-weariness and longing for home. In Japan, a large number of officials in the Ministry of the Army joined the anti-war association, and more than a thousand students at the Imperial University went on strike against the war. Meiji University, Waseda University, and other schools were searched by military police on the 8th of this month, leading to a literary inquisition. These facts are not accidental. These anti-war waves will turn into a torrent with our stronger resistance, destroying the [Japanese] warlords' war of aggression.

In terms of economy, unemployment, hunger, a military expenditure of one hundred million yuan, public debt of two hundred million yuan, and the nationwide floods are all things that every Chinese person knows, so we will not talk about them. Just look at what the Italian Weissbrod said in his book "How I Became a Japanese Spy," based on what he saw with his own eyes. He said that the Japanese warlords are using kidnapping, smuggling, opening opium dens, opening brothels, opening gambling dens, and manufacturing and selling drugs to raise their military expenses. Their plight, baseness, and pitiful situation can be imagined.

The [Japanese]'s international environment is facing increasing difficulties due to its insane actions. On the 10th of this month, [Japan] took advantage of the strained relations between France and Italy to attack Hainan Island. We ourselves are "already prepared for all land deployments and will do our best to fight the [Japanese] army on the island." Even friendly countries such as France and Britain are questioning them sternly on the one hand and preparing for practical actions on the other. In terms of international relations, the Japanese warlords originally wanted to take this opportunity to strengthen their unity with Germany and Italy and threaten France and Britain to make concessions, but the result only made their "being at war with the world" situation more obvious.

With our sustained resistance, Japan's war capabilities are weakening day by day, and its difficulties are increasing day by day. The people and the army are increasingly aware that the war is harmful to them and are rising up against the war. However, the Japanese warlords are using more insane attacks to try to solve these difficulties. The result naturally strengthens these difficulties and makes them approach total collapse faster.

On our side, it is the opposite. Strategic and tactical approaches are rapidly progressing. The moving, admirable, brave, arduous, diligent, and striving facts of senior officers to every soldier are endless and cannot be fully written. In terms of the masses, from large entrepreneurs to farmers in the countryside, from the elderly to elementary school students, many have taken out their strength and money to contribute to the resistance. In terms of politics, from Xinjiang to Guangdong, from guerrilla areas to our rear areas, there is gradual reform and improvement. In terms of economy, the occupied areas have stopped the [Japanese] from plundering our resources, new modern industries are being established in the rear cities, and the vast rural agriculture and handicrafts are being organized in the form of cooperatives. In terms of international relations, it has progressed from the sympathy of the people of various countries to the actual assistance of the governments to us. These advances are being accelerated and guided by our supreme commander in a planned manner, moving towards the goal of final victory.

However, our progress is still not enough compared to the needs of the war. We must intensify our efforts to completely stop the [Japanese]'s offensive and fully prepare for our counteroffensive. Our efforts should follow the four directions listed below:

First, we must intensify our unity. Today, during the period of resistance, there is a very simple truth: what the [Japanese] hope for must be harmful to us; what the [Japanese] oppose must be beneficial to us. Konoe's "quick peace and quick conclusion" conspiracy is what the [Japanese] hope for and is harmful to us. Therefore, those who echo Konoe are tools of the [Japanese] and criminals of the nation and the state, and therefore have been severely sanctioned by the central government. On the other hand, what the [Japanese] oppose and want to destroy is the sincere unity of our entire nation, so we must help and love each other more, support the National Government and the Supreme Commander, and strictly prevent the [Japanese] from sowing discord through their tools.

Second, we must contribute more effort and more money. Since the start of the war, compatriots have been helping the army, bravely serving in the military, enthusiastically donating, and subsidizing the country. This is a good phenomenon, but it is still far from enough. We still need to intensify our efforts, using one minute as ten minutes, one person putting in the effort of ten people, to engage in various resistance work. Those who used to spend ten yuan now only spend one yuan, those who used to use ten things now only use one. As much as possible, contribute money and goods to the country and concentrate them on resisting the war. It would be even better if overseas Chinese also donate more.

Third, we must pay attention to anti-[Japanese] propaganda. The Supreme Commander said: "Propaganda is more important than combat." We must, in accordance with this meaning, explain the purpose of the war of resistance and the methods of effort to every compatriot who is not concerned about or not concerned enough about the war of resistance. Overseas Chinese should, on the one hand, publicize our government's policy of sustained resistance, and on the other hand, ignite the patriotic hearts of all overseas Chinese, so that everyone, directly and indirectly, becomes a tool for "expelling the Japanese."

Finally, we must develop wealth and consolidate our economic foundation for the war of resistance. The government already has plans to develop the southwest and northwest. I hope that compatriots will actively work hard under this plan, and overseas Chinese will invest more enthusiastically so that this plan can be realized more quickly.

"Knowing is the ability to act." In the past nineteen and a half months of the war of resistance, compatriots have known that "Resistance will surely win, and nation-building will surely succeed." They will surely be able to persevere, become more vigorous, and promote the earlier arrival of final victory.

### Guangdong Today

— Lu Yi

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Returning from the Guangdong war zone, we deeply feel that after the painful lesson of the "Fall of Guangzhou," there has been a leap forward in Guangdong's political, military, and general mass mobilization work! Even though these advances are only the beginning and are still far from enough, we can continue to move forward in this direction based on the foundation of these advances, and we may be able to get through the "stalemate" stage and reach the victorious "counter-offensive."

First of all, let us look at the political aspect. The reason why Guangzhou fell so quickly in the past was certainly due to military mistakes, but a large part was also due to political reasons. The biggest problem in politics was the lack of coordination within the Guangdong Party, military, and government, and the lack of unity. This caused many unnecessary frictions and estrangements, forming many gaps. Since the new Chairman General Li Hanshun took charge, the gap between the provincial government and the army has been eliminated. Moreover, on the positive side, efforts have been made to coordinate politics with the military, actively improve the wartime administrative structure, establish four provincial government administrative offices throughout the province, and vigorously implement innovative administration that meets the current needs of the war of resistance. At the same time, the provincial government held large-scale training classes to intensify the training of a large number of young cadres as the central backbone for implementing wartime administration.

Secondly, let us look at the military aspect. Due to the lesson of the fall of Guangzhou, the Guangdong military authorities have deeply felt the urgency of the army's political work. Therefore, the political department of the Fourth War Zone is currently holding training classes for political workers, preparing to train a large number of cadres to enrich and expand the army's existing political work organization. Their aim is to have a political instructor in every company in the army, and in the future, even to have a political instructor in every platoon and squad, so as to ensure that political work can be thoroughly and universally implemented in the troops. There have also been new changes in strategy and tactics, basically focusing on mobile warfare, supplemented by guerrilla warfare in cooperation with the army and the self-defense groups, and necessary positional warfare. Due to General Zhang Xianghua's return to Guangdong to preside over military affairs, the unity between the various Guangdong troops has been consolidated and the unity of military command has been strengthened. Finally, it must be particularly pointed out that our recent victory in the counterattack against Zengcheng and the capture of Huiyang and Boluo, the most important thing is that the military authorities are good at mobilizing the masses' armed forces, combining the army's armed forces with the masses' armed forces, and practicing the unity of the army and the people in combat. Only then did they achieve brilliant victories!

Again, speaking of mass mobilization, under the call of defending South China and defending their homes, the self-defense groups in various places bravely fought against the [Japanese], fully demonstrating the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Guangdong people. Some self-defense groups followed the army to advance to the rear of the [Japanese] and develop extensive guerrilla warfare. Some guarded day and night, taking on the task of eliminating traitors in their hometowns. Some filled the gaps in the defense of the regular army, so that our army could go out to attack the [Japanese] without any worries about the rear. Due to the dispatch of many young work teams by the Mobilization Committee to various villages in the interior, surrounding the self-defense groups, and organizing anti-[Japanese] self-defense associations in various villages and towns, so that future mass mobilization is not just a temporary work, but has become a regular work centered on the self-defense groups. Mass movement work can be carried out from organized masses or more advanced sections to disorganized or more backward levels to achieve true national mobilization. Here, the authorities still need to effectively cultivate mass movement cadres, correct narrow mobilization methods, so that the vast power of the masses, especially in Guangdong, where the foundation of armed forces of the masses is the strongest, can be further developed, and accelerate the completion of the objective conditions for the counter-offensive in Guangdong.

Today, the war situation in South China, on the surface, presents a state of dark clouds and no rain, but this does not mean that the [Japanese] have abandoned their attempt to attack our southwest. On the contrary, the [Japanese], holding on to the semi-arc-shaped front line near Guangzhou, are currently waiting for an opportunity to attack. On the one hand, they are trying to "pacify" the guerrilla warfare in the rear and consolidate their occupation. On the other hand, they are gradually reinforcing and preparing to attack again to cut off our southwest international transportation line. Recently, the [Japanese] army has increased its troops in South China by four divisions. The concentration of [Japanese] warships in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Guangxi is a sign that the [Japanese] army is about to attack South China.

Based on the existing progress, we must accelerate the progress in political and military aspects, mobilize the vast and unparalleled power of the masses to smash the [Japanese]'s attack on South China. This is the central task of the current situation! (Special contract from the National Salvation Society)

### Industrial Cooperation in Our Country's Economic Mobilization [Continued from yesterday]

— Shou Miancheng

7.  The granting of loans for industrial cooperation should be quite cautious. The Association's offices are far away in various places. If each loan must be approved by the General Association, it is impossible. Even if you want to ask the district office one by one, it is slightly slow. However, industrial cooperation loans often amount to thousands or even tens of thousands. The price of raw materials is rising every day, and we have to save them in advance in order to meet the principles of economic management. Then the need for funds is self-evident. However, if such a large amount of loans, and most of them are used for fixed capital, cannot be recovered in a short time, if they are not used cautiously, it will not only be difficult to avoid the emergence of malpractices, but also the funds will feel insufficient day by day. In order to remedy the situation; I think that first, the personnel in charge of loans in various places should go through guarantee procedures, and the staff working in the same place should guarantee each other for mutual supervision. Second, the loan authority of district offices and offices should be restricted separately, and if it exceeds a certain limit, it should go through verification procedures. Third, the General Association should appoint audit commissioners to be stationed in district offices and offices on a regular basis, so that loans cannot be decided by one person alone. Fourth, the borrower should receive it directly from the capital custodian institution or personnel to clear the procedures. Although responsible personnel in various places can be completely trusted if they can choose carefully, the system must be strict. In fact, if there is any relaxation, the originally scheduled procedures can be reduced or exempted as appropriate. This is the seventh point.

8.  The business of industrial cooperation must be able to take into account the special circumstances of wartime and the changes that will inevitably occur after the war. Industrial cooperation cannot but make a contribution to the war, so the manufacture of wartime supplies; is also within its scope of work. During wartime, the government encourages wheeling in order to maintain foreign exchange, so all processing and manufacturing related to wheeling in; industrial cooperation should also be done as far as it is capable. During wartime, the government must also find ways to encourage the production of domestic goods to replace imports in order to maintain foreign exchange. This is also where industrial cooperation can be effective. During wartime, due to the implementation of the conscription law, there is a gradual lack of agricultural and industrial labor, so female labor should be used as much as possible to prevent production from stagnating, and to train women in the functions of life. However, the needs of wartime may disappear after the war. During wartime, prices rise. Although the production cost is high, it can still be maintained with difficulty, but after the war, prices fall, or it will not be easy to support. Moreover, after the war, various large industries return to normal and expand production. Cooperative factories will face great rivals. At that time, how cooperative factories can continue to develop should also be considered in advance. Therefore, the business of cooperative factories at this time should be such that it can continue to produce after the war, or switch to other products, and suitable items should be selected so that the market needs after the war; can still maintain its existence and development. This is also very important for the location of the factory. On the one hand, it must avoid bombing and strive for safety, and on the other hand, it should still strive for convenient transportation and simple transportation. At the same time, this factory should pay attention to the purity of the organizational components, and it should not organize workers from all parties in a mixed way, so as to avoid shaking the foundation of the cooperative due to the return of workers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang after the war. It should also use the high prices during wartime. Raise more public accumulation funds to make the capital strong and prepare for competition after the war. This is the eighth point.

9.  Industrial cooperation should find ways to promote other cooperative undertakings, such as transportation and sales cooperation and consumer cooperation, to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and the promotion of products. Before such cooperation can be established, the association should set up supply and transportation agencies to solve the supply and transportation problems of various cooperative societies. This is not only for the development of industrial cooperation itself, but also to gradually complete the business outline of the cooperative movement. I have already described the links that industrial cooperation and general cooperative administration should have in the previous section, and I believe in its importance even more when I see this. In fact, industrial cooperation should not only achieve close cooperation with other cooperations, but also with other related construction work. This is the ninth point.

10. Industrial cooperation should strive to cultivate its autonomy ability, so that it does not always rely on the government's coercion. This is the fundamental principle of cooperative undertakings, and it is not only true for industrial cooperation. However, if you can pay attention to it at the time of establishment, the results in the future will definitely be better. In addition, the joint organization of industrial cooperatives is also very important. However, the joint organization should not be forced. If the societies are far apart and the content is not very substantial, and they do not have much understanding of cooperation, at the same time. There is no connection in business at all, only because they are both industrial cooperatives and they are united. Then it must be of no effect at all. If the organization of this joint society can be planned in advance, several unit cooperative societies can be established in a planned way in nearby areas, and it is planned to establish a cooperative society in a certain place. I would like to think that the future development of industrial cooperation will all depend on whether it can use the strengths of small-scale management to remove its shortcomings. The function of the above-mentioned joint organization is to remove its shortcomings. This is the tenth point.

The above ten points are a brief description of what should be paid attention to in promoting industrial cooperation in our country as far as I can see. If we can pay attention to it in time, it may be of some help to the healthy development of this emerging industry. However, the Association authorities may have already considered it, and the correct understanding and enthusiastic support of industrial cooperation from other parties is especially indispensable. If we can get the cooperation and promotion of central and local technical agencies, cooperative authorities in various provinces and counties, and local authorities, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is also the slight meaning of my drafting this article.

If Guangzhou is the center, the area occupied by the [Japanese] army averages 80 miles in circumference, north to Xinjie, which is closer to Guangzhou. The easternmost defense line of the Japanese army ends at Shilong, and its westernmost defense line extends to Sanshui. South of Guangzhou, the southernmost defense line of the Japanese army ends at Jiujiang. The purpose is to contain the rich areas of Guangdong such as Siyi and prevent weapons and equipment from being imported by sea to Xijiang. This place is where the Chinese army is concentrated.

### Shanghai [Japanese] Pressure on Concessions, Our Country Should Value This Highly, Iron Nets and Sandbags Arranged in Central Concession Area, Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious

[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] The authorities attach great importance to the Shanghai incident. They believe that the unreasonable demands made by the [Japanese] to the Shanghai Municipal Council are a further step in putting pressure on Britain and the United States and expelling the last remaining rights and interests of the two countries in the Far East. Britain and the United States already know the [Japanese]'s intentions and will not concede. In order to achieve its goal, the [Japanese] dare not take military action, but believe that they will definitely find ways to disrupt the security of the concessions. In order to deal with it, Britain and the United States will also retaliate actively, so the development of the situation will become increasingly serious.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 25th] The Municipal Council has recently installed barbed wire and sandbag obstacles along the intersections and alleys of Nanjing Road and blocked them in order to conduct searches at any time and prevent terrorist attacks.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 25th] As a result of repeated Japanese demands and threats, the Municipal Council Police Force here began a major alert in the concession today. All measures are similar to those taken on the anniversary of "August 13" last year. Since early morning, the large and small intersections and alleys in the concession have been blocked, from the Bund in the east to the western district of the concession in the west, totaling more than 350 blocked passages. This measure has caused inconvenience to a large number of residents here. The French Concession Police Force has also taken cooperative action with the Public Concession and has begun the same alert on the Bund ferry terminals. Armed merchant corps Russian team members and patrolmen conduct strict searches, because it is believed that many terrorists come from Pudong. In addition to large patrols of police officers patrolling the streets, British troops are also on guard in their respective defense zones.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to foreign news from Shanghai, the Continental New Daily, run by the Japanese, said in an editorial this morning that assassination cases have repeatedly occurred in the Shanghai concession. The Japanese should immediately start a forceful "sweep" of the concession without wasting time and empty talk through diplomatic means.

### Tianjin [Japanese] Blockade, American Military Defense Zone, Obstacles Set Outside the Boundary

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 24th] The Japanese army recently set up barbed wire obstacles outside the American military defense zone, leaving only one entrance to the concession. The meaning of this move has not been announced.

Therefore, the Japanese army will not be responsible for guaranteeing your safety in the future." However, the British and American authorities in Jiujiang firmly stated that the Japanese army has the obligation to protect the safety of British and American expatriates in Guling. According to an American who arrived here from Guling, "Japanese planes bombed residential areas in Guling on the 16th of last month, and there were no bunkers or other military targets. Therefore, this bombing is an unforgivable act."

### Government Allocates Funds to Develop Yunnan's Mineral Resources; Yunnan Northern Mining Company to Open Next Month; Capital of Two Million Decided

[Our Kunming Air Dispatch] Yunnan Province, located on the frontier, possesses abundant resources. The provincial authorities, recognizing this, have long been meticulously planning and striving to develop them. Recently, they have welcomed investment from foreign individuals and organizations to consolidate the economic foundation for the war of resistance and national construction. Last year, the provincial government and the Resources Commission agreed that each would contribute two million yuan in national currency, and would take over the originally well-managed Dongchuan Mining Company to establish a large-scale Yunnan Northern Mining Company Limited, jointly developing Yunnan's rich resources. Temporarily focusing on northern Yunnan, they will establish a headquarters and offices in Kunming. Initially, they will focus on the main production areas of copper and zinc, such as Luoxue, Yinmin, and Maolu in Dongchuan, setting up mine factories, and offices in Huize, Yongbei, and Yimen counties. The purpose, in addition to the mission of state-run enterprises and promoting national production, is to improve the technical skills of Yunnan laborers, prevent them from perpetually suffering from exploitative practices, and guide small-capital miners in various locations to adopt new production methods to consolidate the economic foundation during the war of resistance and national construction. The company has ordered a large number of new-style equipment from Europe, and some of it has already arrived in Yunnan. The first steps to be taken are: first, to exploit resources; second, to explore mineral deposits; and third, to purchase metals from private businesses. It also plans to establish offices in major domestic and foreign cities for operational convenience. In the future, if development proves effective, the existing capital of two million yuan will be increased several times to vigorously develop the resources of the entire province. This is the first step towards realizing the development of Yunnan's resources after the war of resistance. The significance of its mission can be imagined. The company held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month in the Finance Department, immediately establishing a board of directors and supervisors, respectfully inviting Chairman Long to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Hu Yitong, Lu Chongren, Yang Gongzhao, Miao Jiaming, Yun Zhen, Sun Zheng, Zhang Peiguang, and Sun Zhizeng were appointed as directors. Yuan Piji and Zhang Zhilin were appointed as supervisors. A joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors was held that day, and the company's articles of association were approved. In addition to setting up offices and mine factories in concentrated development areas, the internal organization includes a general manager, an associate manager, and several engineers, with four departments: General Affairs, Engineering, Business, and Accounting. It was decided that Lu Chongren and Sun Zheng would be the managing directors, Hu Yitong would be the general manager, Zou Shijun would be the associate manager, Zhang Zhilin would be the secretary of the board of directors, Xu Xiaoshan would be the company secretary and chief of the General Affairs Department, Cai Ruofang would be the mechanical engineer and chief of the Engineering Department, Liu Jingmin would be the director of the Kunming office and chief of the Business Department, and Chen Yingjing would be the chief of the Accounting Department. It has been decided to open for business on March 1st, and preparations for taking over the Dongchuan Mining Company have been actively underway in recent days.

### Strange Phenomenon in Shanghai: Armed Funeral, Chen Lu Not at Peace Even in Death

[Reuters, Shanghai, 25th] The funeral of Chen Lu, the former foreign minister of the puppet "Nanjing Reformed Government," who was assassinated and died on the 19th of this month, took place here yesterday in a very peculiar manner. Police officers from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the puppet "Great Way Municipal Government" under Japanese control, as well as British and Japanese troops, were all mobilized to prevent disturbances. Chen's body was carried in a hearse, traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour, crossing the concessions. Relatives and friends followed in cars, escorted by concession police in the two concessions, and by Great Way puppet police and Japanese troops outside the concessions, to reach the public cemetery in western Shanghai.

### Aircraft Wreckage Found Near Lanzhou; All Eight Aircraft Were Made in Italy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to authoritative sources, in the air battle over Lanzhou on the 20th of this month, our air force displayed great prowess and shot down nine aircraft. Six of them were found in the vicinity of Lanzhou, and the remaining three were discovered in Jingyu County. It was determined that the aircraft shot down were Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s, twin-engine aircraft capable of carrying seven people and 1,250 kilograms of bombs, with one fixed machine gun in the front and two movable machine guns in the rear. Furthermore, one aircraft shot down in Luoyang last month on the 24th of the previous month resulted in the capture of their captain, Eiji Sugita, and the recovery of his bombing orders, which detailed the bombing targets as: first, military barracks; and second, city street houses. This shows that the Japanese deliberately bombed undefended cities and innocent civilians, which provides strong evidence of this.

### President Kong Presented the Political Report for March at the National参政会; Progress in Both Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] President Kong presented a political report at the third session of the National参政会, the original text is recorded as follows:

Since the adjournment of the second meeting of your esteemed assembly, much has evolved in the international situation during these past three months, and there has also been considerable progress in all domestic administration. This is, of course, what everyone is extremely concerned about. The heads of the various responsible agencies will all come to the meeting to report on the details. I will now give only a general review and briefly explain the policy guidelines for the future for your reference.

Regarding the international situation, the first thing I want to explain is the evolution of the international situation towards us. Now, the governments and peoples of friendly nations have a clearer understanding of the purpose and spirit of our sacred war of resistance, and therefore, the sympathy and assistance they provide us is even more active. This is the most gratifying thing in the past three months. The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council resolved to continue to provide us with moral support. In addition to the Soviet Union continuously providing us with much assistance in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Treaty and the resolutions of previous meetings, the United Kingdom and the United States have been particularly strong in their assistance to us. The United States has bought a lot of our silver in the past to help us maintain the legal currency policy, and recently, they and the United Kingdom have successively established commercial loans with our country. I believe that everyone will be as grateful to the friendly countries as the government is for this profound expression of friendship. I would like to solemnly tell everyone that the government is continuing to find ways to develop trade between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to eliminate all difficulties, and to further advance the economic and commercial relations between us and the friendly countries.

Since November 3 last year, when your esteemed assembly was in session, the Japanese government issued a statement. On December 19, Arita spoke to foreign reporters, and on December 22, Konoe gave a broadcast speech. Based on the previous statement, he put forward more specific conditions. The ambition and hideous face of the [Japanese] to conquer China and dominate East Asia have now been completely exposed. Our supreme leader gave a stern rebuttal at the memorial week of the Premier on December 26, stating our position. On December 31, the U.S. government continued the first note in October and sent a second protest note to the Japanese government. On January 14 and 19 this year, the British and French governments also sent protest notes to the Japanese government, taking the same steps as the United States. The U.S. protest note firmly upholds the effectiveness of the Nine-Power Treaty, expressing two important points: First, the United States formally declares that China's political independence, sovereignty, and integrity are inseparable from the open-door policy. No country in the world can maintain an open-door policy if it loses its independence and sovereignty. Those of us who study modern world history know that the U.S.'s consistent policy of maintaining security in the Pacific is based on the premise that China's independence and the open door policy complement each other. The United States re-declared this historically inevitable trend and the meaning of the Nine-Power Treaty to the world in simple and clear words, which has already had a great impact on world opinion. Second, the United States believes that existing treaties can be modified and adjusted through international consultations, but cannot allow unilateral abolition or destruction. The international status quo is not forever immutable, but to change the status quo, it must be done according to legal procedures. The notes of the British, American, and French are based entirely on justice, so in principle, we agree with them. Some people believe that the countries of the world can be divided into two factions: those who maintain the status quo and those who revise the status quo. This view is specious. In fact, the division in the international community is only between two propositions: to amend treaties through peaceful consultation, or to destroy treaties through military aggression. The difference between these two approaches is very great, because it is related to the future of human civilization and happiness. Our answer has already been announced to the world. We are willing to promote all peaceful consultations with the most sincere and reasonable attitude, but peaceful consultations are not without scope. Problems related to national survival and national independence must never be the object of negotiation. As for military aggression, we will resist it and we will resist it to the end.

The Japanese first used force to create a new situation, and then said that the existing treaties were not suitable. If this trend is not stopped, international credibility will not be established.

### Central Committee Member Pan Yunchao Dies from Serious Injuries

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th] Central Committee Member Pan Yunchao was injured in a car accident on the 19th and was hospitalized. He eventually died of his injuries this morning at 5:00 AM. His last words were that no obituary should be issued after his death, and that cremation should be carried out, eliminating all unnecessary waste.

### Under Military Politics, the Japanese Live a Hard Life, Forced to Save and Raise War Funds, Reduced Clothing and Food, Unspeakable Suffering

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Tokyo News. In order to raise war funds, Japan is currently implementing two major principles of thrift: (1) eat less; (2) do not buy new clothes. The Japanese government relies on this to sell government bonds. Last year, Japanese national savings reached 5.3 billion yen, and the total amount of government bonds issued due to the China Incident was 3.6 billion yen. This year, the Japanese budget reached 10 billion yen, so the government is urging the people to practice thrift. The impact of inflation is already being felt in Japan, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. For example, a bundle of charcoal that used to cost only 80 sen has now risen to 1.90 yen. Rice prices have risen by 10 percent, and fish prices have risen by several percent. Ordinary people can no longer afford meat. Such high prices may seem insignificant in Britain and the United States, but for an average Japanese family with two children and a monthly income of only 50 yen, the impact is enormous. A certain magazine listed a budget for a family with a monthly income of 50 yen, in which food accounted for about 11 yen per month, i.e. 70 sen per day for a family of four, or 20 sen per person. Of these 20 sen, 10 sen goes to buying rice. Rice is expensive, and 10 sen per day is usually not enough. As for the types of food, soybeans, radishes, vegetables, soy sauce, and salted fish are included.

### Yunnan Party and Government Joint Meeting Resolved to Strengthen Grassroots Work

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 24th] Yunnan held its first joint meeting of the Party and government today, deciding to strengthen grassroots work. Including the current county party branches, it plans to promote party affairs in sixty counties, in order to integrate the people with the Party and government.

### Hengyang Cloaked in War Robes

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Hengyang is where the Xiang-Gui Railway and the Yue-Han Railway connect. It is also a hub of southwest transportation, and its strategic importance is self-evident. Although at this stage, Wuhan at the northern end of the Yue-Han Railway and Guangzhou at the southern end have unfortunately fallen into the hands of the enemy, like two ends of a lifeline being poisoned, its reserve force – the Xiang-Gui Railway – remains intact. Especially the Xiang-Qian Railway, which connects with the Yue-Han Railway at Zhuzhou north of Hengyang, will soon be open to traffic to Zhijiang on the border of Hunan. They are all arteries with vigorous blood flow, which can continuously transport countless white blood cells at any time to swallow the toxins in the two ends of the Yue-Han Railway and other lost areas, so as to remove corruption and promote tissue regeneration, and complete the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country.

Hengyang is an important city, and it goes without saying that the enemy wants to "get it and be satisfied." Since gun and artillery power cannot reach it, they often use airplanes to wreak havoc. The most severe were the two consecutive nights of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the 15th and 16th of last year, when they came to Hengyang in batches to wreak havoc, dropping hundreds of bombs in the Beidou and Xiaoximen areas, burning dozens of civilian houses, and causing about four or five hundred civilian casualties. Our air force rose up to fight back and shot down five enemy planes one after another, two of which fell on the county, and the wreckage has been recovered. Although the two railway tracks and bridges were also bombed, the railway workers recognized the importance of transportation responsibilities and worked bravely day and night, always repairing them as soon as they were damaged. Although everyone knows that it will be bombed again after it is repaired, everyone would rather endure the hardship and repair it so that the train can pass that day. If it is bombed again tomorrow, it might as well be repaired again. This spirit of perseverance is admirable. The reporter moved from outside the city to inside the city. The rain had just cleared, and the road was still muddy. I heard two air raid sirens in a row, but the air defense equipment was quite good. Just follow the street signs and run to the air-raid shelter. At the same time, there were police and the Three People's Principles Youth Corps guiding the way, so the order was also very good. The service groups organized by the government and society here, such as the battlefield service members of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, the battlefield service teams of the political departments of the various military groups and divisions, the Hengyang All-Circles Anti-Japanese Committee sub-groups undertaking condolences and providing tea and water, as well as the wounded soldier reception centers set up by railway employees or Christian churches, are truly like bamboo shoots after a rain, too numerous to mention. The Hengyang Anti-Japanese Committee held public performances of new and old dramas to raise money for wounded soldiers' quilts, using the ticket sales income to purchase them. The participating theater troupes included the 8th Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the 1st Traveling Drama Education Team of the Ministry of Education, the 2nd Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe, the 1st Film Projection Team of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the 2nd Hunan Opera Troupe, the Changsha Children's Drama Troupe, the Changsha Mobile Theater Troupe III, and the Hengyang July 7th Theater Troupe, etc., more than ten groups in total. They all worked hard, one after another, and brought out their best plays. They performed for ten consecutive days, and almost every day was wonderful, and every day was sold out. However, the ticket price was set low (a high price might not be easy to sell), and the total income for ten days was only two thousand and hundreds of yuan, plus donations of only more than four thousand yuan, which could eventually make more than five hundred quilts; but it is really difficult. They have all risked their lives on the front line for the country and the nation, and now they come down with honorable injuries, and they still have to suffer from the cold in the icy and snowy weather. If our compatriots in the rear—especially in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Nanyang—who can still live a warm life do not continue to donate generously to save these experienced soldiers and allow them to recover as soon as possible and return to the front line to eliminate the enemy, how can we feel at ease!

This urban area of Hengyang, which straddles both sides of the Xiang River, is like a woman wearing a fashionable war robe. Anyone who passes in front of her must salute her. However, there are exceptions. The reporter did not salute her, but regarded her as a female warrior team equipped in a position neither too far forward nor too far back, and inspected her once in a "parade" manner. I think her moving lineup can be described as follows:

First, let's start with the outline of her head—the city: The urban area covers an area of about sixteen square li, the city circumference is more than seven li, and there are seven city gates. The south gate is called Huiyan; the southeast gate is called Yuejiang, commonly known as Tielumen; the east gate is called Yingri, commonly known as Chaibudou; the northeast gate is called Xiaoxiang; the west gate is called Anxi, commonly known as Daximen; the northwest gate is called Wanghu, commonly known as Xiaoximen; the north gate is called Zhanyue (Yue is Hengshan), all of which are elegant and meaningful. There are 100 and some odd pillboxes around the city, and there are more than 300 in the whole county. In addition, there are tens of thousands of tightly organized self-defense teams in various townships and towns, all eager to try and looking forward to the arrival of the battle to shed some blood and sweat for the country and the nation.

The reporter entered the city through Daximen. There were two soldiers holding guns horizontally, guarding and watching, with a very heroic demeanor. There was also a traffic policeman holding a red flag, directing the entry and exit of cars. Nearby, there were also solid air-raid shelters for passers-by to avoid air raids. After entering the city and walking straight, it was not long before I arrived at the post office. At that time, the three places for selling tickets and sending registered express letters were all crowded with people. According to Mr. , the person in charge of the 'Information Desk', this was originally a second-class bureau, but the recent postal service has exceeded that of a first-class bureau. The staff has also doubled compared to before, but in fact, it is still not enough to cope with it.

Soon to the main street crossing, there are two standard restaurants facing each other, one called "Hao Gongdao". It is said that it moved from Shanghai, and for every meal, two corners and five cents, you can eat "quite full" of meat, vegetables, and rice. It is so civilianized, which is not bad. But the Fujian restaurant across the street, which advertises "all female service," and the sign is written in red and green, is a bit "out of time." The restaurant has three floors. The middle and lower floors sell set meals, five corners and five cents a meal. If you eat a la carte, the price is also more expensive. The third floor specializes in a la carte, and the price is extremely high. It is impossible to eat rice without spending three or four dollars, but what you eat is not delicious food, but just having a female waiter to accompany you to drink. According to a waiter on the second floor, angrily said: "The male waiter's monthly salary is only ten yuan, the head chef's is eighteen yuan, and the rent is only thirty-six yuan, but the female waiter's salary is as high as seventy yuan, which is too unfair!" He looked up at the entrance of the third floor and continued: "If you don't tease her, she teases you—just for more tips. At the same time, there are many civil servants who like this set. At this time, it is too much to spend money like dirt!" This is not entirely out of jealousy, but it is very reasonable. In addition, there are two or three large-scale restaurants and hotels that advertise with female waiters. Even if the government is inconvenient to passively prohibit them from operating, it should actively levy national salvation donations from them. The slogan of "improving the lives of soldiers" that has been chanted for a long time, if everyone thinks it is very valuable, but it is just that the funds are limited and difficult to implement; then we might as well adopt the method of praising the few and benefiting the many, and first reduce the special expenses or office expenses of senior military and political personnel, and use them as one source of funds to improve the lives of soldiers. At the same time, this is still two "radical" methods to curb waste by senior civil servants!

Walking to the crossroads, I took "asking for directions" as an excuse to climb the police's guard station and look around: The east road slopes down, and the Xiang River is outside Yuejiangmen; the street is full of rice loads, and each yuan can buy 18 to 20 kilograms of white rice. The north-south main street, also known as the main road, the shops and stores are all western-style buildings of four or five stories high. Banks, bookstores, cloth shops, silk shops, department stores, etc., are mostly arranged side by side on this street. In the middle of the road, there are cars and horses like dragons, and people are bustling on both sides. Its prosperity and liveliness can be compared with the second and third-class roads in Shanghai.

Indeed, the population of Hengyang is very developed. According to the Ministry of Interior's survey in the 18th year of the Republic of China, there are more than 1,366,000 people in the entire county, and the urban population accounts for 150,000. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan were successively lost and the fire in Changsha, according to Mr. Liu Xingyi, the secretary of the county government, the urban area has now surged to 300,000 people. The government pays five silver dollars a day to the strong men who help the army transport goods. Whether it is hundreds or thousands, they can be recruited as needed and arrive as soon as they are called. There are also more than 500 people who regularly serve the army every day. This seems to be a greater contribution of manpower than any other county. If the population is not dense, it would certainly be difficult to do. However, although the population of Hengyang is so dense, as soon as an air raid siren is heard, everyone can hide without a trace in an instant.

Going north from the main street and turning east to "Yingri Gate", take a boat across the "Jiangdong Shore". The Xiang River is as blue as the Gui River, but the water volume, depth, and riverbed are several times larger than the Gui River. At the docks on both sides, wooden signs are inserted, stating that each boat carries ten people and charges two cents per person. There are also many civilian houses on the east bank of the river, mostly living along the river. Along the river, I turned south again and came to a road connecting the city to the Yue-Han Railway Station. There were also many noodle shops and hotels, mostly opened by people from Beiping and Henan. At this end of the road leading to the city, there is a large sandy beach under the bank. Some people are singing "Suzhou Ballads", showing "Magic Lanterns", and setting up various games and small gambling activities, attracting many wounded soldiers in gray cotton robes with red crosses sewn on them, to hang out and linger there. This seems to be a natural club for wounded soldiers, but what they enjoy is meaningless. Regarding this, I can only appeal to the propaganda teams gathered in the city.

From here, across the river into the city, there is a pontoon bridge made of seventy or eighty civilian boats, which can be freely passed without charge. The civilian boats are sealed by the government and given a daily living allowance per person; if there are military transport ships going up and down the river, they can be opened to let them pass.

At that time, a train had just transported a batch of wounded soldiers from the front line across the bridge to the shore to wait for assembly. Some of the clothes and quilts they were wearing were really broken and tattered, but they were still clutching warm coppers and stretching out their shivering hands to spend five cents to buy a newspaper from a news vendor. They had just shed blood for the country and the nation, and now they were enduring hunger and cold to buy a newspaper to read. This enthusiasm for caring about the war situation and national affairs moved me to tears at that time!

When I was about to walk to the south gate, I saw that the battlefield service group of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs had set up a wounded soldier reception center, where a pot of porridge was cooked, probably to be given to this group of wounded soldiers. At the same time, the stretcher team of the Hengyang People's Anti-Japanese Committee was also dispatched in full force and rushed across the river. It can be seen that there must still be some seriously wounded soldiers who could not move at the station!

In short, this woman of the times who has already put on war robes—Hengyang—although her local voice, color, and actions are not yet entirely like the "preparing for war" demeanor that a true warrior should have, after all, she is arming herself. It is hoped that those who are engaged in political work will actively equip her again, especially paying attention to the evacuation of the old and weak population in the urban area and the propaganda and organization of the people in the countryside, so that she can immediately progress and become a truly awe-inspiring and murderous combat soldier!

### Franco Government: England and France to Recognize Immediately; French House Passes Vote of Confidence; Spanish President to Resign and Leave France

[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 25th Dispatch] According to sources within the Franco government, after the formal recognition of the Franco government by Western powers, France will implement planned efforts to enable its industry and commerce to regain their former position in the Spanish market. It is expected that the French munitions industry will propose negotiations with Spain to supply large quantities of iron sulfide. Political circles here believe that the Franco government will insist on retrieving Spanish Bank gold, artistic treasures, and military materials stored in France as a condition for restoring normal Franco-Spanish commercial relations.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th Dispatch] French Prime Minister Daladier reported to the National Assembly this afternoon that the authorities will take concrete steps to formally recognize the Spanish government on the 27th of this month. At that time, a meeting of cabinet members will be convened to decide on this matter. In response to external comments, Daladier said, "The security of our third border has been declared. France has no less than six hundred kilometers of border with the Franco government. The reason why I advocate that the French government should maintain friendly relations with the true government of Spain is precisely for this reason. Today, the true government of Spain is the Franco government." After Daladier's speech, the House of Representatives immediately passed a vote of confidence by a vote of 323 to 261. Daladier concluded, "I firmly believe that France should not be isolated from Spanish affairs, just as it should not be isolated from any other part of the world. This is not a matter of partisan policy, but a matter of French security." At this time, the entire assembly applauded greatly.

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that if the French cabinet agrees to Daladier's recommendation to recognize Franco's policy, the British government will take similar action on the same day. It is expected that Chamberlain will announce this move to the House of Commons at the same time as Daladier. London believes that France's decision indicates that negotiations between France and Franco have come to an end, and believes that the situation in Spain has been settled and that the government army's resistance will not continue. The whereabouts of Spanish Prime Minister Negrín are currently unknown. It is widely believed that he is still near Valencia and will soon leave the country. According to information obtained here, almost only Negrín in the Spanish government advocates continuing the resistance. The conditions for recognizing the Franco government are still unknown to all parties. The exchange of views between the French representative Bérard and the British representative Hodgson should gradually clarify the situation. Franco has notified Hodgson of Mussolini's promise to withdraw Italian troops. Authoritative sources recalled that Franco had stated that he wanted Spanish troops to occupy Minorca completely, and Franco had repeatedly assured British representatives that after ruling Spain, he would not pursue anyone except criminals. They expressed satisfaction with this. It is widely believed that Franco's hope to maintain friendly relations between France and Spain is no less than that of France. Furthermore, after the end of the Spanish war, Franco must immediately carry out long-term construction and pacification of the region. Britain and France are better able to assist Franco than other countries, because the financial resources of other countries are not as good as those of Britain and France.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, Spanish President Azaña will submit his resignation when Britain and France formally recognize the Franco government and leave French territory. It has just been learned that the Mexican government has notified General Miaja, the leader of the government army, that if he is not tolerated in Spanish territory, Mexico is willing to welcome him as a guest of honor.

Attlee's Speech Criticizes Chamberlain's Policies, Advocates Increasing Confidence in the Soviet Union and the United States

[Associated Press, Birmingham, 25th Dispatch] British Labour Party leader Attlee recently delivered a speech here criticizing Chamberlain, stating, "We only have two paths to choose from, namely surrender or war. Prime Minister Chamberlain should express greater confidence in the Soviet Union. The country abides by treaties and is a friend of peace. I hope the Prime Minister will increase confidence in the people of the United States and other places and not rely on the deceptive promises of those who specialize in breaking treaties. It is inappropriate for the Prime Minister to express trust in dictators. We have clearly recognized the Spanish rebel government, but this government is the one that killed our sailors, sank our ships, and bombed women and children. The Prime Minister talks about peace but encourages illegal actions everywhere, claims to believe in democracy but is friends with thugs."

[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 25th Dispatch] It was announced here last night that the number of people captured during the attack on Catalonia reached 110,235, of which 100,000 have been transported back to the Spanish mainland, and more than 8,000 wounded soldiers are still staying in Catalan hospitals. According to the Franco government's radio station, former Catalan Governor Gabolillo has been expelled from the party by the Masque Party headquarters. Reliable sources have also received news here that serious incidents have occurred in the city of Murcia under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government. It is reported that officials from the French consulate were detained, but the details are unknown. There are rumors that General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Republican government army, is also related to the detention of French consular officials.

### Ciano Arrives in Warsaw Unexpectedly to Entice Participation in German-Italian Axis; Poland Resolves to Maintain Political Independence

[Reuters, Warsaw, 25th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife, Polish Ambassador Drohosz, and many others arrived in Warsaw at 12:18 this afternoon. Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Italian Ambassador Valentino welcomed them at the station. Polish veterans lined up in front of the station to salute. Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife will stay at the Belweder Palace. This afternoon, Ciano will pay tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Beck will host a banquet in the evening.

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 24th Dispatch] According to sources here, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive here tomorrow to conduct diplomatic talks with the Polish government. A Polish government spokesman told an Associated Press reporter today that Poland's foreign policy has already been decided. It is willing to maintain friendly relations with the German-Italian axis, but Poland is unwilling to give up its independent and free sovereignty, so it is determined to resist the forces that entice it to participate in the axis. Poland is an important factor in determining the overall situation in the Middle East, so its foreign policy must be prudent. At present, Poland is willing to maintain friendly relations with all friendly countries, regardless of Germany, Italy, Britain, or France, without being partial. Otherwise, if it only attaches itself to one side, Poland will lose its importance in determining the European situation.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Dispatch] Diplomatic circles here declare that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Warsaw this time to conduct talks with the Polish authorities may not be able to induce the country to join the Berlin-Rome axis. The country's non-participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact has already been confirmed without a doubt. Although it recently recognized the Spanish Nationalist Army government as legitimate, the government immediately declared that this was a de facto recognition, which is very different from the ideological preferences of Germany and Italy. Political circles here also say that Poland is determined to maintain political independence at any cost. The country also has close relations with Romania. Ciano's intention is to urge the country to sever diplomatic relations with Romania and give up its unwillingness to the situation in Southeastern Europe. In a nutshell, Ciano wants to win Poland over to join the German-Italian axis, using Germany's temporary non-advance eastward as bait. Poland's transfer of Germany's attention to temporarily prevent it from advancing eastward, although possible, the countries of the Balkan Entente (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece) are united and strong, and their total military strength is no less than seven million, which should not be underestimated. Although these countries maintain good relations with Germany and Italy on the surface, in fact, no country has 100% goodwill towards totalitarian countries. The same is true in Poland. From this, it can be seen that even if Germany and Italy act rashly, they may not succeed, and it is expected that they will not dare to take the risk. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the competent authorities here all believe that no matter how hard Ciano tries this time, the Polish government will still maintain a neutral attitude and refuse to take sides.

### Anglo-German Economic Conference to Be Held Next Month; Ashton Returns to London Yesterday to Report on Negotiations

[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch] Ashton, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, stayed in Berlin for a week to prepare for the Anglo-German economic conference. He also had a long conversation with General Göring, the person in charge of Germany's Four-Year Plan. Today, Ashton will return to London to report his impressions to the government and Minister of Commerce Stanley. During his stay in Germany, Ashton met with General Göring several times, as well as German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Minister of Economy and President of the German Bank Funk, Director of the German Bank Puhl, and many German industrial and economic experts. According to Washington's commentators, the Anglo-German economic conference will be held in Berlin next month. This news proves that the crisis of war in Europe is very small.

### Arab and Jewish Representatives to Not Talk Directly for Now; Indirect Talks to Resume Tomorrow; Britain to Propose Constitutional Issues

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Arab, Jewish, and British government representatives continued their meeting for half an hour today and decided that the Arab and Jewish sides will not adopt direct talks for the time being and will make a decision after the representatives of both sides report to the entire delegation. All parties are quite satisfied with this decision. The indirect talks mediated by the British government are scheduled to resume on the 27th. According to people from the conference, the purpose of the recent trilateral talks is to make it easier for the Arab and Jewish sides to understand each other, and not to urge both sides to get closer immediately. In order to facilitate the reports of the Arab and Jewish representatives to the entire delegation, the Anglo-Arab talks originally scheduled for Saturday this week have been postponed to next Monday morning, and the Anglo-Jewish talks have been changed to the afternoon of the same day. It is reported that the British government will propose positive proposals on constitutional issues, immigration, and land sales in this meeting. These proposals will only be in outline and not in detail, as a basis for continued discussion.

### Hungary Joins Anti-Comintern Pact; National Socialist Party Dissolved Simultaneously

[Reuters, Budapest, 24th Dispatch] Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky, on behalf of Hungary, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact today. After the signing ceremony, the Hungarian Foreign Minister said that Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact is due to Hungary's continued struggle against Bolshevism for the past twenty years and is also the result of Hungary's friendship with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Since 1919, Hungary has participated in the struggle against the Comintern's intervention in international affairs. This agreement is not intended to oppose any country, but is a self-defense tool to oppose foreign undue interference in the internal affairs of the signatory countries. The methods of action of the Comintern are emerging one after another and are very powerful because they belong to an international nature. Therefore, we want to prevent it, and countries must cooperate. Then the German Ambassador to Hungary replied, expressing welcome to Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, saying that this move proves the friendly relations between Hungary and other signatory countries. He also expressed satisfaction with Hungary's participation in the struggle against the disruptive work of the Comintern and its loyalty to its historical mission of maintaining order and peace.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 25th Dispatch] Hungary's National Socialist Party has recently been dissolved by order. This happened at the same time that the Hungarian government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which is quite noteworthy. According to observers, Hungary's move is actually intended to reduce Germany's "adverse reactions." Hungary's move will not have a major impact on relations with Germany, because Hungary's National Socialist Party has no relationship with the German Socialist Party.

[Associated Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Political circles here were quite surprised after the news of the Hungarian government's dissolution of the National Socialist Party reached here. At the same time, Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Warsaw on official business, which is noteworthy.

### Pope's Will Unsealed

[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th Dispatch] The will of Pope Pius XI was unsealed today. The contents briefly stated that all items received during his papacy should be transferred to his successor. As for the handling of his private property, a separate will was drawn up to be given to his family and his followers, and any surplus should be allocated for charitable purposes. However, the total amount of the Pope's wealth is still unknown.

### Crossing the Mediterranean: German Plane Crash

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th] According to official announcements today, a German plane, while crossing the Mediterranean from Arras, suddenly crashed. The plane and all crew members were unable to survive. However, detailed circumstances are currently unknown.

### Soviet Pravda Praises the Great Red Army as a Fortress of World Peace: Neither Intimidates nor Is Intimidated

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Moscow Dispatch: This month, on the 23rd, the Soviet people celebrated the 21st anniversary of the glorious Red Army and Red Navy. That evening, Soviet public organizations and representatives of various Red Army units jointly held grand celebrations in Moscow, Kyiv, Boli, Vladivostok, Kunish Gan Kharkov, and other cities. All Soviet newspapers published numerous articles discussing the history and heroic past of the Red Army. The Pravda editorial "Ever-Victorious Red Army" stated, "Twenty-one years ago, various foreign imperialists attempted to take advantage of the weakness of the newly established Soviet Republic's army, but a strong domestic revolutionary movement arose to counter the enemies' foolish attempts. Thus, our glorious Red Army, created by Lenin and Stalin during the war, grew stronger year by year as its national defense capabilities became increasingly consolidated. The Red Army celebrates its 21st birthday with first-class military strength. The Red Army is famous for its many heroic victories and is deeply loved by all the Soviet people. The Red Army is the army of victorious socialism and an army that serves the people. Its steadfast strength expands infinitely. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has created a new type of soldier, unprecedented in history. Today, the Red Army and Navy take an oath, and from its resolute words, a typical soldier of a socialist country can emerge. This soldier is trained in loyalty and bravery and dedicates his entire life to the motherland. The anniversary of the Red Army is a day of celebration for our entire people and the working masses of the world. The Red Army and Navy are deeply imbued with the spirit and sentiment of internationalism. In all capitalist countries, there are many friends of the Red Army. All workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals are friends of the Red Army. They deeply know that the Red Army is a fortress of world peace, neither intimidating nor being intimidated. ×××××××××××, the sympathy of the world proletariat is the backing of the Red Army.”

### The Sino-Japanese War and the Anti-Comintern Pact

— Translated by Shi Chang; Original by ASIATICUS. Published in the January issue of Asia-America Magazine.

When Japan planned to conquer China, it often calculated future "great wars," even thinking of a series of linked "great wars." However, the unity of the Chinese military and civilians in a long-term resistance war, thus causing a "great war," was an insult to Japan. Japan's military preparations were aimed at attacking the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Only these three countries were worthy of being enemies in the "great war" with Japan for hegemony in the Pacific and Asia. Japan believed that China's resistance war could be dealt with using special techniques of "local incidents" and "short-term punitive wars." Its main strategic consideration was how to avoid interference from the great powers. It seemed indifferent to China's strong resistance war. Japan believed that establishing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy was very beneficial because this could prevent interference from the great powers in the Sino-Japanese incident, cover up the truth of the invasion, and implement the plan to save the two continents of Europe and Asia from the scourge of "communism." Japan's purpose in attacking the Soviet Union could be used as an excuse to quickly promote monopolizing the Chinese market. After monopolizing the Chinese market, the Far East would become a huge economic base, which would be very helpful for attacking the Soviet Union. This is natural. At the same time, it could also conveniently attack Britain and the United States.

Japan hoped to benefit from the aggressive actions of Germany and Italy in Europe and the Mediterranean. Similarly, Hitler and Mussolini also believed that Japan's actions in the Far East were beneficial to them because Japan could force Britain and the United States to pay attention to the threat of war in the Far East. At the same time, it could also make the Soviet Union station elite troops and stockpile abundant raw materials in Siberia. The policies of Germany and Italy were aimed at changing the balance of power in Europe but not engaging in actual war with the British, French, and Soviet bloc (likely supported by the United States). This was related to Japan's ideal of controlling the balance of power in the Pacific. Therefore, Hitler created a Greater German Reich in Eastern and Central Europe, Mussolini turned the Mediterranean into an Italian lake, and Japan wanted to control the economically and politically linked Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" group. After this, they would have a better advantage for attacking the Soviet Union. At the same time, Germany, Italy, and Japan could further threaten all "neutral" countries, preparing for the final control of the world and the division of the world. Japan could then seize possessions and interests in the South Pacific belonging to countries such as ××, Annam, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands!

It is very clear that Japan's plan for China must be implemented quickly. This is absolutely crucial for the entire plan to control the world. Japan can only defeat China, make the Chinese government surrender, and join the Anti-Comintern Pact to use ordinary traitors to establish a puppet regime and indirectly govern China. Under such circumstances, important ports would lose their superior position, the interests of Britain, the United States, and France would be greatly damaged, gradually leading to extinction. At the same time, Japan's position would be able to threaten Singapore—the gateway to the British Empire in Asia—and be able to establish a military security line isolating China and the Soviet Union. This is equally important for Mussolini and Hitler.

Japan's deep war, unable to achieve a swift victory, cannot but use a large number of troops, and cannot retain main force troops, can intimidate the world, threatening the Soviet Union and other powers, and the dream of a short-term conquest of China, has already become a delayed "great war," and this is enough to make Japan feel terrible. Moreover, Germany and Italy do not need this kind of great war. Furthermore, the resolute resistance of the entire Chinese nation has forced Japan to concentrate most of its military and financial resources in North China, Inner Mongolia, part of the Northwest, the Yangtze River basin, and the coastal areas. Currently, we cannot see any signs of a cessation of the war. Millions of Japanese troops cannot defeat the Chinese regular army, cannot stop the activities of the Chinese guerrillas to protect the growing transportation lines, and cannot suppress the resistance of patriotic Chinese in the "occupied" areas. Japan's temporary victory cannot eliminate the danger of failure and collapse. This is not only Japan's disaster but also the disintegration of the entire Anti-Comintern Pact.

The Anti-Comintern Pact has not been successful in Europe either. Although Czechoslovakia was slaughtered, Britain and France, and even the United States, have shamefully acquiesced to the aggression of Germany and Italy in Spain, without providing material support to the Spanish government. Here, the question of time is the most important. Italy can be said to have failed because it could not achieve a swift victory in Spain.

Brief Commentary

### The Case of Japanese Planes Bombing the New Territories

The incident of Japanese planes bombing Luohu in the New Territories of Hong Kong is a completely planned ×××× by Japanese aggressors, and it is one of the separate manifestations of the same attempt as occupying Hainan Island and competing for the concessions in Shanghai. If this act is not met with the most severe protest and sanctions, the future harm will be ×××××××××! Regarding this point, the British government naturally recognizes it clearly.

Currently, this matter is being negotiated between the Japanese and British sides in Tokyo and×××××××. The Japanese side is completely following the planned program of using "accidental bombing" and "apology" to cover up its crime of destroying Hong Kong territory ××××××××. The British side naturally cannot be satisfied with this, so the negotiations have not made any progress.

In order to ensure the safety of Hong Kong and the status of Britain in the Far East, this type of incident will never happen again: (2) Effectively guarantee that British air transport in the Far East will not be subjected to any obstruction or attack: (3) Extensively compensate for the losses of this incident.

However, recent history proves that any guarantees and promises of fascist aggressors are most unreliable—therefore, this request must be realized with actual strength. The first is to strengthen Hong Kong and British military facilities in the Far East, especially to rapidly increase the strength of the Far East Air Force: The second is to quickly discuss methods of close cooperation with France and the United States to prevent aggression: the third is to step up cooperation with our country to defend the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Vietnamese transport, and at the same time develop Sino-British, French and American sky transport.

British interests are inseparable from the interests of China and all democratic and peaceful countries. Only by abandoning all policies of compromise with aggressors, only by intensifying the solidarity and assistance of democratic and peaceful countries, and only by bravely resisting aggressors in our country, can there be the most powerful guarantee.

### New Mission for Christians

The Hong Kong Association of the Chinese Christian Church in Guangdong has scheduled a joint worship service for members of the church from various regions of the mainland in Hong Kong today at 2:00 p.m. at the Wan Chai Methodist Church to pray for the national crisis. There will also be a report on frontline rescue work and a speech by the head of the youth service corps accompanying the army. We have a few words to say after seeing this news.

In recent times, the crazy atrocities of the Eastern and Western fascist aggressors have promoted and expanded the world war, killing human beings, destroying civilization, and insulting religion. This is something that angers everyone in the world, let alone Christians who have a glorious history and a great mission. Since the September 18th Incident, and especially since the start of the all-out war of resistance on August 13th, Chinese church members have sacrificed for the national crisis and served for the war of resistance. The greatness of their performance has been seen not only by the people of the country but also praised by the world. Among them, the most commendable are the organization of service corps accompanying the army, frontline rescue teams, comforting teams for wounded soldiers and refugees, and the extensive mobilization of the masses to go to the national crisis and relieve military disasters. Furthermore, the youth associations in various places hold current affairs lecture meetings, discussion meetings, organize national salvation propaganda teams, anti-Japanese choir groups, and perform dramas and sell items to raise donations for the country. These are all worthy of the greatest respect from patriotic compatriots across the country and righteous people in the world!

We hope that Christian church members can all recognize the true meaning of saving the motherland and saving the world, inherit the spirit of bravely facing difficulties and generously enlisting in the past, and unite even more to call on the masses to oppose the Japanese, German, and Italian aggressors who are plotting to destroy our motherland and destroy our world. The new mission is the most sacred, most solemn, and most urgent mission, and we must do everything possible and endure all hardships to complete it.

### Britain Will Send More Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Hong Kong for Defense

[Reuters, London, 24th] The British government is currently studying the report by British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, on his talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita (regarding the Japanese plane bombing incident in Hong Kong), as well as Japan's apology and promise of compensation and assurances that such incidents will not happen again. The British government considers the act of Japanese planes bombing British territory to be a very serious incident. Whether this incident can be considered over is a question that the British government is currently considering.

Forts Continue War Exercises, Light Control to Be Held Next Month

Furthermore, the British military authorities are paying close attention to this incident. To guard against any eventuality, they have already instructed the Scottish troops in the New Territories to take self-defense actions when necessary. According to reporters, the fort defense forces in Hong Kong have also been ordered to practice shooting. The Baisha Island fort practiced the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the army authorities again ordered the fort to practice war for two days. Other forts will also continue to hold exercises. When the Baisha Island fort practiced yesterday, it was from 6:30 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The time today is from 12:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. During the exercise period, all ships are prohibited from traveling to and from. According to reporters, the air defense authorities, in view of the urgency of the current situation, will hold a light control exercise in mid-next month. It is also possible to hold it earlier within the possible scope. According to Western newspapers, in view of the urgency of the situation in the Far East, the British military authorities believe that the defense of the colonies of the Great British Empire must be strengthened under the cloud of war. Therefore, it has been decided to increase troops stationed in Hong Kong and Singapore when necessary, including the naval, land, and air forces.

× Plane Flew Over the Border Again, Dropping Absurd Leaflets Everywhere

According to the Tak Chee Daily, a × plane appeared again on the border of the New Territories yesterday (24th). The plane first soared near Shatoujiao in the Chinese territory and then flew towards Aotou Shenzhen. However, it did not drop bombs, only dropping absurd leaflets everywhere. Its route almost included the entire border of the New Territories, but there was no cross-border event. The border was as calm as usual yesterday. The number of refugees fleeing into the New Territories has greatly decreased. Regarding the incident of × planes bombing the New Territories yesterday (21st), the British diplomatic community recently stated that the British government did not pay much attention to it at first. After thoroughly investigating it, it was found that it was not comparable to an ordinary misunderstanding incident. It was considered more serious than initially observed. Through the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, repeatedly protesting to the ×× side, × Foreign Minister Arita has formally apologized to the British side and stated his willingness to compensate for the losses and impose appropriate punishment on those who overstepped the mark. However, the British side believes that the guarantees of preventing the same incident from happening again should have more practical and effective methods, and intends to insist on a more extensive scope of compensation for losses than currently planned.

### At the Annual Meeting of HSBC, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Reported That China's Financial Stability Is Due to the Government's Management of the Monetary System, Which Is Highly Praised: The Bank's Profits Reached 15 Million Yuan Last Year

The Shanghai HSBC Bank held its annual shareholders' meeting at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. Forty-nine people, including Chairman of the Board of Directors, Pearce, and shareholders, attended. First, the chairman proposed to approve the annual business report and delivered a concise speech, making a clear assessment of the financial trade and monetary system in the Far East. Pearce highly praised the Chinese government's handling of the repayment of tariff-backed loans and the appropriate management of the monetary system, and also praised the Chinese Customs staff's loyalty to their duties and calm response to emergencies.

Regarding China's financial situation, Pearce said that it has become stable. Although the wartime situation has had some impact on China's finances, the bumper harvest in the Northwest and the sharp increase in remittances from overseas Chinese have helped the Chinese government stabilize its finances. Part of this is due to good income and most of it is due to proper management. The Chinese government has stabilized its finances.

Regarding the business situation of HSBC Bank, Pearce believes that it can be described as satisfactory. Although there have been various difficulties in the past twelve months, the net profit still reached 15,529,621.32 yuan. 3,338,304.53 yuan was deposited last year. The profit distribution method was stipulated as a dividend of one shilling, two pence, and seven-eighths per share, for a total of 400,000 pounds. In addition to the dividend, there was a balance of 12,145,172.08 yuan.

### Fire in Tai Kok Tsui Yesterday Morning - Sixty Thatched Huts Destroyed - Two Thatched Huts Also Destroyed in Kowloon City

Between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM yesterday morning, fires broke out in two locations, Kowloon City and Mong Kok. In Kowloon City, two thatched houses were destroyed, while in Tai Kok Tsui, fifty refugee huts were reduced to ashes. Although the losses were not very heavy, the victims were all ordinary people. This sudden accident is truly tragic. Details of the fires in both locations are recorded separately below.

Kowloon City

At 1:55 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in a thatched house in Pak Ha Village, Kowloon City. The occupants of the house noticed the fire and immediately tried to put it out, but the fire had already grown and spread rapidly, making it impossible to control. They immediately sounded the alarm and reported to the fire station. The Mong Kok Fire Station dispatched the fourth, seventh, and three water tank trucks to the scene, while the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station also sent one truck to assist in the rescue. By this time, the fire had spread to neighboring houses. Fortunately, villagers assisted by fetching water to put out the fire. The fire was finally extinguished at around 2:00 AM. As a result, two thatched huts were burned down, resulting in a loss of several hundred dollars. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured.

Tai Kok Tsui

In addition, there is a large area of wasteland in Tai Kok Tsui, Mong Kok. Many poor laborers who cannot afford to rent houses live in thatched huts there. Consequently, there are over several hundred of these shanties. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in one of the shanties when a resident was burning incense and worshiping the gods in the early morning. During the worship, the palm leaf roof caught fire, and it quickly spread. The men and women in the house were unable to extinguish the flames and rushed to escape, shouting "Fire!" The entire shanty was quickly consumed by flames, and neighboring huts were also affected. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the fire spread rapidly with the wind, making it impossible to approach. The Mong Kok Fire Station and the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station, whose fire engines had just returned from Pak Ha Village, Kowloon City, received another report of the fire in Tai Kok Tsui and immediately rushed to put it out. When the fire engines arrived, they saw that about sixty thatched huts were already on fire. They opened several hoses and divided up the work to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at 5:00 AM, but the sixty thatched huts had already been reduced to ashes. The loss was over two thousand dollars. When the fire broke out, the escaping residents lamented that all their property had been destroyed in an instant, and they could not help but shed tears.

### Happy Valley's Great Merriment - Spring Racing Season Opens Yesterday

— Lang

Special dispatch from our newspaper! The annual five-day Spring Racing Season began yesterday.

Yesterday, even before 10:00 AM, many cars, trams, and buses were filled with passengers heading towards Happy Valley Racecourse. The trams and buses were extremely crowded, and many people, impatient to wait, set off on foot. The streets were filled with crowds of people surging eastward like a tide.

Happy Valley was packed with people, tens of thousands of spectators, old and young, rural and stylish, all came to join the fun. The women were dressed in red and green, adorned with flowers, walking around in groups, dazzling the eyes.

The grass in the center of the racecourse was still green, shining in the sunlight, contrasting beautifully with the white, magnificent grandstand and the colorful national flags.

Happy Valley, the entire Happy Valley, exuded an atmosphere of "happiness" in both its movement and stillness.

The clock in the grandstand pointed to 11:30 AM, and the first race, the "Fuzhou Cup Race," began amidst the clamor of voices. Everyone watched intently.

After 12:00 noon, because all the foreign firms, banks... had stopped working, more people came to watch the races. Strings of speeding cars brought batches of gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. The grandstand was full of people. The grandstand was also divided, with the so-called Members' Enclosure reserved for members of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Membership required an entrance fee of ten dollars and an annual fee of thirty-five dollars. Non-members had to be introduced by a member to enter the Members' Enclosure, with a daily fee of ten dollars for men and five dollars for women. The general public area charged a uniform admission fee of two dollars.

At 1:30 PM, after the end of the fifth race, the "Wong Nai Chung Race," an hour break was announced to allow the audience to have lunch. The spectators in the grandstand were busy going to the bar inside the hall. Holding expensive menus, they ordered dishes and asked for wine from the waiters. The general public outside the venue also flocked to nearby food stalls and vendors to find something to eat. Vendors selling fruits, candies... and snacks made a fortune.

During lunchtime, everyone was talking about "horse racing," of course. The 525,000 tickets sold for the one-dollar "Grand Sweepstakes" were the main topic of conversation. Everyone envied the first prize of over two hundred thousand dollars, and everyone longed for the arrival of the "Grand Sweepstakes Day" on the 27th. Everyone believed in their own good luck. They forgot everything else. In their minds, there were only horses, no, only money, horses are money!

At 3:30 PM, the sixth race began, and they were busy watching again. They were anxious for the horses, cheering for the horses, and also sighing for the horses. They were busy all day. Those who won money were elated, while those who lost money were dejected.

The first day of racing had twelve races. They were busy until after 6:00 PM before dispersing.

The Spring Racing Season lasts for five days. After the first day, there are still four days left: the 27th, 28th, March 1st, and 4th. During these four days, Happy Valley will be just as lively? Every day, tens of thousands of people come to chase, chasing after money.

Probably having money means happiness (?) In Happy Valley, there is money, and there are also women dressed luxuriously, there is eating, there is drinking, extravagant eating, extravagant drinking. There are cars, hundreds of luxurious new cars parked in the parking lot opposite the racecourse, as if holding a car exhibition. However, if you raise your head and look at the hills above Happy Valley, there are countless graves, tombstones, short monuments, all arranged in rows——

Money, women, eating, drinking, and graves, how ingenious! This simple picture symbolizes the entire life of the city.

They work hard and operate with a straightforward character, and have long held considerable important power in commerce and economy, bearing a long history. Their contributions in the cultural and educational fields have also been remarkable, but they lack organization, and their strength has not yet been concentrated. In order to "connect emotions, study academics, and jointly seek welfare for the motherland and hometown," the Chaozhou cultural figures in Hong Kong recently initiated the organization of the Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Society. Preparations have been completed, and a founding meeting was held at the English Capital Hotel at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon.

First, Chairman Wang Youjian announced the reasons for the meeting, then reported on the preparation process and passed the charter. Next, elections were held. The meeting concluded at around 4:00 PM. The results of the election show that the following were elected as executive committee members: Wang Youjian, Lin Tiantuo, Cai Chusheng, Chen Changwei, Luo Yinpu, Zhang Jiayan, etc. (7 people). The alternate committee members are: Zhang Dunde, Lu Fu, Lin Zishi, Cai Hansun, Wang Yongzai, etc. (4 people). Finally, the executive committee members mutually elected Lin Tiantuo as the chairman. Cai Chusheng, Luo Yinpu, and Chen Changwei will be in charge of the research department. Wang Youjian, Zhang Jiayan, and Wang Yongzai will be in charge of the general affairs department. The society stipulates that all Chaozhou compatriots residing in Hong Kong who have a passion for academic research, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, and who are willing to stand on academic grounds, work together, and enthusiastically seek welfare for the motherland and hometown, are eligible to be members of the society. After the society is established, it will regularly hold various academic research activities and various fitness training programs. Once the foundation is laid, it plans to focus on multi-faceted connections and mobilize fellow villagers living in various places to organize branch associations, so as to concentrate efforts towards the same goal.

### Clothes in Hong Kong

— Yu Gen

"There are no poor people in Hong Kong." You may have heard "Old Hong Kong" say that (?) This statement is made because the Hong Kong people of the middle class are very keen on maintaining appearances. Even if they have to go hungry, they still dress beautifully to adapt to the urban environment where "one respects the clothes first, then the person."

This statement seems to be true, especially in the past few days – the Lunar New Year holidays. We see that the men, women, and children crowded on both sides of the road are all dressed very grandly. Some are in Western suits, some are in Chinese gowns and jackets, colorful cheongsams, furry fur coats, all kinds of colors and styles, Chinese and Western, are all available. Judging from the clothes of the pedestrians, there really are no poor people in Hong Kong.

At home, men may wear only athletic vests, "cowboy shorts" (shorts), and wooden clogs, and women may wear only pajamas, shorts, or underwear, shorts, and red clogs. But when they go out, men are neatly dressed in suits and shiny leather shoes, and women are in cheongsams, high-heeled shoes, and dressed like blooming flowers.

Perhaps Hong Kong people have a particularly keen sense of the climate (?) Many people know that Hong Kong people wear clothes "before it gets cold, they feel the cold; before it gets hot, they feel the heat." In September and October, when the thermometer drops to only 60 degrees, Hong Kong people put on wool suits, coats, cotton robes, and fur robes. Some men even wear aviator leather coats with fur collars, and women wear tiger skin, leopard skin, and squirrel fur coats, looking like "Eskimos." They have turned Hong Kong into a place resembling the Arctic!

The temperature is also 60 degrees, but in March and April, it is very different. Women show off their thighs and arms, wearing breathable "Sea Tiger silk" and transparent "Cicada Wing yarn," revealing their backs vaguely. Men also wear silk, spinning, white sharkskin, linen and other summer clothes. The "Arctic" Hong Kong is now regarded as Honolulu, Hawaii, or Malaysia.

Hong Kong people are very diligent in pursuing new fashions. The new clothes of London and Paris quickly appear here. The reason is that many people learn new clothes from watching movies. For example, if the movie shown at the × Cinema today features Danny DePardieu's coat without buttons, tomorrow many Hong Kong ladies will learn to wear coats without buttons. If the movie shown today features Robert Taylor wearing a suit with many seams on the back, tomorrow many Hong Kong young masters will learn to wear suits with many seams.

Many foreigners have such a question about Hong Kong people's beautiful and exquisite clothes: how can people who earn only twenty or thirty dollars a month dress so luxuriously and beautifully? Let me tell you a little, the common people have good ways to maintain appearances. For example, when making a suit, they will not spend the entire month's salary on a set of thirty-odd dollar suits, and then tighten their belts and not eat. They have what is called a "suit savings club." The method is that ten or eight like-minded friends organize a savings club with five or ten dollars per share. Everything is the same as an ordinary savings club, but the cash obtained after the members bid on the shares is only used to "make suits."

Some speculative tailor shops have a payment plan to facilitate customers. A set of thirty-dollar clothes can be paid in six or four months. Recently, there have also been "mooncake savings clubs" run by grocery stores and "roasted meat savings clubs" run by preserved meat stores, and there are methods for organizing "suit savings clubs." These "suit savings clubs" require each member to pay a certain amount per month. In the summer and winter of that year, you can choose a set of suits designated by them each time... all kinds of methods are nothing more than to facilitate people with low incomes so that they do not have to take out a large sum of cash at once.

If you want to be more "economical," there is also the second-hand clothing store route. There are many second-hand clothing stores in the Upper Ring Main Road and Shanghai Street in Yau Ma Tei. These stores sell "original pawned second-hand clothes" that have been pawned for too long and not redeemed, which are wholesale to them by pawnshops. There are also "new returned clothes" that customers have ordered from clothing stores but have not picked up after the deadline. It is said that this year, because of the × invasion, the mainland market was lost, and new and old clothes were accumulated in Hong Kong, so the prices were particularly cheap. A completely new suit can be bought for six or seven dollars, and an old one can be bought for two or three dollars. A man's coat can be bought for five or six dollars, and the most luxurious one is no more than ten dollars. Women's coats are even cheaper. A very nice one can be bought for three or five dollars, and one with a leather collar and a very new style is no more than ten dollars or so. This year can be said to be an opportunity for the common people to wear clothes.

A foreign saying goes: "Clothes make the gentleman." The eyes of urban people are very snobbish. Our clothes are often the first thing people look at. If the clothes are too casual, they will be looked down upon by most snobbish people. In this way, it is difficult for us to blame the common people for wearing clothes and maintaining appearances. The problem lies in the entire society.

### How to Criticize Drama

— Hu Chunbing

(I)

Dramatic criticism is a kind of review work in the dramatic activity itself, and it is also an effort of general social literary criticism with dramatic activity as the object. Drama is one of the most primitive human spiritual activities. In the narration and depiction of legends, in the dance of religious rituals, the history of drama has already begun. From ancient times to the present, all ethnic groups in the world, without exception, take drama as a major provider of human spiritual food, a powerful influencer and important organizer of emotional activities.

At the same time, dramatic criticism has a history as long as dramatic activity.

Drama is different from other art departments. It is a comprehensive art, it is a body art, it is an art of action, it is an art of struggle. The activity of drama depends on the cooperation of the majority of people and the appreciation of the masses, so it is the most popular art. His image medium most easily and profoundly affects his object, so he is the most social art.

Precisely because of these, dramatic criticism is particularly necessary.

Dramatic criticism is qualitatively different from literary criticism in other departments. It is not an individual's appreciation of a static work of art, but a correct understanding and understanding of the dynamic group art activities from the perspective of a member of society, and a rigorous review and criticism.

This is the correct starting point for dramatic criticism: use the progressive viewpoint of society, the enjoyment of life, understand and capture the art of imitating (and creating) life, and see its significance in the advancing crowd: that is, the characteristic of dramatic criticism.

(II)

What kind of drama there is, there is what kind of dramatic criticism, which is as true as saying "what kind of society there is, there is what kind of drama." Classical drama is regarded as the creation of words and literature, and the criticism at that time only looked at his skill of "chanting wind and playing with the moon." Later, drama gradually developed into entertainment and became a commodity, and dramatic criticism also became a commodity role - promoting actors and publicity, or a tool for commercial warfare - attacking and scolding, and punishing differences. When drama became a weapon of social struggle, dramatic criticism also became 100% political preaching, biased towards an angle of ideological struggle. Until the great battle for liberation began, drama became a mobilization of the masses. At the time of the launching, dramatic criticism began to embark on the road of obeying the war of resistance and serving the war of resistance.

For convenience, we can say that Chinese dramatic criticism has gone through the above-mentioned stages.

(III)

How to criticize drama?

First of all, we can say that a critic, like an ordinary viewer, watches a play from beginning to end, and sees a story with a beginning and an end. His emotions unconsciously fluctuate with the development of the story. He intuitively accepts this continuous dynamic image. This is a step in collecting critical material. (This is equal to the second stage of creation, but the truth here is the same, so it is said that "criticism is creation.")

Secondly, from a story, we will naturally feel that there is a Moral (sense of right and wrong), an Idea (thought), and a theme (purpose, proposition). A rational reaction to this Moral, whether it is to agree with or oppose all or part of it, has already entered the realm of criticism.

Third, we will think about how the parts of a whole topic are coordinated, how the development line is, and how the structure is. All technical conditions have aroused our consideration. If the second stage is comprehensive, then this stage is analytical.

Fourth, we will further think about, what is the position of such a script and such a performance in many performances? What effect will it have on the progress of the entire dramatic movement? What impact will it have on the entire society? This utilitarian consideration can be said to be the social stage.

After the four stages of intuition, mixing, analysis, and social (evaluation), the critic has a definite grasp of the object of his criticism.

This is the common path that dramatic criticism must go through.

(IV)

How can a dramatic critic obtain the correct effect through these four stages? That depends on one's own cultivation—general and dramatic.

The issue of self-cultivation is also the condition that a dramatic critic must have.

First of all, a dramatic critic must have a correct world view. Because what drama reflects, records, promotes, and organizes is the social life of human beings. That life is diverse, complex, and contradictory. If he has not learned correct and progressive ideological methods and basic social knowledge, then his criticism is mechanical and often wrong.

But this does not mean that with general knowledge he can ascend to the throne of a critic. If based on a pattern or just general common sense, it is impossible to understand or help create great works, so:

Secondly, he must be very proficient in the knowledge of various departments. The detailed items and work progress of the drama are all necessary weapons for a critic.

It is not enough to be limited to the proficiency of dramatic technology.

Third, he must have a broad range of cultivation on the laws of general literature and art and on the characteristics of other departments, so that his spirit can be more broad and his understanding can be more profound.

Finally, a critic must be a worker and a participant in the movement, so that he can read a script and watch a performance as an organic part of a movement. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the critical function in the absorption and abandonment of work, and to establish a progressive, constructive, creative, and dynamic dramatic criticism.

(V)

We cannot stay in the stage of "writers despise each other" and "mutually touting each other." We cannot be an association of critics like the "uncles' group" (actor fans). We don't need to talk about empty political theories. Therefore, to write good dramatic criticism, our critics must constantly learn and participate in practical work!

### One Year of Theater in the Isolated Island

— Wei Lan

I. Starting from the Beginning of the Year

Shanghai became an isolated island, and most theater workers had to go to the interior. Just as the Chinese theater movement was on the rise, it suffered this major blow, and the theater movement on the isolated island became even more "isolated."

However, starting from 1938, the beginning of the year showed a gratifyingly vigorous phenomenon. The "Qingwu Drama Society" first performed "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Women's Apartment," "The Great Thunderstorm," and "Returning Home in Glory." Following that, the "Xiaofeng Drama Troupe" performed "Flood," and the Shanghai Art Drama Society performed "Women's Apartment" and "Mei Luo Xiang." But the vigorous phenomenon was only temporary, and then it declined again.

II. The Dissolution of "Qingwu"

To the "Shanghai Drama Art Society"

The "Qingwu Drama Society" was a group of considerable size. Unfortunately, after several large-scale performances, internal disagreements arose, resulting in its dissolution. A portion of the members organized the "Xiaofeng Drama Troupe" and recruited several movie stars, such as the deceased Shang Guanwu. Another portion of the members organized the "Shanghai Art Theater," headed by Li Jianwu and Gu Zhongyi. The Xiaofeng Drama Troupe was suspected of having a certain suspicious source of funding, which was first revealed by the "Shanghai Evening Post", and consequently, it soon died out. "Shanghai Art" actively participated in the Shanghai community's relief performances for refugees shortly after its establishment, receiving threatening letters, but later still strived to perform. However, it was soon forced to cooperate with the "Sino-French Friendship Association" due to personnel and environmental issues, becoming the "Shanghai Drama Art Society" under the name of the drama group of the Sino-French Friendship Association. It was registered with the French Municipal Council Bureau, consolidating its foundation, and now it can be considered the only large theater troupe on the isolated island. It possesses excellent actors and technical talents, first-class directors such as Wu Renzhi, Xu Xingzhi, and Li Jianwu, and first-class playwrights You Jing, Gu Zhongyi, and others are all sponsors of the society. Actors such as Lan Lan, Xia Xia, Shu Shi, Zhou Qi, Xu Li, Xia Feng, Wu Mei, and others are all basic actors, contributing the highest level of performance to each performance.

The first performance of the "Shanghai Art Drama Society" was on September 23, 24, and 25, 1938, at the French Municipal Council Hall, performing "The Beginning of Man," originally written by the French writer Barro and translated by Zheng Yanyi, adapted by Gu Zhongyi, and directed by Wu Renzhi. It was performed twice and received quite a good response. The second performance was "The Struggle Between Love and Death," originally written by Romain Rolland and translated by Li Jianwu, directed by Xu Xingzhi. At the same time, O'Neill's new type of one-act play "Before Breakfast" was also performed, directed by Li Jianwu, for four consecutive days from October 27 to 30, and replayed on November 5 and 6. The results were very satisfactory, and the performance of "Before Breakfast," a new type of one-act play and a one-person play, was very successful and received good reviews.

III. "Weekly Small Theater"

To the "Drama Association"

Although the isolated island has formed, there are many fundamental members of theater workers who have not left Shanghai. They have organized many small drama groups within their own scope. Although they are "small," their aspirations are great and their orientation is good. The organizing members are mostly middle school and university students and general amateur drama enthusiasts, shop assistants, employees of banks and money shops, and customs officers, staff of refugee shelters, refugees, and workers. The "Weekly Small Theater" united them, led them, and supported them. However, the plan of "Weekly Small Theater" was not fully realized. It only united the small groups in form, and there was still a lack of unity among the actual groups.

Not long ago, "Weekly Small Theater" was suspended. Recently, after reorganization, it became the current "Shanghai Drama Association" and continues the mission of "Weekly Small Theater". The organization is more sound than before, and the work is also developing well. There are about ten or twenty small theater troupes participating in the "Association", and their performances are all assisted by it, especially in terms of stage technology. If participating troupes have performances, they must report their performance plans in detail to the "Association", and there is good communication between them. Therefore, the actions of small theater troupes have received correct theoretical criticism and guidance. The leaders of the "Association" are also the key members of the various small theater troupes. Although they are not famous, they are all very capable and dedicated and hardworking.

IV. New Mutations in Civilization Drama

Movie stars Gu Menghu and Bai Hong entered the "Queen's Theater" from spoken drama for the sake of livelihood, attempting to improve civilization drama. However, they used the method of spoken drama to improve it, and as a result, they did not achieve success, and they suffered losses and failed.

Now, they are implementing civilization drama at the "Green Treasure Theater" of the New New Company. Fortunately, under their efforts to improve it, the civilization drama of the "Green Treasure Theater" is on the way to success. At the very least, the scenery and lighting have made significant progress in technology.

V. The Activity of Small Theater Troupes

There are too many theater troupes in Shanghai. Because there are so many, everyone works very hard, so there are often small performances. However, most of them still participate in entertainment-type performances, and they often feel a lack of talent and quality when performing alone.

In addition to the two large performances of the "Shanghai Drama Art Society" in November, the "Silver Money Drama Troupe" also gave a large performance.

The Silver Money Drama Troupe of small theater troupes is an organization of drama enthusiasts among the staff of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and various banks and money shops. Before the large performance, they held a practice performance in the hall of the "Ningbo Fellow Association" in November, with programs such as "White Tea" and "Zhang Guan Li Dai", with mediocre results. On November 23 and 24, they performed "Sunrise" at the Lido Theater, directed by Xia Feng. The results were quite good.

Not long ago, the "Guiyan Drama Society" of "Private Shanghai Middle School" and the "Longmen Drama Society" of "Provincial Shanghai Middle School", with the assistance of the "Association", held an exchange performance at the "Municipal Council North District Elementary School". The programs were Guiyan's "Endurance" and "Locked Box", directed by Director Hu, who worked hard among the various small theater troupes, and Longmen's collectively directed "Winter" and Xu Li's directed "The Proposal". This performance gave a good impression, and "Endurance", "Locked Box", and "The Proposal" all had very wonderful performances.

December can perhaps be said to be the most vigorous time for the isolated island theater movement in 1938, as if echoing the vigorous phenomenon at the beginning of the year.

The Shanghai Christian Student Groups Federation staged Ouyang Yuqian's adaptation of the demonic "Dark Forces" on December 17 and 18 at the French Municipal Council Hall, directed by Ms. Gai Lan. The nature of this performance was charitable fundraising, with ticket prices starting at one yuan, but it was a great success and the performance was very good.

On the 19th, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School took the opportunity to celebrate the school anniversary and held a "Refugee Relief Entertainment Gala" at the Lyceum Theater, where foreign songs and dances were performed. In addition to music and other programs, the Shanghai Drama Art Society participated in the performance of "Women's Apartment" in two shows, day and night. The day show was also a one-act play "Artist" directed by Xu Li, and the night show was an English six-act play "Peerless Beauty" directed by Zhang Zhongying, performed by students of the school.

VI. "Sino-French Drama Art School"

And "Drama Service Society"

Small theater troupes not only lack actors and directors, but also have difficulty solving the problems of scripts, technical talents, and performance venues. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the "Drama Group of the Sino-French Friendship Association" and the "Chinese Opera Research Society" and general Sino-French enthusiasts of art and drama jointly established a Sino-French Drama Art School to cultivate general theatrical talents.

The Sino-French Drama School's implementation plan is divided into three phases. The first phase is to first run a class of spoken drama research crash course and a class of Kunqu opera research crash course, emphasizing both theory and practice, graduating in one year. The second phase is to add several advanced courses, graduating in two years. The third phase is to build its own school buildings, libraries, theaters, etc. The plan is so gratifying, but I don't know if it can be realized. You Jing, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Renzhi, and others are all professors at the school, and the principal is Feng Zhizhong. The enrollment results for the spoken drama and Kunqu opera classes totaled twenty or thirty students, and classes started on October 1.

### The Second Salvation Drama Troupe Will Go Abroad to Publicize - Expected to Arrive in Hong Kong Within Days

The Shanghai Drama World Salvation Association, the wartime mobile Second Salvation Drama Troupe (referred to as the Second Salvation Drama Troupe), left Shanghai in August last year, and has passed through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, and Shangcheng and Macheng counties in the Dabie Mountains. Then it went south along the Yuehan Railway, turning to Xiang and entering Gui, educating and mobilizing the public all the way by performing dramas and singing, achieving very good results. When it set out from Shanghai, there were only fourteen people, led by the progressive movie star Mr. Jinshan and Ms. Wang Ying. Along the way, it attracted many excellent comrades. Because of the hard work and serious life, it has been praised and welcomed by military and political authorities and people from all walks of life everywhere. Recently, they have been staying in Guilin, continuing to publicize the art of the War of Resistance, and have performed famous national defense dramas such as "The Battle of Taierzhuang", which has won the praise of the general public. Now, in order to expand the salvation propaganda abroad and appeal to overseas Chinese on behalf of the soldiers on the front lines, it has been decided recently to go to Southeast Asia to perform dramas for a period of six months. According to a letter from a comrade in the team, they set out from Gui around the tenth of this month to come to Hong Kong, and will stay in Hong Kong for a short period of time. It is expected that they will arrive within these few days!

Hong Kong Drama League Performance

Since the War of Resistance, the salvation theater movement in Hong Kong has suddenly flourished, and small-scale theater troupes have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. In December last year, due to environmental needs, they organized the Hong Kong and Kowloon Youth Drama Association, with more than 20 small theater troupes participating. Now, some youth drama groups in Hong Kong have organized the Hong Kong Drama Federation. Since the launch of the initiative, the Cloud Friends Drama Society, the Youth Troupe, the Xuezhen West Section Drama Troupe, the Dingchou Drama Society, the Nonggong Society, and the Huazhong School Drama Troupe have registered to join. Now they have scheduled to hold the first joint performance this afternoon (26th) at 7 pm at the Caroline Hill Confucius Hall. In addition to the spoken drama troupe, the Junior Chorus and the Xuezhen Middle Section Training Class and Huayi College will be responsible for singing and chorus. It is expected that there will be a lot of excitement at that time!

### Promoting the Art of the War of Resistance, the China Art Troupe Holds a Traveling Charity Performance, and a Second Performance Will Be Held in Mid-March

Since its establishment, the Chinese Art Troupe has been working very actively. In addition to its first performance at the Hong Kong Central Theater and the Kowloon Puqing Theater last month, it also performed for the Hong Kong Chinese Youth Relief Association at the beginning of this month, with good results. It is said that the troupe has now scheduled a second performance at the Central Theater in mid-March, with six plays to be performed: 1. "The Demonic Power" adapted by Ouyang Yuqian from Tolstoy's original work, 2. "Chinese Man" newly compiled by Hu Chunbing, 3. "Fisherwoman" from the original French work of Barro, 4. "Losing Oneself in Triumph", a famous work by Chen Baichen, 5. The Soviet satirical comedy "The Government Inspector", 6. Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm". Now, in addition to actively rehearsing new dramas under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian to prepare for the performance, they are also holding traveling charity performances to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment movement and promote the art of the War of Resistance. Yesterday, the troupe sent letters to various charitable organizations in Hong Kong, requesting assistance in carrying out the project. Now, the original letter is recorded as follows:

Respected Sirs, This troupe is a professional theater troupe. In order to promote the theater movement, there should be regular performances every month to develop itself. However, this troupe does not belong to an individual, nor does it only belong to a small number of members. The colleagues are willing to contribute all their energy to the nation, country, and society. Although their ability is limited, they still want to do their best. For this reason, we now intend to take out a portion of our time to perform national defense dramas in various community organizations and schools on a voluntary basis to facilitate publicity. We hope that you will give us your sponsorship in many ways, and we have made the following methods. Please give us your instructions and inform various community organizations and schools so that we can receive treatment. With regard to the public interest - the attached methods are as follows: (1) Any school or community organization with a gathering of more than 20 people can invite this troupe to perform. (2) The performance of dramas is limited to one-act or one-scene, two-act national defense dramas. (3) The scenery, costumes, and transportation costs are all completely borne by this troupe, and no fees will be charged. (4) The performance date, time, and location must be agreed upon by both parties at least five days in advance. After obtaining a written reply from this troupe, it can be announced. (5) It cannot be accepted during this troupe's performance period. (6) The purpose of this performance is to cooperate with the national revival movement and make effective publicity. It is intended not to sell tickets. If it is necessary to slightly charge for tickets in order to limit the number of people, then the income will be used entirely as donations to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment movement and may not be used for other purposes. (7) If there are special circumstances that need to be discussed by both parties, they can be negotiated and resolved temporarily. (8) The above provisional methods may be considered at any time in order to adapt to the situation if there are obstacles in implementation.

### Hong Kong Spoken Drama Groups Launch Yellow Flower Festival Charity Performance "Huanghuagang" - More Than Forty Theater Troupes Will Unite to Perform

The China Art Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong colleagues and other three major drama groups, in order to unite all Hong Kong drama groups to work together, and to provide emergency relief to Shenzhen and Kam Tin refugees, specially launched a joint performance of "Huanghuagang" on March 29 this year, the Yellow Flower Festival, by more than forty Hong Kong drama groups. This kind of joint large-scale performance can be considered an unprecedented grand event in Hong Kong, and its significance is twofold: one is to unify the front line of the Hong Kong drama world, and the second is to provide relief to homeless refugees. Recently, the three groups have held two symposiums. Attendees included Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, and Li Hua of China Art, Zhu Baishui, Xianfeng Haoge Fen of the Hong Kong Drama Association, and Rong Zekuang, Liang Fuhe, Li Shulun, and Ling Ke of the Guangdong Drama Association. It was immediately decided that this performance would be a completely charitable performance, and it would also cooperate with the British Relief China Society or the Relief Association. Now, letters have been sent to the China Traveling Drama Troupe, the Era Drama Troupe, the Iron Current Drama Troupe, the Ant Child Drama Troupe, the Tough Fight Drama Troupe, the Lu Feng Drama Troupe, the Youth Tongle Society, the Cultural Drama Troupe, the Far East Drama Troupe, the Forward Drama Troupe, the Ordinary Drama Troupe, the Xuede Lizhi Society, the Ziqiang Society, the Xinsheng Society, the Drama Group of the Four Women's Associations, the Red and White Drama Society, the Youth Group of the Dingchou Drama Society, the Chunlei Drama Society, the Leidian Drama Society, the August 13 Drama Troupe, the September 18 Drama Troupe, the Bow Drama Society, the Amateur Drama Troupe, the Lian Drama Troupe, the Pioneer Children's Drama Troupe, the Drama Group of the China Bookstore, the Xuezhen Drama Society, the Hong Kong Colleagues Association of the Guangdong Drama Association, the Drama Group of the Chinese Government Association, the Julu Drama Society, the Lan Ya Drama Society, the Pioneer Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Spoken Drama World Federation, the Justice Drama Society, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, the Hong Kong University Drama Society, the China Juvenile Drama Troupe, the Male and Female Youth Drama Group, the Nanfeng Society, the South China Girls' High School Bin Society and other drama troupes, to send representatives to attend the meeting today to resolve everything. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, we feel that in order to more effectively serve the sacred national liberation struggle, the unified front of the drama world has the necessity of enrichment and expansion. As a result of our talks on the evening of February 21, we decided to call on all drama troupes and all drama workers to establish our joint work in the performances of national festivals. In the execution of the work, we will strengthen unity, enhance self-education, and implement precise division of labor; and jointly devote ourselves to service work. For the first joint work, we have selected the joint performance on March 29, the great historical festival of Huanghuagang. This work belongs to all drama workers and must be meaningful with the participation of the broad masses. We sincerely make a call and a reminder here, hoping that everyone will quickly gather together to discuss and practice. It is now scheduled to hold a symposium of representatives of various drama troupes at the China Amateur School (13 Shandong Street, Mong Kok) at 1:00 pm on the 26th of this month (Sunday); to discuss the initiation of a joint large-scale performance, and to unite and work afterwards. Please send two responsible representatives to attend the meeting at that time to discuss everything!

### Today's All-Star Game at Caroline Hill: South China vs. Hong Kong Combined Team in a Charity Match; Hui Tang and Anderson Leading Their Respective Sides to See Who Has the Superior Skills

[Report from our newspaper] After the Human Day festival and the upcoming Lantern Festival, looking far into the distance only brings sadness upon returning home. We may have drunk the New Year's wine, but our sorrow remains unresolved. We must not forget the vengeance of [omitted character] Day and should strive harder. Let us sincerely save the nation, setting aside the usual New Year's greetings, uniting our efforts, and hoping for victory in the war of resistance. Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. I will follow behind with my pen.

The British Relief Fund Society, after establishing a branch in Hong Kong, has achieved remarkable results in relief work. Recently, the society's president, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, sent a letter to the Football Association, requesting a charity football match to raise funds for disaster relief. The Association, considering the matter a charitable cause, could not refuse. With the agreement of South China Athletic Association, they will send a team to compete against the Hong Kong Combined Team. All proceeds will go to the branch. It is true that everyone desires to do good. Who would not be like us? Relying on the efforts of twenty-two football players, we can save countless lives from the aftermath of war. We hope that philanthropists will attend, making this meaningful football match today a lively and positive event.

The South China team has a complete lineup. Li Huitang is determined to play center-forward, while Zhang Rongcai will be the goalkeeper. Liu Songsheng will play left-wing, giving the formation a fresh look. On the Hong Kong Combined Team side, Anderson will lead the way. During the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Games, he not only showed no signs of aging but also gave an excellent performance, shining brightly. He and Hui Tang can be considered unparalleled. Today, Anderson and Li will lead their respective sides, surely showcasing their unique skills and engaging in a great contest of magic, making for a tense and exciting match.

Chinese stars Xu Jingcheng and Hou Rongsheng have also been selected for the Hong Kong Combined Team, adding to its splendor. The goalkeeper, serving in the military, is Hong Kong's red player. It remains to be seen if the team's fierce arrows can break through his closed-door policy. Right-winger Fula was bravely injured during the Interport Games and hospitalized. Unable to play today, he will be replaced by Amberson. In short, all the stars are gathered, and they will surely contribute greatly. Football fans who want to see a good show should arrive early. The lineups for both teams are listed below:

(South China Athletic Association)

Zhang Rongcai (South China South)

Li Tiansheng (South China South), Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Liu Weipei (South China Chinese), Liang Rongzhao (South China South), Liu Qingcai (South China South)

Liu Songsheng (South China Chinese), Li Zhaorong (South China [omitted character]), Li Huitang (South China Athletic Association), Feng Jingxiang (South China South), Deng Guangsen (South China South)

(Hong Kong Combined Team)

Healey (Kowloon Club)

Shi Han (Middlesex), Hou Rongsheng (Kwong Wah Athletic Association)

Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Athletic Association), Biludu (St. Joseph's), Hanni Bo (Kowloon Club)

Morse (Police Club), Soo Shi (Middlesex), Anderson (St. Joseph's), Kenny (Middlesex), Amberson (Artillery Team) (Substitute) Reggie (Army Ordnance Corps), Yishi Dulange (Hong Kong Club), Wulie Zhi (Kowloon Club), Packa (Police Club)

In addition to the charity match, there will be four league matches for Divisions A, B, and C. In Division A, St. Joseph's will play against the Navy at the Navy Ground. St. Joseph's forward Anderson will be playing for the Hong Kong Combined Team in the charity match today, so their attack will definitely be affected. Moreover, the Navy is a strong team with high hopes of winning the championship. Driven by this hope, they will surely put forth their best effort. St. Joseph's strength is already not as good, and now they are missing Anderson, so the outcome of the match is predictable.

### South China's Two Teams Both Compete: The Younger Team Loses, the Elder Team Wins; Eastern Defeats South China Chinese 4-2; South China South Wins Against Hong Kong Club by a Score of 6-0

Yesterday afternoon, there were two consecutive Division A league matches at the Hong Kong Club Ground: (1) Eastern vs. South China Chinese, (2) South China South vs. Hong Kong Club. The number of spectators did not decrease due to the Spring Racing Carnival, likely because paying once allowed them to watch two good matches, which was considered affordable and worthwhile.

Eastern Defeats South China Chinese

Eastern Had a Full Lineup, While South China Did Not

When the first match began, Eastern's lineup was complete, while South China Chinese did not field their full strength. Tan Jun'gan and Yang Shuiyi were nowhere to be seen, making their attack and defense weak. How could they resist the energized Eastern team? However, in the initial exchanges, Eastern was somewhat careless and fond of dribbling. Although their attack was strong, they could not break through the defense. When South China Chinese launched a chance counterattack, Eastern immediately conceded, losing 0-1. Only then did they realize the opponent was not to be taken lightly and immediately corrected their mistakes, finally equalizing five minutes after conceding to make it 1-1 at half-time. In the second half, after ten minutes, South China Chinese took the lead again to make it 2-1. The loss of this goal was entirely due to Xian Han's unstable handling of the ball, which slipped out of his hands, allowing Genbao to rush in. If Xian Han had been calm and composed, this goal would not have been scored.

After the Match, Chengtao Was Deemed the Most Valuable Player

The best performer throughout the match was Chengtao. His interceptions were sharp, and his passing was accurate, earning much praise. Eastern's ability to turn defeat into victory was due to this player's fast-paced delivery. Although Li Deqi scored three consecutive goals, his hesitation and missed opportunities hampered the team's morale. South China Chinese's ability to take the lead twice with such a lineup was testament to the efforts of their forward line. However, their defense seemed much weaker than before, with numerous dangerous situations in front of the goal, often in a passive position. Zhu Zhaohang bravely defended alone, but his efforts were futile.

Xie Jinhong, Lin Depu, Liu Weipei

Genbao Scores First

After the match started and the teams battled for fifteen minutes, South China Chinese broke through the encirclement and launched a fierce counterattack. Runbo crossed from the wing, Dehui headed the ball, and Genbao flicked it in, making it 1-0 to South China Chinese. (Eighteen minutes) Eastern were inspired and ordered a full-scale attack, surrounding South China's goal. Qixiang shot from a key position, but Liu Mao hilariously blocked it. Although Chengtao regained possession, Baiwei quickly intercepted him, making it futile. (Twenty minutes) Shidu snatched the ball in the middle and sent it to Li Deqi. Qixiang received Li Deqi's quick pass and immediately shot, but Zhaohang could not save it, making it 1-1.

South China's Weak Defense Concedes Three Goals

In the second half (ten minutes), Zhenhui dribbled the ball and chased, lobbing it towards the goal. Xianhan carelessly caught the ball and fumbled it, allowing Genbao to lead the charge and kick the ball into the net, making it 2-1 and putting South China ahead again. (Twelve minutes) Lingsheng suddenly broke through in the middle and passed the ball to Chengtao. Chengtao cut through defenders and shot, hitting the post and bouncing back. Deqi arrived in time and added another kick, equalizing 2-2. (Twenty-two minutes) Chengtao repeated his side attack, making a solo raid and passing a wonderful ball. Deqi met the ball and headed it, hitting the goal post and bouncing back. Deqi turned around and hooked the ball in, making it 3-2. (Thirty-three minutes) Chengtao repeated his old trick, with Weipei and Baiwei failing to stop him. Deqi took advantage of his wonderful pass and performed a flying kick, shooting the ball into the net, making it 4-2. Eastern finally won at the end of the match.

South China South Defeats Hong Kong Club

A Large Disparity in Strength; No Excitement

After the match between Eastern and South China Chinese ended, South China South and Hong Kong Club began their match. There was little excitement. Initially, Hong Kong Club was able to resist, showing some strength. However, after several dozen rounds, they gradually showed weaknesses and eventually collapsed. By the time the final whistle blew, South China South had given Hong Kong Club a "shutout," making it a new record for South China South's winning score in the second week of the league. The reason for South China South's overwhelming victory was their complete lineup and the dedication of their soldiers. Rongcai's goalkeeping performance was exceptionally calm, catching every wonderful shot from the opponent. He can be called a goalkeeping master. The two defenders and three midfielders defended firmly, leaving no gaps for the opponent to exploit. The five forwards were as lively as dragons and tigers, moving like lightning. As for Hong Kong Club's defeat, the most obvious reason was the weakness of their defense, with their defenders and two backfielders being ineffective. The midfielders were also less skilled, especially Meilington, who was the most incapable, failing to stop South China's attack. The forwards also had poor coordination, and their shooting lacked accuracy. Only left-winger Lingzhi was somewhat commendable.

Rongcai's Save Earns Praise

At the start, Hong Kong Club kicked off. Douwen intercepted the ball, went straight up the wing, and shot towards the goal, but Gaolusi caught it. Then Feng and Li advanced together, like two dragons emerging from the sea. Li shot twice in succession, the former going too high and the latter being caught. Hong Kong Club narrowly escaped a disaster and tried their best to counterattack. Luozhi shot towards the goal, accurately and powerfully. Rongcai calmly moved his hands, sending the ball out of danger, earning applause from the fans. After about sixteen minutes of fierce fighting, Zhaorong intercepted the ball. The two defenders tried to stop him but were passed. Zhaorong then dribbled the ball alone and charged forward. After a few steps, he lifted his foot and shot towards the goal. Gaolusi jumped but missed, and the ball slipped into the net. After the restart, En[omitted character] intercepted the ball again and passed it diagonally to Guangsen, who launched a surprise attack from the wing, as fast as a meteor. By the time Meilington chased him, Guangsen had already reached the enemy's territory. Gaolusi saw Guangsen shooting and jumped to save, but he missed again, conceding the second goal, making it 2-0. Afterwards, Hong Kong Club desperately counterattacked. Luozhi charged towards the goal several times, but South China South defended firmly, only forcing a corner kick. Later, Rongcai committed a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. However, Qi An shot wide, and the first half ended.

South China's Momentum is Strong; They Take What They Want

During the break, South China South's morale increased, and they took what they wanted, dominating the match. After battling for a while, Zhaorong took advantage of Rongzhao's pass and instantly advanced to a key position. Gaolusi went out to meet the danger, and Zhaorong easily kicked the ball into the net. Six minutes later, South China South's forwards charged again like an avalanche. Qi An and Shi Dulange saw the situation was too dangerous and desperately intercepted, but En[omitted wedge symbol] was too clever, dodging and weaving. Finally, he kicked the ball into the net. Afterwards, Jingxiang performed a hundred-step piercing willow skill, hitting the bullseye. Enliang followed suit, and it was also successful. Before long, the match ended, with South China South winning 6-0. It was difficult to support alone; even if they wanted to avoid defeat, how could they?

After the battle broke out, the ball went back and forth, and the teams fought fiercely. The American team's attack was strong, surrounding the Scottish team's goal. Within a minute, Tiwanxiang scored a goal, but the linesman ruled it out for being offside, and the American team only had a moment of happiness. However, their attack did not weaken. Five minutes later, the American team forced a corner kick. McGarettie kicked it in beautifully, and Hamwen added another kick, directly hitting the bullseye, making it 1-0 to the Americans. The Scottish team counterattacked, and Hoxi's midfield defense was quite effective. However, they lacked strategy and were greedy for success, shooting aimlessly and failing to score. The American team took the opportunity to counterattack, and Tito broke through on a solo run, scoring the second goal. The Scottish team was not convinced and attacked again. Wenlu shot from twenty yards and hit the post, bouncing back into the net, making it 2-1. After a long period of chaotic fighting, Falaming carelessly touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area. Suo Shi scored the penalty kick, and the first half ended with the American team leading 3-1. After switching sides and starting the second half, the American team's prestige was even greater, dominating the match. The Scottish team could only defend and had no power to counterattack. The situation became one-sided. Soon, Hamwen flashed in, passed Fraser, and shot the ball into the net. Before long, Suo Shi made a solo run and scored again from five yards, making it 5-1 at the end of the match. Middlesex defeated Scott 5-1.

### Kwong Wah Courageously Defeats Police Club

[Special Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, in the Division A football league match, Kwong Wah faced Police Club at the Boundary Street Playground. After returning in triumph from Australia, Kwong Wah rode the momentum and smashed the Police Club, who had just won the special silver medal, into pieces, winning with a score of 4-2. They avenged their failure in the first week. At the opening whistle, Kwong Wah immediately took the offensive, with their five forwards chasing the ball in different directions. The police defenders resisted strongly. Zhou Wenzhi took the opportunity to kick the ball into the net during a melee in front of the goal, scoring first. After a melee lasting fifteen minutes, Zhuo Shijin shot from fifteen yards, piercing the willow with a hundred steps, scoring with one shot. The veteran players could do nothing. Kwong Wah scored two goals in fifteen minutes, greatly increasing their prestige. The police attempted to retaliate, and Gui Cai launched a fierce attack, but Guo Qi sacrificed himself to save the day. Zhou Wenzhi roamed in the midfield, distributing the ball well, and was extremely active. Jing Cong received Zhou's long pass and passed it to Chi Fen, who shot into the net with lightning speed and ear-covering technique, making the score 3-0. The first half ended with this score.

After changing sides in the second half, the police repeatedly tried to avenge their humiliation, sending everyone out. The three defenders moved forward to help with the attack. The defenders used the tactic of luring the enemy offside to stop the progress of the Kwong Wah forwards. For a moment, Kwong Wah's goal was in danger, and the defenders fought bravely. With the police emptying their defense by moving everyone forward, Chi Fen received a pass from Hou Ziyuan and went on a solo run, but his shot went wide, narrowly missing a sure goal. Shortly after, Wenzhi shot quickly, but it was unsuccessful. Chi Fen repeated his old trick, getting another good chance, but he was too anxious and missed the opportunity. Shortly after, Jing Cong angrily swept the ball, but the old goalkeeper saved it. In the last five minutes, the police ordered an all-out attack. Hou Zi committed a foul in the penalty area, and a penalty kick was awarded. Hou Lvnan kicked it in, and the whistle blew for the end of the match. Kwong Wah finally avenged their previous defeat with a score of 4-2. The lineups for both sides were as follows: (Ball Boys)

### Middlesex Defeats Scott; Scott Can Only Defend and Cannot Counterattack

(Special Report from our Newspaper) In the first week of the match between the Scottish Army Scott and Middlesex, the teams tied 1-1. At that time, the two sides still had the same lineup, and the match was difficult to determine. Yesterday was the second week, and the two teams met again at the So Kon Po Ground. However, the situation had changed drastically. Middlesex's players Watson Gorogan and others had left the team and returned to their country, and Scott's players Polo Du and others had also left. Both teams' fighting strength had weakened. Fortunately, Middlesex had no shortage of rising stars, and their strength was only slightly affected. However, the Scottish Army suffered from a lack of good players, and their strength was declining. Yesterday, they faced Middlesex like a small witch meeting a big witch. They could only defend and had no power to counterattack. The situation became one-sided. As a result, Middlesex easily defeated Scott with a score of 5-1.

The battle was chaotic and had no excitement at all. Scott's defeat was purely due to a lack of good players, which affected their defense. Adamson was incompetent, and Lishi Liverji took over the important task of helping with the attack and defense, but he had no strengths. This gave Middlesex left-winger Hamwen the opportunity to break through. Scott's loss of each goal was due to the weakness of this side. The front line [omitted character] Xi had courage but no strategy, and he was greedy for success, shooting aimlessly whenever he had a good opportunity. Only Fraser Wenlu was qualified, but he was difficult to support alone.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... Marie Antoinette

Marie Antoinette

This film, in every aspect, deserves to be called a great success. Every scene in the film is filled with touching romances and tense, terrifying tragedies. At the same time, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, were able to vividly portray the tragic fate of a French queen. Their acting in the film has reached the highest peak of artistic expression.

Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of passion and hope, who unfortunately marries the mentally dull Louis XVI. Disappointed, she indulges in a life of luxury and debauchery and falls in love with Duke Fersen. However, she eventually squanders the nation's wealth, indulges in lust, and is not understood by the people. Combined with Louis's mediocrity, this leads to widespread suffering and the outbreak of revolution. In this era of turmoil, her extremely tragic fate is created.

The film brings this moving historical event to life on the screen. The sets and costumes are also extremely magnificent. At the same time, the film vividly depicts the queen's extravagant and debauched life, the environment that shaped her character, and the situation of the French Revolution at the time, further enhancing the film's realism. This "Marie Antoinette" is a work that is highly worth recommending to the audience.

The aerial scenes shot in color are definitely successful. Previously, in "[omitted character] Island Goddess," there was a scene of an airplane flying in the sky, and the beauty of the sky's colors left a very beautiful impression. In this film, this point is further developed. The sky is too beautiful. Perhaps many people who watch this film will want to fly an airplane leisurely in that lovely blue sky.

The story seems a bit too long, but it tells the story of the American aviation industry over the past thirty or forty years, from its inception to the present, focusing on three young people who have devoted their lives to aviation. The two male leads, Fredric March and Ray Milland, are competent. The female lead is a newcomer, Ruth Campbell. Judging from this film, she is a very promising new star.

Shirley Temple is undoubtedly recognized as the most popular little singer on the screen today. Of course, it is the business acumen of 20th Century Fox to have her star in this play.

As for the plot, it is still the same old, tired, and extremely contrived and vulgar story. The only watchable scene is when she leaves the orphanage and says goodbye to her friends in the orphanage. The rest is quite disappointing.

Shirley has grown a bit older. Thank you to the Hollywood movie merchants for creating a "grown-up" tone for her, of course, a "Hollywood-style" grown-up tone. The true innocence of a child is not much left in her, and soon, I believe that even this point will be destroyed.

The songs are okay, but the scenes are not grand. The final scene, "Court Theater," is also unremarkable.

### Thoughts for Consideration

— Ling Mo

Not long ago, someone asked me if I had studied philosophy, meaning to advise me to study a little philosophy. Not wanting to miss an opportunity to gain some knowledge, I presumptuously raised the question of whether philosophy is essentially contemplation or belief. This question may be unphilosophical, but for the sake of newcomers, the answer was to establish a belief before contemplating. Then, what if the result of contemplation is doubt? This requires a doubt about the doubt. Perhaps there is no further doubt? The answer is "perhaps" there is, and there should be. To ask further is to prove oneself unteachable. Thus ended my first lesson in philosophy.

I lack the courage to study a second or third lesson, because if each lesson proves me unteachable, I will discover that everything I know has lost its foundation. It seems better to remain in a life without philosophy. I envy those who, from the beginning, acquire their philosophical basis with religious-like faith, systematically selecting what they need and discarding what they don't. But too much is discarded, which seems to be a common phenomenon. Naturally, this is not a result caused by philosophy itself, but one can and should suspect that starting from philosophy leads to this phenomenon even more.

Planning the re-liberation of education is a promising new effort at present, and its success will be a significant gain for this great era. Experts haven't expressed much opinion yet, but many students have already expressed their hopes in newspapers and magazines. The most common opinion is to criticize the impracticality of secondary school curricula, demanding that choices and rejections be based on ideals. Even some progressive editors misunderstand this view, so the letters answering inquiries strongly emphasize the importance of basic subjects. However, discussing importance and unimportance purely abstractly can be very reasonable from both positive and negative perspectives. For example, most of the knowledge included in geography classes is for reference. This point is quite valuable, but the person who raised this argument may not allow us to doubt whether he can find the necessary geographical knowledge in reference books, or even whether he knows if Tunisia is in Africa or Europe.

The emphasis on memorizing individual events is indeed a shortcoming of current secondary education. However, mathematics, with its abstract nature, is generally disliked by most students. Part of the reason is that mathematics has also been turned into a subject that emphasizes memory over contemplation by educators. But the creation of this situation is also due to scholars' reluctance to apply contemplation in this area. In the past, many believed that middle school students should not contemplate, and that making students pay attention to mathematical methods was the foundation for building useful practical knowledge—a belief that made mathematics the basis of entry. Now, starting from contemplation, we know that building this belief is inevitably biased, and mathematics seems to be abandoned along with this bias. The point that mathematics is a basic tool for philosophical contemplation needs to be emphasized again.

Mathematics has made great contributions to the completion of modern philosophy, but the new idealism of the new Cambridge school, which also starts from mathematics, focuses too much on the contemplative aspects of mathematics. This kind of result is naturally very possible. If the nature of philosophy is contemplation, then this should also be allowed within the scope of philosophy. Moreover, we don't need to anticipate in advance whether we will make such a long-distance leap, using mathematics as a tool for science and as the basis of philosophy. Taking a slight step further towards contemplation is exactly what is needed. The extent to which philosophical contemplation is permissible is not something to ask about for the time being.

### The Grandeur of the Many

— Ai Wu

"Random Thoughts on a Journey, Part 3"

In the Yao Mountains near Yongzhou, I saw many peaks covered from foot to summit with lush green fir trees. They were densely packed together, as if all trying to climb to the mountain peak, stretching out thousands of heads, vying for the sun, and greedily absorbing the atmosphere. This scene made one feel the combination of the many; the more numerous, the more magnificent the beauty.

Similarly, in front of a cave in Guilin, I saw thousands of student soldiers lined up on the plaza below the cave, roaring songs of national salvation. The powerful waves of sound almost shook the wilderness and the sky, also making one feel unparalleled magnificent beauty. Realizing the great power of humanity united in a concerted action is truly astonishing. The same song, when sung by one person, only feels like a song. Conversely, when sung in unison by thousands of throats, one deeply feels that it is simply a force that shakes people.

Previously, when Chinese people went abroad alone to seek a living, they only showed the spirit of struggle and endurance. This time, under the invasion of the × people, the masses united to resist the invaders. I believe it will surely give the world a different and amazing impression. Even if they don't feel this is unparalleled magnificent beauty, they should no longer feel that we Chinese are always a sheet of loose sand! February 16th, Guilin

### Fight On! Spain

— Chen Youqian

It is an era of激変，
It is a century of battle，
Written in blood
Thirty-odd months of an epic worthy of song and tears

The most powerful is the will of the people,
The most sacred is the truth of history,
Glorious, you,
Fight on! Brothers of Spain!

Humanity has suffered an unprecedentedly cruel劫運：
Light is draped in gloomy clouds,
Civilization is shrouded in the smoke of poisonous gunpowder,
Justice is trampled under the feet of Fascism,
Humanity is pulverized in the invaders' gunfire.

Fascism—ah! That
Serpent of the times,
Devil of mankind,
Is frantically,
Cruelly,
Disturbing Europe,
Harassing Asia,
Destroying the culture of human history,
Attempting to destroy the world in an instant.

Totalitarian rogues are peddling intimidation,
Man-eating bandits are playing with fireballs,
Some bring "civilization" to conquer Abyssinia,
Some open their bloody mouths to devour Austria,
And also—

Compromisers calculate on their abacuses,
Waving the banner of hypocrisy,
For the sake of momentary ease,
Forcefully nailing Czechoslovakia to the cross
Forcing her to be silently slaughtered and dismembered;
For wearing the mask of "non-interference"
Condone the rampant atrocities of international Fascist lackeys
Letting them poison Spain's free land.

Now—
The black-shirt army's demonic hands
Have seized玛诺迦，玛育迦，
Preparing to stir the Mediterranean,
Preparing to slaughter Spain.

The arsonists of the swastika shop,
Even want to step into the Pyrenees Mountains,
Lighting the torch of the second world massacre.

Look!
The aggressors grin in the piles of corpses,
The beastly horde leaps on the graves,
The "victory" of the violent ones is placed on the tip of a volcano,
——It's a moment of illusory revival.

Fight on! Spain!
The dark night is already pregnant with a bright dawn!
You, the vast ranks who cherish freedom,
For the sake of
The independence of the motherland,
The justice of humanity,
Heroically shedding precious blood,
To resist the ranks of international robbers,
To fiercely strike the traitors who endanger peace,
Even to the last bullet and the last man,
Never surrender, never fear!

"Surrender means destruction,
Compromise is shame,
Defend Valencia,
Hold on to Madrid,
Use blood and flesh to build a firm
Fortress!
Use blood and flesh to defend the beautiful
City!"

Listen! To this magnificent roar!
Listen! To this reservoir of blood and tears!
The fire of righteous indignation is already burning in the hearts of every awakened
Spanish people
Still stubbornly and highly raising
The banner of fighting for independence and justice.

Foreign comrades,
Oppressed brothers!
In the East, we,
The sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation,
The red hearts of four hundred and fifty million people,
Have merged into a surging torrent,
Formed into weapons of steel,
Also like you,
Under bombing,
In the flames of war,
In the trenches,
Unanimously gritting our teeth,
In the anti-aggression, anti-fascist,
Advancing in the arduous battle, shining brightly!

Now, our resolute footsteps
Have shaken the foundations of militarists,
Our sacred ranks
Are approaching closer and closer to light and victory day by day.

On the shoulders of those in this world who do not want to be slaves,
All should solemnly shoulder the historical task!
For survival, we must fight,
From the battle, promote the truth.

It is an era of激変，
It is a century of battle，
The most powerful is the will of the people,
The most sacred is the truth of history,
Written in blood
Thirty-odd months of an epic worthy of song and tears
Glorious! You,
Fight on! Brothers of Spain!

### The New Tasks of Resistance Literature and Art

— He Weichu

Literature and art stand at the forefront of the era, illuminating the direction of the times, not following behind it. Before the great anti-aggression war flames were ignited in China, the general themes in Chinese literature and art had already vividly exposed the invaders' ferocity and indicated that China's way out for survival was to engage in a heated and great struggle with the invaders! Now, China has indeed embarked on the sacred and great path of resistance, which can be said to be the literary and art circles having fulfilled part of their responsibility to win a valuable price—the way out for survival. Moreover, this is the task assigned to us by history in this era, and the enlightenment of literature and art standing at the forefront of the era is the same.

Thus, it can be seen that literature and art in the current era of resistance is no longer something for a few literati and cultural figures to appreciate on their own, but has become a guide for the masses and a bugle for the oppressed people. It must reflect not only the heroic deeds of shedding blood and fighting bravely on the battlefield, and the tragic cries of displaced refugees, but also the efforts and struggles of the working masses in the rear who are sweating to help the resistance, as well as the consolidation of private power under the guise of resistance and the reflections of harming the nation's future for private interests, which are also extremely important and necessary. However, it is not only necessary to fulfill the responsibility of reflection, but also to indicate the political line of struggle and the dawn of truth.

Even so, it is still not possible to fully complete the true new tasks in the current era of resistance. It is also necessary to display the glory and greatness of the anti-resistance and to summon the broad masses to the sacred battlefield with unendurable resentment against the invaders, to organize and educate the broad masses to join the circle of the national united front, and to unleash the great power of anti-×.

In short, the new tasks of literature and art in the current era of resistance are not only to reflect the dark side, but also to display the bright side, and the forms of literary and artistic writing can adopt a variety of expressions.

### Execution

— Shulun

Guarded by soldiers, several dozen yards away from the foothills, a small team escorting a traitor continued to advance. The monotonous trumpet blew ahead, a simple and very low, sorrowful sound that explained the heart's turbulence before the final farewell of someone who no longer needed to exist.

People who had chased out from Zhongshan Road in Sihui County City stood far, far away from the execution ground, looking across as if across a river. At this moment, some people wished they could wear a precise telescope to see everything about the other side clearly. Others didn't care about any of this, cursing dejectedly:

"It would be better to burn him with cigarettes. Shooting him is still too cheap."

"Dismembering him by five horses would be the best! Dealing with those traitors."

There were quite a few people who sympathized with this kind of argument. They could easily exchange the same opinion with each other, rarely using a cruelest method of punishment to pride or overcome others!

So, they said in their hearts:

"It would be much more convenient if we were legislators and law enforcers."

However, other people watched this spectacle with timid hearts. It was the first time in their lives that they had participated in such a grand killing ceremony. Due to their intense hatred of the traitor, their curiosity and courage increased even more.

The timid traitor became even more fearful under the gaze of the crowd. He seemed to be someone who didn't know how to walk. After the first step landed on the ground, he couldn't lift his feet again. Something on the bottom of his feet firmly glued him, and now he hoped that there was really such a thing so that he would no longer have to move.

However, this was impossible. The organized team had already advanced very quickly. Two strong soldiers dragged him forward with all their might, and a large crowd of spectators cheered in an overly noisy voice.

Finally, they arrived at a suitable location. The escort relaxed and stopped him. A soldier in the team stepped forward a few steps to patrol left and right. Then everything seemed to be arranged. The traitor was as fragile as a child and fell to the ground with a push. His head seemed unable to decide whether to look up or down for a moment. His hands and heart were naturally trembling very violently. People closer to him believed that they could see and know that he didn't even dare to hope for the slightest thing.

"Bang!" This sound gave many people a moderate pleasure, and they believed that their hope of coming here had been quite satisfied.

Because the traitor had already fallen to the ground, people longed for the second shot even more.

"Bang! Bang!" There was no commotion in the crowd. At most, they would notify each other or record the number of the dead man's wounds:

"The third, the third shot!"

Presumably, the dead man had already fallen to the ground motionless. People had reached a satisfactory state with this dying man.

An officer-like figure turned the corpse over with one hand, raising his pistol high as if as a sign, and then dispatching it lowly. Thus, the last shot penetrated the back of the criminal.

The traitor was buried on the ground like a clod of earth. The escort team relaxed for a moment, and the guards also returned to the team. Then, the people watching the execution swarmed across the mountain road, even overtaking the people walking slowly in front, running two steps as one to fly forward.

The executed traitor lay straight, his hands tightly bound behind his back with a rope. The bloody wounds were open, red, purple, and bruised black, like a withered rose flowing on his chest, waist, and back.

As before, some people felt a flood of pleasure, while others had weak thoughts surging. Looking at them with pity, they seemed to be thinking:

"I don't feel sorry for the dead man, but why did he have to die like this?"

People gradually dispersed, and the heavy shackles still remained motionless on the traitor's feet.
