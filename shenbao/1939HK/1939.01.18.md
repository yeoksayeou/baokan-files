### The Concretization of British Sanctions Against Japan

The antagonism between Britain and Japan in the Pacific, and even in the world, is absolutely irreconcilable. Although for several years, some people in Japan have been pursuing the "old dream of the Anglo-Japanese alliance," and Britain, as the "Manchester Guardian" stated, "in the past eight or nine years, British officials rarely clearly stated their opinions," allowing Japanese fascists to incite anti-British sentiment. Now, Britain, for two reasons, has concretely demonstrated its attitude and determination towards Japan: one is the deteriorating situation in East Asia after the Guangdong-Hankou War; the other is the United States, a pivotal player on the Pacific political stage, resolutely adopting a tough attitude and sanctions against Japan.

Britain's determination to take a tough stance and active action against Japan is comprehensively expressed in this note to Japan. Britain certainly respects diplomatic etiquette and diplomatic language, but in this note, the wording is very strong and specific. The content of this note includes three key points: first, it points out the various conspiracies actually carried out by Japanese aggressors in China; second, it completely denies the "changes caused by force" by Japan and Japan's unilateral abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty; third, it states that China's politics were gradually stabilizing and its economy was developing before the Japanese war of aggression. These arguments are powerful arguments for exposing the international deception of the aggressors. We are greatly gratified and expectant about the impact of Britain's attitude on safeguarding international justice and treaties.

Britain's specific expression this time was certainly influenced by several tough notes from the United States to Japan, but the issuance of the British note will inevitably increase the United States' stronger determination, because whether the United States can implement the plan to sanction Japan depends on whether the Pacific policies of Britain and the United States can be "parallel" and whether the two can effectively cooperate on the international stage. Britain's tough stance towards Japan can also promote France's tough policy towards Japan, because France not only needs to view British and American policies as decisive in its actions in the East, but also needs Britain to support it in the West to stop the joint attack of German and Italian aggressors. It is said that the British note was submitted to Washington and Paris in advance and issued with the consent of the US and French governments, so its power will be even greater, because the US and France have a moral obligation to cooperate with Britain in sanctioning Japan. If Japan "continues to turn a deaf ear," the US and France will definitely cooperate with Britain to take retaliatory sanctions against Japan, as predicted by the "Daily Mail."

This British ultimatum is different from ordinary notes, as speculated by diplomatic circles in London, it is a "final warning" to Japan. If Japan ignores it again, Britain, the United States, and France will unite and take active economic sanctions. Britain's tough stance this time has another important force, that is, it has the support and supervision of national public opinion. The "Manchester Guardian" commented harshly, saying, "We have only one serious criticism of the British note to Japan, that is, its presentation came too late," and also said, "This time's striking surprise is indeed very admirable." The British people, especially merchants who have close ties with British interests in China, and members of parliament who represent the will of the people, have long been earnestly demanding that the British government adopt a tough policy towards Japan to protect its due interests. Although there is some doubt that the British government is too late in implementing the will of the people, the British government, which has always adopted prudent and reliable diplomatic steps, will certainly be able to implement the determination of the "final warning" expressed in this note in the future.

However, it can be predicted that Britain will not receive a satisfactory reply from Japan and a solution to the problem. Although the Japanese government has not yet made an official reply, Japanese public opinion has expressed great indignation, and its criticism of Britain has become more absurd. As pointed out by the "Hochi Shimbun," "Britain must have lost its senses." The "Nichinichi Shimbun" put forward more specific opinions, saying, "If Britain continues to support Chiang, Japan will have no choice but to regard it as a major enemy." Before the British note exposed Japan's conspiracy, the "Hochi Shimbun" still stubbornly argued, "The stationing of troops is due to the request of the pseudo-organization." This inferior skill of burying one's head in the sand is truly "losing its senses." The evolution of Anglo-Japanese relations in the future should be as we predicted before the establishment of the Hiranuma cabinet: although the culprit of anti-British sentiment, Interior Minister Suetsugu, has left the government, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot be adjusted as a result.

In our opinion, Britain has been rejected and scolded by Japan for a long time, and the interests of Britain and Japan are irreconcilable. Britain either does not uphold its own rights and interests in the Far East, or now is the most appropriate and powerful time.

Not only the United States and France have expressed their sincerity in cooperating with Britain, but even the Netherlands may join. The pressure of this group on Japan will make it impossible for Japan to survive. Even German naval experts admit that "the military strength of Britain and the United States in the Pacific is far superior to that of Japan. In terms of economy, Britain and the United States actually control most of Japan's exports, and Japan's exports are Japan's economic lifeline." This is exactly the same as the conclusion we often discussed before. At a minimum, Britain should have the courage to take the lead in implementing "punitive tariffs," abolish Japan's rights under the most-favored-nation clause, or go a step further and completely prohibit the import of Japanese goods into Britain and its colonies.

### Review of Japan's Domestic and Foreign Situation

— Guo Moruo

The Japanese cabinet has recently been reorganized, the culprit who launched the Lugouqiao Incident, Konoe, has collapsed, and as our war of resistance enters the second new stage, this political change in Japan is nothing less than a very good gift that the [Japanese?] gave us in the twenty-eighth year of the new year. It can also be said that it is a great gift from our soldiers who fought bloody battles on the front line. The reorganization of the Japanese cabinet clearly exposes the failure of the war of aggression, because the Chinese sacred war of resistance for one year and six months has forced the [Japanese?] to the final juncture.

On the day Hiranuma took office on the 5th, his first statement was that he admitted that Japan was in an unprecedented emergency. It is not easy to overcome the current difficulties. Hiranuma thought that if the Japanese people could unite under the leadership of their Emperor, it might be possible. From Hiranuma's statement, we know clearly that Japan is at the end of its rope. Can they unite? Impossible. If they could unite, Konoe would not have to step down, and Hiranuma would not have to take office.

Why did the Konoe cabinet collapse and resign? The immediate cause was that the military wanted to implement the general mobilization plan, but Konoe repeatedly expressed his disapproval and wanted to realize it as soon as possible. Therefore, due to the inconsistency of opinions, Konoe was forced to step down. In this sense, it expresses the struggle between Japanese financial groups, capitalists, and fascist military circles. The structure of the Japanese state and all production are controlled by financial groups and capitalists. The fascist military officials, however, wanted to seize control and let them dominate. Since the September 18th Incident until now, they have been fighting openly and secretly.

We should know that Konoe is a nobleman promoted by Saionji himself. He is the spokesperson of financial parties and capitalists. The policies of financial parties towards the invasion of China are different from those of fascist military officials. The financial groups wanted to invade China without bloodshed and by means of economic exploitation. The military officials were not satisfied with this peaceful exploitation, so they launched a large-scale war of aggression. As a result of one and a half years of war of resistance, Japan has fallen into a very serious crisis. The financial groups want to stop at the right time and end the war early, and the military officials also want to fight a quick battle and make a quick decision. However, their political conspiracies and strategies for a quick battle have been defeated by us. The military officials had no choice but to expand the war and intensify the aggression.

The Japanese financial groups have completely lost the power to control the fascist military officials. We can also know that the Japanese military officials are a crazy horse, and this horse-drawn chariot of Japan will definitely hit the cliffs. All the cliffs belong to the 400 million compatriots of the Republic of China. Therefore, Hiranuma's statement when he took office is a reflection of the phenomenon of division. The Hiranuma cabinet is likely to be a short-lived cabinet. Not only that, but also Japanese imperialism, ××××××××××.

The seven demands that Itagaki proposed to Hiranuma are nothing more than wanting to destroy China wholeheartedly. Because of the failure of a political conspiracy dream on December 2 last year, the fascist military officials further proposed a plan to expand military preparations, strengthen the axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and mobilize the whole country. This clearly shows that the Japanese imperialists are moving further down the road to ruin. To expand military preparations, economic strength is essential. What is the state of the Japanese economy since the war of resistance? Since the July 7th Incident the year before last, the military budget has been increased repeatedly, already reaching 3.95 billion, and last year it was 6 billion. According to general estimates, Japan's daily military expenditure is at least 500 million. From the estimate, the [Japanese?] have spent about 10 billion in the past year and a half. The Japanese relied on issuing a large number of public bonds to support such a large military expenditure. After the July 7th Incident, they originally planned to issue 3.5 billion, but only 1.5 billion was issued. As a result of the promotion, only 455 million yuan was collected. Because of the failure to issue public bonds, the huge military expenditure could not be remedied, so taxes were increased and banknotes were issued. Recently, one yuan has fallen below two mao. Therefore, the phenomenon of war-weariness in Japan is very common, but the fascist military officials continue to deceive the people and squeeze the people. The general public can only pray for the end of the war every day.

Their attempt to strengthen the axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy is clearly to expand the world war. In fact, Italy is unable to take care of itself and certainly has no power to aid Japan, and Germany will never send troops to aid Japan in the war. The so-called strengthening of the axis is only to restrain other countries in Europe. As for the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France, Britain's important lifeline is in the East. Now that the [Japanese?] have imposed a restriction on them, Britain will never cooperate with Japan. In fact, Britain has given us new loans, which gives the [Japanese?] an added difficulty. Speaking of the United States, President Roosevelt is advocating the amendment of the Neutrality Act, which means restricting the transportation of military supplies to the aggressor countries. The superiority of Japan's military strength relies on foreign countries. Roosevelt wants to amend the Neutrality Act, and the reason is also to restrict Japan and sanction Japan. The United States has always been friendly to China. Secretary of State Hull has warned American businessmen that Japan must pay cash for military supplies, so Japan has long lost credit in the hearts of Americans. As for France, it conducts its foreign policy based on the attitude of Britain and the United States.

### Japanese Prisoners of War Participating in the Work of the New Fourth Army

— Yan Su, Special Correspondent of Bao Ben, from Southern Anhui

I don't know how many guerrillas there were. In less than ten minutes of the battle, I was injured and fainted on the ground. Later, I was awakened by the sound of the call to return to the team. (Only afterwards did I know that this was the sound of the call of the New Fourth Army) Before long, I was captured by the Chinese people and handed over to the New Fourth Army. (Question) What were your feelings when you were captured? (Answer) When I was captured, my eyes were slightly injured, and I thought there was no hope of survival. Because the officers told us that Chinese soldiers would kill Japanese prisoners of war, but after being here for three days and talking with a New Fourth Army comrade who spoke Japanese, I realized that the actual situation was not like this. I have been here for three months, and I have been treated well by the New Fourth Army in every way. In addition to a comfortable material life, they also give us books to read (Chinese books and Japanese progressive novels), work (teaching soldiers Japanese slogans and making Japanese propaganda materials), and the right to enter and leave freely (referring to the meaning of going to the streets to play freely - reporter). Therefore, my spiritual life is also very pleasant. (Question) If the New Fourth Army were to release you back to your country at this moment, would you be willing? If you were willing, what would you plan to do when you returned to your country? (Answer) I am willing to return to my country. I will return to my country to join friends in promoting ideas inclined to socialism and anti-war, but this may not be possible. Because if the Japanese military knows that I have returned to my country, they will definitely kill me. (Question) What is the situation in Japan now? What is the relationship between the people and the government? (Answer) Generally speaking, the people in Japan have recently become increasingly poor due to rising prices, and they have a very bad impression of the government and have gradually begun to oppose it (mostly workers and laboring masses). (Question) What diseases do you see the most among Japanese soldiers in China? (Answer) Cholera, frostbite, and malaria are the most common. Cholera in summer, frostbite in winter, and malaria are common all year round. (Question) What do you think is the future and outcome of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) The Sino-Japanese War will be a protracted war, that is certain. According to my estimate, it will take about nine years. The outcome of the war is that China will be able to achieve final victory, that is also certain, because as the war is prolonged, Japan's difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources will increase, and at the same time, the anti-war forces among the people (including the Communist Party) will inevitably unite to overthrow the Japanese warlords. At that time, the Japanese central government, because it has no relationship with the Japanese people in peacetime, will inevitably fall. (Question) What do you plan to do after the end of the Sino-Japanese War? (Answer) After the end of the Sino-Japanese War, I want to return to Japan to discuss and promote the impressions and things I have learned here with my friends. (Question) How has your life been here for the past three months? (Answer) At first, I was not used to the food here, and I did not dare to eat some things because I was afraid there would be problems. Now I am not only used to it, but also I am very confident and satisfied. Therefore, I very much hope to help China defeat the Japanese warlords as a reward. (Question) Did anyone see you off when you left Japan? (Answer) Yes, the military mobilized the people to see me off. (Question) Do you miss your family now? (Answer) I missed them very much at first, but now it's better, because the New Fourth Army has helped me communicate with my family. (Question) Do you have a lover? (Answer) Yes, she is still studying in Tokyo. (Question) How is she now? Do you miss her? (Answer) I don't know now. She cried when she said goodbye to me. Of course, I miss her very much. I am now asking the New Fourth Army authorities to find a way to communicate with her. If I can find a way to bring her to China, that is what I hope for most.

Views of Foreign Correspondents on the Sino-Japanese War (Continued from the second page of the 12th)

It is indeed a杞憂[need clarification]; the dissatisfaction and anxiety of the world powers continue unabated, and Japan is no exception.

What are the views of Mr. Komori and Mr. Alaz?

Mr. Alaz, Swiss national and Economic Minister of the Chinese Daily, believes that the most fundamental first condition for the restoration of peace in the Orient is a ceasefire. When one side continues large-scale acts of war, no country can freely propose peace or overcome the underlying conditions for peace. Whether formal or not, it is a ceasefire agreement.

No war continues forever, nor can it continue forever. All wars in history end with the conclusion of a peace treaty. The situation in the Far East is very clear. Japan has enormous interests on the mainland and should protect them, and the mainland countries should defend all their greater interests even more. Therefore, for the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, the terms of peace must take into account the rights and views of both countries, and must not be coercion by one side against the other. The people of a great country certainly cannot accept humiliating conditions from one side, as can be seen from the recent example of Germany. If the tip of a gun can support peace, that would be too wonderful.

Komori: Well then, let's end here. Thank you all.

Currently, three routes are besieging Anyi, which is expected to fall imminently. The southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has entered a state of mixed warfare. The Japanese rear route has been cut off by us, and communication is lost.

[Minge Society and others, 17th Dispatch] The Japanese invaders in Yumen, since the 9th, have been using more than ten aircraft to cover their fierce attacks on us.

Currently, most of the Japanese invaders have fled to Linfen, and a unit has remained in Gucheng Town (more than ten miles northwest of Fencheng) and the Xishankou area of Fencheng Nongling. There are no Japanese traces.

[Minge Society and others, 17th Dispatch] The number of Japanese in Jiang County has increased to more than 4,000 in recent days, with more than 20 artillery pieces. One unit of more than 1,000, with six artillery pieces, fled south to Licun Village, where it is engaged in fierce fighting with one of our units. The Japanese have recently transported a large amount of ammunition from Hengshui to Hengling Pass. About 700 or 800 Japanese have recently gathered in the Cui Jiazhuang area southwest of Hengling Pass, with the intention of invading south.

[Local News] The Taikoo ship Qiongzhou arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haiphong via Beihai and Haikou, carrying many passengers and a large amount of goods from the mainland. The [reporter] interviewed the crew members of the ship and the passengers who came to Hong Kong from Beihai and Haikou, asking about the recent situation in the local area. The [reporter] recorded the conversations of the individuals. According to the crew members, Japanese warships were previously gathered off the coast of Beihai, with the intention of taking the opportunity to land, but our local defense was extremely strict, so the Japanese have not succeeded to date. The Japanese warships have already left the sea area there, but there are many Japanese ships arriving off the coast of Weizhou Island. When this ship passed through the area, it remotely saw about 20 large and small ships anchoring there, and many small motorboats were docked in the sea area. There was no harassment to ships coming and going from various countries. About half a day after this ship sailed from Haikou to Hong Kong, it saw five or six Japanese ships sailing south near the sea area south of Guangzhou Bay, followed by many small motorboats. The whereabouts were unknown, and their intention seemed to be to go to Qiongzhou or Weizhou off the coast of Haikou. When this ship approached the sea area opposite the outer Lingdingyang of the Pearl River, it also saw two Japanese ships sailing south from a distance. It was not known where the two ships were heading. It is said that in the past three to five days, many Japanese ships have also sailed south. According to passengers from Haikou, Japanese ships come and go without constant pattern outside Haikou Port, without unusual movements, but Japanese [aircraft?] often come to spy. On the morning of the 13th of this month, two Japanese planes flew in from the direction of Yuanzhou Island, and the Haikou air defense authorities issued an air raid alert. The residents fled in droves. Before long, two Japanese planes were seen flying over the city of Haikou, seemingly for reconnaissance, and then flew southwest. They returned three times, but did not drop bombs. Our air defense authorities did not fire on them because the aircraft were flying too high. The alert continued all day. After the Japanese planes left, the shops reopened. It was also learned that traffic between Hong Kong and Haikou is normal, and goods are also coming and going as usual.

### Tianjin Secret Agents Break into Concession to Kidnap, Forge Car Permits to Commit Crimes, A Famous Female Doctor Kidnapped

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Tianjin News: Two plainclothes police officers from [the Japanese puppet regime] carrying guns drove a car with license plate number 709 to Dabeidao in the British Concession on the afternoon of the 13th. They broke into Jinzhongli No. 8, where senior staff of the Bank of China in Tianjin reside. There were British Concession police guards outside the gate. The police, upon discovering the intrusion, immediately opened fire and shot one of the [Japanese puppet regime] police officers on the spot. After being wounded, the [Japanese puppet regime] police officer fled in a hurry. After investigation, it was found that car number 709 was Cao Zhai's private car, and it had not left the premises. This proves that the license plate of the car used in the crime was forged by [the Japanese puppet regime]. The British Concession authorities, in addition to tightening security near Jinzhongli, are continuing their investigation. Furthermore, Ding Mao央, a famous female doctor in Tianjin, was kidnapped by [the Japanese] near the Public Women's Hospital outside the East Gate on the 12th. She is currently being held at the Japanese Concession police station, for unknown reasons.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] The situation in the French Concession in Hankou has slightly improved.

It is reported that in the past two weeks, about a thousand people have been forced to leave the French Concession every day. However, foreign exporters in Hankou are not allowed to obtain export licenses, causing business to cease. However, the Japanese have begun to purchase large quantities of tung oil for transportation and export. Tung oil is one of Wuhan's important products.

### Northwest Situation and River Defense

— Special Correspondent Bai Yun

1. The Time is Not Yet Ripe for the Japanese to Attack the Northwest

Since the loss of Guangzhou, the Sino-Japanese War has clearly entered a new phase. Those observing the war situation in the country have long believed that the Japanese would follow this by attacking the Northwest, aiming for Xi'an and Lanzhou, thus proposing the task of defending the Northwest. On the Japanese side, after occupying Wuhan, they also publicized their so-called Fourth Phase of Operations, which would involve attacking Lanzhou. Therefore, at that time, the whole country paid great attention to the development of the Northwest situation and expressed concern. At that time, news reported that the Japanese in southern Shanxi were increasing from time to time, that the Japanese at Fenglingdu were shelling Tongguan from time to time, that the Longhai Railway was experiencing some obstacles, and that Japanese planes were constantly bombing Xi'an, Ningxia, and some places in northern Shaanxi, seemingly indicating a westward advance. At the same time, there were various pieces of intelligence and rumors that confused people, such as "the Japanese have prepared ten divisions, led by Umezu, to attack Xi'an, and another eight divisions, with some regiments, led by Renuma, to attack Ningxia and approach Lanzhou." On the Suiyuan front, news of the Japanese advancing westward also came constantly, such as "the Japanese plan to transfer two divisions from Hankou to Suiyuan, requisitioning civilian housing in Guisui for their use." Such as "The Japanese plan to attack our western Erdos has gradually become active, it is reported that its First Route Army, divided into the following three routes forward: one from Jehol via Tongzhou to Ping綏 line west; two by Jehol Park to Dolun to Zhangjiakou; three gathering north Jin and Chahar border of the mixed army to Datong, rumor that action will be taken in the coming days." Such as "The commander of the Second Route Army for the Japanese invasion of the Northwest, Unnuma, is reportedly already in Zhangjiakou, transferring troops, and the Supreme Commander of the North China Army, Terauchi, is reportedly going to Datong and Baotou to command everything." Also, "The Japanese attempt to invade the Northwest is becoming increasingly active. The pro-Japanese puppet forces in Bailingmiao are arriving in Guyang at a rate of over six thousand per day, and the Japanese in Guisui have increased by over three thousand. The puppet army of two divisions in Baotou, commanded by the traitor Li, is the vanguard for the westward advance. Kuno and other units, with over eight hundred soldiers and over sixty vehicles, have moved westward. Over twenty Japanese planes are stationed at the Baotou Airport, and three hundred camels and dozens of vehicles are transporting supplies westward every day." These messages have caused anxiety for those with unclear understanding. At that time, the Japanese, after occupying Hankou, were targeting Xiangfan, dividing their forces to advance towards the Northwest, and thus some people believed that the Japanese would first occupy Xiangfan, advance along the Han River to Hanzhong, and at the same time occupy Wulin from Sui and Baotou, advance along the Yellow River to Ningxia, to reach Lanzhou, taking a large encirclement of Xi'an. It seemed that the entire Northwest had been placed under Japanese control, and was in imminent danger, causing people's hearts to become increasingly volatile. At this time, the reporter was in Xi'an, and visited all parties concerned, inquiring about the truth, and it was proved that these were messages lacking judgment and observations ignorant of the general situation. In order to understand the current situation of river defense, so as to make a comprehensive judgment and observation on the situation in the Northwest, the reporter then went to Chaoyi, Pingmin, and Tongguan to inspect, and has recently returned to Xi'an. The results of this trip further prove that most of the above messages and intelligence are the result of the Japanese spreading propaganda, and that the river defense is solid, and the Japanese would not dare to speak lightly of a westward invasion without sufficient preparation. A telegram from Hekou on December 30th stated, "Summarizing the situation of the past ten days, the Japanese in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan have not increased in number. The Japanese army currently stationed in Jin and Sui includes the 110th, 108th, 109th, and 116th divisions. Datong and Sui Baotou each have about a thousand Japanese troops, and Guyang and Wuchuan each have three to five hundred Japanese troops." This has negated the accuracy of the above news that the Japanese have begun or are about to attack Ninglan. The Japanese attacking Xiangfan have been hit head-on by our forces and have collapsed, which shows that the observation that the Japanese plan to invade Hanzhong is an exaggeration. Looking at the overall situation, it can be said that the time is not yet fully ripe for the Japanese to attack the Northwest. Our government has made careful plans for the national defense of the Northwest, and will never allow the Northwest to be easily shaken. The situation of the War of Resistance in the Northwest is still promising. In the future, the Northwest can be the starting point for recovering the lost territories of North China. At present, in this temporarily silent situation, it is precisely the time for us to actively prepare to resist the Japanese. All pessimistic and defeatist emotions must be swept away completely.

Recently, the international situation has repeatedly changed in our favor, and our policy and strength to resist to the end have become increasingly firm. Therefore, the new difficulties of the Japanese have increased, and their feet will sink deeper and deeper. Based on this new situation and the opinions gathered from all sides, the reporter has made a comprehensive account of the current situation and future of the War of Resistance in the Northwest.

2. Why the Japanese Are Not Immediately Attacking the Northwest

Attacking the Northwest is indeed one of the key points in the Japanese war plan against us. This is considered by the Japanese to be as important as attacking Wuhan and Guangzhou. However, after Wuhan was abandoned and Guangzhou was lost, the general public believed that the Japanese had already begun military operations to attack the Northwest, and the Japanese also repeatedly publicized this, so why has it not been realized? Why has the entire war situation fallen into a temporary state of silence? There are several reasons for this:

First, the Japanese originally fantasized that after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou, they would "pursue the victory" and eliminate our main force in one fell swoop, open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and then turn their troops north to attack the Northwest. Who knew that after two major battles around Xuzhou and Wuhan, lasting about ten months, they suffered heavy losses and were already exhausted. Therefore, they were struck by us in northern Hunan, and failed to gain a firm foothold in Guangzhou. At the same time, we increased fresh troops in Guangdong, adjusted our formations, and abandoned Wuhan in a planned manner, so the arrangements between Hunan and Hubei were completed in a timely manner, breaking the Japanese fantasy. According to the experience of the Civil War era, after the fall of Yuezhou, Changsha would not be easy to defend; however, this time we were able to prevent the Japanese from advancing south after the loss of Yuezhou. This shows that our military deployment has greatly improved compared to the situation after the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xuzhou, which was beyond the Japanese expectations. It is said that if we had abandoned Wuhan a few days earlier, the arrangements between Hunan and Hubei could have been completed earlier, and the Japanese might not have been able to capture Yuezhou. This is not an exaggeration. At this point, the Japanese began to retreat in the face of difficulties, adopting a defensive posture in northern Guangdong and northern Hunan, and the battles on the main battlefield have temporarily become silent.

Second, the Japanese plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has failed, and they urgently need to rest. It is even more impossible to immediately carry out the arduous task of attacking the Northwest. At that time, the Japanese attacked Xiangfan mainly to ensure the security of Wuhan. Even if they occupied Xiangfan, they would not have the strength to continue to advance and attack Hanzhong; moreover, since Xiangfan had not been secured, the claim of a large encirclement of the Northwest was even more impossible. The Japanese north of the Yangtze River and south of the Pinghan Railway, of course, had to adopt a defensive posture at this time.

Third, the Japanese had already gone through fifteen months of invasion war, gaining more harm than good, and suffering greatly, while our policy of resisting to the end did not change due to the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, but became more determined. Full-scale guerrilla warfare, developing behind Japanese lines, is expanding day by day. The Japanese hope for our "surrender and peace" is impossible, and the dream of a quick victory has been shattered. Therefore, the Japanese had to temporarily stop their offensive and re-examine the project of invading us: Should they first clear the occupied areas, improve the puppet organizations, and alleviate their domestic crisis, and then slowly advance to destroy China? Or should they first strengthen their domestic warlord rule, continue to attack China, and even subjugate us, and then slowly digest it? Before these issues are decided, they must temporarily stop the attack.

Fourth, the Japanese can never change our policy of resisting to the end, but they still want to find loopholes in our camp to carry out their so-called "peace" political conspiracy. In order to facilitate this conspiracy, it is naturally necessary to temporarily stop the attack.

Fifth, at this time, a favorable shift in the international situation suddenly occurred. Britain and the United States helped us with huge loans, the Sino-American Silver Agreement was extended, and a rift occurred between the Soviet Union and Japan due to the Fisheries Agreement, which had a major impact on Japanese internal affairs and military affairs through diplomacy. The Japanese also had to transfer troops from North China to the Guandong to demonstrate to the Allies, so how could they have the strength to continue attacking the Northwest?

Since the entire war situation has temporarily fallen into silence due to the above-mentioned reasons, what meaning is there in continuing to attack the Northwest, other than putting on an act?

3. Has the Crisis in the Northwest Been Eliminated?

Since the Japanese national policy is based on the determination to destroy our country, the observation that they will attack the Northwest after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou is inherently true. Unless a revolution occurs in Japan, the economy and finances collapse, international sanctions are imposed, or we have the strength to counterattack, their national policy cannot be changed, and the crisis of the Japanese attacking the Northwest can never be eliminated due to the temporary silence of the war situation. This crisis may eventually be realized sooner or later, and of course, this crisis may also be reduced in the future, but the conditions for this elimination require us to strive for it through the arduous struggle to defend the Northwest. These conditions are not yet available at present, so the crisis in the Northwest still exists. Attacking the Northwest will probably still occupy a very important position in the Japanese future strategy.

The silence of the entire war situation is also beneficial to us, because we can take the opportunity to make more adequate preparations and shorten the time to achieve final victory. How long will this period of silence last? This will be determined by how the international and domestic environment of Japan and us change. It cannot be specifically pointed out now. For example, if British-American cooperation can become increasingly concrete, and if the Soviet Union can be tough on the fisheries issue with Japan to the end, then the pressure on Japan will be very great. This period of silence may be slightly prolonged, but we are not afraid of the Japanese launching an attack early, because in the future, the Japanese attack will lose the convenience of the railway lines and plains, and will go deep into our interior, which is more beneficial to us than to the Japanese. Therefore, whether the crisis in the Northwest is eliminated or not does not completely depend on whether the Japanese attack sooner or later, but on how we defend the Northwest. (To be continued)

### New National Defense Frontline… Current Situation in Shashi

— Special Correspondent Shao Zeng

1. Jingzhou and Shashi After the Retreat from Wuhan

Jingzhou and Shashi are located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, are huge ports in the west, and are the rear screen of Wuhan, so the importance of the situation is self-evident. Commerce, culture, and other aspects are also quite prosperous. However, after the successive voluntary retreats from Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, the situation in Jingzhou and Shashi suddenly became tense. At that time, the reporter was transferred from Nanzhang to work in Jingzhou. After arriving in Shashi, what I heard and saw was a chaotic scene of soldiers and refugees. All that was on the street were either disorganized retreating soldiers from the front or wailing and begging refugees. The pawn stalls set up along the street were even more varied and countless. The walls were covered with small advertisements looking for people, such as "XX has gone to XX", "XX can come to XX"... Seeing such things would make people think of the tragic situation of wives and children being separated and fleeing in all directions!

At this time, Jingzhou and Shashi were in turmoil. If the Japanese had continued their westward advance after capturing Wuhan, then without a doubt, Jingzhou and Shashi could have been easily obtained. Look! The more well-established shops had either posted "This shop has moved to Yichang to do business" or "Temporarily closed," and all had closed their doors. Those who stayed here, however, raised prices and hoarded goods. Of course, those with money had already left, but the poor who could not escape suffered, and the streets and alleys were in a state of panic and chaos. How could they talk about "consolidating the defense"? In this situation, if it had lasted another half a month, then Jingzhou and Shashi would have become a "no man's land"!

After the fall of Wuhan, the line from Changsha, Hengyang, and Jingzhou and Shashi to Xiangfan became a national defense line, and Jingzhou and Shashi were the central hub on this line. However, the great fire in Changsha, the crazy bombing of Xiangfan, and Yichang behind Jingzhou and Shashi were also under air raids all day long. All of this was enough to increase the panic in Jingzhou and Shashi. This situation of "precariousness" gradually recovered after Mr. Liu Chaoliang (Commander of the Special Operations Brigade of the Military Affairs Commission) concurrently served as the Commander of the Jingzhou and Shashi Garrison.

2. The Activity of the Youth League

After taking office, Mr. Liu Chaoliang actively engaged in rectification work, on the one hand dispersing the population to prepare for necessary times, and on the other hand stabilizing people's hearts. These are two contradictory actions. However, the shrewd Commander Liu reconciled these two contradictions, so that the entire Shashi went from danger to stability, from stability to normalcy, and then developed and prospered.

The first step in building a new Shashi was to launch a "cleaning campaign", mobilizing all the forces in Shashi to clear the walls, ban street vendors, drive away stray dogs and pigs, and control slogans and posters. After a week, the entire Shashi was refreshed. In addition, the proper settlement of soldiers and refugees, and the order of the market were all restored, and only saw the new Shashi, where can you find the appearance of war again.

After cleaning up the city appearance. Training work began to take shape, dock workers, packing workers, rickshaw pullers, and people in the theater were all active under the leadership of the Youth War Zone Service Corps.

The Youth War Zone Service Corps of the Jingzhou and Shashi All-Circles Support Association was formed urgently during the crisis, gathering more than 40 young men and women from high schools and above. More than 20 comrades from the Special Operations Brigade's War Zone Service Team also participated and served as volunteer cadres. Liu Rongchao, director of the Garrison Command's Guiding Office, also served as the leader of the group. Their organization was divided into three teams according to age and gender in terms of living management, and divided into ten groups in terms of work, including editing, singing, comics, drama, condolence, rescue, and public transport. In addition to performing dramas, posting slogans and comics for publicity, they also carried out "localized" oral propaganda, such as talking about air defense when the air raid alarm was lifted; when a traitor was shot, they talked about eliminating traitors, which was shocking and easy to achieve great results. Since Shashi gradually turned from danger to stability, the Youth League launched practical organizational training work, which is now described separately:

Dock Workers' Union: A total of 32 docks in Shashi have a dock general trade union, and four branch unions are set up in different areas. One person is sent to each place to assist in handling labor affairs. At present, there are about 5,000 workers. The Youth League always puts the interests of the workers first, so it is highly trusted by the workers. Dock workers in Shashi have united into a steel-like whole!

Packing Workers' Union: There are thousands of workers in the packing factory. Although there was an organization before, it was actually in name only. After the Youth League sent people to reorganize it, it revived and prospered. At present, worker training is carried out every day, and female group members also go to train female workers. The work is very smooth, and the workers sincerely accept the training, and the group members do not avoid complicated explanations and tell them in detail. How can a loving mother's love be applied to the workers without achieving good results!

Drama Association: There are currently seven theaters in Shashi. Since the official establishment of the Drama Association, it has adhered to its position and worked hard. All obscene and corrupting social scripts have been absolutely stopped, and a performance is held every week to support the military, and all income is turned over to the support association for military use. This time, Shashi's gold donation and performance have been held many times, and the enthusiasm for saving the country and donating is a unique phenomenon in the Shashi theater industry.

Commercial Trade Association: People's relief power is the most abundant, but they are the least organized and lack the most training, so their power has always been difficult to exert. Now each store in Shashi has been organized into a trade association, totaling more than 40 types. In the future, they will exert the greatest power to seek happiness and improvement for the new Shashi and add new impetus to the war of resistance.

Rickshaw Pullers' Union: The rickshaw pullers in Shashi are now organized, and they also have a general trade union and several branch unions. They will uphold the principle of "exerting their strength" and do their best to maintain transportation and indirectly help the war of resistance. We must know that the power of the laboring masses is the greatest and most sacred power!

(3) Gold Donation Movement in Shashi

The gold donation movement started on December 25 (Rejuvenation Day) of the 27th year and officially donated gold on New Year's Day this year. During the three-day process of gold donation, the Youth War Zone Service Corps made the greatest efforts. In addition to working hard to use the power of all trade unions and trade associations, they also held street fundraising, not afraid of the cold eyes of passers-by, not afraid of the disgust of misers, they were working enthusiastically, and their spirit and perseverance were shown from this work, and at the same time, they represented the true nature of revolutionary youth.

The gold donation platform in front of the Chamber of Commerce was crowded and noisy every moment for three days. Although alarms were frequent, they could not stop the enthusiastic outpouring of Shashi compatriots. Some were blind beggars with blurred eyes, some were children begging along the street; there were goddesses who sold smiles for a living, there were monks from ancient temples, soldiers who had retreated from the front line, and wounded soldiers recuperating in the hospital. Without rich or poor, without status, they all took out their money under the belief of one country! Dock workers, packing workers, rickshaw pullers, etc., are admirable and commendable, both contributing efforts and money, which is not comparable to the big-bellied merchants who generally regard money as their lives!

Now the gold donation has ended. The 110,000 yuan in gold donation has set a precedent for Shashi; this shows the enthusiasm and generosity of Shashi compatriots. The 150,000 citizens of Shashi will be a powerful auxiliary vehicle in the war of resistance camp. When the reporter was writing, I just got the news that Yichang's three-day gold donation totaled more than 17,000 yuan. I can't help but say, "So is Yichang"!

(4) Coda

Vigorous vitality has spread throughout Shashi, which is now becoming increasingly prosperous. If someone has been here before, they will be surprised to say, "I didn't expect it to be so stable." Yes, Shashi, which is so close to the front, is indeed unexpectedly stable and tense. In life, it does not have the slightest wartime state, but in work, it is full of vitality and progressive tension everywhere.

Look: Shashi is becoming active by leaps and bounds.

### Britain Considers Continuing Financial Aid to China; Sanctions Against Japan to Be Decided by British Prime Minister

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 17th] Chongqing newspapers on the 17th all published editorials praising Britain's note to Japan as being bright and just. Our political circles also admire Britain's straightforward actions, considering it the first righteous sanction since the September 18th Incident. It is even more important to us than material and economic assistance.

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 16th] All sectors here hold great hopes for the current League of Nations meeting. Newspapers on the 16th all published editorials hoping for the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant, providing practical assistance to China and maintaining world peace. Zhu Jiahua and Wang Shijie hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the International Fellowship Society on the 16th, hoping that public opinion would promote the League of Nations to implement Article 16 and provide economic aid to China.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Japan will soon reply to the British and American notes regarding the Open Door Policy. The reply will suggest that the relevant countries discuss and modify the principles of the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity. Although Japan knows that this approach will not be accepted by the powers, the authorities believe that Japan, due to its traditional friendly relations with Britain and America, may be able to negotiate under certain conditions.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry is still studying the notes from Britain and the United States. According to well-informed sources, Japan will soon issue a reply, in which it will point out several basic diplomatic policies: (1) racial equality, (2) freedom of trade, and (3) fair distribution of resources.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Due to Japan's interference with British interests in China, there are conflicting opinions among various departments of the British government regarding economic or commercial sanctions against Japan. Last Saturday and Sunday, Britain issued a strong note to Japan, mostly due to the firm attitude of the Foreign Office, which hoped that the United States would adopt the same policy and did not want to show weakness. Although the aforementioned note did not propose any retaliatory action, the Foreign Office very much wanted to strike a blow to Japanese trade and provide financial assistance to China. Conversely, the British Board of Trade and the Treasury advocate a cautious approach to Japan, as angering Japan could jeopardize Britain's £300 million investment in China and its valuable trade in the Far East. It is believed that the conflict on this point will be finally decided by Prime Minister Chamberlain, and some people believe that Chamberlain's attitude will largely be determined by President Roosevelt's words and deeds. At the same time, the British Board of Trade is still considering several methods, such as (1) providing loans to China so that it can purchase military supplies and other goods, (2) raising import taxes on Japanese goods entering Britain and British colonies, (3) prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to Japan, and (4) providing financial assistance to China. As a first step, the British government has agreed to provide China with a credit loan of £500,000 over four years to purchase British trucks to operate on the newly built Yunnan-Burma Road. However, the two countries are still arguing over the interest rate. Britain is demanding an annual interest rate of 6%, while China is only willing to offer 5.5%, saying that it is only offering this rate for similar loans from the United States. Britain also told China that once Parliament passes a new bill authorizing the establishment of a new credit loan of £10 million to protect British interests, China may be able to obtain a further £20 million in credit loans. Furthermore, there are some rumors about establishing a "Sino-British Stabilization Fund" to maintain the current state of Chinese legal tender. This matter is also related to Britain, because if China's legal tender system collapses, British commerce in China will inevitably suffer the same fate. As for commercial sanctions against Japan, all parties believe that the risks are far greater. However, it is heard that British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently told the Chinese side that if the United States can implement commercial sanctions, then Britain will definitely implement them without a doubt. On the day the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting opens, it is expected that Wellington Koo will take the opportunity to put pressure on Britain, asking it to provide greater assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan.

[Reuters, London, 17th] According to the Financial Times, if the British note to Japan is regarded as a homily, its effect will be very great. However, is it imaginable that the Japanese authorities, who have reached this point today, will change their policies because of solemn teachings? The future of Britain's £300 million investment is threatened, and verbal protests alone cannot protect it. The current situation has developed to such a point that the British government cannot simultaneously allow Britain to avoid conflicts with the Far East and at the same time protect a small portion of the interests that have been destroyed. A united Anglo-American boycott of trade with Japan is more effective than sending a hundred notes to Japan, because Japan's foreign trade is its greatest weakness.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 17th] It is claimed here today that the French government has decided to follow the example of Britain and the United States and will submit a note to Japan requesting an explanation of its policies. It is heard that the content of the note will be the same as that issued by Britain the day before.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement saying that a copy of the British government's note to Japan regarding respect for the Washington Nine-Power Treaty was delivered to the State Department here today, but he refused to comment on it. When a reporter asked whether the British and American governments had exchanged opinions on this matter, Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that he was not aware of it personally.

### Preliminary German-Hungarian Negotiations; Hitler Receives Hungarian Foreign Minister; Anti-Comintern Pact to be Signed in Hungary

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky this afternoon. This is the preliminary of Csáky's negotiations with German leaders on German-Hungarian issues. It is understood that Csáky will not sign the Anti-Comintern Pact in Berlin but will sign it after returning to the Hungarian capital. This morning, Csáky and Ribbentrop had a very harmonious two-hour conversation. Hungary may be somewhat disappointed with Germany's proposed Czechoslovak-Hungarian border. Ribbentrop expressed his condolences to Csáky. The two also discussed the issue of the German minority in Hungary and the economic problems of the Danube region. The Hungarian ambassador to Germany hosted a banquet for Csáky today, attended by ambassadors and many German ministers (including Minister of Economic Affairs Dr. Funk). German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will hold an "Anti-Comintern" banquet tonight, with Csáky as the guest of honor.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th] Although political circles are extremely tight-lipped about the events discussed when the German leader met with the Hungarian Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon, it is generally speculated that the following four items must have been discussed: (1) Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations; (2) the German efforts to persuade both sides to comply with the Vienna Arbitration Tribunal's decision regarding the frequent border conflicts between Hungary and Czechoslovakia; (3) the issue of the German association organized by the 600,000 Germans residing in Hungary; and (4) Hungary's relationship with its neighboring countries Romania and Yugoslavia, with Germany attempting to forge closer friendships with Hungary and Yugoslavia.

### US Silver Purchases; Congressional Movement to Ban Foreign Silver

[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to Washington, there is an important movement in Congress to prohibit the Treasury Department from purchasing foreign silver. Many people from silver groups are also strongly supporting the movement, fearing that large-scale purchases of foreign silver will cause the domestic silver market price to fall into extreme stagnation.

[Reuters, London, 16th] According to reports, the US government is currently under some pressure to stop purchasing foreign silver. People in the London silver market expressed surprise at this statement but were not overly alarmed. According to well-informed sources, it is naturally accepted that the US government cannot purchase silver permanently. Under the current circumstances, stopping purchases can only cause silver prices to plummet. Moreover, the US government already has a large amount of silver. Washington will still not adopt this policy, as the result will affect itself no less than anyone else. Furthermore, due to the inflow of huge amounts of gold, the US government wants to purchase gold and silver in accordance with the ratio stipulated in the "Currency Act" (i.e., 75% gold and 25% silver), it must continue to purchase large quantities of silver.

[Reuters, New York, 16th] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that he does not support taxing agricultural products. He believes that taxes on consumers are already high enough. He also said that he has not yet discussed with the Senate the issue of stopping the purchase of foreign silver.

### Dominican Republic Agrees to Accommodate 100,000 Jews

[Reuters, London, 16th] The Dominican Republic, in cooperation with the International Refugee Committee, has pledged to accommodate approximately 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe. The proposal for this matter was submitted to the government by Frederick Scholes, the country's consul general in London. The content of the plan is roughly to organize the refugees so that they can become good citizens in the future, contributing to the country, and not advocating the wholesale reception of the refugees as they are.

### British Chief of the General Staff to Inspect the Middle East

[Reuters, London, 16th] British Chief of the General Staff Viscount Gort is scheduled to depart for the Middle East on the 26th of this month for an inspection, with his departure from London lasting several weeks.

### League of Nations Delegates Conduct Political Talks; British and French Foreign Ministers Meet with Soviet Ambassador; Spanish Issue Openly Discussed

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 16th] The 104th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held this afternoon. Delegates from various countries conducted important political talks outside the meeting. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz in the morning and conducted talks with Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak in the afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Halifax also had discussions with Ambassador Suritz in the afternoon. French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to return to Paris tonight to attend the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow and participate in a foreign policy debate. Foreign Secretary Halifax will also return home in the same car, and the two will meet again in the car.

[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] Before the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, the report drafted by the British, French, and Soviet Four-Nation Committee on the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain was first released. It stated that there are 12,673 foreign combatants in Barcelona and the central region. Those who participated in the front lines have now withdrawn, totaling 6,490 people. The committee report recommends that the withdrawal plan be extended to four months in order to complete its mission. Regarding the withdrawal procedures, the report stated that all combatants who are forced to leave the country for political reasons must be sent back to their countries. However, those who are expected to be mistreated after returning to their countries will be sent to other countries where they can be safe. French representative Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech that the committee will report to the General Assembly within a few weeks that all foreign volunteers on the government army side have been withdrawn, so the rebel side should also withdraw foreign volunteers in the same way, so that Europe will not be at risk of national conflict. British representative Foreign Secretary Halifax also supported the committee's recommendations. He reiterated the British government's belief that foreign intervention in Spain must stop. Soviet representative Mr. Suritz said that the committee's report can eliminate all doubts about the nature of the government army's organization.

### Britain to Purchase Large Quantities of Zinc for Building Air Raid Shelters

[Reuters, London, 17th] According to the opinions of the hardware industry here, the recent increase in the need for zinc is related to the government's plan to build air raid shelters. Although there is no official report on the quantity and price of zinc, it is believed that the British government has ordered approximately 100,000 to 120,000 tons.

### Fierce Air Battles in Barcelona; Women Parading Amidst the Sound of Aircraft; Resolve to Fight to the Death and Defend Catalonia

[Reuters, Barcelona, 16th] Today, rebel planes soared over Barcelona. Amidst the sound of aircraft, hundreds of women paraded fearlessly on the streets where refugees gathered, calling on the public to resolve to fight to the death. They held flags with slogans such as "Strengthen Catalonia" and "Defend Catalonia to the Death." Five rebel bombers dropped twenty heavy bombs on the port area, about half of which landed in the sea. Four hit workers' residential areas, injuring five people. Government fighters rose up to fight them, and the battle was fierce. The rebel planes were soon driven away. At the same time, the government army bypassed from the rear of Tarragona and recovered its original positions on the mountain, controlling the main road east of Vendrell (15 miles from the coast).

[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] The Spanish Embassy in London issued a statement today saying, "If anyone today again speculates that the war in Spain is about to stop, they will be misled. The recent advance of the enemy has not reduced the effectiveness or combat power of the government army. The Spanish government solemnly declares that although foreign infantry, well-armed, interferes arbitrarily, and various dictatorial countries try to undermine it, our Spanish people will bravely resist until the ultimate goal of the foreign invaders and their Spanish companions ends in failure."

[Reuters, Burgos, 16th] Franco's army recently broadcast to the people of Catalonia, saying that the rebels will inevitably win, and everyone should lay down their weapons, and said, "Our march into Catalonia is not to destroy it, but to save it."

### US Navy Department Continues to Draft Plans; Firmly Insists on Fortifying Guam; To Prevent Japan from Advancing South and West

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Roosevelt consulted with his key diplomatic, naval, and army subordinates, and the topic was clearly related to national defense and foreign policy. Those who consulted with Roosevelt included Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretaries Woodring, Edison, Naval Captain Laws, and Ambassador Bullitt. Afterwards, Roosevelt consulted with Interior Secretary Ickes, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, and Labor Secretary Perkins. It is said that this conversation included the "Commodity Credit Corporation."

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The US Navy Department is currently continuing to draft military expansion plans. Fortifying Guam as an advanced base for the Far East Fleet is one of the ends of this plan. However, government officials and Congress do not agree. Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, opposes fortifying Guam, while a Navy Department spokesperson said, "The Navy has always advocated making Guam a strong advanced fleet base to assist coastal defense and to provide our fleet with a base when operating in the Far East. We will abandon the Philippines in 1946, so we must have a suitable base in the Far East, otherwise we will become a second-rate power in the Pacific. Since Guam is our territory and there is no reason to abandon it, why not fortify it?" According to some well-informed sources, the State Department is the most opposed to fortifying Guam. Guam has long been a demilitarized area. Admiral Hepburn also mentioned the status of Guam in his report released last week. According to the report, the island is 1,500 miles from Japan. If there is a submarine base there, it will be enough to prevent Japan from advancing south and west. However, due to Japan's opposition, how this matter should be handled must be determined by basic national policy. Hepburn's report said that building a submarine base on Guam would, first, protect the Philippines from the threat of a major war, second, make US coastal defense and defense in Hawaii extremely simple, and third, give the US fleet greater freedom of movement to cope with possible unexpected events in the Atlantic.

Short Commentary

### Gospel for Children

The fate of Chinese children has long been squeezed into the most unfortunate quagmire in the world. Widespread poverty prevents a surprisingly large number of children from receiving proper education, and the "blessing of education" received by a small number of so-called "lucky ones" is nothing more than sitting in a "children's prison," not to mention at home, but also at school. Therefore, the cry of "Save the children" has long been noticed by every person who cares about the education of our "next generation."

The sound of the all-out war of resistance broke the obstacles to national political progress. The education of the "next generation" was placed at the forefront of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and "breaking the children's prison" became a major task in saving the children. According to a special dispatch from our Chongqing on the 17th, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to elementary schools across the country strictly prohibiting corporal punishment. This may be the first step in breaking the children's prison and improving school education, and it can also be regarded as the first sound of liberation for children in the War of Resistance. We not only hope that teachers in elementary schools across the country will abide by this order and transform children's prisons into children's paradises, but we also hope that advanced members of society will assist the government in paying attention to the vast majority of children who are excluded from the doors of schools and who are displaced under the bombs of the invaders!

### The War Situation in North China is Becoming Increasingly Serious

After the Japanese army's five-pronged attack on Shanxi was defeated by us in the New Year of this year, they are now actively preparing for a larger-scale military invasion of the Northwest. A large number of Japanese troops are concentrating in Shanxi and Henan. In order to thwart the new offensive of the Japanese invaders, we have, on the one hand, completed the entire military deployment in the four northern provinces, and on the other hand, under the leadership of a certain route army, launched a large-scale battle to attack Rehe. There have been fierce battles in Malang Valley, and the Northeast Volunteer Army is also actively operating. The war situation in North China will become increasingly serious, which can be asserted.

The seriousness of the war situation in North China will inevitably contain a large number of Japanese troops. At least the fifteen divisions now in North China and the more than 300,000 Japanese troops in the Northeast will not be able to be transferred to other war zones, which will be of great help to the war of resistance in Central and South China. It is not difficult to imagine. It should be particularly pointed out here that our army in Central and South China has now reached the time to step up the implementation of a counter-offensive. Even in order to stop the new offensive of the Japanese army, we should not miss the opportunity to "seize the initiative." In order to achieve victory, every compatriot should more enthusiastically support and assist this counter-offensive.

### Review of American Far East Diplomacy, Translated by Zino from the December Issue of "Amerasia" Magazine Last Year

Two articles, "The First Anniversary of the Far Eastern War" by Professor P.H. Clyde of Columbia University, a leading authority on Far Eastern affairs, and "A Review of America's Loan Plans to China" by Jaffray, the editor of "Amerasia" magazine, were both published in "Amerasia". Professor Clyde raises three points for discussion: (1) America's interests in the Far East have been utterly ruined; (2) America's true will has been desecrated by Japan's war actions; and (3) Japan is visibly much weaker. Professor Clyde points out that because of these three points, the United States needs to re-evaluate its Far Eastern diplomatic policy. He then proposes four concrete solutions, which are summarized as follows: (1) Relief for innocent Chinese civilians; (2) Voluntary individual boycott of Japanese goods; (3) Stopping the sale of military supplies to Japan; (4) Striving for informal, credit-based (loan) practical assistance to China. Professor Clyde, with his keen insight, has formulated these proposals so as not to stir up the current psychological fear in America. There is nothing to say except unanimous approval for his suggestions. If Americans are to implement even this minimal step of relief, a psychological shift is also required. Currently, America is filled with a mad and paralyzing pacifism that endangers diplomatic actions and influences diplomatic thought.

The fundamental condition of a peaceful policy is based on the principles of law and their implementation, and on words that can be debated with the other party. Recently, the people of the United States have not fully understood these two conditions. It must be understood that the principles of law and their implementation are the guiding principles for a country's international relations. However, if a country only adopts these laws for itself and applies these laws as moral precepts for maintaining its foreign interests, then the entire system of peace based on these laws will be damaged in part. If a country disregards the rules of international conduct, regardless of the rights and obligations of international life; and other countries ignore such a chaotic international political situation because these rules cannot be implemented, then world peace can never be maintained.

These two basic conditions are not only despised by the United States, but at the same time, most people even deny their existence. The reason why this situation has evolved to this point is due to the fact that diplomatic relations have become a common matter in recent years. Unwillingness to go to war with an aggressor is one thing; inability to act based on reasonable or affirmative evidence is another. All human experience proves that defense for one's own benefit is paramount, thus enabling people and the environment to balance, and this golden rule exists indelibly. And now, the situation in the United States seemingly makes the government afraid of causing war, so it remains silent about any international rogue. The phrase "timid as a mouse" is the best portrayal of this fact. However, I don't believe that the American people are timid as mice, they are just at a loss.

What is most perplexing is the lack of action in dealing with international affairs. I believe that telling a country about the destruction or contempt for your interests is not a declaration of war. It is not an illegal action to ask a government to stop another country from harming the interests of its country and its people. There are so many ways to resolve international disputes, and the so-called active policy towards Japan will cause war is nothing more than a fantasy in a mirror.

Regarding this, we cannot but pay attention to our Far Eastern diplomatic policy. At the beginning of the "China Incident," the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan's concept of international law is a feasible rule derived from national action, so Japan demands to handle it on its own, and other countries have no room to interfere, and military actions are becoming more and more fierce. After the end of the war, if there is no social and economic revolution, Japan's position will be built on international law made in Tokyo.

Therefore, we should pay attention to the international law promoted and implemented by other countries in the Far East. The most interesting is Japan's concept of conquest. In Manchuria, there is a puppet state. On the surface, there is an independent government. In fact, it is completely under Japanese rule. This plan is an attempt to escape the condemnation of international law. Stating that it does not intend to invade other countries. However, the law-abiding world, the League of Nations and the United States created a principle of non-recognition in response. Therefore, among the countries of the world, only Germany, Italy, Poland and El Salvador maintain diplomatic relations with the pseudo-"Manchukuo." As a result, pseudo-"Manchukuo" has cut off all international relations, its currency is like waste paper outside the country, and it has no economic status in the world, thus Japan has increased many difficulties. Japan's political relations in the world are also difficult. Japan is not allowed to enter the financial markets of various countries. Japan's commercial treaty relations are also frozen, because Japan refuses to negotiate without a special treaty with "Manchukuo." Therefore, all countries do not endorse what Japan has done and do not agree with it.

In China proper, Japan has not come up with new political tricks. Japan is only setting up many puppet regimes and using the names of these pseudo-organizations to exploit China's resources. It is very clear that all the facilities of "Manchukuo" may be the first step for Japan to protect the interests of China proper, and these interests are closely related to all countries.

Japan's second frustrating problem is the "war" issue. It wants to avoid the US president implementing the Neutrality Act, and to prevent other countries from condemning it, so it says that this dispatch of troops to China is not intended for conquest, but only to force China to cooperate. Therefore, this dispute is not a formal war. In fact, this is a counterproductive trick. Since it is not a war, Japan cannot enjoy the rights of a belligerent. Therefore, it cannot implement the laws of war under international law. (To be continued)

### Lam Pak-sang, the Person Responsible for the "South China Daily" Who Signed and Published Wang Jingwei's Telegram Advocating Peace, Was Suddenly Attacked Yesterday: Two Youths Attacked with Iron Cones in Front of the Lane Crawford Building, Suffering Serious Injuries to the Head and Neck. One Suspect Was Arrested

At 5:15 PM yesterday, in front of the Lane Crawford Company on Des Voeux Road Central, a young man in a suit was suddenly attacked by two workers dressed as laborers, who used iron bars and iron cones to inflict serious injuries, leaving him unconscious. Afterwards, one person was arrested and identified as one of the attackers. The reporter immediately went to the scene of the incident to investigate. Later, it was learned that the young man in the suit was Lam Pak-sang, the person responsible for the Hong Kong South China Daily. On that day, Mr. Lam was walking to the front of the Lane Crawford Company when he encountered two laborers dressed as workers, who walked up to him. One of them first used an iron bar to strike Lam's neck with force. The other then used an iron cone to forcefully strike his head and neck, causing blood to gush out. The two workers continued to strike him, and his body and arms were injured by the iron bars and iron cones. Lam, having suffered these blows, fell unconscious to the ground. Seeing that Lam was injured, the two assailants immediately left. At that time, a Westerner nearby saw this scene and immediately helped the injured party while blowing a whistle. A British soldier happened to be passing by and arrested a passerby, who was identified as one of the attackers. The police then telegraphed the Central Police Station to report the case and telegraphed for an ambulance to take Lam to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, the injured person gradually regained consciousness after examination by the doctor. His injuries are not expected to be serious. It is learned that Lam Pak-sang is 37 years old and studied in Paris, France. At that time, Wang Jingwei happened to be in Paris. Lam convened a meeting of students studying in France in Paris to welcome Wang. This was the initial stage of the relationship between the two. Wang thought that Lam was very talented in writing, so he recruited him. When Wang established the South China Daily in Hong Kong, he appointed Lam to be in charge. When Wang later established the China Daily in Shanghai, Lam was again transferred to be in charge. Lam was very active in political circles because of his relationship with Wang Jingwei. Recently, he was also appointed as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Last month, Lam Pak-sang and Mei Si-ping jointly signed and sent Wang Jingwei's telegram advocating peace to famous newspapers in Hong Kong and China. The central government, because of Lam Pak-sang's actions, issued an order to strip him of his position as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Lam Pak-sang and Mei Si-ping had recently jointly issued a letter from Wang Jingwei to Chiang Kai-shek. The wording was very absurd. From this, it can be seen that Lam Pak-sang has a very deep understanding of Wang Jingwei himself. According to the reporter's investigation, Lam Pak-sang had made an appointment with several friends at 4:00 PM yesterday to go to the Lane Crawford Company's restaurant for afternoon tea. After tea at 5:00 PM, they dispersed. He also wanted to turn to Des Voeux Road Central, but he was attacked by the assailant at the side alley of the White House. The Hong Kong police detectives are taking this matter very seriously, because this matter is greatly related to the political aspect and the recent telegram from Wang Jingwei advocating peace. It is also learned that one of the arrested persons, named Chen Lin, 27 years old, claims to be a painter. He absolutely denied the sniping of Lam, but the police authorities, for the sake of prudence, are still detaining the person pending investigation.

### Order in Various Refugee Camps Is Good: Refugees Engage in Farming and Handicrafts. Education of Refugee Children Has Also Been Implemented Step by Step. The Hong Kong Government Is Preparing to Relieve Poor People Sleeping in the Open

In order to accommodate poor refugees, the Hong Kong government has built refugee camps in Kam Tin, Fanling, Ma Tau Chung, King's Park, and North Point. The total number of refugees accommodated in each camp is about 10,000. The management of each refugee camp is very strict and perfect. In addition to being well-fed and clothed, the refugees in the camps have started to learn small handicrafts or engage in farming. After a certain period of time, the refugees will be able to reach self-sufficiency. The government's establishment of refugee camps is not only to settle poor refugees, but also to solve the problem of homeless people in Hong Kong. Father Ryan, the secretary of the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, met with reporters yesterday morning and gave a detailed report on the current situation and management of the refugee camps in various districts of Hong Kong, which are recorded as follows:

Refugees in Kam Tin Engage in Farming

The Kam Tin refugee camp can originally accommodate 5,000 people, but some have already left the camp and returned to their hometowns. Currently, there are only 3,300 refugees in the camp. Two weeks ago, the camp had already started agriculture, with refugees responsible for farming. Every 50 people are in a team, and each team works for one week, six hours a day, in shifts. Refugees cultivate a total of nine acres of land. The land and seeds were borrowed by Deng Boqiu and other gentry in the New Territories. In addition to farming, refugees in Kam Tin also learn small handicrafts, such as making glass bottles and straw bags. Currently, 1,000 straw bags can be produced every day, and this number will increase in the future. A woodworking factory will also be established so that refugees can learn another skill. In the future, the selling price of the products will be distributed to the working refugees. It is expected that after the industrial development of the refugee camps in the future, the refugees will be able to achieve self-sufficiency.

Schools for Refugee Children Established in Fanling

There are three refugee camps in Fanling: one in the north of Fanling, one in the south of Fanling, and the other in Cha Kwo Ling. The three camps accommodate a total of 1,500 refugees. Due to local environmental conditions, no handicrafts have been organized, nor has land been found for refugees to cultivate. There are a total of 200 refugee children in the Fanling refugee camp. In order to prevent refugee children from becoming accustomed to laziness, the refugee camp management authorities have established two schools for refugee children, so that refugee children can read and write, and will not become illiterate when they grow up. The two schools have achieved good results and may be expanded in the future. At the same time, the issue of refugees producing their own goods is also being considered. Once a good method is found, it can be implemented.

Order in Various Camps in the City Is Good

The number of refugees accommodated in the various refugee camps in the city is about 4,000. The King's Park camp accommodates 1,607 people, North Point 1,471 people, and the Ma Tau Chung camp originally accommodated 1,008 people, but because a part of it was allocated to accommodate Chinese troops returning from British territory, it currently only accommodates 817 refugees. There are refugee children's schools in the North Point refugee camp with a total of four classes and 200 students. The number of students can be expanded to 500 in the future. The handicrafts learned by the refugees in North Point are sewing and weaving rattan ware. Women also take on cooking work. The refugees in the King's Park camp are also engaged in small handicrafts. There are 60 women in the camp engaged in sewing and embroidery. The Ma Tau Chung camp plans to establish a soap manufacturing factory, which will be realized in a short period of time. The refugees in each camp are working hard and will have a huge output in the future. The selling price of the products is received by the refugees themselves, so the refugees are happy to work and hope to achieve self-sufficiency. The order in each camp is very good.

The Government Pays Attention to Relieving the Poor

Mr. Lai continued that the main purpose of the Hong Kong government's construction of refugee camps is to accommodate refugees coming to Hong Kong from the war zone, but the current camps have not been filled, and there are currently no refugees coming to Hong Kong. It is expected that there will not be a large number of refugees coming to Hong Kong in the future. The government authorities plan to use refugee camps to accommodate poor people sleeping on the streets in Hong Kong. They have just started to investigate the number of people sleeping on the streets and are preparing to transfer the homeless to refugee camps. This plan of the government is actually killing two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it provides a home for the poor sleeping on the streets, and on the other hand, it can improve the appearance of the city, which is the best way. Moreover, there are industries in the refugee camps, and the poor can learn skills after entering the camps, and may reach a self-sufficient stage in the future, which is better than wandering on the streets. This plan of the government will be realized in a short period of time.

### The Federation of All Circles Will Supplement the Collection of Membership Fees. A Resolution Was Passed Yesterday to Send Letters to Various Members Seeking Opinions

The Hong Kong Federation of All Circles held its 32nd joint meeting at Tung Wah Hospital yesterday. Dozens of representatives from various groups attended. The chairman, Liu Qingxuan of the General Affairs Group, after passing the minutes of the previous meeting, first reported the work of each group separately, and then continued to discuss the proposals of each group. As a result, it was resolved: (1) To retroactively approve the appropriation of National Currency 2,000 yuan by the Standing Committee to relieve refugees in Boluo County. (2) The requests for assistance from the 5th Detachment of the 1st District and the guerrillas in the Dongbao-Hui border area are not to be discussed because the government has an overall plan for the guerrillas. (3) To reply in writing to the letter from the Panyu Association inquiring about the original text of the resolution of the 30th meeting, which appropriated 5,000 yuan to relieve refugees in northern Yu. (4) To ask the nursing groups among the members to submit written reports on their organization and work for reference when sending teams back to China. (5) In the future, proposals from various members should be submitted in writing to the Standing Committee for review and then submitted to the General Assembly. (6) To send letters to various members soliciting opinions on whether the Federation should supplement the collection of membership fees as a General Assembly fund, and to stipulate the membership fee rate.

### The China Art Troupe Performed for the First Time Yesterday: "Song of Righteousness" Resounded Through the Clouds

Since its establishment, the China Art Troupe has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life with its large number of talents and great plans. As the theater movement in Hong Kong is becoming more and more popular this year, the China Art Troupe held its first performance at the Central Theatre. People from all walks of life were eager to see it first. Starting at noon, the Central Theatre was crowded with men and women. The program on that day was "Song of Righteousness," which described the political awakening of the guerrilla team in the mainland and the process of cooperation between the army and the people. The plot was extremely moving, especially the realistic performances of "Captain Liu Guan" Yuan Rikui and "Big Red Shoes" Yao Ersao, which aroused the admiration of the audience. At the end, the "Song of Righteousness" resounded through the clouds, and the crowd left the venue with a renewed spirit. The evening show, "Getting Carried Away," was a work specially directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, hired by the troupe. The plot was elegant and popular, and the purpose of the play was pure. By afternoon, the tickets were sold out, and many spectators were turned away. Li Hua, the director of the troupe's front desk, repeatedly expressed his regret to the latecomers and hoped that they would come early today.

### ×Armed Tugboat Robbed a Cargo Ship in the Waters of Mas Bay. The Ship Met a British Warship on the Way and Escaped

The hijacking of Hong Kong fishing boats and cargo ships by armed tugboats has been happening recently. Although the Hong Kong naval authorities have repeatedly issued serious warnings, the rampant actions of the ×people at sea remain the same. According to the "South China Morning Post" yesterday morning, at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month, in the eastern waters of Mas Bay in the Chinese Sea, a cargo ship No. 565 registered in Hong Kong suddenly encountered a ×armed tugboat. Seeing the cargo ship passing by from afar, the tugboat chased closely, firing three volleys of shots along the way. The shots were as dense as a string of beads and were very fierce. The bullets hit the side of the ship, as dense as a honeycomb. Seeing that the situation was not good, the shipowner Li Shan ordered all the crew members on board to lie down in the cabin to avoid being shot, allowing the cargo ship to drift in the sea. Before long, the ×tugboat had caught up, lowered a small boat carrying five ×soldiers, and approached the cargo ship. They swarmed aboard, pointed guns at everyone on the ship, searched the ship, and then snatched the ship's license plate. Then, they forced the shipowner and crew to get on the ×small boat, and then hijacked the cargo ship. Not long after the ×ship sailed away, the British warship HMS Danae happened to pass by and rescued Li and others. They asked about the situation, and Li told them everything. The captain immediately telegraphed back to Hong Kong to report the hijacking of the cargo ship and tracked it forward. In an instant, they caught up. Seeing that the situation was not good, the ×ship reluctantly released the captured cargo ship. The British warship did not go too far and towed the cargo ship back, thus avoiding being hijacked. Fortunately, there was no other major loss besides the ship's license plate.

### Good Times Don't Last Long: Last Year, the Total Trade Volume of Hong Kong Broke the Record of Previous Years. The Whole Year Increased by More Than 40 Million Compared with the Previous Year. After ×Invaded Southern China, It Has Been Sharply Reduced Compared with Before

Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, before Southern China was invaded, Hong Kong, with its special status, had an exceptionally prosperous trade in various aspects. The monthly trade reports of the Statistics Department broke all previous records. However, since the outbreak of the war in Southern China, it has been declining day by day. However, the annual statistics, due to the good harvest in the first half of the year, can also create a new record of import and export trade in previous years. According to the report of the Statistics Bureau, the trade figures for December last year decreased by 15,291,508 yuan compared with the same month in 1937. However, the annual statistics reached 113,071,214 yuan, which is 44,568,526 yuan more than the previous year.

The Annual Statistics Exceeded the Previous Year

The total import trade for the year was 61,816,8937 yuan, which is 1,100,4970 yuan more than the previous year. The total export trade was 51,119,2277 yuan, which is 44,579,556 yuan more than the previous year. However, this import and export statistics does not include goods transshipped through Hong Kong to other places, items carried by tourists, and the value of equipment and treasures used by the military.

It Began to Dim After Guangzhou Fell

Since ×invaded Southern China, Hong Kong's foreign trade has become dim, especially in December. The import trade in that month was only 46,496,841 yuan, while the same month in the previous year was 49,342,058 yuan. The export trade was only 33,535,169 yuan.

Trade with China Broke Records

Last year, the total trade with China reached 463,991,816 yuan, an increase of 62,269,645 yuan compared with the previous year. Among them, the import trade was 233,264,347 yuan, and the previous year's figure was 211,321,185 yuan. The export trade was 230,727,469 yuan, an increase of 40,326,483 yuan compared with the previous year's figure.

Trade in Southern China Has Been Reduced by More Than Half

It dropped sharply to a low level in December. The value of imports from China was only 4,649,061 yuan, while the same month in the previous year was 15,761,968 yuan. Imports to China also fell to 7,717,927 yuan. Among them, trade with Southern China was the most significant. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the value of imports from various ports in Southern China such as Haikou, Jiangmen, Wuzhou, Ganzhou, and Yunnan was only 5,308,836 yuan, while the previous year was 12,411,036 yuan. The value of exports to the above-mentioned places was only 3,500,888 yuan, while the previous year was 14,409,998 yuan. The annual statistics of trade with Southern China increased by 6,045,979 yuan compared with the previous year. The total value of export trade was 139,643,818 yuan, and the total value of import trade was 105,569,145 yuan.

Exports of Gold and Silver Surpassed Imports

Last year, the total value of gold and silver exported from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom and the United States was 18,810,3656 yuan, while the value of imports from China was 9,600,1218 yuan. From January of the previous year to the present, the total value of gold and silver bars and treasures exported from Hong Kong was 583,350,180 yuan, while the total value of imports was 396,050,173 yuan. Among the above-mentioned imports and exports of treasures, gold and silver bars were mostly exported by the Chinese government to the United Kingdom and the United States.

Hong Kong Is the Center for Tea Exports

Regarding the fact that Hong Kong was the center for tea exports last year, it was mentioned in this newspaper a few days ago. The following figures will illustrate it. Last year, the value of tea imported into Hong Kong was 16,926,951 yuan, and in 1937, it was 3,620,211 yuan. Last year, the largest amount of tea exported from Hong Kong was shipped to Vladivostok, a total of 16,772,110 pounds worth 9 million yuan. Egypt was also a good customer, but what they bought was cheap tea, the quantity was 2 million pounds worth 162,000 yuan. In the past, this trade was entirely purchased directly from domestic suppliers by land, but due to the war, it was changed to sea transport. However, since the outbreak of the war in Southern China, the land and water transportation between here and Guangzhou has been cut off, and this superior market will not be able to continue to be maintained this year.

### The Manufacturers Association Will Continue to Hold the Chinese Goods Exhibition This Spring. The Scale of This Exhibition in Mid-February Will Be Larger Than Last Year

After the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association established the Chinese Goods Exhibition at St. Paul's College last year, people from all walks of life were able to have a better understanding of the products of the manufacturers here, and the prospects for domestic products benefited greatly. The association recently believes that it is necessary to continue to hold the National Exhibition in Hong Kong this year, as the population has increased sharply. It specially convened a special meeting of the board of directors at 12:00 yesterday to consider and study the exhibition date and all the methods for a long time. Decisions have been made on the exhibition date and all the methods. The exhibition period is scheduled for four consecutive days from February 19. After all the articles of association and personnel methods have been revised, they will be officially announced within days. It is heard that the directors of the association are very concerned about this year's exhibition. Although last year's exhibition has been well received by all parties, in order to make it even better and more perfect, they are very active in the operation of the exhibition. It is found that this year's site is larger than last year's, and the organizers have the experience of last year to participate in the government, so the future achievements will be more advanced than before.

### Jinshan Steamer Returns to Hong Kong from Guangzhou Yesterday: Resumption of Guangdong-Hong Kong Navigation Not Yet Easy; Carrying Fifty-Seven Passengers, Absolutely No Cargo; Navigation Conditions Not Finalized, Today Changing Course to Hong Kong-Macau

The Jinshan vessel of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company, which departed from Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 11th of this month, staying in the province for a week, returned to Hong Kong yesterday morning at 8:15 am, arriving at 3:15 pm, and docked at the Triangular Pier.

Fifty-Seven Passengers Returned to Hong Kong

Upon investigation, there were fifty-seven passengers returning to Hong Kong on the steamer yesterday. Among them, forty were foreigners, including British and American merchants, as well as some reporters from × side and secret agents. There were fourteen Chinese passengers, including women and children, who were working in Shamian. They all traveled in the first-class dining room and dining hall seats. There were also two Chinese who seemed to be specially dispatched by × side to Hong Kong, seated in certain first-class cabins, acting suspiciously. After the ship docked, they immediately disembarked. The steamer did not carry any cargo on this return trip, but the furniture and household items filled almost the entire ship's hold, all purchased cheaply in Guangzhou by foreigners and transported to Hong Kong.

Conditions Not Finalized, Changing Course to Macau

Whether the Jinshan steamer would continue to sail to the province after returning to Hong Kong was of great interest to the general public. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Mr. Lu Si, the general manager of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company, to inquire whether the Jinshan steamer would sail to the province again or change its route after returning to Hong Kong. According to Mr. Lu, the Jinshan steamer's recent trip to the province was a trial run, not a complete resumption of the Guangdong-Hong Kong line. Currently, the company and the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have not yet fully agreed on the restoration plan, and there are still some conditions under negotiation. It is still uncertain whether a satisfactory solution can be reached in the future. Therefore, the Jinshan steamer will not sail to Guangzhou again for the time being after returning to Hong Kong. Only after the negotiated conditions are properly resolved can this be discussed. The Jinshan steamer is scheduled to change course to Macau tomorrow (today) at 5:30 pm, returning to Hong Kong from Macau at 3:00 am the following morning. The future sailing schedule will continue as such, he said.

× Will Subsidize Various Shipping Companies

According to another unconfirmed report, the × side does not allow cargo to be carried on the resumed Guangdong-Hong Kong ships as a way to monopolize navigation rights on the Pearl River. However, in the current situation, if the Guangdong-Hong Kong ships resume operations, there will be very few passengers, making it difficult to maintain. The shipping companies are actually suffering significant losses. Therefore, for the resumption of the Guangdong-Hong Kong line, only carrying passengers is merely being used by the × side, and many companies are unwilling to make unnecessary losses. Many are considering abandoning the line and making other plans. It is said that the × side will provide limited assistance to compensate the losses of the shipping companies so that they can continue to operate. This is what was heard, but its accuracy remains to be verified.

Special Article from This Newspaper

### Interview with Mr. Lu Guangmian: A Discussion on China's New Industry in Development

— Qi Zhuo

Wishing Visionary Capitalists to Actively Invest

Mr. Lu Guangmian, the director of the Northwest Regional Office of the China Industrial Cooperative Association, reported on the wartime industrial situation in the rear at yesterday's welcome meeting of the Women's慰勞会 (comforting association). This was noted in yesterday's newspaper. This reporter made another special visit to Mr. Lu yesterday and obtained many valuable materials that should be reported to overseas Chinese who are concerned about national affairs:

Mr. Lu returned to China from the United Kingdom in 1932. From 1933, he worked with Nankai University, the China Vocational Education Association, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Qilu University, and Jin Cheng Bank, among other groups, to form the North China Agricultural Improvement Society, dedicated to improving agriculture in North China. Because the work progressed smoothly and the enterprise developed rapidly, this North China Agricultural Improvement Society, together with the Economic Commission, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the North China Cooperation Committee, formed the semi-official North China Cotton Production Improvement Association. It achieved rapid progress in improving seeds, rural cooperation, educating the public, and transporting cotton to the United States..., laying the foundation for a new agriculture in the provinces of North China. In recent years, Mr. Lu has been working hard on this emerging enterprise, developing a relationship with North China.

When the July 7th Incident broke out, the association had more than one million loans that could not be recovered from farmers. With the expansion of the occupied areas, the work was naturally affected.

At the time of the incident, Mr. Lu was still in Beiping. He moved to the Pinghan Road area with his colleagues to carry out arduous organizational and production work. Until the China Industrial Cooperative Association was established last autumn, Mr. Lu took office as the head of the Organization Group and the director of the Northwest Regional Office, going to the Northwest to develop wartime industry.

In addition to various daily necessities, the association is currently able to produce military industries such as alcohol and bombs, and production is gradually increasing. According to Mr. Lu's practical experience, after a large number of refugees moved to the interior, the urgent task is to develop production, both to supply daily necessities and to lay the foundation for new industries; on the other hand, to enable refugees to participate in production work and prevent them from wandering. The greatest role is that because the people are organized and productivity is increased, before the local area is occupied, it can help the development of guerrilla warfare in various places. In the event that the local area is occupied, these organized production elements are the basic elements of the guerrilla team. This is indeed a problem worth considering in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

Regarding the favorable conditions for wartime industrial development, the first is that there are many refugees, and manpower can be easily mobilized; the second is that the interior is rich in raw materials, making it easy to develop industry; the third is that the outbreak of war and the obstruction of transportation make imported goods scarce, which is an excellent opportunity to revitalize new industries. Mr. Lu briefly mentioned this in the welcome meeting the day before yesterday, but the difficulties in developing industry at present were not mentioned at that time, and I would like to ask the people of the country to pay special attention to them.

According to Mr. Lu's words to the reporter, the difficulties currently encountered in developing new industries are: The first is insufficient capital. Although the Executive Yuan has allocated a fund of 5 million yuan and a recurring expense of 500,000 yuan per year, to open various factories in various places on a large scale, the capital is still insufficient. At this time, the government has a hundred things to be done, and the power to develop industry is really only so much. Therefore, we can only hope that Chinese and foreign people will actively invest. Many foreign people with far-sighted vision have already enthusiastically assisted, and we also hope that the financial circles and capitalists at home and abroad will actively invest for the country and for the cause to facilitate the development of new industries. Whether viewed from the perspective of resistance or national construction, this is an extremely meaningful plan. Miss Pu Yihua De, a Westerner who came with Mr. Lu, is also responsible for appealing to Chinese and foreign people to actively invest. I believe that the visionary financial circles and capitalists will not miss this opportunity. China's War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the time when China's industry develops will also be the day when individual investment succeeds.

The second is the lack of talent. Many educated intellectuals mostly like to be officials and despise industry, which is also a reason why industry cannot develop. Today, we urgently need to change the general public's concept from education, eliminate erroneous ideas, take national interests as the premise, and make China a healthy modern country as soon as possible.

The third is the backwardness of technology and the lack of specialized talent. For example, there is a current shortage of imported matches, and the scales on bones everywhere are raw materials, but there is a lack of specialized talent to use and invent these readily available things. Recalling fifty years ago, when our relationship with foreign countries was distant, we were still able to produce various beautiful clothing items ourselves, which shows that we can independently produce with our own raw materials. Because we rely on imported goods, we have weakened our creativity instead. Now, we urgently need specialized talent to invent more in this area. For example, there is an extreme shortage of glass in the interior, and a small piece of glass is very expensive. Since the industrial sector developed the glass industry in the interior, the production of glass is no longer a problem.

The above is a summary of what Mr. Lu said. Mr. Lu will return to Chongqing during the day and then go to the Northwest to continue his work. Offices will be set up in Hong Kong and various parts of Southeast Asia to facilitate the work. This is really an urgent matter at hand, and I deeply hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it.

### A Guangzhou Tale of Blood and Tears

— Luo Xia

Amidst the constant rumors of the resumption of Guangdong-Hong Kong navigation, the Jinshan steamer of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company finally carried passengers and returned to Guangzhou, the city of rams, which is the cultural essence of South China after the calamity. This trial voyage can be considered a success. Yesterday afternoon, this angel connecting Guangdong-Hong Kong traffic - the Jinshan steamer, crawled back to Hong Kong waters again, and also brought back many stories full of blood and tears that we cannot bear to hear. Here, let me introduce the general situation:

Guangzhou in ××

On the morning of the 11th, the Jinshan steamer, driven by the morning breeze, surged forward through the blue waves. Four hours later, it had entered the territorial waters of the motherland. Humen, which dominates the corner of the sea, stands tall in the wind, quietly allowing the vast river water to batter it. All the steel cannons have been dismantled. Passing by "Xinzao" again, only ashes are seen flying, and there is no sound of people. Before long, the ship arrived at the provincial river. The first thing that catches the eye is the Xihoukou and the Xiguan area, the most lively places, which have all become scorched earth. The long Changdi embankment no longer has the enchanting scenery of Pearl Girls calling for ferries and tourists strolling. Only dilapidated cars and iron nets are piled up on Changdi to prevent people from smuggling. South of the provincial river and east of Jinghai Road is a desolate area with few inhabitants. The once prosperous and beautiful Wuyang has turned into ashes!

A World of Darkness

The most quintessential part of the city is the Daiheji area. Thousands upon thousands of hooligans, local bullies, robbers, prisoners, and all kinds of criminals have converged there. The human flesh market and the general assembly of dirty things are located there. Gambling and opium smoking are mixed together, making it extremely lively. There are very few who operate in firewood, rice, and daily necessities, so these things are particularly expensive.

Besides the × army, the ones maintaining law and order there are the Self-Defense Corps. These Self-Defense Corps are all "supernatural" types. Not to mention catching thieves, they are also trying to make money in various ways! Once dusk falls, shadows disappear, and the × army also returns to its nest. Robbers and thieves then act in all directions. Murder and robbery are like everyday meals. Even the most powerful old man dares not come out to interfere in such things. It is said that on the fifteenth night, more than a hundred households near Dajitou were robbed. The terrifying situation there can be seen. Therefore, there is a popular saying: "× army during the day, thieves at night"!

××××××

×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××

Forced Use of × Currency

Compatriots staying in Guangzhou, in addition to receiving 'special' treatment in everything, must also obediently use × currency. The emperor's notices are posted on the streets. Those "military tickets" that are worthless when brought to Hong Kong must be used there, where the exchange rate is 30% higher for silver dollars and 80% higher per yuan for fractional currency. If you dare to utter half a "no," you will be arbitrarily labeled as "discriminating against × currency," and then your head will surely move!

An Interesting Story

Amidst the sounds of our army counterattacking Guangzhou and the elusive attacks of our heroic guerrillas, the × army is really anxious and disturbed in their dreams. It is said that the × army stationed on Phoenix Hill is close to the mountains and fields. At night, the fierce north wind rustles the weeds, and when the × people wake up from their dreams, they think it is the guerrillas coming, and they cannot help but panic. This needless worrying has happened countless times, so the × army decided to burn all the weeds to avoid future troubles. Who knew that not burning them would have been better, because burning them brought a major disaster. The reason is that there were two unexploded bombs buried there. The fire ignited the fuses, and with a loud bang, hundreds of × soldiers were blown to pieces and flew in the air. After this bombing, the × soldiers traveling alone dared not go far. What a ridiculous thing this is!

It is also heard that the rift between the × army and the navy is very deep. The navy issues boat flags of different clans, but they are often torn up by the × army, and the boat families are treated unfavorably. Even those boat households who have army passage flags are often refused passage by the × navy. Therefore, when sailing on the river, the boat households use navy flags, and when docking, they use army flags to cope with this helpless environment. But even so, they still often encounter unexpected disasters.

Finally, there are many facts that cannot be recorded, which is naturally a regret. However, I believe that everyone who sees the above facts will feel ashamed of Guangzhou on the one hand and miss Guangzhou on the other hand. Finally, they must be determined to eliminate all the darkness and return to Guangzhou!

Traffic and Travel

### Diary on the Way from Wuzhou to Liuzhou

— Xiao Wen

October 25, 27th Year [1938] Trapped in Wuzhou for nearly ten days, and again forced to flee to another place due to the changing situation. There are very few ships from Wuzhou to Liuzhou, because the spring flood season has passed, the water is shallow against the current, and even if small steamships are used to tow them, the journey of fifty or sixty miles takes four or five days. Moreover, it is rumored that the authorities are sealing the ships, and once they leave, they will never return. Most ships are unwilling to go, stopping only at Shilong in Xiang County. Beyond that, the flow against the current is turbulent, and there are many more dangers. It is better to transfer to a train to Liuzhou, which is safer. Here and now, the sound of the wind and grass is disturbing, and those who flee are ten times more numerous than ships. After trying all means, I finally secured only a few cabins. The ship is named Minfu and is towed by a steamship. Due to the loading of cargo, the departure is at midnight. Therefore, I have enough time to pack my luggage. However, the new house, which I have lived in for less than ten days, is neatly arranged. Once it must be abandoned. Such is the tongue of a refugee. By evening, it was rumored that Wushan would be under martial law after twelve o'clock. At ten o'clock, I hurriedly hired a porter to carry my luggage to the pier. Unexpectedly, the Minfu ferry was already full of passengers. Although I had reserved a cabin seat, the luggage was complicated and there was no way to deal with it. The open space was first occupied by those who were quick-footed. Even the ground was full of people, with almost no place to insert a foot. So I tried to stuff and hide the luggage, and the rest was piled on the cabin, forming a castle. After the busy work, I was covered in sweat. Fortunately, the ship set sail immediately, and the river wind blew, which was refreshing. Looking back at the shore, the lights were sparse. After ten days, Wuzhou said goodbye again. Tired from the late night work, I fell asleep, not knowing that I was on the ship.

October 26 Woke up from a dream, not knowing that the east had already turned white. After a while, the ship stopped, saying "We have arrived at Teng County." Guests boarded, mostly students returning to their hometowns, with no place to stay, only piling their luggage along the ship's edge and sitting on it. Teng County is the area I have visited before, and recently friends have temporarily stayed there. Looking into the distance, I can't help but feel a sense of vicissitudes. The ship is still stable in the river, no different from living in a house. However, Wu Jun's two sisters were seasick, not eating or drinking, not knowing why. Along the way, we passed through Mengjiang and Baima, where people got on and off, making it crowded and unbearable. Bored on the ship, there are mountains by the window. The scenery of western Guangdong is different from other places. However, Wuteng is not a scenic area in Guangxi, and I have been here several times, so I don't feel any strangeness. I brought a translated version of Tolstoy's Resurrection in my luggage and finished reading it, not knowing that the shipman had brought food. At dusk, the ship docked at Jiangkou. Jiangkou is a common name for locals, actually Dahuangkou. Small boats approached to sell cakes, pastries, pomelos, and oranges. Many people bought them. There was little cargo on the ship and people are hungry. There was no wind that night, it was sultry, and the ship did not sail in the heart of the river, fearing that the beaches along the way were dangerous and it would be difficult to travel at night.

October 27 We arrived in Guiping in the morning. Guiping is a major port on the waterway, with more Rong falling. I will move to the ground before I leave, so I can stretch my feet a little. There are often sandy beaches on the way, some stretching for several miles, desolate and useless, but the mountains and rivers are more picturesque, and you can look into the distance or look at them at eye level. The wonders of the mountains and rivers of western Guangdong are only beautiful here. Xu Xiake's so-called "turning the stream into a hole" water flow can be seen in its true form. Small boats passing here are reversing and flowing horizontally, inevitably tilting and sinking. The ancients called it a dead place, hidden in a wild area, which is probably not wrong. We moored in Wuxuan in the evening, and the wind picked up after dinner, which was a little cooler. It suddenly rained, and the roof of the ship leaked, soaking the beds everywhere. There was no way to arrange them. I rolled up the quilt and shrunk my feet, and didn't sleep well all night, unable to bear the misery.

October 28 Arrived at Shitou around 9 o'clock in the morning. After going ashore, the stone steps were very high, dozens of steps in all. It is said that only a few steps are exposed during the floods, so the state of the water can be imagined. Entering the town, there were no buses to Liuzhou that day, so I temporarily stayed in a hotel. The simplicity of the hotel made it unbearable to live in, but after a few days of hardship, drinking a cup of clear tea was like drinking sweet nectar. A small shop is better than living on a boat.

### Cargo Transportation at the North Shanghai Railway Station: Railway Staff and Tax Collectors' Multiple Layers of Exploitation; Unequal Freight Rates with Ulterior Motives

(Shanghai Correspondence) Since the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways fell into enemy hands, and the invaders, after military transport, allowed passenger and freight transport, the ruined and desolate North Railway Station has experienced a slight revival.

In the past, this metropolis—Shanghai—relied on the railways to bear the heavy responsibility of absorbing and releasing goods. On the railway side, there were the Mackinnon Road Station, the North Station, the Rihui Port Station, and the South Station. Now, the South Station is completely closed off. Although there were early rumors that the Mackinnon Road Station would open soon, it has not yet happened. The Rihui Port Station has a bit of cargo being unloaded due to its advantageous location on the Huangpu River, but there are no goods being shipped out because permission has not yet been granted. Besides these, there is only the North Railway Station. Currently, the North Station is relatively busy and lively, with cargo being shipped out and goods being transported in.

Generally speaking, the situation of unloading cargo arriving at the North Station is not much different from the past. However, the unloaded cargo has no warehouse to be stored in and can only be piled up in the open air. Furthermore, after the abolition of *likin*, which the invaders once used as an excuse to criticize China for lacking organization and which had been absent for several years, tax collectors have now reappeared under the bayonets of the invaders. Brand new figures have risen and are reaching out for money for every item.

The situation of shipping out cargo is absolutely not as simple and smooth as it used to be. If you have goods to be shipped out, you must first register several days in advance. After the person in charge of registration allows you to register, they will give you a "cargo space permit" about the size of a bean curd. It specifies the date on which you are allowed to bring the cargo to the North Station. Only on that designated date can you bring the goods. However, you must first take this "cargo space permit" to the person in charge of cargo space and ask him to assign a location. At this time, if you only take the "cargo space permit," you will not get a location. You must give him five or ten yuan in legal tender to get your wish fulfilled. After the person in charge of cargo space approves your location, he will note the cargo space number on the "cargo space permit." Only then is the procedure complete, and you can bring your cargo to the designated cargo space for storage. If you do not get the approval of the person in charge of cargo space, the "cargo space permit" issued at the time of registration is equivalent to waste paper. Not only will there be no space for you to pile up, but even the soldiers guarding the vehicle yard gate will not let you pass with the cargo. Before August 13th, the North Station often had many goods awaiting shipment piled up in the open air or even on the roads outside the warehouse because there were too few warehouses. After the war, the few warehouses that existed were either destroyed or mostly unwilling to publicly store goods. Therefore, even if you spent money to buy cargo space, it is only an open space in the open air.

After the cargo is piled up in the cargo space, you must then request a vehicle to load it. This also requires spending twenty or thirty yuan of inexplicable money. Otherwise, even if you wait for several days, a vehicle will not be assigned. And Chinese-run transport companies cannot directly request a vehicle; they must entrust it to a foreign transport company. At the very least, they must hire a few foreign people. This, of course, requires spending a lot of unjust money. Furthermore, goods being shipped out must have a "procurement permit," which most Chinese-run transport companies cannot obtain. They can only temporarily spend twenty or thirty yuan per vehicle to buy one from others.

In the past, freight calculations were divided into six detailed grades. Now, they are roughly divided into three grades. However, less than a full vehicle load is not graded.

Silk fabrics, satin, groceries, etc., are first-class freight rates.

Artificial silk, cotton yarn, foreign cloth, native cloth, eggs, dried cocoons, flour, foreign candles, cigarettes, sugar, coal, iron, etc., are second-class freight rates.

Cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, salt, etc., are third-class freight rates.

According to the above classification, we can clearly see its purpose. The so-called third-class goods, which have cheaper freight rates, are entirely Chinese bulk products and the things that the invaders urgently need.

The current freight rate from Shanghai to Hangzhou is two yuan and fifty-five cents per ton for a full vehicle load of second-class goods; to Nanjing, three yuan and sixty cents; Wuxi, two yuan and sixty cents; Suzhou, two yuan and twenty cents; Jiaxing, two yuan and thirty-five cents; Songjiang, two yuan and thirty cents, plus four types of miscellaneous fees such as loading fees and unloading fees, each costing sixteen cents per ton, totaling sixty-four cents. Furthermore, the Communication and Transportation Corporation charges an additional fifty cents per ton for full vehicle loads, regardless of distance, and an additional fifty cents per load for less than full vehicle loads. The so-called Communication and Transportation Corporation is the railway's freight manager, responsible for the appointment and expenses of all freight personnel on the entire line.

All the vehicles for loading goods on both lines were taken away when the Chinese army retreated to the west. The vehicles now in use were transported from elsewhere, each carrying fifteen tons, but charging freight for thirteen tons.

Due to the shortage of vehicles and their small size, there is insufficient allocation. Therefore, Chinese-run transport companies cannot directly request vehicles. Because the purpose of some people is to make illicit fortunes, just like in other places, it has created many situations of exploitation and extortion. The "staff" inside the station determines the amount of their special fees based on the quantity of goods and the number of vehicles each day. And many foreign transport companies or individuals, relying on their inherent advantages to obtain vehicles, do not load their own goods—or simply have no goods to load—and transfer them to unlucky Chinese people at high prices, like renting out a house.

Currently, goods transported to or from the North Station are subject to a 5% tax on the original price, collected by people sent there by the "Shanghai Municipal Government." Those tax-collecting clowns understand nothing but extortion. Therefore, when assessing the price, they often estimate it arbitrarily. If you want to reason with them, reason simply does not exist there. However, this does not mean that they are "loyal to their duties." The situation is often like this: for example, if you have a batch of goods, they want to estimate the original price at 3,000 yuan and donate 150 yuan. After agreeing, they write a donation ticket for 50 yuan, collect 50 yuan from you, and tell you about the rest. Contact someone in a certain place, which is often a large hotel or inn south of the Garden Bridge, or perhaps even a brothel. If you go there at eight or nine o'clock, you would have to pay him 100 yuan. But because this goes into his private pocket, you can get a 50% discount and only pay him 50 yuan.

If you paid the money in that place, if you want to know where their money went, just look around, and you will know everything: smoking opium, gambling, drinking, playing with women, the whole set. The tax-collecting clowns and foreign staff on the railway are exactly the same. Not only do they pocket the money for their own indulgence, but they sometimes also pull many transport company employees along to have fun until dawn, causing people to pay extra, not only materially but also spiritually.

Because the North Station is no longer desolate, people are renting the damaged houses on Qiujiang Road. The houses in this area are now considered confiscated. Therefore, when renting, you have to rent from the "Foreign Residents Group." The rent is about a few yuan per month, but what they give you is just a dilapidated house, not repaired. You have to repair it yourself. Therefore, some people rent a house and spend four or five hundred yuan to repair it. This kind of renting situation is truly unprecedented.

Currently, the cargo transportation at the North Station is relatively busy. At the same time, the pockets of certain people, as well as hotels, inns, brothels, opium, gambling, and alcohol, are also busy. On the other hand, it is precisely the accelerated flow of the workers' blood and sweat. (Qi Xia)

### Overview of the Local Piece Goods Industry

For decades, the Hong Kong piece goods market has been dominated by England, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The annual trade volume reaches 13-14 million yuan. For Hong Kong, a small place, to have such sales achievements is undoubtedly huge. Eight years ago, Japan's domestic industry gradually developed, and piece goods began to be transported to Hong Kong for sales. Because the goods were cheap and the styles were new, Chinese people mostly favored their low prices and good quality, and competed to buy them. Japanese goods gradually gained prominence in the Hong Kong market. Although European and American piece goods were of better quality, the price difference was too large, and the market was gradually eroded by the Japanese. Especially in the past five or six years, Japanese goods have become even more prosperous in the Hong Kong market, accounting for 60% of the total annual trade volume of piece goods in Hong Kong, while Europe and America only account for 40%. The goods that the Japanese transport to Hong Kong for sale are divided into winter and summer types. Winter goods are dominated by velvet, with the most styles, followed by mixed velvet and cotton velvet. Summer goods are mostly artificial silk fabrics, accounting for 90% of the imported goods. The rest are bamboo gauze, mixed cloth, white cloth, and linen cloth. Currently, the buckram sold in the Hong Kong market is all Japanese goods. Determining European and American goods, the annual European and American goods transported to Hong Kong have increased to more than three million yuan, which is much different from the one to two million yuan sold last year. The most imports from Europe and America this year are from England and Germany, followed by Italy, then France, and the least from the United States. Winter velvet includes wool clothing, overcoat, tuxedo yarn, light velvet, enterprise velvet, and sea tiger velvet. Summer goods are mostly bamboo gauze, mixed cloth, linen cloth, refreshing velvet, and white cloth. The United States mainly exports canvas. The goods transported to Hong Kong are not only sold locally, but most of them are transported to Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou Bay, and North China for sale. Before the war, European and American goods worth more than one million yuan were sold to Guangzhou annually, and Japanese goods worth more than two million yuan. In Fuzhou, Hankou, Xiamen, Changsha and other places, European and American goods accounted for more than one million yuan, and Japanese goods also accounted for more than four million yuan. North China mostly made purchases directly from Shanghai due to geographical reasons, so very few people came to Hong Kong to place orders. Also, Macau is not far from Hong Kong. Before the war, the annual sales of European, American and Japanese goods totaled more than one million yuan. However, after the war, places with trade relations with Hong Kong such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou were successively occupied, and the external sales of Hong Kong piece goods gradually decreased. After Guangzhou fell, the reduction was as high as 80%. Currently, the only remaining sales channel is Macau. Fortunately, because many people came to Hong Kong to take refuge, the two to three million yuan of European and American goods ordered by the Hong Kong piece goods industry this year have sold very well in the market, with more than seven out of ten orders already sold. Most of the silk shops in Hong Kong are capitalized by the Japanese, who want to use them to sell their goods.

### Hua Cup Hua League vs. Hai League: Li Huitang Invited to Participate; Hua League Lineup Should Also Be Improved

[Our Newspaper Exclusive] The second act of the Hua Cup football preliminary is the Chinese League team against the Naval League team, to be held on the 22nd of this month (Sunday) at 3:30 PM at the Hong Kong Stadium.

The Hua League representatives have already been selected, but because South China is leading its troops, they have not been able to return in time, and only two players staying behind, Tan Junqian and Liang Rongzhao, have been selected.

The Football Association believes that the already decided Hua League lineup is not perfect, fearing that the appeal is weak and the ticket revenue will be affected, because all the ticket revenue from this competition belongs to the Football Association.

The Football Association's annual expenses rely on the ticket revenue from this competition to make up for it, especially this year, when it is necessary to host the Philippine team to Hong Kong for the inter-port competition, which requires even greater expenses.

Therefore, regarding this preliminary, the Football Association hopes that the Hua League can select first-class players to play in the game to increase its appeal and that the Hua League can win the final, because the Football Association's "business sense" is important, so it pins all its hopes on the Hua League.

This time, the Hua League representatives have not lived up to expectations, and the Football Association is especially anxious, fearing that the Hua League will be defeated as soon as it plays, and the final will be a match between Western teams. Chinese spectators will definitely be unhappy, so this business will have less profit.

For this reason, a member of the Football Association strongly invited Li Huitang to help the Hua League at that time, and Huang Jiajun also acted as a matchmaker, asking Mr. Li to make it difficult for him and avoid disappointing the Football Association.

Mr. Li told reporters yesterday, "A member of the Football Association cordially invited me, and I am very grateful. It is not convenient for me to refuse to do my best to achieve both goals, but since I have participated in the competition, I do not know how the already decided Hua League lineup will change."

Mr. Li's statement means that he will definitely participate in the competition, and his spirit of righteousness is a model for the sports world and is also good news for general fans. In particular, this time the Hua League has his participation, and the dangerous elements of being eliminated will be reduced.

I remember that since the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese football community in Hong Kong has received the support of the Football Association every time it has held a charity match. This time, although the ticket revenue of the Li Hua Cup match is all returned to the Football Association, we should also do our best to help him, give peach and reward plum, and there should be reciprocity, so Mr. Li's agreement to participate this time is very meaningful.

The selected Hua League representatives should not be overturned in principle, but this time it is to increase the Football Association's revenue, so it may be possible to act with authority to make it happen. Therefore, the reporter has a suggestion for the Hua League's lineup at the time of the game for Li Huitang's participation.

The position of goalkeeper has already been determined by Tan Junqian, so there is no need to change it. Moreover, Li Huitang once said that in the past, he and Lao Tan had never failed in any competition they participated in in the same team, so you can use their lucky partner together.

The right inside guard should choose Hou Rongsheng of Guanghua. In the current situation, I think it is satisfactory. It seems inappropriate to use Miao Huaguo as the left inside guard. Although he has improved recently and his header is better, his movements are too slow, which is a fact that everyone has seen. The right wing of the Hai League, Armstrong, is very powerful, and I am afraid that Lao Miao will not be able to resist it. Using Song Lingsheng is also not possible, which is no different from cutting feet to fit shoes, and he has rarely played inside guard. If used improperly, it will be a burden. In my opinion, Luo Weiquan is the most suitable, because Lao Luo's foot is strong enough. In every small-scale game, he is the one who makes things happen. Taking the small to compare with the big has a meaning. If he is selected, I believe he will be able to do the job happily.

The center midfielder should choose Liang Rongzhao, and he has been very careful about passing the ball recently, and he is brave and energetic. The right midfielder is an ideal candidate for Song Lingsheng. He has ball skills, is good at flanking, and is better than Liu Shizhan. The left midfielder should use Xu Jingcheng. If so, the entire midfielder line will be so strong that even if the inside guard is weaker, there is no need to worry with the strong cover of the midfielder.

The left and right wings must belong to Hou Chengtuo and Chen Bingshi. There is no doubt about it. The only thing to consider is the three forwards. In my opinion, since Li Huitang is the center forward, there must be a good ball-supplying inside forward to assist Li Fang in easily advancing. This good ball-supplying person is none other than Zou Wenzhi. He has also cooperated with Chengtuo before. If he is selected as the left inside forward, he will definitely have an understanding performance with Chengtuo and will definitely assist Huitang in attacking. It is quite difficult to find a right inside forward, but Zhuo Shijin can be recruited. His long-range shooting skills are somewhat like Huitang's style.

If the forward line is selected as I suggested, I dare say that the offensive power will definitely be strong. What's more, Huitang, Shijin, and Chengtuo are all good shooters, which will make the Hai League guards sigh for neglecting one thing and paying attention to another. What do you think of the wise, do you think it is so? The lineup suggested by the reporter is recorded below. (Ballpark Tycoon)

### On the Necessary Understanding of Deep Breathing

— Wang Xuezheng

The benefits of deep breathing can be summarized into the following six types:

(1) Exercise the lungs and expand the chest.

(2) Purify the blood, normalize blood circulation, and strengthen the heart.

(3) Enhance the capabilities of various organs, making their functions active and normal.

(4) Invigorate the spirit and strengthen the body.

(5) Restore fatigue, relax the body, treat insomnia, and strengthen the nervous system.

(6) Suppress emotional impulses, prevent violent anger, and worry, making the body and mind comfortable and promoting mental health.

Although deep breathing is a very simple and effective exercise, if we lack a deep understanding of this exercise or rush it, the result will not only fail to reap the maximum benefits, but often suffer harm instead.

Here are the necessary understandings we should have about deep breathing:

(1) We should not use deep breathing exercises as the only tool to exercise the chest. Deep breathing exercises should be carried out together with other exercises that focus on developing muscles or exercising strength, or after this type of exercise. For example, when performing dumbbell exercises, deep breathing can be done for about one minute after completing two or three exercises; or after completing all the exercises, deep breathing can be done for about three minutes. If you do deep breathing exercises at ordinary times, the effect is small, because the air we need during exercise is often seven or eight times more than usual. The lung's capacity for air is limited at noon, and it cannot accept a large amount of air. If it is forced too much, it will be harmful.

When performing other exercises, you should also do deep breathing at any time. Otherwise, there is not only a risk of harm to your body, but you will often feel rapid heartbeat, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and fatigue.

Although many exercises require rapid movements and cannot be performed with deep breathing at the same time, no matter what, we must not stop breathing when exercising or exerting force. When breathing is difficult or rapid, you can temporarily use your mouth to breathe, because this can quickly inhale a large amount of air.

(3) Although it is not advisable to overdo deep breathing, it is also not very effective if you only do it for a few minutes a day. We must always fill our chests with fresh air, so our body must have the correct posture so that we can do deep breathing at any time.

(4) To reap the maximum benefits from deep breathing exercises, you must pay attention to the chest cavity, chest bones, lungs, chest muscles, shoulder muscles, and diaphragm, so that the functions of each part are active and normal.

As for the method of deep breathing, we should pay attention to the following four points:

(1) Unless breathing is difficult or rapid, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. However, when encountering cold wind or cold weather, in order to avoid catching a cold, you should still inhale through your nose, and do not breathe into the wind.

(2) When inhaling, the muscles of the whole body should be completely relaxed, not tightened or forced, and the posture should be natural.

(3) When inhaling, the abdomen should be expanded as much as possible, and when exhaling, the abdomen should be contracted as much as possible.

(4) When exhaling, cross your arms in front of your chest and compress your chest forcefully to completely expel the air from.

When exercising or exerting force, you must try to make your breathing deep, long, and thorough at the same time to avoid injury, but at this time, the first thing to pay attention to is the correct breathing method. There are only two breathing methods during exercise:

(1) Inhale when exerting force and exhale when relaxing.

(2) Exhale when the chest and abdomen are compressed and inhale when they are expanded.

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment... Social Thugs

The Last Gangster

Edward Robinson plays a thug who does all kinds of evil. The success of his past works proves that he is an outstanding talent. His superb acting skills and meticulous character performance have won unanimous praise from every audience.

In this film, he plays a thug who commits all kinds of evil, murders and steals, disregards the law, and manipulates the evil forces of the entire society. He is domineering, arrogant, and invincible, but in the end, for the sake of his virtuous wife and loving children, he sacrifices everything, including his own life, and ends up in a very tragic end.

Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of great talent, with a very moving scene. The cast includes James Stewart and Ruth Strickland. At the same time, in this film, we also see a most perfect cast of thief actors in Hollywood. All the tense and moving plots in this "Social Thug" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.

Queen... Mischievous Boy's Acting Record

This long and funny film, led by Tom Kelley and a group of mischievous boys, is Tom's work after "Mischievous Boy's Biography", but because of the story, it is obviously not as touching as the previous one. However, the director's handling of this film is very lively and vivid. Several gimmicks are still satisfactory. The various performances of the circus are very wonderful, and the performances of a group of child stars are very outstanding. In the end, it is still an entertaining film.

Peace... Knight's Brother's Thief Breaking Record

North of the Rio Grande

This is William Beke's work after "Knight Friend's Thief Drama Record". It is also a story about the American Western knight Garchette. This time, because his brother was shot and killed by robbers, and he failed to get justice in court, Garchette was eager to avenge his brother, disguised himself as a gambler, and hid in the gambling den to secretly investigate the real murderer. After repeated dangers, he finally avenged his brother and eliminated a major harm in the West. The plot is quite tortuous. William Beke also has a more wonderful performance in this film than the previous film.

East... Frontier Flying General

Border Flight

A film about smuggling. The story is plain. The scenes of several battles in the air with bandits are quite exciting and moving. Frances Farmer and John Howard's performances are mediocre.

Great China... Midnight Piano

Moonlight Sonata

This is a musical romance film. What is worth noting is the famous pianist Peter Luskowski, Padreswskf. The film structure is based on Peter Luskowski's piano performance as the center of the story. In the concert, his superb art moved the entire audience, especially a young couple. At the request of the audience, he replayed "Midnight Piano", followed by his oral account of how a young couple was moved by "Midnight Piano" when their love broke down and reconciled as before, which is the story of this film.

In addition to Peter Luskowski's art being worth appreciating, the plot and performance are slightly dull, with more dialogue than action, which cannot get rid of the British film style. Charles Ford has lost his dashing spirit of the year.

Scene Star... Smart Girl

Always in Trouble

Consistent style, attitude of smart and witty matchmaking, finally yacht competition, both funny and tense, Kim Hye-soo performed very well.

Central... Drama

Chinese Art Troupe

Day Performance... Exuberant Elation

Night Performance... Thunderstorm

New World... Quarrelsome Couple

Exaggerated film

Taiping... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Troupe

Day Performance... Not Necessarily All Men Are Unfeeling

Night Performance... Purse Princess

Puqing... Cantonese Opera

Xingzhonghua Troupe

Day Performance... Xi Shi's Love Trap Zhao Zilong

Night Performance... Bitterly Fated Three Grandsons

Beihe... Cantonese Opera

Jintianhua Female Troupe

Day Performance... Xue Dingshan

Night Performance... Powdered Building, Book Two

### Movement and Stillness

— Cao Juren

——Impressions of a Battlefield Trip

One clear early winter morning, I climbed alone from the Goose Lake Academy along the leaning pagoda to the summit of Mount Fengding; the morning sun was just rising, and the thick fog filled the valley. The white camellias by the roadside were covered with dewy moisture, which made them particularly vibrant. That day, I don't know whether it was this famous philosopher - the meeting place of Zhu and Lu, which aroused my nostalgia? Or was it the cold and solemn atmosphere of early winter that stimulated my meditation? I always felt a little different in my chest, thinking silently and walking slowly, thinking that Zhu and Lu had different ideas when they discussed learning here, they walked hand in hand, sometimes silently, sometimes arguing fiercely, and sometimes tacitly understanding each other. Did they also think that thousands of years later, from the same to the different, from the different to the same, many magnificent waves would be opened up?

Just as I was thinking deeply, the rattling sound of six aircraft interrupted my thoughts; at that time, I suddenly turned my mind and raised the following question: Suppose Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan were both born in modern times. And Lu Ziqian (a master of the Jinhua School), who had some different views from Zhu and Lu, also came to Goose Lake to participate in the discussion; when the three of them were arguing fiercely, the × people's planes flew over. What would be the attitude of the three of them? This is very thought-provoking. Lu Xiangshan might sit upright, with little change in his expression, and Wei Xi might think of the sage's way of exercising power and the ancient motto of "a gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall". As for Lu Ziqian, he probably immediately stopped participating in the debate, feeling that digging air-raid shelters was more practical than philosophical debate. After the planes passed; who is right and who is wrong, everyone's pen tip can be broken; but if the disciples in the Goose Lake Academy are young people who are currently studying, their judgment can be made immediately, because they believe that the × people's planes will really drop bombs and blow Lu Jiuyuan, who is sitting upright, into meat patties. They will feel that the realistic path taken by the Jinhua School is the right path.

When I went down the mountain, the top of the leaning pagoda touched my another kind of thought: Goose Lake Academy, this sacred place of Confucianism, and Hongji Temple on Mount Fengding, that sacred place of Buddhism, what kind of interaction is there between them? Could it be that the leaning pagoda at the foot of the mountain is the dividing line between your territory and mine, and they will not glare at each other? Or is Lu Xiangshan's attitude closer to the side of Mount Fengding, Zhu Xi belongs to the circle of Goose Lake Academy, and Lu Ziqian is outside the circle of Goose Lake? Their disciples have fundamentally different attitudes towards the monks of the mountain temple. Continuing to pursue in this way, the problem becomes more and more complicated; that morning, a kind of philosophy of life, a philosophy of life in troubled times, matured in my heart.

Between Mount Fengding and Goose Lake, there are fundamentally different views on life; Buddhism advocates the beauty of stillness, taking "Nirvana" as the destination of life, Confucianism advocates the beauty of movement, taking "self-improvement" as the great way of "change". Lu is inclined to Buddhism, so he advocates "clarifying the mind and seeing the nature", Zhu is inclined to Confucianism, so he advocates "investigating principles and dealing with affairs". Lu Ziqian, Ye Shuixin, Chen Tongfu, and the Yan Li School in the early Qing Dynasty, are closer to Confucianism, so they advocate "experiencing worldly affairs and thoroughly studying economics". (Economics refers to democratic economics.) The beauty of stillness is easy to understand, and people in middle age understand the taste of leisure and comfort. The beauty of movement can only be appreciated if you have the courage to face reality head-on; following the movement, what is in front of you is a messy reality. People who are used to a leisurely life only know that the mess is just joking with their life order, and no old rules can allow them to deal with it properly. Turmoil makes their heads hurt, constantly. When he knows that under the turmoil, the stream of life is active, and the stream of life is leaping forward, it makes his head hurt again. This is why Zhu Xi is confined to the circle of Goose Lake, and Confucianism can only survive in the doctrine of the mean. In troubled times, "the doctrine of the mean" is not enough, you have to have a more positive attitude towards life.

As the Western saying goes, "Young people have more heat and less light, and middle-aged people have more light and less heat". The turbulent world is a world of fire, and only people with more heat can catch up with it. ——January 1, 1939

### Death

— Geng

Death is the most painful and the most difficult. Therefore, the general public's concept of death is sometimes a curse and sometimes praise.

Death is the most painful, objectively. "When the living bid farewell to the dead, there is no arguing about regret," In other words, only the living will feel the pain of death. Death is the most difficult, subjectively. Everyone is afraid of death, but if you can abandon everything and bravely tend towards death, then it is difficult. Therefore, death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai. Dying when you shouldn't die, dying when you don't have to die, is lighter than a feather; dying when you should die, daring to die when you must die, is heavier than Mount Tai. The former's death, because the death is not in the right place, will not only fail to win social sympathy, but on the contrary, because he leaves a bad impression, he will also be cursed by society. The latter's death, because he died in the right place, gives people the story of loyalty and integrity, which is a model for those who die later, so it is worth praising.

In this war of resistance, there are too many stories of death. The soldiers in the front are dying in the thousands for the people, for the country, and for justice, before the god of war. They are the dead soldiers of the Republic of China and the pioneers of justice and public reason. History will not fail to solemnly record their heroic sacrifices and their spirit of regarding death as home; this is not to mention for the time being. There are also many stories of committing suicide for righteousness and scandals of corpses lying in the streets in the occupied areas. These many deaths not only have distinctions between lightness and weight, but also between compliance and defiance.

According to this newspaper's Taixian correspondent: Xu Shizhu, a Zhenjiang educator who once served as the director of the Dantu County Education Institute and the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, is from Dagang Township, Zhenjiang. His morality and articles have always been respected by his fellow villagers and people in the community. Recently, because his nephew Xu conspired against the country in the township, he tried to persuade him to break away but failed. He believed it was a great shame and humiliation, and committed suicide by jumping into the river in Xinzhou a few days ago to serve the country. Those who are willing to be traitors should be ashamed to death. It is said that Xu was very regretful when he learned of the news that he committed suicide by jumping into the river to serve the country.

Xu Shizhu committed suicide by jumping into the river because his nephew conspired against the country and failed to stop him. This is not only clarifying shame, but also clarifying ambition. This kind of behavior is of course deeply moving and worthy of respect! However, although his death has considerable value, his attempt to use this method of dying to persuade his unfilial nephew to repent is still debatable.

Traitors have no soul, they do not know what is called integrity, what is called integrity. Our only solution to this group of beasts in clothing, traitors to the nation, is "kill without pardon". Persuasion is useless. Since Mr. Xu Shizhu had the courage to die after the lesson of "forcefully persuading him to break away but failing", if he could not add a white blade to his unfilial nephew and put him to death, remove a scoundrel for the country, and fight for a little righteousness for the world, he could launch a widespread movement to eliminate traitors and awaken the awareness of the compatriots in the occupied areas. If this leads to the consequence of death, then death is more valuable and more difficult.

Therefore, we recognize: we must have the courage to die, and at the same time, we must have the will to die to demand the price of death.

### I Love Firelight

— Luo Xi

I love the wild fire that will ignite a thousand feet of light in the dark night, it can illuminate: who is the real human, who is the jackal in human face!

Although fire will burn down prosperous cities, fire will burn down beautiful mountain villages; but this is the alternation of the new and the old, not a permanent disaster!

Jackals that eat people will run everywhere, and the light of wild fire will rush up everywhere; no one has a place to escape or hide!

On the earth, millions of oppressed children have sung in unison to the sky-high firelight:

"Only resistance, can there be liberation! Our will is a strong sentry post; our fists are unparalleled knives and guns!"

Towards the fierce jackals, millions of people have merged into a滔heavenly huge wave. They will press the jackals down on the mountain of bones, and they will immerse the dregs in the rivers formed by hot blood; after the wild fire is extinguished, they will build more prosperous cities and more beautiful mountain villages on the earth stained with blood and flesh!

Yes, I love firelight!

### Xin Hui Oranges

— Wu Chonghan

Of Xin Hui's produce, the two most important are the palm frond and the oranges.

Xin Hui oranges have a clear, sweet taste, and after winter, they have a particularly appealing fragrance, known as "orange fragrance," which is beloved by the people of Lingnan. Oranges have been famous since ancient times, with Qu Yuan having written "Ode to the Orange." It is a pity that this fruit is prone to spoilage and cannot be stored for long or transported far, so its market is limited to Guangdong.

Every year around the Double Ninth Festival, oranges come onto the market. Initially, they are green, then they turn yellow, and finally, they turn a golden yellow. At this point, the oranges are ripe. In Lingnan, especially in Xin Hui, who doesn't love oranges?

A few days ago, Sister Yun came from Xin Hui, overcoming obstacles and difficulties, and brought me two baskets of oranges. They were golden and dazzling. I was extremely grateful to her for being so thoughtful during this time of fleeing from the war, crossing rivers and mountains, and painstakingly bringing these two baskets of oranges.

"They are just worthless things, what is there to be grateful for?"

Sister Yun suddenly sounded sad. I almost misunderstood, thinking she was just being modest.

Sister Yun's livelihood is growing oranges. This is her family's tradition, passed down for generations. In Xin Hui, many people make a living this way. Some cultivate dozens of acres of orange trees, while others cultivate only a few acres. If there is a bumper year, without floods, droughts, wind, or rain, the growers can make a good profit. Some can become wealthy, while others can at least make a living. The people of Xin Hui rely on this for their livelihood, just like those who cultivate palm fronds. This year happens to be a bumper year, with abundant harvests of rice and oranges.

"A bumper harvest of oranges means they are worthless!"

From her sorrowful tone, I understood what Sister Yun meant.

"In past years, oranges cost five or six yuan per catty, and as high as ten or twenty yuan when the price was high. This year, they are only worth a yuan or so, and even a few jiao, and no one is interested. They are extremely cheap! Worthless junk, not worth anything!"

Sister Yun continued to explain the reasons why oranges are so cheap:

"It's entirely due to the * bandits invading from the south. Guangzhou has fallen, and there is no market for oranges. The roads to the outside are blocked everywhere. Xin Hui oranges are only eaten by the people of Xin Hui."

She sighed and said:

"A year of hard work has come to nothing! The capital is lost - the oranges are too cheap. Picking them to sell doesn't even cover the cost. It's better to leave them on the trees to ripen, rot, and fall, even if it makes the fields dirty. The orange growers are bankrupt! Some orange growers, driven by hunger and cold, have even listened to the foolish suggestions of others and secretly transported oranges to Guangzhou, hoping to recover some of their capital. However, this kind of behavior is no different from being a traitor! I would rather starve to death than be a * slave!"

Sister Yun was still indignant. I know how difficult it is for them to grow oranges this year. However, with the * bandits running rampant, who can avoid such hardships?

"With the nation in crisis, there are bound to be many changes. It's not like the peaceful days of the past.

'This year, smiling faces greet parents,
The fragrance of golden oranges fills the trees.'

I've heard you sing this folk song many times."

"We don't sing it that way anymore!"

"How so?"

"It's changed!"

"What's the new version?"

"Today, who picks the oranges?
Golden trees everywhere, eyes filled with tears!"

As Sister Yun said this, her eyes filled with tears again!

### Random Notes from Military Life

— Li Huiying

This old man was once educated in a private school. In his youth, he traveled and did some things, and because of these connections, we were able to get along and reduce the common aversion that villagers have towards soldiers. Indeed, he never showed any annoyance towards us, or, like some villagers, deliberately made things difficult by insisting that we shouldn't use too much water, that we shouldn't get the ground dirty, or that we had used his bamboo poles. This old man was not like that—because of his understanding of the war of resistance, he not only didn't make things difficult but also cared for these brothers in uniform.

"Aren't you staying a few more days?" he asked, seemingly reluctant to see us go. His wife, the old woman who washed our clothes every day, came out of the inner room, as if she had heard our conversation, and added:

"Comrades..." she had already become familiar with these two words, "Are you about to leave?"

"Yes."

"We haven't treated you well."

"Not at all, we've been a bother to you."

"Don't be polite," the old man interjected, shaking his feather fan, "If it were peacetime, you wouldn't even come to visit."

"Where are you going?"

Regarding this question, we have always been unable to tell the truth to others. Because there are too many traitors, even good people must be treated with caution. Therefore, whenever anyone asks about our marching route, we always answer, "We'll go ahead and see." We use this to brush them off.

The first part of the marching route is already known to everyone: "Huilong Street - Fangjiaping - Jiuhe Street - Daoguan River - Taojiapu - Baiguo - Caoxiedian - Macheng - Wujia River - Xidao River - Huangtugang - Zhangdian - Futian River - Liushudian -"

Everyone packed their luggage and everything was ready, just waiting to be put on their backs. (To be continued)
