### Visit to Commander-in-Chief Li at the Xiangfan Front

— Ye Juesun

While in Xiangfan, Mr. Wei Chengcheng, Director of the Political Department of the Fifth War Area, led us to visit the local military-civilian club. Everything from public education to illustrated explanations of military knowledge, public entertainment, etc., was arranged in an orderly manner. The comprehensiveness of the facilities and the perfection of the management were by no means what people in the rear would imagine possible so close to the front line. The cultural work of the Ninth War Area is indeed brilliantly unique. However, there is one thing that still requires more assistance from our friends in the rear, and that is the issue of cultural sustenance. Most of their good books, magazines, and newspapers are old. Therefore, they eagerly hope that cultural circles in various places can collect some relatively excellent books and newspapers and mail them to the 32nd Postal Bureau, addressed to Mr. Wei of the Political Department. The contrast between cultural work at the front and in the rear is indeed too unequal. We often loudly advocate arming the mind and spiritual mobilization. But all of this requires spiritual nourishment.

I stayed in Xiangfan for a total of three nights. Commander-in-Chief Li, the victorious general who gallops along the banks of the Han River, was in high spirits. He held an optimistic attitude towards the situation in the Lingge Police Bureau and the battle line along the Han River basin. This gentleman's conversation is very interesting. Any serious problem, after passing through his mouth, can immediately become a relaxed and clear "casual chat" that is easy to understand. He believes that in the five or six months after the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy expended great sacrifice and effort, only to achieve less than a hundred miles of progress. The strategic reason is that after the enemy's main force entered Wuhan, the border area between Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi was almost completely recovered by our army, and Wuhan was in a bitter situation of being surrounded on all sides. Mr. Li gave an example, saying, "It's like a person who is trapped in the mud. When it reaches chest height, he will naturally feel difficulty breathing and be in extreme danger. Therefore, he will try his best to push away the threats in front of him. But, little does he know, before he can let go, new pressures are being added to him even heavier and more densely." Now, although the two large pincers (of a crab) have slightly stretched in, the body is even more pressured and trapped in a deeper dead end. Commander-in-Chief Li firmly believes in the future of the Japanese military, believing that "those who commit many injustices will inevitably destroy themselves," and that Japanese imperialism will inevitably follow the same path as the World War of 1914, bringing about its own demise.

Speaking of the Annam issue, Mr. Li has a very profound and far-reaching understanding that general political commentators and international affairs experts have never pointed out. He feels that the safety of Annam is crucial to France's strategy and tactics. Militarily, once Annam is lost, France will no longer have a base in the Far East. Politically, the Japanese, after occupying Annam, will inevitably use the Annamese to form a government and falsely give it the beautiful name of independence. This would naturally provide a stimulating example to many other colonies. Therefore, since the Japanese imperialists occupied Hainan Island, Annam has been in an extremely critical situation. As for the method of turning danger into safety, it is not difficult. What is needed is only a very close alliance between China and France in the Far East. China has no ambition to seize Annam, a point that the French authorities can trust. With this basic belief, Sino-French cooperation in Annam will naturally be easier to achieve. Mr. Li believes that if France hopes to supply Annam with military supplies from Europe during the war, it is very unreliable. Proper preparations should be made: first, factories capable of manufacturing light weapons and ammunition should be established in Annam; second, all food and manpower issues can first have some verbal or written tacit agreement with China, because this is the best way for China and France to cooperate in practice. China has no problem with manpower and food, and France will certainly not have difficulty with one hundred to two hundred thousand pieces of military equipment. Therefore, currently, as long as France can truly feel the necessity of protecting Annam and give China a hint, we can certainly help them when necessary. The vividness of Commander-in-Chief Li's conversation lies in his ability to give examples and use analogies. Here, he similarly gave an example: "The Chinese are like a poor man. Sometimes, even if he approaches a rich man with good intentions, the French are always afraid of being touched for oil or borrowing money. In fact, this poor man is indeed not an ordinary person. He has backbone and methods. Not only does he not want to take advantage of others, but he also intends to try his best to help others in times of need. Although we have good intentions and are full of enthusiasm, the social status is not appropriate, and there is no self-recommending and capable matchmaker. Therefore, this marriage has never been consummated, and the situation in the Far East and the Pacific is deteriorating." At the same time, the Chinese national character is the most trustworthy in the world. Among friends, money and many commercial transactions rarely require contracts or agreements other than the verbal "one word is final." The other party will never breach the agreement because there is no contract or written evidence. Therefore, if France is sincere and can deeply understand this poor man, then even without any formal diplomatic treaty, just a clearer and more sincere word, we will make preparations. Mr. Li Meng believes that the French government still has many concerns about Annam. First, if too many factories are opened, the number of workers will inevitably increase, and they are afraid of causing social problems. Second, if they get too close to China, they are afraid that the Annamese will learn from the Chinese and launch a movement for freedom and independence, leading to national problems. Regarding these two points, if they are truly the French government's concerns, I think France itself does not understand Annam. What do you think?

The next day, I went to Longzhong, the ancient site of Zhuge Liang's thatched cottage, where he said, "I am originally a recluse in Wolong." Liu Xuande had visited the thatched cottage three times to invite this fan-wielding, turban-wearing, cart-riding friend who seemed like a celestial being. Now it has become a training ground for young students to cultivate new forces to promote Hubei's politics and war area public movements, I hope that there will be hundreds and thousands more Zhuge Liangs here.

On the morning of April 7th, I left Xiangfan and returned to Xuan Chang. The entire route was a famous battlefield during the Three Kingdoms period: Changyang Bridge, Changban Slope, Guan Tomb. Unfortunately, my pen is too clumsy and unskilled, otherwise I would really like to write an essay lamenting Zhao Zilong's bravery on Changban Slope. Although it is difficult to say whether it has much significance, his seven entries and seven exits from the enemy's encirclement, alone and single-handedly, with his heroic and majestic spirit, were extremely pleasing.

From Yichang to Shashi, crossing Dongting Lake to Changsha. Due to transportation difficulties and accompanying four foreign friends, I became quite exhausted. After arriving in Changsha, I had to immediately set up camp and only slept at twelve o'clock that night. When I woke up the next morning, I realized that my temperature had risen to 40 degrees Celsius. Thanks to everyone's blessings, I have now recovered my health!

Today I am leaving Changsha for Mount Heng.

### The Eastern River in Arduous Battle

— Rao Qiumei

Although the enemy has withdrawn from Huibo, they are still entrenched in the Dongguan, Shilong, and Zengcheng areas. This part of the enemy still harasses the Huibo border from time to time: Zhangmutou, Fuhexu, Lianhexu, and Longbizhen and other places are burned and plundered by the enemy time and again. This shows that the Eastern River is still at war, and at the same time, when the enemy plans and implements a new offensive against Guangdong, the Eastern River is again under the threat of this new offensive.

Because the Eastern River is at the front of the war, is in the war, the people of the Eastern River have already begun to use "struggle" to meet this environment, which is the driving force to push the Eastern River forward.

Here we can see:

1.  The Development of Guerrilla Warfare

When the enemy occupied Huibo, the people of Huibo had already partially attacked the enemy. More than 200 enemy troops attempting to flank Conghua from the small road from Boluo to Longmen were completely annihilated by the people of Boluo and Longmen. When the enemy withdrew from Huibo, more than 200 enemy troops were wiped out in one fell swoop in the mountainous area around Fuhexu in Boluo (our side only suffered one injury in this battle). The Fuhexu Self-Defense Corps also shot down an enemy bomber, killing six pilots. Subsequently, guerrilla warfare was constantly being launched around Zhengguo, Lianhe, and other market towns at the foot of Luofu Mountain, and various forms of struggle emerged. There are stories of elderly women in their sixties stealing guns to lure the enemy, jokes about sneaking into enemy camps at night to steal machine guns and accidentally bringing home motorcycles, and more than 20 people pretending to be women working in the fields to lure and kill enemies. In small-scale battles, groups of three or five infiltrated enemy-occupied casinos to carry out various small-scale activities. Most praiseworthy is the Zengcheng guerrilla team of more than 100 people under Shan Rongpei, who penetrated deep into the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, repeatedly attacking the enemy's transportation lines, and once used the terrain to engage in a battle with more than 300 enemy troops for an entire morning. The Boluo guerrilla team under Chen Jie has fought more than ten battles, large and small, against the enemy under the personal leadership of Chen Mingtou (Chen Laotou, around 70 years old, is a self-made man and an old Kuomintang member in good health). Lianhe Township Chief Lai personally led the people of the township, not only severely cracking down on the enemy's invasions, but also repeatedly attacked enemy camps at night, causing great losses to the enemy. As a result, under the enemy's "deep hatred," he was betrayed by a traitor from the township. One night, more than ten members of his family were brutally murdered, and his wife and daughter were sexually assaulted. Chief Lai himself was tied to a cross in the enemy area and had pieces of his flesh cut off for three days before he died. The enemy used all cruel and inhuman means to deal with the leading figures and all combatants in our guerrilla teams, but this only deepened the hatred and animosity of our people towards the enemy, making guerrilla warfare on the Eastern River front and behind enemy lines more widespread!

2.  Mobilizing Eastern River Youth

Although the youth of various counties in the Eastern River are in a difficult environment, they have already been mobilized. First, let's talk about two young and combative teams:

I. The Eastern River District Team of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard of Eastern Youth, referred to as "Anti-Vanguard." This team of about 70 people, after withdrawing from Guangzhou, accepted the guidance of the Mass Mobilization Committee of the Fourth War Area and set out to work in the Eastern River. At that time, the enemy was still in Huibo. This team had already gathered in Heyuan and worked in the areas of Puqian, Shiba, Guzhu, and Guansige on the Huibo border, actively training self-defense groups and helping local people run self-defense group training classes. In the work areas, local teams of "Anti-Vanguard" were organized. It is estimated that more than 1,000 "Anti-Vanguard" members were organized in the counties of Hui, Chai, He, Longchuan, and Xinfeng. These "Anti-Vanguard" members can almost all play a considerable role in promoting and setting an example for the local national salvation work.

II. The Eastern River Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps is directly subordinate to the Nanyang Huizhou Ten-Prefecture Overseas Chinese Association. A general headquarters was established, and a branch was established in each county, with the purpose of assisting local governments in doing anti-war mobilization work and all possible wartime service work. Currently, the first regiment in Huizhou, with more than 100 members, is the most powerful, the second regiment in Huaiyuan, with more than 40 members, and the third regiment in Fu Luo, with more than 40 members, are working in the vicinity of the war zone. The fourth regiment in Chaihui, with more than 20 members, the fifth regiment in Heyuan, and the sixth regiment in Longchuan, with more than 10 members. Other counties such as Heping, Lianping, and Jiangxi have not yet established service corps. In addition, there is a rescue team of more than 20 people and a mobile drama troupe of more than 20 people. If these three to four hundred young cadres can all be actively deployed in a planned way to carry out work in various fields, they will make valuable contributions to the Eastern River.

Secondly, let's talk about the organizational status of the youth in various counties. Haifeng, Lufeng, Wuhua, and Heyuan all have County Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Associations. Haifeng has the largest number of organized members, with more than 2,000 people. Wuhua also has more than 1,000 people. Longchuan has a unified organization of the County Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard. The youth of Heping are mostly organized in the Farmers' Resistance Association. It is said that the Heping Farmers' Resistance Association has about 5,000 members. Then, there is no doubt that the maximum number of 4,000 members should belong to the youth. The development of Huiyang and Boluo is uneven, and there is still no unified organization in the county, but the organized youth always number one to two thousand. The wartime work team of the Boluo County Government with more than 20 people and the wartime work team of the Heyuan County Anti-Japanese Support Association with more than 70 people are both excellent fighting teams that can work independently, endure hardship, and go deep into the masses.

3.  Front Line, Heart, and Rear

According to the current geographical conditions of the Eastern River and the distribution of enemy and our forces, the front line of the Eastern River is Huibo, the heart is Heyuan, Longchuan, Lianping, and Heping is the rear (of course, not the great rear), and several central points among them have an enlightened and progressive political environment.

The most central area of the front line is of course in Boluo. Huang Chang, the county magistrate of Boluo, is a wise county magistrate. Not being corrupt is his greatest advantage. He can also pay considerable attention to developing mass organizations, such as the county government's organization, the wartime work team, recommending Chen Jie as the commander of the guerrillas, running a cadre training school for the self-defense regiment, and changing Boluo County Middle School into a wartime middle school, serving as the principal himself. If the government can trust young people more, employ a large number of young people, and do things more effectively, guerrilla warfare will inevitably develop more widely, and Boluo's bright future is unquestionable.

Heyuan, which has become the heart of the Eastern River, is moving towards a bright road day by day. The new county magistrate, Wu Shijun, has not been in office for long, so it is of course too early to talk about work performance, but it is said that he is very straightforward and has few bureaucratic airs. As for the county party headquarters, it can work very actively. It can play an exemplary role in the county party headquarters of various counties in the Eastern River. Under his leadership, there is regular work in addition to working in the countryside. Under his leadership, a unified county youth anti-Japanese comrades association, a county women's association, and a county youth anti-Japanese comrades association were established. At the same time, under his leadership, a regular symposium of various national salvation organizations was established. The organizational units of this symposium include youth resistance, youth corps, women's associations, youth resistance, anti-vanguard service corps, etc. A common work program was issued, and the symposium decided on many regular tasks, publishing publications, and holding street singing, talks, and speeches every night, with each group taking turns to take charge. Training classes for young cadres are also underway.

Among the rear counties, Longchuan is the most central county. In terms of transportation and economy, it has become the center. In terms of the direction of the Korean War, it is relatively close to the front line. In Longchuan, both politics and mass movements have shown unusual progress. The county's unified youth congress was held after the Lunar New Year, and the "Longchuan Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard," a unified organization, was established, with County Magistrate Deng Hongqin serving as the captain himself. Under the leadership of the county magistrate, fifty self-education classes for young cadres have been held. Recently, a county primary school teacher conference has also been held, and a county primary school teacher union has been established. Longchuan's national salvation movement has not only received the leadership and support of the upper-level county government, the county party headquarters, and the general gentry, but also the enthusiastic support and help of local village associations and alumni associations.

The continued political progress and the vigorous development of the mass movement in the three central counties of Boluo, Heyuan, and Longchuan will inevitably be able to influence and promote the entire Eastern River situation, fundamentally transform it, grow new strength, and defeat the dark monsters. The people of the Eastern River must and are moving in this direction!

### How to Mobilize Rural Women? Experience from Wartime Rural Service Team Work

The reporter had a long talk with Mr. Chen Yiyun. Entrusted by Madame Chiang, Mr. Chen is the captain of the wartime rural service brigade of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement Headquarters, leading more than a hundred female comrades to work in various rural areas of Hunan, and has gained a lot of valuable work experience. It may be useful to introduce them to fellow rural workers here.

(1) Rural work requires the greatest determination. China's countryside suffers from various diseases, not only having stubborn feudal consciousness, but also being extremely poor. For it to become healthy and participate in the war of resistance, it needs to undergo a considerable period of treatment before it can contribute the greatest strength. President Chiang instructed us that China's inexhaustible strength is indeed hidden in the vast countryside.

To make rural people understand the war of resistance, it is necessary to improve their level of knowledge, publish newspapers, and run women's literacy classes and children's literacy classes. To enable women to fully exert their productive power, it is necessary to set up nurseries to relieve their burden. To make villagers pay attention to hygiene, it is necessary to lead them in carrying out a major cleanup and publicize attention to family hygiene. To maintain local security and enhance the people's anti-war sentiment, it is necessary to assist in the work of eliminating traitors, using persuasion and secret reporting to overcome local corruption and encourage the people to join the army and assist the wounded soldiers. The hundred or so team members led by Mr. Chen are working hard to carry out these tasks, relying on their hard work, courage, and firm determination.

(2) When starting work

The team members, more than a hundred in number, are divided into seven squadrons, each with three platoons, each with four or five team members. Each platoon is independently scattered in various towns and townships to work. Feudal consciousness is deeply rooted in the countryside, and it is impossible to carry out work there without using various methods. First, plays and newspapers are staged in the local area to attract local attention, and then home visits are made. A service bag is carried along to gain the goodwill of the villagers through service, and self-introductions are made to dispel the villagers' suspicions about the team members.

First, it is necessary to gain the understanding and help of the local government, local elders, gentry, and intellectuals, and then rely on their strength to help them develop their work everywhere.

(3) How to encourage joining the army

Whenever a young man is drafted, the team members take some money, firecrackers, and meat to the draftee's home. The money is for the families of the soldiers who are going to war. The firecrackers are set off at the door of his house. Curious villagers all come to watch. At this time, the team members take the opportunity to speak to them, telling them that it is everyone's duty to voluntarily join the army and how glorious it is. This often has a great effect.

(4) Story of military-civilian cooperation

In the XX area, there are many wounded soldiers, but conflicts often occur with the people. If appropriate methods are used to help the wounded soldiers and the people cooperate, great results can be achieved.

Once, a team member told a rural woman to burn some boiling water for the wounded soldiers passing by, but the rural woman refused. So the team leader took out money to buy it from her and explained how the wounded soldiers were injured for the sake of the people and how the people should help them. So the rural woman was moved and willing to provide boiling water without asking for money, and also burned sweet potatoes to comfort the wounded soldiers.

(5) How to run a nursery

Wherever the team members go, if there are many local women participating in labor, they will set up a nursery in the local area. It accepts children from one to six or seven years old. (To be continued)

### If the Chinese Sea is Blockaded?

— Bao Ledi

These days, the Japanese side has been loudly declaring its intention to blockade the Chinese sea. Logically, this is a decisive measure that should be implemented as soon as the war starts. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, Chinese and foreign people were waiting for this move. However, almost two years into the war, they are only making loud noises. If it is regarded as a threat to Britain and the United States to help them seize concessions, or even to coordinate with Germany and Italy in Europe and alienate the rapprochement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, it is difficult to see any threatening power. It is just a frantic action after being attacked.

What does it really mean? We don't need to consult, but now someone has raised the question: If the Chinese sea is blockaded, what changes will occur in China's economy? What most people worry about is that after the blockade, China will not be able to buy military supplies from abroad; the daily necessities of the Chinese people will not be able to be imported; and China's native products will not be able to be exported.

These questions are indeed worth considering. But the answer is "obviously it doesn't matter."

First: Since the fall of the southwestern ports, the Chinese government's military supplies have been routed through certain international routes, and do not need to pass through the Chinese sea. Therefore, if Japan wants to cut off overseas military supplies, it should ask the Japanese navy to break through the Singapore military port; it should ask the Japanese army to attack Xinjiang. Otherwise, it is useless.

The second question should be answered in two parts: the occupied area and the rear area. In terms of lifestyle, it should also be answered by two groups of people: those who are thrifty and those who are extravagant. Indeed, many of the daily necessities in the rear were transported from the Chinese sea. However, even without the Chinese sea being cut off today, the Chongqing newspapers still cost more than eighty yuan each, and the market price in Shanghai is now about seven yuan and five jiao. The price of paper in Chongqing is so expensive, but the local publishing industry has not stopped, because they have all adopted local paper. The same is true for the shortage of cotton cloth in the mainland. It can be seen that even without the blockade, it is already the same as being blockaded. At present, the people of the mainland not only maintain their livelihoods, but also increase their income due to the development of handicrafts. Shanghai, a market for foreign goods, will of course face major problems after the blockade, but the most affected will be European merchants. Japanese merchants will not be willing to give up this opportunity, but when the Chinese people are as thrifty as the current mainland people and use local products, then Japanese merchants will have to suffer the consequences themselves.

These answers above also apply to the third question. In fact, it cannot打击 the Chinese government from obtaining export foreign exchange. The result is that it will smash Japan's existing method of obtaining export foreign exchange.

Japan's economic power completely depends on the world commodity market. It takes Chinese raw materials, processes them, and exports them. However, when Japan blockades China, its overseas profits will also be completely blockaded by others at the same time. Although it can occupy the Chinese market, or even have customers for Japanese goods in China, the Chinese purchasing power will inevitably decrease sharply with the decrease in exports. Moreover, its current exports are only for exchanging military supplies. Since China has no military supplies to supply, and Europe and the United States are now prohibiting military supplies from Japan, they will certainly proceed more thoroughly at that time. Some people say that Japan has been waging war against China for nearly two years, but it does not dare to formally declare war and does not dare to truly blockade the Chinese seaports. The main reason is here. That's right, this is the biggest reason, and it still exists now. Therefore, everyone believes that the Japanese side's roar this time is nothing more than a diplomatic intimidation tactic.

### Deduction of "Huaxing Notes" from the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen

— Zhang Zongtao

The Sino-Japanese War has been going on for nearly two years, and Japan has been forced to wage a long-term war. The most important strategy of a long-term war is to consume the enemy's economic power. Although the degree of consumption of economic power is manifested in general economic phenomena, its collective manifestation is probably in the changes in the value of the currencies of the two countries. Therefore, Japan is constantly trying to seize China's foreign exchange reserves in order to directly affect the credibility of the legal tender and indirectly affect the people's psychological resistance, and at the same time reduce China's ability to purchase military supplies from abroad. This is why "United Reserve Bank Notes" were issued in North China. However, the stability of the legal tender has thwarted the Japanese conspiracy, and they have suffered the consequences themselves. The repeated depreciation of the Japanese yen is enough to indicate the trend of the collapse of Japan's economic power, while also proving the optimism of China's anti-war future.

The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today: as far back as June and July of last year, the depreciation was not as severe as it is today. In early May, the Japanese yen on the black market was still above the legal tender, but it began to depreciate when the "Huaxing Commercial Bank" expanded and opened on May 16. As of today, 88 yuan of legal tender can buy 100 yuan of Japanese yen. Why is this? It can be discussed in terms of remote and recent causes:

Remote causes: (1) Currency inflation - Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's economy has gradually become difficult, relying entirely on the issuance of deficit bonds and the printing of banknotes to maintain the war against China. In the early years, Japanese financiers believed that the issuance of Japanese government bonds reaching 100 million yuan would be dangerous. However, today's extraordinary expenditures have caused the amount of government bonds to exceed 19 billion yuan. What's more, the most difficult thing is that most of the government bonds issued have not been absorbed by the people, but are stored in the Japanese bank, post office, and the vaults of large chaebols. Government bonds cannot be digested, and military needs are urgent; therefore, the government has no choice but to issue banknotes to clear the accounts. The issuance of banknotes exceeds the limit, which will inevitably cause currency inflation; that is, planting the seeds for the decline of the Japanese yen.

(2) Insufficient gold reserves - The Millard's Review weekly reported that, according to reliable reports, since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the gold reserves in the Bank of Japan's treasury have been transferred to the United States by 3.5 to 2 million yuan to pay for cotton, iron, oil and other war equipment. Therefore, today's Japanese yen banknotes are virtually without reserves. Apart from the annual production of 2.5 million yuan of gold, there is no other source. However, the issuance of banknotes is increasing sharply; it cannot maintain its credit.

(3) The circulation of military currency - Japan uses "military currency" for military pay in China. The purpose is nothing more than to save the lack of foreign exchange on the one hand and to disrupt the legal tender on the other. However, this kind of non-cash "military currency" is like waste paper when it flows into the hands of the people; those who hold this currency want to get rid of it as soon as possible and exchange it for legal tender. "Military currency" is not unrelated to the Japanese yen; the Japanese yen is greatly depreciated due to the depreciation of "military currency."

(4) The alliance between Japan and fascist countries - The Japanese yen was originally formally linked to the pound, which gained the trust of democratic countries, but since the outbreak of the war, Japan has colluded with Germany and Italy, which has made democratic countries very suspicious of the Japanese yen.

Recent causes: (1) Depreciation of "United Reserve Bank Notes" - Recently, the "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China have been depreciating, and the Japanese yen, which is related to it, has also depreciated. Moreover, speculators took advantage of the opportunity to exchange Japanese yen in North China for legal tender in Shanghai, resulting in a large amount of Japanese yen positions in Shanghai; which made the Japanese yen fall further.

(2) The stability of the legal tender - The foundation of the legal tender was extremely stable. After the establishment of the British loan and the increase of foreign exchange reserves, the external credibility of the legal tender has been enhanced. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign people in the occupied areas who were forced to accept the Japanese yen have exchanged it for the stable legal tender; the Japanese yen has fallen miserably.

(3) Restrictions on the export of goods to China - Japan, seeing the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Central China; feared that it would affect its domestic plans, so it suddenly restricted trade with Central China; thus, a large amount of Japanese yen left in Shanghai could not be absorbed for a while; at the same time, all the "military currency" in the inland areas could not buy Japanese goods, so they were all transported to Shanghai and exchanged for legal tender. Therefore, the supply of Japanese yen in Shanghai exceeded demand, and it was bound to depreciate.

(4) Japan's control over the export of pseudo "Manchukuo" and North and Central China - The soybeans, soybean oil, wheat, cotton and other goods that pseudo "Manchukuo" and North China transport to Shanghai every year, and the rice, silk and other goods that Central China transport to Shanghai are all extremely large in quantity; today, it monopolizes this kind of local products and restricts their transport to Shanghai, resulting in a surplus of Japanese yen chips in Shanghai, and the value naturally declines.

(5) The surge in immigrants - After our army moved west, the number of Japanese immigrants to Central China increased sharply, so the number of Japanese yen brought in must have been considerable. Flooding the Shanghai gold and stock market, it certainly greatly affects the value of the Japanese yen.

At the time when the Huaxing Commercial Bank was established amidst the depreciation of the Japanese yen, it can be seen that there is also a small mutual cause in between.

The establishment of "Huaxing Bank" was initiated by the Japanese; the plan was to issue "Huaxing Notes" to absorb legal tender and seize foreign exchange. Huaxing and "United Reserve Bank Notes" have the same style. However, the "United Reserve Bank" is a participant in the "Japanese Yen Group," so the "United Reserve Bank Notes" it issues are equal in value to the Japanese yen; the "Huaxing Bank" is prepared with legal tender and cuts off its relationship with the Japanese yen, thus reflecting the weakness of the Japanese yen. The black market therefore sold Japanese yen and rushed to buy legal tender.

As for "Huaxing Notes," its value must be even worse than the Japanese yen. Because the Japanese yen is still unwilling to guarantee, who will guarantee its credit? It is very clear. Given the failure of the "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China, the future of "Huaxing Notes" is even more bleak, because the environment in North China is much better than that in Central China: (1) North China's foreign trade deficit is not as large as Central China's. (2) North China's market is not as complex as Central China's. (3) Japan's political and economic power in North China is more deeply rooted than in Central China. Even though the "United Reserve Bank Notes" are still depreciating, the "Huaxing Notes," which are in a more difficult situation, are naturally helpless, which is self-evident (reprinted from Shanghai Shen Bao).

### Victory in the Bloody Battle on the East Bank of the Yellow River; Our Troops Advance and Assault the Enemy's Rear; The Enemy's Offensive Has Been Exhausted, and We Have Moved to the Offensive

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 8th] The enemy in Qianjiang and Yuekou in Central Hubei is still stubbornly resisting and has not retreated as of yesterday. We are still attacking in a large encirclement. One of our units approached Tianmen on the 6th and achieved considerable gains.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, 7th] The enemy concentrated its main force in Western Shanxi and Southern Shanxi this time to invade westward, attempting to peek at the Yellow River and disturb the border of Shaanxi. However, after our army's separate counterattacks, as of the 7th, its offensive has been exhausted, and we have completely moved to the offensive. The invaders from Lishi and Zhongyang have suffered 2,000 casualties in the past week, and several mid-level officers have been killed. The invaders from the vicinity of Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Anyi have also suffered 1,000 casualties in the past three days. On the east bank of the Yellow River, we are excellently expanding our advance and engaging in bloody battles with the enemy. One of our units has advanced to the enemy's rear, posing a great threat to them. Our guerrillas along the Tongpu Railway have been active for days, constantly cutting off transportation. The area around Zhongtiao Mountain is also completely under our control.

The Shanxi Battle is Unprecedentedly Fierce; The Enemy at Zhangdian Flees South

[Central News Agency, Tanqu, 8th] Since the enemy launched a three-pronged offensive in Southern Shanxi on the 6th, the battle has been fierce and unprecedented. The enemy at Zhangdian who fled south occupied Ling Village and Qiaoxia Niu Village (south of Zhangdian), and then divided their troops to attack Shangjian Village (southeast of Ling Bridge), Dachen Village, and Shuntou Village (south of Ling Bridge), with a force of about 1,500. Another force of about 500 attacked Hanyao Village (west of Shangjian), attempting to directly attack Maojin. One of our units advanced to meet them, and another unit bypassed the enemy's flank and attacked them from both sides. The enemy was defeated and fled to Dachen Village. We took advantage of the situation to pursue them and recovered places such as Dong Dachen Gou in the morning of the 8th. Only the remnant enemy is still entrenched in West Dachen. The enemy increased their forces by 400 on the 8th, and we are thoroughly wiping them out. One of our units is actively pressing towards Xia Niu Village (south of Ling Bridge). The enemy is showing signs of retreating. The enemy at Shuntou Village was also repelled by one of our units on the 7th. Subsequently, the enemy reinforced and counterattacked. Our troops are fighting in the southwest area of Shuntou. After our brave counterattack and the successive recovery of places such as Shangjian, Hanyao Village, and Dachen, our morale has been greatly boosted. The enemy fleeing south will not be difficult to annihilate. As for the Jiexian front, the enemy with 3,000 troops also launched a two-pronged offensive on the 6th. One route with 1,200 to 1,300 troops harassed Huanggao Long Cen (southeast of Jiexian), and a small group of 500 to 600 harassed Longquan Village, reaching Xingju (northwest of Pinglu). Another route with 1,000 troops fled east from Monan Town to Daxia Gou Nan. The vanguard of 500 to 600 troops had already passed Che Village (southeast of Xiaojuan) on the 7th. At about 3:00 AM on the 8th, several hundred enemy troops attacked Pinglu from Dongping Tou (directly north of Pinglu), Xingdian (northwest of Pinglu), and Che Village in three routes. One of our units is intercepting and attacking them separately.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 7th] According to military intelligence, after our army recovered Luoluo Town on the 3rd, it immediately took advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated enemy. On the morning of the 5th, we chased them to Yingtou and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for four hours, completely defeating them. We recovered Yingtou. The enemy who invaded the Taihang Mountains from the west has all fled back to Xingtai. In this battle, we captured three enemy puppet soldiers alive, seized more than a dozen guns, more than a dozen hand grenades, and many supplies.

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 7th] More than 300 enemy troops from Bianjie Town, northeast of Anyi, invaded eastward at noon on the 4th. Our army ambushed and waited for them. When they approached the position, we launched a fierce ambush, completely defeating the enemy, who fled in panic. In this battle, we killed more than 100 enemy troops and seized many spoils of war.

Our Planes Bomb Xinhui; Enemy Planes Attack Chongqing Unsuccessfully

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 8th] At 1:00 PM on the 5th, our air force suddenly appeared and circled over the Xinhui-Kaiping highway, dropping seven bombs on the enemy's positions west of Xinhui City. The people cheered and celebrated when they saw this.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 8th] Last night, a group of 36 Japanese planes attempted to bomb Chongqing, but due to bad weather and poor visibility, they failed to wreak havoc. However, when the Japanese planes were returning to Hankou, they passed through Wanxian and dropped bombs. The air raid alarm was issued here at 6:00 PM. The Chinese fighter planes immediately took off and patrolled the area, preparing to give the invaders a painful blow, but the Japanese planes did not appear.

[Central News Agency, Ningbo, 7th] At noon today, four Japanese planes invaded the airspace of Zhenhai and bombed indiscriminately. One plane was shot down by our officers and soldiers, and the pilot was captured. Subsequently, four Japanese warships came and shelled us while trying to rescue the downed plane. The plane has sunk into the sea, and the Japanese warships are still fighting with us as of 6:00 PM.

### Tianjin Authorities Issue Final Ultimatum to the British Concession; Deadline for Surrendering Suspects in Cheng Case; Otherwise, the Concession Will Be Blockaded

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai Outer News, Confirmed News, The Japanese side has again issued a final ultimatum to the British authorities in Tianjin, saying that if the British side does not hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng within two days, the Japanese side will take necessary steps to seal off the British Concession.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Tokyo Outer News, According to a Japanese news dispatch, since the British authorities in Tianjin refused to hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have decided to take free action. For the needs of the environment, the Japanese side will have to blockade the British Concession and cut off its transportation with the outside world. Japanese merchants who have been using the wharves and warehouses of the British and French Concessions in the past have now begun to move. The goods that have been moved out have reached 50,000 tons. In the future, the river transportation center will definitely be transferred from the British and French Concessions to the Special Zone. Also, the Yokohama Specie Bank and Mitsubishi Corporation (United Reserve Bank) in the British and French Concessions are also preparing to move.

### American and French Ambassadors Go to Chongqing in Succession

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th] The American Ambassador to China, Johnson, will leave Kunming on Saturday. Accompanying him will be the military attache of the American Embassy, Johnson, who flew to Kunming from Hanoi last Tuesday. Today, he made a courtesy visit to Long Yun, the chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government. Chairman Long will host a banquet for the American ambassador tomorrow. It is also learned that the French Ambassador, Cosme, will arrive in Haiphong today and fly to Chongqing. Newspapers here are speculating about the French Ambassador's sudden trip to Chongqing because the French Ambassador was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai until September before leaving again. Officials of the French Embassy also declined to explain this matter.

### Taiwan Propaganda; Enemy Warships Shell Japanese Planes; The Incident Location is in Dapeng Bay; ××××××××

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 8th] According to a Taiwan announcement here, a Japanese commercial plane was fired upon by a cruiser near Dapeng Bay. The pilot learned that the warship was a British cruiser. It fired 15 shots, all of which exploded near the plane. When the British warship opened fire, the Japanese plane did not cross British territorial waters.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] It is reported that two Japanese 'Douglas' passenger planes were attacked by a foreign warship on Wednesday morning southeast of Hong Kong. However, no official information has been received here yet.

### The Dingkeler Incident; The British Government Attaches Importance to It; The Cabinet Passes a Protest to Japan; The British Consul General in Shanghai Visited the Japanese Consul Yesterday

[Haitong News Agency, London, 8th] According to a report in the Daily Express on Thursday, regarding the incident in which Ding Keqin, a British employee of Shanghai LUNCHANG Company, clashed with Japanese military police and was stabbed to death, the British Cabinet passed a protest to the Japanese government. Also, a British government newspaper said that it would demand a formal apology from the Japanese government and punish the Japanese military officers involved in the incident.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] News from Shanghai, Dingkeler was taken from Pudong to Gongji Hospital and carefully treated by a German doctor and two Norwegian doctors, but he eventually died. The wounds he suffered clearly indicated that they were caused by Japanese military bayonets. However, it is difficult to determine whether the Japanese military stabbed him when disarming Ding's pistol or after disarming the pistol. The British authorities are very angry about this matter and will lodge a serious protest to Fang Wu.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Tokyo Outer News, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman issued a statement on the LUNCHANG Company incident in Pudong on the 6th, saying that initially, there was a conflict between workers who opposed the strike and those who expanded the strike. When the Japanese military was about to escort the ringleaders to the Japanese military headquarters, a British person suddenly arrived and opened fire on the Japanese military.

Another British Person Dies Suddenly

[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] Another British employee of LUNCHANG Yarn Factory, Mai Yongster, who had a conflict with Japanese sailors in Pudong, died mysteriously last night. A hospital received an urgent phone call and immediately sent an ambulance to the New Customs Wharf to transport back McLister. McAllister died immediately after arriving at the hospital. It is reported that McAllister was 35 years old.

LUNCHANG Strike; Britain Submits Negotiation

[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] The British Consul General here, Sir Philip Pile, visited the Japanese Consul General this afternoon to request the Japanese side to immediately take steps to protect British industries in Pudong, suppress anti-British movements, and stop inciting Chinese workers in British-owned factories. Pei expressed his views on the entire situation, especially focusing on the LUNCHANG factory incident, and pointed out that yesterday, when two British employees of the factory persuaded the striking workers to return to work, an armed instigator opened fire.

Small Comment

### Shanghai, or Harbin?

'The Northeasternization of North China' and 'The Northernization of Central and South China' have become slogans of the past. In the eyes of the Japanese invaders, today's Central and South China are already yesterday's Northeast! Let's take a look at today's Shanghai!

'The Shanghai Public Concession searches pedestrians and hotels more than a million times in a month!'

'Ding Keqin, a British employee of Shanghai LUNCHANG Factory, was beaten to death by the Japanese army.'

'Another British person died mysteriously in LUNCHANG Factory!'

Mr. Van Spilberg, an Italian, described in his book 'Japanese Spies' the heartbreaking, painful, and shocking actions of the Japanese in Harbin after the September 18th Incident. These actions have already appeared in Shanghai in an even more intensified form!

However, under the policy of compromise, who can guarantee ××××××××, not to become a continuation of today's Shanghai?

Workers of the World, Unite!

The International Labor Conference opened in Geneva yesterday. Representatives of all parties resolved to respond to Roosevelt's anti-aggression declaration and expressed their sympathy for the joint resistance of our workers and peasants.

The current situation tells the hard-working masses of the world that our common enemy is the fascist aggressors and their running dogs. Therefore, the main task of the working masses is to unite and oppose fascism and aggressors. This is the case in the Soviet Union, in democratic capitalist countries, and especially in the countries invaded by the Wang fascists.

Chinese laborers want to unite with peasants. We have already awakened and started to unite under the banner of anti-fascist aggression to participate in the war of resistance. From now on, Chinese and foreign public opinion circles should work together to unite the world's workers and move towards the road of anti-fascist and anti-aggression. In order to defend democracy and peace, and to liberate ourselves!

Paper Bullets Out

Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Affairs Office, ordered all railway stations and ferries to transport newspapers free of charge. It is reported that the Guangdong Provincial Government has ordered its subordinates to comply.

At present, in the War of Resistance, we need to mobilize all the people to overcome difficulties and win victory. The supreme leader has already shown us the principle that 'propaganda is more important than combat.' It can also be said that it is time for the total mobilization of paper bullets!

Our colleagues in the press and cultural circles should quickly recognize the position we are in! Let's launch our paper bullets to the front lines, to the rear of the enemy, and to the vast masses! The motherland is warmly calling us!

### The Shanghai Financial Market Remains Highly Volatile; The Pound Soars; The Japanese Yen Fluctuates Erratically

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 8th] The British Consul General visited the Japanese Consul General today and made an oral protest against the Japanese side's incitement of workers to oust Britain. The British Consul General especially pointed out that the strike had already been resolved. However, the Japanese armed plainclothes team still forced the workers not to return to the LUNCHANG factory. He requested the Japanese side to take effective measures to prevent the above incident from happening again. A spokesman for the British Consulate said that the protest regarding the Dingkeler incident is being drafted and may be submitted tomorrow.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] 'Financial News' commented on the issue of the devaluation of the national currency today, saying, 'The attempt to maintain the Chinese legal tender at eight pence or eight and a half pence has been abandoned. The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee decided yesterday to let it rise and fall naturally so as to obtain a natural level and then maintain it again. This decision is intended to balance China's import and export trade and prevent the escape of large amounts of funds. It is reported that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has spent 5 million pounds. However, it is inaccurate to say that the source of funds is about to run out.

[Hong Kong News] Our Foreign Exchange Administration previously announced the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange. The financial community here attaches great importance to it. This morning, a reporter specifically interviewed Zhong Daching, the chairman of the Gold and Silver Exchange, and asked about this matter. According to him, our Foreign Exchange Administration previously stopped selling foreign exchange. My brother also received a telegram this morning saying that the Huaxing Bank has issued a large number of military tickets in the past month, attempting to absorb our national dollars and transfer them to foreign exchange, intending to disrupt our country's finances. However, our Foreign Exchange Administration has already anticipated this and taken this measure to deal with it. This matter has no real impact on our country's finances. The price of national dollars fell slightly this morning because there were fewer buyers. This is a temporary matter, and it is expected to return to its original state in one or two days. Also, it was learned that the price of national dollars was slightly lower this afternoon than the previous day. The lowest price in the morning was 455, and then it rose to 467. The provincial milli-coupons were 370.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] The Japanese yen continued to fall today, with 100 yuan worth 91.1 yuan of national currency, which is even lower than the previous week's 94.5 yuan of national currency. Later, because our national currency fell slightly against the British pound, 100 Japanese yen rose to 94 yuan of national currency again.

### Enemy Navy Claims to Stop Searching Mail Ships; Great Flattery to the Powers

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesman for the Navy Department announced today that famous mail ships will not be subject to Japanese restrictions and inspections. He said that the policy of the Japanese Navy has not changed and continues to respect the commerce of third countries. However, because foreign flags are often misused, the Japanese Navy boards ships to inspect them to clarify the nationality of the ships, which is 'necessary'.

### The National Government Orders the Arrest of Wang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The National Government ordered on the 8th that Wang Zhaoming violated national policy and disregarded righteousness. At a time when the whole country was united in the War of Resistance, he deserted his post,妄主和議, and echoed the enemy's absurd arguments, hoping to incite people's hearts and obstruct the overall plan. After being punished by the central government, he still did not wake up, and went against the tide, secretly going to Shanghai last month, not hesitating to attach himself to the ranks of traitors, colluding with the enemy, and plotting wrongdoing. He is ashamed to collude with the enemy, and his actions to harm the country clearly violate the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Recently, people at home and abroad have expressed their deep indignation and have submitted more than a thousand requests for arrest and severe punishment. If the government still shows tolerance, how can it uphold national law and comfort our soldiers and civilians? All military and political organs across the country should immediately arrest him and punish him according to law in order to maintain discipline. This order.

### The Red Society on the Jinan Front (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Shanxi War Zone, Jin Zairong

On the Jinan front, news of the "Red Society" (i.e., the Red Spear Society) is often heard. Such groups are truly mysterious in our eyes. I always wanted to visit them once to see what it was all about. Coincidentally, two "Red Society" liaisons from northern Pinglu came. They didn't have the airs of the Boxers but had the proper respectful attitude of farmers. I obtained their consent and decided to go back with them.

One morning with a light drizzle, I set off with the two "Red Society" liaisons. It was more than sixty li from where we lived to the "Red Society" village. The Jinan alluvial plain has the most ravines. After the rain, the mud roads were incredibly slippery. When we passed a five-hundred-foot-high ravine, we didn't walk down but rolled down. At the foot of Zhongtiao Mountain, where it was quite close to the front line, was the defense area of the Sichuan Army. Here, some of the mountain roads were damaged, which was even more annoying. We became snakes or reptiles. We didn't arrive at the "Red Society" village—××gou—until five o'clock in the afternoon.

××gou is a not-so-deep mountain valley with many cave dwellings. At the east and west ends of the valley, stalwart and robust farmers stood guard. They all held red-tasseled spears, calmly watching the front, because the ×'s (enemy) positions were only two li away. On the not-too-distant earthen hill, there were even the ×'s artillery positions, so the village was bombarded by cannons every day!

The "Red Society" meeting place was in a Temple of Heaven and Earth. After I entered the temple, many strong farmers and children had already gathered. They didn't ask "Where does the guest come from," but took away the two rifles we brought (the guns were brought to give to them). They cocked the guns outside, making clacking sounds, which shows how much they loved guns. We were received by the local village head. Because he didn't know our purpose, he showed considerable embarrassment. After we explained our intentions, he finally relaxed. Then, I met the "Red Society" leader. It is said that on both sides of the Zhongtiao Mountain Range in Jinan, from Yangcheng County to Yuncheng, there are more than 80,000 members of the "Red Society," divided into four branches: Qianmen, Yixintang (also known as Heidaomen, Kanmen), Baishentang, and Qianshunhui. Each branch has a general headquarters; under the general headquarters are branch headquarters. Now distributed in northern Pinglu is Qianshunhui. The general headquarters is in ×× village, which belongs to Xia County north of Zhongtiao Mountain. It has more than 700 members.

As for the "Red Society" in northern Pinglu, it is a spontaneous organization of farmers. Most of them live in villages in front of or to the side and rear of the ×'s (enemy). They are unwilling to flee their homeland and unwilling to be obedient subjects. After being trampled by the ×'s, they united to protect their homes. After these organizations were established, they fought against the ×'s. Therefore, the ×'s now dare not underestimate the local people. They dare not come to the countryside again without a large force. Now they are distributed in six places: Anjiagou, Suhancun, Shaobao, Fengkou, Gucheng, and Yaotou, with about 200 members, forming a large encirclement against the ×'s.

Some people rumored that the "Red Society" was being used by the ×'s. The source of the news is this: "Although Xia County and Anyi County north of Zhongtiao Mountain have fallen, the ×'s cannot completely rule them. The people established the Red Spear Society to protect their homes under such circumstances, but because they were not strong enough, they dared not fight against the ×'s. They only wanted the ×'s not to come and considered it done. The ×'s also carried out mass movement work, often interacting with them, and often summoning them to meetings, lending them livestock for farming, and engaging in public buying and selling. They wore the 'Red Society' armband and amulet belt (one of the society's sacred objects, a three-inch-wide blue cloth strip with a talisman hidden inside, worn diagonally across the body, which can protect the body) and could enter the city (ruled by the ×'s) without trouble. In order to strive for their existence, they had to perfunctorily deal with the ×'s. This is the origin of the news that the 'Red Society' is being used by the ×'s." As for the "Red Society" in the south of the mountain, it is completely different from the north of the mountain. It confronts the ×'s and often destroys the ×'s telecommunications.

### Revealing the Secrets of the Pseudo-Huaxing Bank from its Organization, Business, and Motives

— Chen Baorong

Regarding the role and impact of the pseudo-"Huaxing Bank," the author attempts to study the content and future of this monstrous creation from the bank's organizational structure and planned business policies.

According to the latest issue of the "International Economic News" published in Tokyo, the organization of the bank is as follows:

Name – "Huaxing Commercial Bank" (English name: HuaHaingCommerceialBank).

Location – "Head Office": No. 2, Route Sayle An, Shanghai; Nanjing Branch: Corner of Lingkang Road and Zhu Shen Road. The above head office and branch are said to have "opened" on May 15. There are plans to add "branches" in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places.

Capital – 50 million yuan (considering its attempt to make "Huaxing notes" equal in value to legal tender, the value of the capital of 50 million yuan seems to be equal to 50 million yuan of legal tender).

Investors – Pseudo "Reformed Government": 25 million yuan

Japanese side: 25 million yuan

(Including) Industrial Bank of Japan: 5 million yuan

Bank of Korea, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sumitomo Bank: 4 million yuan each

Personnel – "President": Chen Jintao (pseudo "Minister of Finance of the Reformed Government")

"Vice President": Oiso Ichi (pseudo "Director of the Central Bank of Manchuria")

"Directors": Okazaki Kaheita (former head of research at the Bank of Japan), Ebara Takenosuke (former auditor of the Yokohama Specie Bank), Shen Ruchang (former director of the Continental Bank), Dai Xunlu (former manager of the Osaka branch of the Bank of China; it is said that Dai also serves as the manager of the pseudo-bank).

"Supervisors": Chen Riping (pseudo "Vice Minister of Finance of the Reformed Government")

Business – (1) Discounting, (2) Documentary Bills, (3) Buying and selling foreign exchange, (4) Buying and selling gold, silver, and foreign currency, (5) Deposits, (6) Arranging negotiable instruments, (7) Safe keeping, (8) Savings

Special Features – Issuing "Huaxing Bank Notes." At the time of opening, the "Reformed Government" will deposit 10 million yuan of interest-free deposits and manage "state treasury affairs of the Reformed Government."

Term – "Business term: 30 years."

From the organization of the bank, it can be seen that it has no future. It is clearly a plundering mechanism formed by the heads of the Nanjing pseudo-"Reformed Government" and the Japanese financial conglomerates and military authorities. It hangs the signboard of "Commercial Bank" to distinguish it from the "Joint Reserve Bank," which carries the name of "National Bank." Rather than wanting to establish "natural credit" (i.e., credit not created by force), it is more like a result of the distribution of spoils among the heads of the Northern faction. The fierce struggle for power and profit between the two pseudo-organizations in the North and South can be seen from this.

The motives for establishing the "Huaxing Bank" and issuing counterfeit banknotes differ between Japanese merchants, the Japanese military, and the pseudo-organizations. The Japanese merchants' motives lie in the shortage of raw materials and foreign exchange. They hope to fully obtain raw materials and foreign exchange resources from within the Chinese war zone. However, they want a financial institution that can control Chinese trade and a currency that can be freely used to achieve the above objectives.

The Japanese military's motives lie in the shortage of military supplies and strategic concerns. Because they have no foreign exchange, they cannot buy foreign weapons. Not having enough funds to pay the huge troops is their most painful shortage of military supplies. The activity of guerrillas causes the Japanese military the most headache. The front line is always strained, and the rear is restless. Strategically, they really feel helpless, so they want to destroy the financial foundation of our army from a monetary and financial perspective.

As for the motives of the beastly pseudo-organizations, in a nutshell, they plan to get rich fully. These people take on the roles of "new nobles" simply to make some money. If they cannot create money, it is difficult to satisfy their desires. If they cannot control their subordinates, it is even more difficult to buy a large number of cronies and henchmen.

Therefore, they agree in principle on issuing "Huaxing notes" and destroying legal tender, but they have their own ideas on how to do it. It is said that using legal tender as a reserve for "Huaxing notes" is the victory of the Japanese financial conglomerates and pseudo-organizations. They really hope that legal tender will collapse, but knowing that it is hopeless, they think that by relying on the light of legal tender, the counterfeit "Huaxing notes" will become valuable. Then, Japanese merchants can plunder raw materials in the war zone, reducing their need for foreign exchange for China. The pseudo-organizations can pay salaries, making it easier to tame cronies and henchmen. However, the opinion of the Japanese military department is absolutely contradictory. While hoping to rely on the light of legal tender to give "Huaxing notes" foreign exchange value and make it easy to pay salaries, they also hope that under the connection between "Huaxing notes" and legal tender, the credit of "Huaxing notes" will go bankrupt, and the credit of legal tender will also go bankrupt along with it. Since our Exchange Stabilization Committee announced the suspension of applications for foreign exchange and lowered the black market price of legal tender, this attempt has undoubtedly failed.

The main task of the bank seems to be issuing counterfeit banknotes, but the Bank of Japan, which has the nature of a Japanese national bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, which has the nature of an exchange bank, do not participate. This shows that they have already decided not to maintain the counterfeit banknotes. It also reflects the non-cooperation of Japan's bureaucratic financial capital and Japan's military financial capital (such as the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan) in this regard.

The failure of the "Joint Bank" and the "Joint Notes" has made them realize that bayonets cannot handle financial work, and force cannot establish monetary credit. But how easy is it to establish natural credit? Moreover, although the so-called capital of 50 million yuan is said to be "actually paid-in," who would actually believe it? Looking at the aforementioned so-called "privileges," it is listed that the "Reformed Government" will deposit 10 million yuan of interest-free deposits in the bank at the time of its opening and manage "state treasury affairs," which shows its internal emptiness. I dare to believe that most of this capital is offset by Japanese military scrip, because in fact they have no surplus funds.

Looking at the "Huaxing Bank's" main business, it is "controlling trade exchange," not handling ordinary commercial financial loans. But controlling imports will only worsen "international disputes." Controlling exports is technically difficult and will determine the failure of his entire conspiracy. Because his only possible method is: intercepting halfway and compulsory buying and selling, and it must be backed by bayonets. This fundamentally cannot establish natural credit for "Huaxing notes." The result will inevitably repeat the failure of "Joint Notes." Moreover, to make the interception successful, there must be a close-knit "smuggling" network. But in China's rural society and old peddling economy, this net will inevitably be full of holes. Moreover, it is a time of chaotic war, an era when guerrillas are active everywhere, and at most only a small number of exports can be intercepted. Moreover, most of the export foreign exchange that can be intercepted must be embezzled by the small fries and Japanese ruffians who are currently responsible for this kind of interception and fraud, or they will be bribed and released, or swallowed up entirely. Japanese financial groups and bureaucrats have long seen through this result, so the six major Japanese banks are only willing to contribute 25 million yuan of capital, which is a sign of eating rat poison with their eyes open.

To make "compulsory buying and selling" effective, the condition is that "Huaxing notes" must have value. But the promotion of "Huaxing notes" will inevitably rely solely on "compulsory buying and selling backed by bayonets." The "Huaxing notes" simply have no credit and cannot naturally generate their value at all, so they are still abolished.

To make legal tender collapse with the failure of "Huaxing notes" is a thought. Let alone the fact that legal tender itself has reserves, international credit, and natural credit woven from political and economic factors, just taking legal tender as the "reserve for Huaxing notes" will instead promote the credit of legal tender and make people love legal tender, and even refuse to use "Huaxing notes" because of this. Because legal tender has strength and credit, it will be forcibly pulled to guarantee it. Even a three-year-old child understands this principle. Moreover, legal tender is not guaranteeing it at all. Besides the Japanese and puppets, no one will believe that legal tender is the guarantor of "Huaxing notes." This conspiracy to "drag people into the water" will naturally have no hope of success.

### If the Soviet Union is Drawn into the War, Britain and France Will Provide Assistance. Chamberlain Declared in the House of Commons that Mutual Assistance Negotiations are Proceeding Smoothly.

(Central News Agency, London, 8th) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the Soviet Union becomes involved in war with any European country due to the aggressive actions of another country, Britain and France will provide full military assistance. The provisions of the Anglo-French-Soviet pact are not limited to direct attacks on Soviet territory.

(Central News Agency, London, 8th) It is reported that the authorities have decided to send Sterling, the director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, who is currently on vacation in Poland, to Moscow to ensure the smooth progress of mutual assistance pact negotiations.

Britain Sends Central European Director as Special Envoy to the Soviet Union

(Reuters, London, 7th) Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Sterling, the director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, will be appointed as the British special envoy to the Soviet Union. Sterling recently went to Bojing in a private capacity to visit the British Minister to Poland and has now returned home. It is reported that Sterling has participated in the entire process and evolution of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so he is very suitable for the task of conveying instructions to Ambassador Seeds on behalf of the government and can be expected to enable the early conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement. It has recently been learned from diplomatic circles that a draft agreement that can satisfy the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, has generally been established. The general basis of this agreement includes the condition of mutually guaranteeing each other's "important benefits" if they are threatened with infringement. In the future, individual declarations can be used to express their "important rights and interests." If the Soviet Union declares that the territorial integrity and political independence of the Baltic countries are its important rights and interests, the problem of guaranteeing these countries can be avoided, and in practice, a guarantee can still be obtained. According to the general official psychology, now that the principle of absolute mutual assistance advocated by the Soviet Union has been agreed upon, it does not seem difficult to find a way to resolve all differences of opinion. Sterling is scheduled to depart from London by plane on Friday and arrive in Moscow around Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, it is generally speculated that there is full hope for the establishment of a thorough agreement next week.

Prime Minister's Report to the House of Commons on the Latest Situation of Anglo-Soviet Negotiations

(Reuters, London, 7th) Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, saying: "Given the reasons that Parliament can appreciate, the government authorities cannot report on the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations every day. However, the current has reached another stage, which is enough for me to supplement the report of May 24. As a result of recent exchanges of views between Britain and the Soviet Union, the two countries have reached unanimous agreement on major issues. I believe that the British government has satisfied the Soviet Union's hope and is ready to conclude an agreement based on complete mutual relations. At the same time, it will clearly express its readiness to unite with France without reservation and provide full military assistance if the Soviet Union encounters aggression. The so-called full military assistance is not limited to the invasion of the territory of any of the three countries, but to be carried out in certain circumstances when any government of the three countries feels that its security has been indirectly threatened by the actions of other European countries. The above-mentioned certain circumstances have been reviewed at length. Regarding this point, I hope to obtain a method that can be accepted by the three countries, which can take into account the interests of other countries and obtain the cooperation of these countries to jointly resist aggression. At present, there are still one or two difficult problems to be resolved, especially the status of certain countries, which are unwilling to accept guarantees from other countries on the grounds of deliberately maintaining absolute neutrality. Since these countries are unwilling to accept guarantees from other countries, there is no way to force them to accept them. However, I hope to find some ways to prevent the above-mentioned difficulties and other unresolved issues from becoming an obstacle to the principle of mutual assistance and resistance to aggression. In order to promote Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it has been decided that the Foreign Office will send a representative to Moscow to explain to the local British ambassador the British government's views on all unresolved issues. I hope that this will enable the negotiations to be completed as soon as possible, so that the opinions of the three governments can converge and a "final agreement" can be established.

Regular Contact Between the Staff Departments of Britain, the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania

(Central News Agency, London, 7th) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Chamberlain made a general statement on the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, and said that the governments of Finland, Latvia, and Estonia had recently notified the British government that they were willing to strictly maintain neutrality, so the guarantee being negotiated by the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union was unwilling to accept it. A member then asked the Prime Minister whether the British Staff Department had held talks with the Staff Departments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, or whether there were any plans to do so. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The staff departments of the countries concerned maintain contact, which is a regular way of contacting the military authorities of the resident country through the military attachés of the embassies. In recent months, in order to develop this method, certain countries have been supplemented, and in the future, we should try to supplement them uniformly, but for the sake of national interests, it is not convenient to disclose the details."

Chamberlain Still Believes that the Agreement with Italy is Successful

Chamberlain made a lengthy discussion on the situation in Spain, saying, "All situations are under the government's consideration. The British government does not intend to submit any notes to the Italian government at this time. It will determine the next steps when the situation changes, there are substantial changes and new developments." Chamberlain replied to subsidiary questions, saying, "The Anglo-Italian agreement has not been broken. 20,000 Italian troops and 6,000 German troops are enough to show that most of the foreign troops have now withdrawn from Spain. The Italian Air Force stationed in Majorca has been reduced, and many pilots have also left. It is expected that the Italian Air Force personnel currently stationed in Spain will also return home soon. Only two German Air Force personnel remain at the Majorca air base, and the rest have returned home. The United Kingdom and Italy exchanged telegrams in the past to exchange views. The main purpose was to avoid Italy managing war materials in certain Spanish bases. According to current information, the Italian army in Spain has now withdrawn, and our main purpose has also been achieved."

It is reported that General Gort also explained the structure of the new British tanks to General Gamelin. According to reports, this type of tank is one of Britain's secret new weapons.

### A Historic Visit: The British King and Queen Arrive in the United States. US Secretary of State Hull Greets Them Respectfully. 500,000 People Cheer at the Canadian-US Border.

(Reuters, Niagara Falls, USA, 8th) The British King and Queen arrived at the US border at 2:40 this morning (standard time). Twenty minutes later, they set off for Washington.

(Associated Press, Niagara Falls, 8th) US Secretary of State Hull welcomed the British King and Queen to the United States today, saying, "On behalf of the American people, I extend a warm welcome to Their Majesties. It is a great honor and pleasure. We are extremely happy that Their Majesties have come to the United States. We are willing to treat each other with a spirit of harmony and friendship, and we deeply hope that Their Majesties will have an extremely pleasant stay in the United States." The King smiled and thanked them. Mrs. Hull then took the stage and said, "I feel honored to welcome Their Majesties now." When the King's special train arrived at the station, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie was the first to jump off and wait in front of the King's carriage for the King to get off. Also disembarking were Lord Alton and Mr. Allieber, who were accompanying the King. They went to the King's location, but were stopped by the guards. Even after explaining, it was ineffective."

(Reuters, Niagara Falls, 7th) After holding the customary farewell ceremony in front of the Great Falls in Canada today, the British King and Queen drove to Table Rock, where they were led through the winding tunnels of the falls. When they arrived at the US border, US Secretary of State Hull introduced the welcoming personnel to the British King and Queen. Among them was a naval adjutant who would accompany the King and Queen at all times during their stay in the United States.

(Reuters, Niagara Falls, 7th) Canadians warmly welcomed the British King and Queen to the United States tonight beside the Great Falls in Canada, because crossing the falls is the US border. Americans there are already waiting to welcome the second British monarch and Queen to set foot on American soil. Nearly 500,000 people from Canada and the United States gathered here all day to watch this historically famous border crossing. US Secretary of State Hull came from Washington and will welcome the British King and Queen within the US border at the border. Hull told reporters that this kind of international visit is an example for some countries in the world that specialize in making trouble. There have never been two countries in the world that have as many similarities as the United Kingdom and the United States. The British King and Queen still had two and a half hours in the Canadian Falls Park before re-boarding the train at 1:30 AM (standard time) and crossing the international bridge to the US border. As soon as they crossed the international bridge to the US border, British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, will introduce US Secretary of State Hull to pay his respects. Hull, like all members of the welcoming committee, is wearing a lead-west suit. There are currently 10,000 schoolchildren gathered outside the hotel where the British King and Queen are dining, hoping that the British King and Queen will appear on the terrace to overlook the scenery of the falls. After the British King and Queen arrive at the US border and meet the welcomers, they will return to the train and go directly to Washington. US President Roosevelt will personally greet them at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

The third article sets the effective period of the treaty to ten years. (Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th) The non-aggression pacts between Germany and Latvia, and Germany and Estonia, were signed this morning.

Editorial

### Striving for the Final Victory in the Financial War

The famous Austrian general Montecuccoli once said, "The first element of war is money, the second element is money, and the third element is also money." In the First European War, if Britain, France, and other countries had not received loans from the United States and the supply of military goods, they would have been defeated before the United States declared war. Today, any war is inextricably linked to finance. Therefore, while striving for ultimate victory on the battlefield, we must also strive for victory in the financial war to safeguard and accelerate the victory of the all-out war of resistance.

In the twenty-three months since the start of the war of resistance, under the wise leadership of our authorities, and with the loyal patriotic support of the national financial community and national capital for the central government's policies, and with the sympathetic support of international friends, we have consistently maintained a dominant position in the financial battles as well. Conversely, the Japanese financial community has encountered serious difficulties and crises. The reality of malignant inflation is not only destroying its national economic structure, but also increasing the difficulties of its military invasion of China. The recent disastrous defeat of the puppet currency policy in North China further proves that all Japanese attempts to solve its difficulties are dead ends. According to yesterday's telegraphic news, although our legal tender has been deliberately devalued to only 50% of the value of the Hong Kong dollar, it is still higher than the Japanese currency, which has been falling wildly and irretrievably, by 60 points!

The current Japanese financial strategy is mainly based on political offensives: supporting the puppet regime of Wang Jingwei and other traitors, strengthening the control of occupied areas, and attempting to use our national manpower and resources to solve their own difficulties and increase our difficulties. The activities of the China Development Bank, using the plummeting Japanese currency to exchange for legal tender, and then using legal tender to obtain foreign exchange, are the first step in implementing this strategy. This kind of financial offensive is likely to continue to develop frantically.

In order to deal a heavy blow in a timely manner, we have temporarily suppressed the price of legal tender this time. The power of the Stabilization Committee is used to carry out necessary control. In this way, first, it can break the Japanese and traitorous plan to absorb foreign exchange with Japanese currency to threaten the legal tender; second, it can stop the unlimited subsidization of over-importing from Shanghai, which can also be said to strengthen the effectiveness of foreign exchange control (it is said Shanghai has large over-imports in the recent two days, and absorbs 2 million pounds of foreign exchange every day). Third, from an overall perspective, it can adjust exchange rates and foreign exchange situations, prevent speculative merchants, and balance national import and export trade. Therefore, it can be seen that the various rumors after the devaluation of legal tender are obviously unfounded and have nothing to do with the unshakable credit of legal tender.

However, in order to win a greater victory in the financial war, we feel that there are several points to work on: First, since the central government implemented restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange on March 12 last year, domestic and foreign trust has greatly increased, the credit of legal tender has been stable, and military and economic aspects have benefited. However, on the one hand, there are people who are ignorant of conscience who are doing their best to carry out their capital flight, which still needs to be stopped by law. On the other hand, regarding the restriction of foreign exchange, there should be more specific and clear regulations on what is allowed and what is rejected based on the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. That is to say, foreign exchange should be subject to further control, and trade with foreign countries should also be strengthened based on the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. Second, in the future, the Japanese are likely to devote themselves to looting the occupied areas and excluding the interests of European and American powers. Issuing paper money indiscriminately, taking our products, and exporting them overseas to exchange for munitions for further offensives is also an inevitable trend. Therefore, we must also intensify diplomatic efforts to promote the anti-Japanese movement to aid China, and expand guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, calling on compatriots in the occupied areas to refuse to use counterfeit money, and oppose and strike against the Wang Jingwei and traitorous puppet organizations. Third, we must negatively try to block the relationship between the foreign exchange ports of the Japanese puppet regime and the Shanghai foreign exchange market, and at the same time, actively try to move a large amount of Shanghai funds inland and promote local production and economic construction. All of this depends on the enhancement of the government's control, integrity and the prevalence of talented politicians, and on the trust of the entire Chinese nation in the government and the loyal support for the wartime financial and fiscal policies.

### International Labour Conference Concludes; Pays Tribute to China's United Workers and Peasants in the War of Resistance; Calls on Workers of the World to Oppose Aggression

[Reuters, Geneva, 7th] The International Labour Conference is scheduled to be held here tomorrow, attended by representatives from fifty countries. The representatives of various countries attending today held preparatory meetings and passed two resolutions: (1) supporting US President Roosevelt's peace proposal and requesting him to continue his efforts to convene an international economic conference to establish a permanent and honorable peace; (2) expressing deep sympathy to the heroic war of resistance by the Chinese working class against Japanese aggression, and stating that "the world's workers are convinced that this great sacrifice will not be in vain. Chinese farmers will also know how to maintain their independence to resist Japanese aggression, but the Japanese proletariat does not want to participate in aggressive actions."

### Ambassador Hu Delivers Speech; Denounces Fascist "School" for Destroying World Peace and Order

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih delivered a speech at a Columbia University alumni dinner yesterday. Former Czech President Beneš was also present. Ambassador Hu said that a new school of thought has risen in the ideological world, the purpose of which is to eliminate international idealism, and the world order created by Wilson based on the League of Nations has been destroyed by this group of people. Mr. Beneš and I are representatives of sacrifice.

### British House of Commons Discusses Far East Issues; Britain Lodges Representations with Japan Regarding the Yangtze River Issue

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Undersecretary Butler gave a written reply yesterday to the question raised by Sir Milner, a Conservative member of the House of Commons, stating that the British government does not consider it necessary for British merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to inland ports to hold special permits issued by the Japanese army. Ambassador Craigie to Japan has been instructed to make representations to the Japanese government.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Conservative Member of Parliament Suttermann asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the government had acquiesced to the Japanese requirement that British citizens intending to travel to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must hold passports issued by the Japanese military authorities. Undersecretary Butler replied that the government had acquiesced to the Japanese request to facilitate British citizens traveling to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, although the government did not recognize, in principle, Japan's right to restrict and control the actions of British citizens. Ambassador Craigie to Japan had been instructed to formally make reservations to the Japanese side. The situation on the Yangtze River had not yet returned to normal, so the government, on the one hand, made reservations in principle, and on the other hand, acquiesced to the Japanese regulations in order to obtain some convenience.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Undersecretary Butler said in the British House of Commons today, "The British government has temporarily followed the method of carrying Japanese military passes to allow its citizens to go up the Yangtze River, but the British government does not recognize, in principle, Japan's right to restrict the actions of British citizens. The government has instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to formally declare a reservation of this right." He also explained that the government temporarily complied because the situation on the Yangtze River had not yet returned to normal. "We believe it is better to declare a reservation of rights on the one hand, and temporarily comply with the method to gain convenience in going up the river." Chamberlain also replied in writing to a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Ward Low, stating that the government's policy on the situation in the Far East was reflected in the note sent by Japan to the Japanese government on January 14 of that year. "There is no time for a special debate on the matters raised by this issue. I am very sorry, but I also know the importance of this issue and will find an opportunity to debate diplomatic events." Regarding the "Sigrist case," Hua asked Chamberlain to give him a full opportunity when he held a debate on foreign policy on an appropriate day, so that Japan's conspiracy against the foreign concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Gulangyu, as well as Japan's detention of British merchant ships, blockade of the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, could be specially discussed. The Undersecretary replied to the "Sigrist incident" that the government wanted to make detailed demands and must first obtain a full report. It will still take some time before, and said that Prime Minister Chamberlain had stated on May 24 that the government reserved all rights to claim compensation. The Undersecretary said in a written reply to Ward Low's question, "The government does not recognize that British citizens traveling from Shanghai to the interior need to obtain permits from the Japanese military, and stated that the government has received reports." It is said that the Nanjing puppet Provisional Government had stated that after June 1, foreign ships wanting to unload goods at the Jiujiang shore must first obtain a permit from the Japanese military authorities. The government has instructed Ambassador Craigie to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government and ask the Japanese government to immediately instruct the relevant authorities not to insist on Japanese military permits, because the British government has not recognized this necessity. Mr. Butler then reported on the incident at Tongji Hospital in Hongkou on April 24. When British police officer Sampson was investigating the death of Dr. Li Li after being hit, he was suddenly beaten by a Japanese military officer. The British Consul General in Shanghai has protested to the Japanese Consul, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has also protested to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The government will do everything in its power to protect the lives of British citizens.

[Reuters, London, 7th] At a meeting of the British House of Commons today, Colonial Secretary MacDonald reported on the British Malaya's contribution to the British Empire's defense expenditure, which was greatly cheered by the members of the House. He said that in the past thirty years, Malaya had contributed a total of more than 7.25 million pounds to the British Empire's defense construction. In addition to this amount, the Malayan government bore the cost of local defense forces, including the British garrison, amounting to 15 million pounds.

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 8th] The Governor of French Morocco, Nogues, arrived here yesterday and visited the new British overseas garrison commander, General Aiyunson. Nogues was accompanied by three staff officers.

Belgium Insists on Neutrality

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 6th] The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee recently submitted a report on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget proposal, which will be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion within days. The content states that the main points of diplomacy are divided into three points: (1) Belgium is determined to maintain neutrality, and will not accept any military agreements, whether collective or reciprocal in nature; (2) If other countries have any intentions towards the Belgian Congo colony in Africa, they will resolutely reject them; (3) The relationship between Belgium and the Netherlands is close, and there is no need to conclude a military agreement.

Sweden Expands Navy

[Haitong News Agency, Stockholm] Yesterday, Swedish Navy Commander General Kannis said that since the parliament opposed the naval treaty signed with Britain, Sweden has the freedom to expand its navy. The Swedish Parliament will soon draft an expansion plan. Now, in order to protect its neutral rights, Sweden needs to build six new ships, each with a displacement of 12,000 tons, a speed of kilometers per hour, six 28-gun cannons, six to eight 15-gun cannons, and several good anti-aircraft guns. The Swedish Navy Commander also said that the cost of building the ships is estimated to be approximately 65 million Swedish krona.

### British Government Promulgates Regulations; Instructs Air Defense in British Territories; Detailed Regulations for the Construction of Air Raid Shelters; Hong Kong Will Also Proceed According to These Methods

The clouds of war are gathering, and the invading countries are trying to take risks. For two years, the situation in Europe has been turbulent. In order to maintain world peace and prevent riots by ambitious countries, the British government is implementing military preparedness, strengthening national defense strength, and preparing for contingencies. The safety and defense of the British mainland and its colonies are actively preparing, and air defense work is the most important. Looking at the tension of Hong Kong's air defense work in recent years, it can be seen that in the future war, aerial warfare will inevitably become one of the most tragic. The British government cannot help but prepare for this.

Promulgates Regulations; Instructs Air Defense

The British government has repeatedly announced air defense plans for its domestic regions and colonies. Recently, it published a white paper detailing air defense regulations for factories, shops, and houses, instructing air defense methods for factories, shops, and houses in wartime to protect the safety of their employees or workers, and stipulating that all shops and factories employing more than 50 employees or workers, located close to dangerous areas, must comply with these methods. The book specifies the construction methods, raw materials, area, and location of indoor and outdoor air raid shelters, trenches, or tunnels. The regulations will be implemented in various parts of the United Kingdom and in British colonies and leased territories. Hong Kong will also carry out air defense work according to the methods instructed in the white paper.

Protecting Safety; Two Methods

It has been learned that one of the most important sections of the regulations is the equipment of air raid shelters in factories, houses, and shops. Although there are no provisions requiring air raid shelters to have defenses against poison gas, the regulations stipulate that they must have the above-mentioned preparations so that they can be dealt with at any time in an emergency. This point has slightly changed from the British government's initial poison gas defense plan. The regulations state that the location of the air raid shelter should be as close as possible to the position of the people taking shelter, so that whether during the day or at night, the evacuees can arrive within five minutes of hearing the alarm. There are approximately two methods for protecting the safety of shop employees. First, set up air raid shelters, trenches, or air raid tunnels on the ground or underground outside the building. Second, build indoor air raid shelters.

Regulations for the Construction of Air Raid Trenches and Shelters

Indoor air raid shelters can be divided into approximately four types: A. Building air raid trenches or tunnels underground in the factory; B. Using the factory's basement as an air raid shelter; C. Selecting suitable houses or corridors and strengthening their consolidation as much as possible to serve as air raid shelters; D. Specially opening up an air raid shelter in the factory building. For air raid shelters, part or all of which are underground, the area occupied by each person shall not be less than six square feet, and the height shall not be less than twenty-five square feet. In order to reduce the loss of direct bombing, each air raid shelter is limited to 50 people. If the area of the room is larger and can accommodate more than 50 people, then every 50 people must be separated by a solid wall, but the total cannot exceed 200 people. The distance between each air raid shelter should also not be less than 25 feet, and if possible, it should be 30 feet.

Pay Attention to Protecting Factory Personnel

Also, in order to avoid the danger of the exit being blocked, each room should have two exits, the further apart the two exits are, the better. As for indoor air raid shelters, they should be located on the ground floor or basement of the building. If due to special circumstances, or in buildings without a basement, the second floor can be used as an air raid shelter. Personnel in the factory who are responsible for guarding machinery or other important work and have considerable air defense knowledge should be provided with proper air raid shelters. The location of outdoor air raid shelters must try to find the most suitable place, and air raid tunnels should be built near the building so that evacuees can enter them calmly in case of an emergency, so as not to cause unfortunate events due to chaotic order. In terms of area, it is stipulated that 1,200 people can be accommodated per acre. For important factories, their air raid shelters should be located near the factory to avoid wasting time for evacuation and hindering their work. In addition, attention should also be paid to the storage of various chemical raw materials and dangerous goods in the factory, and attention should be paid to moving them to avoid accidents, etc. The above is the more important content of the regulations, and there are also specifications for the raw materials used in the construction of air raid shelters, etc.

### Grandson of Former US President Leaves Hong Kong for Home Today

Quintin, the grandson of former US President Theodore Roosevelt, returned to Hong Kong after completing his expedition in Tibet, waiting for a ship to return to the United States. It is now known that Quintin is scheduled to depart on a Canadian ship at noon today to return home.

### Tiger Disease More Ferocious Than Tiger; Beware of Cholera; Do Not Import Uncooked Food; Immediate Injections are the Best Policy

Epidemic diseases are prevalent in Hong Kong, especially cholera. More than fifty cases have occurred since the beginning of summer, and more than half of those infected have died. In addition to holding free immunization injections in various districts, notices have been posted on the main roads in recent days, detailing the dangers of cholera and advising residents to be cautious about their diet to prevent it. The original text of the notice is copied as follows: "Cholera in Hong Kong." Cholera is a very contagious disease. Its symptoms are severe diarrhea and vomiting, muscle cramps, followed by exhaustion, often leading to death. The source of the disease is actually caused by a microbe that contaminates the food and drink (especially the drinking water, milk, fruits, vegetables) that enters the body. This microbe can be eliminated by heat. Preventive measures are as follows: (1) Milk and drinking water must be boiled before drinking; (2) Fish, shellfish, vegetables, and opened fruits, as well as raw food, should not be eaten uncooked; (3) Ice cream, jelly, and soda, etc., should not be eaten unless you know their origin; (4) Try to prevent flies from landing on food; (5) Do not add raw ice to drinks; (6) If you suffer from diarrhea, no matter what, seek medical treatment immediately; (7) Human excrement and the clothes and bedding of patients are all media for transmission, so they must be soaked in disinfectant. Preventive injections can protect against cholera for five months. People from all walks of life can go to the hospitals or medical bureaus set up by the government to receive preventive injections without paying a penny. If you can afford it, please ask your doctor for injections.

### Enthusiastic Registration of Health Personnel: Preparing to Apply for Service Back Home; Over 100 Registration Forms Issued in Three Days

Holding weapons to defend the country is, of course, the duty of every citizen, but coping with modern warfare relies on national mobilization. Anyone with a skill must contribute to the country. This is not only true for those who bear arms. Among the most urgent and numerous needs are health and transportation. Regarding transportation personnel, active recruitment is already underway in the Nanyang Islands, Siam, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Macau, with enthusiastic responses from overseas Chinese. However, in the area of health, only overseas Chinese groups have spontaneously organized medical teams to return home for service. The scale of these organizations is far from meeting the needs of the battlefield.

To meet the needs of long-term resistance, the Guangdong Provincial Government has launched a registration program for wartime health personnel, printing forms and distributing them to various counties for completion. This is because many of these talents usually gathered in Guangzhou, but after the invasion of Guangzhou, many fled to Hong Kong and Macau, representing nearly half of the province's doctors. Therefore, registration is also being conducted simultaneously in Hong Kong and Macau. In Hong Kong, the registration is handled by the China Youth Relief Office, which began on the 5th of this month. Nurses, midwives, and others must register on time, or their licenses will be revoked.

According to Huang Rongyu Zhi, the director of the office, since the beginning of registration, overseas Chinese health personnel in Hong Kong have registered very enthusiastically. In just three days, over 100 registration forms have been issued. The office has only received 300 forms, and based on the current situation, it is feared that this will not be enough. A letter has been sent to the Provincial Health Department requesting additional forms to meet the need.

The purpose of this registration is to allow the authorities to easily recruit health personnel when needed. As for the recruitment process, the registration office may temporarily act as an agent in the future. The regulations and methods for recruitment have not yet been discussed. The registration of wartime health personnel still needs to be reviewed or examined by the responsible authorities, and those who pass will be given certificates, ready for recruitment at any time. It is not yet known whether this work will be handled by the Guangdong Health Department or the Military and Political Health Department.

Furthermore, it has been found that the current voluntary registration of Chinese residents in Hong Kong does not conflict with the talent registration of the Provincial Health Department. Even if each health worker participates in both registrations, there is no conflict. If our country recruits first, doctors originally from the mainland will naturally return home to serve. If our country recruits later, transportation will be cut off, making it impossible to apply. Moreover, most of the existing doctors in Hong Kong are British citizens and must participate in Hong Kong talent registration to meet the needs of emergencies. Therefore, the two can proceed without conflict.

### China War Relief Team to Send Team to Shantou for Service: Flag-Giving Ceremony Scheduled

Since the westward movement, the Guangdong China War Relief Team has expanded its operations and actively trained a large number of personnel to meet the needs of various war zones. Now that our army is about to launch a counter-offensive, the front line urgently needs relief personnel. Hua Zhenzhong, the garrison commander of Chaozhou and Shantou, recognizing this, telegraphed Wu Zemin, the chief of the team, to send a team to Shantou to serve with the army. After receiving the order, Wu decided to send the cadre training class, which had completed its training in Hong Kong, as the third team. It is reported that the team is scheduled to hold a departure flag-giving ceremony at the Tsz Chi Middle School on Nathan Road, Kowloon, at 3:00 PM on the 11th of this month.

### Robbery on Butterfly Valley Road: Teachers and Students Encounter Thieves on Trip

Yesterday, Pan Siwei (40 years old), a teacher at the YMCA, took advantage of the holiday to lead 12 students on a trip to Butterfly Valley in Sham Shui Po. Upon reaching their destination, Pan and student Liang Qiguang walked ahead, about a few feet away from the other students. Suddenly, three thieves, armed with knives, rushed out from the hillside and blocked the path of Pan and Liang, brandishing their weapons and threatening them. Pan, seeing the ferocity of the thieves, dared not resist and allowed them to search him. As a result, a wallet containing $10.50, a gold ring, a dart, and a pen were stolen from Pan. Liang was robbed of $0.45. The three thieves then searched the 11 students following behind, stealing about $4. After succeeding, they calmly fled towards the hillside. In total, silver and goods worth $34 were stolen. Later, Pan and the others returned to the Sham Shui Po police station to report the incident.

### Human Hearts Are Hard to Fathom: Boat Crew Robs Cargo Boat; Two People Tied Up and Thrown into the Sea; One Rescued, One Drowned

The cargo boat No. T929H, fully loaded with 300 cans of kerosene, 100 bags of fertilizer, 20 packages of native cloth, and other miscellaneous goods, set sail from Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, on the morning of the 17th of last month, bound for Haifeng County. There were six crew members on board, including Liu Pei (44 years old). It was about 4:00 PM that afternoon, when they sailed to the Chinese waters six nautical miles southwest of the Henglan Lighthouse, when four of the crew members, including Liu San (25 years old), conspired to tie up Liu Pei and Zhou Liuyi (29 years old), and threw them into the sea, stealing the boat and its cargo. Later, Liu was rescued by another boat, while Zhou was taken by the sea. Liu Zeng only returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday to report the incident to the Tsim Sha Tsui police station. It was found that the kerosene on board was worth $600, the fertilizer was worth $40, the cloth was worth $120, and other miscellaneous goods were worth $20, totaling $780. It was also found that the boat was recovered by the water police patrol boat.

### Commander of the China Fleet, Admiral Noble, Returns to Hong Kong; Rear Admiral Murray Remains in Amoy

Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, who had previously been in Shanghai due to the Gulangyu incident, has now completed his duties and returned to Hong Kong yesterday afternoon on the British warship HMS Birmingham. While in Shanghai, Admiral Noble met with Japanese naval authorities. Rear Admiral Murray, commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the China Fleet, remains in Amoy on official duties, stationed on the British warship HMS Gannet.

### Slow Airmail Delivery: Some Residents Express Dissatisfaction

Some Hong Kong residents are dissatisfied with the slow delivery of "First Class Airmail." According to the schedule of the Imperial Airways flights last week, the flights were originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at noon on Monday, but due to the delay of the Imperial Airways plane, the flights were delayed by 24 hours and only arrived in Hong Kong at 5:45 PM on Tuesday. What residents are dissatisfied with is that the Hong Kong post office stamped the letters at 6:30 PM, but the letters were not delivered to the addresses until 9:00 AM the next morning. When "First Class Airmail" was first implemented, the Hong Kong post office delivered the mail arriving at noon every day on the same evening, but now this method of delivery has been improved.

### Recent Activities of the Chinese Amateur Alumni Association

The Chinese Amateur Alumni Association has recently been actively and intensively carrying out its work. After sending off the second batch of alumni, including Zhang Chu, from eight schools to return home to join the army, the association recently responded to the campaign to collect underwear and trousers. As a result of the efforts of the alumni, HK$201.50 was raised and handed over to the Guangdong All-Circles Committee for Comforting Soldiers Bleeding in Battle through the Ta Kung Pao, which can be used to make about 300 sets of underwear. Recently, to strengthen relief work, the association held its second general alumni meeting at the Chinese Amateur School yesterday to discuss various activities. The meeting was enthusiastic, and the second session of the board of directors was re-elected on the spot. It is reported that the association will also hold a variety show in the near future to raise funds for the elementary school for refugee children.

### Insufficient Capacity of Filtration Plants: Water Restrictions May Be Imposed Again This Summer; Water Affairs Officer Mr. Wood Speaks; Lenient Restriction Method Planned

As a result of the sharp increase in Hong Kong's population, water consumption has been huge, resulting in insufficient supply from the existing filtration plants. Water restrictions may be imposed again. Since the cancellation of water restrictions, water consumption has been extremely high, but the water storage in the various reservoirs in Hong Kong and the central area has not been lacking. There is indeed a lot of unfiltered water, but the filtration plants are not sufficient to meet the demand. Mr. Wood, the water affairs officer, said in a statement that the experience gained from announcing the all-day water supply in Hong Kong on May 23rd shows that it will not be possible to maintain an all-day water supply this summer, especially when there are several days of hot weather. Due to the rapid increase in population at the end of last year, the capacity of the existing filtration plants is difficult to accommodate the large amount of water required. At present, the expansion of the filtration plants has been approved, and the situation is expected to improve by the summer of 1940. If the Bureau deems it necessary, water restrictions will be re-implemented, using a lenient restriction method, that is, supplying water all day on one day and then supplying water for 15 hours the next day. Restrictions will be applied to both Hong Kong and Kowloon. For example, if Hong Kong has an all-day water supply today, Kowloon will only have a 15-hour supply, and if Kowloon has an all-day water supply today, Hong Kong will only have a 15-hour supply.

### A Quick Sketch of the King's Birthday Parade

— Yu Lang

Yesterday, just past seven in the morning, the usually quiet Happy Valley was already surrounded by thousands of people, packed like sardines. The noise was deafening, breaking the silence and turning it into a lively scene. The trams and buses to Happy Valley were still packed, carrying people to watch the King's Birthday parade in batches.

The racetrack was also filled with hundreds of foreign gentlemen and ladies, most of whom were eating an early tea in the bars behind the stands, leisurely waiting for the start of the parade. The crowd outside the hall did not have such enjoyment, but fortunately, the vendors speculated and brought out many pastries to sell to the audience to satisfy their hunger.

At seven-thirty, the army, navy, and air force teams participating in the parade arrived one after another. There were more than 2,500 people in total. The guest seats A specially set up for Chinese and Western officials and the consular corps were also full; the remaining seats for officers' families, scouts, students, reporters, etc. were also full.

At 7:45 AM, Major General Nash, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China, arrived with his chief of staff and aides. All the officers and soldiers under inspection stood at attention to pay their respects.

Major General Jia, dressed in military uniform, rode his horse back and forth, inspecting the team first.

At 8:00 AM sharp, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, accompanied by his aide-de-camp Captain Bate Smith, arrived in a car, escorted by a volunteer motorcycle team. The commander ordered the team to stand at attention and salute. At the same time, the British national flag slowly rose and fluttered at the top of the flagpole in front of the podium.

The Governor, wearing a white gold-epauletted Commander-in-Chief dress uniform, with a badge hanging on his chest, a white plume on his hat, and a sword, was very majestic. The aide-de-camp was also wearing his dress uniform, with a red plume on his hat, looking very dignified. After he returned the salute to the team, he came out to inspect. Although it was raining heavily at this time, the inspection ceremony was held in the rain.

After the inspection, the Governor walked onto the podium. The newly appointed Hong Kong Naval Commander Pitt, Air Force Commander Brown, Naval Volunteer Commander Beatilis, and Army Volunteer Commander Ross and other senior officers were already waiting on the podium.

After the Governor stood still on the podium, the commander gave an order, and the team made a divisional formation, preparing to march past the podium. The Hong Kong Garrison Army band immediately went to the front of the podium and began playing a march.

In the soft sound of military music, Commander Major General Jia led the way, leading the Navy, Naval Volunteers, 8th Heavy Artillery Regiment, 5th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, Hong Kong and Singapore Artillery Hong Kong Regiment, Engineer Regiment, 2nd Battalion of the Scottish Royal Army, 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Army, 5th Battalion of the Lam Put Danny Indian Army, 1st Battalion of the Gao Wang Indian Army, mule team, Air Force, and Hong Kong Volunteer Force and other units, marching around the field.

When the team passed in front of the podium, the officers raised their swords, and the soldiers looked at the officers on the podium. The Governor and other officers on the podium raised their hands to return the salute.

After the parade, the team lined up as before. The Governor and all the officers left the podium and stood in front of the flagpole. After the bugler sounded the horn, the British national flag on the flagpole slowly lowered, and the King's flag was raised instead. The band played the British national anthem, and everyone stood at attention, indicating the King's arrival.

The King's flag is deep red, yellow, and blue. The upper left and lower right are both deep red, and each side is embroidered with a golden harp. The upper right is yellow, embroidered with a red lion and a red border. The lower left is blue, embroidered with a golden lion.

After the national anthem was played, all the officers and soldiers took off their hats and cheered three times, and then sounded the horn again, lowered the King's flag, and raised the British flag instead, indicating the King's departure. Everyone saluted again to see him off. Each time, the Governor represented the King in accepting the salute.

With the ceremony completed, the Governor left first, still escorted by the volunteer motorcycle team. The army, navy, and air force units and the audience also dispersed one after another. It was already 9:30 AM.

### Serving Culture, Helping Youth: This Newspaper Launches Student One Dollar Newspaper Reading Campaign; Deep Sympathy from Various Schools, Who Cooperate One After Another

— Qi Zhuo

For a promising young student, the newspaper—a progressive newspaper—is their spiritual food. If spiritual food is interrupted, they feel empty and lost. If spiritual food is not sufficient, they immediately feel dissatisfied. This is a common experience for many friends—especially young students with a strong desire for knowledge. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the first point.

School textbooks are the source of knowledge for students. A student loyal to learning cannot be disloyal to textbooks. However, the world's knowledge is vast and complex. Cultural progress is also changing rapidly. To think that textbooks are the whole picture of learning is like a frog in a well. So, what is the best supplementary material? What is the most realistic and vivid textbook? Undoubtedly, the newspaper is one of the most important. A student loyal to learning cannot be disloyal to newspapers. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the second point.

Individual survival depends on the entire society. A healthy citizen cannot be ignorant of the dynamics of the country. China is a link in the world, and understanding the international situation is a basic requirement for being a modern person. Therefore, understanding current events and studying current events is one of the life tasks of young students. In Hong Kong, newspapers are an even more important tool for raising the national consciousness of young students. Especially during the great and sacred war of resistance and nation-building movement. This explains the value of newspapers, which is the third point.

The above is only the broad outline. In fact, the benefits of newspapers are far more than this.

A wise teacher makes guiding students to read newspapers one of the important educational methods; guiding students to cut out and paste newspaper clippings becomes a major extracurricular activity. There are indeed many wise teachers in Hong Kong who can understand this. However, the problem then arises:

1. Newspapers are too expensive, and many students cannot afford them;

2. How to cut out and paste newspaper clippings in a rational way?

These are the difficulties that various schools feel in guiding students to read newspapers. This newspaper is honored to be loved by the advanced members of the Hong Kong education community, and we are very encouraged to receive many valuable opinions from them.

This newspaper believes that education is the lifeblood of the country, and newspapers are a sharp tool for promoting education. At this critical moment for the survival of the country and the nation, the education community and the press must strengthen cooperation even more. Therefore, we have launched the "Student One Dollar Newspaper Reading Campaign." The content of this campaign has been seen in this newspaper's "Letter to the Hong Kong Education Community" on Teachers' Day. The general idea is:

1. To introduce as much as possible beneficial to young students in the "moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic" education, and also rich in emotion and interesting opinions and writings; and encourage students to publish their works or opinions—therefore (A) in addition to the original commentaries, special articles, domestic and foreign news, "Free Talk" sports, entertainment, film and drama, etc., we plan to open a "Student Net," specially to welcome student contributions, and pay for contributions, (B) with each school as a unit, with the consent of the school authorities, to hold student current affairs essay competitions, common sense quizzes, and current affairs speech contests, debates, symposiums, etc., so as to make the gains from reading newspapers completely transformed into living knowledge and realistic learning.

2. To guide young students on how to read newspapers, and promote their habit of reading newspapers, we plan to select several important official documents published in our newspaper every morning, encourage students who read newspapers to cut and paste them one by one, classify them according to the nature of each text, so that they can be immediately analyzed and classified after cutting and pasting. All the paper for pasting newspapers, category cards, and classification tables will be pre-made and distributed by our newspaper for students to use. Students can divide and bind the clipped newspapers into volumes every few days, becoming the most intimate and realistic reference materials, on the one hand increasing their ability to understand current affairs, and on the other hand training their general management and office methods. The topics for the current affairs essay competition, current affairs quiz, and current affairs speech debate competition mentioned above are taken from the reference materials obtained from cutting out newspapers, and those who have outstanding achievements will be specially rewarded.

3. To reduce the price of newspapers so that every student can read newspapers without feeling the burden on their parents—therefore, we plan to reduce the price of newspapers as much as possible to one Hong Kong dollar every three months, reading two large sheets of newspapers every day, which is only one Hong Kong cent, which can be said to be an unprecedented record in the Hong Kong press! As for the paper for pasting newspapers, category cards, and classification tables, our newspaper will also handle it on behalf of the students. The paper will be printed with the student's name and the name of the school they belong to, and only a very low price will be charged.

Students who subscribe to newspapers should ask their schools to certify their subscription and fill in their address. Before school starts every morning, our newspaper will send staff to send the day's newspapers along with the important text classification table to each school, and ask each school to distribute them to each student according to their grade. However, on Sundays and public holidays, our newspaper will send them directly to the address of the commuting students.

Some people say: This campaign not only loses money for this newspaper, but also causes us trouble. However, we believe that we have a major obligation to our young student readers, so we are determined to do it.

In recent days, schools that have enthusiastically cooperated with us in promoting this campaign include Zhi Yong Middle School, Overseas Chinese Middle School, South China Middle School, Guangda Affiliated Middle School, Pangguang Middle School, Amateur School, Hainan Vocational School, Zhenguang Middle School, and Ling Ying Middle School. We sincerely request that other schools also quickly join hands with us. And we hope that students' parents will give their full sympathy. We have other detailed methods, and we welcome the education community and young student readers to ask for them. The address is 2 Pottinger Street, Central, the business department of this newspaper, telephone number: 28750.

Shanghai Special Edition

### Shanghai's Opening as a Port

— Dong Bai

Shanghai's geographical advantages drew early attention from foreign merchants. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, members of the British East India Company suggested to their superiors that Shanghai held promise as a commercial port. During the Jiaqing reign, due to strict prohibitions on opium, British merchants trading in Guangdong grew impatient and sought to open other ports besides Guangdong. In the twelfth year of Daoguang (1832), envoys were sent to Shanghai to investigate and request trade, but were refused by Daotai Wu Qitai, and left without success. Three years later, Lin Zexu burned opium in Guangdong, and the British then initiated war with China. In June of the twentieth year of Daoguang (1840), British forces captured Dinghai; in April of the twenty-second year (1842), they occupied Zhaopu; on May 8th, they seized Wusong, and on the 11th, they seized Shanghai. On the 15th, British forces left Shanghai, sailed up the Yangtze River, and attacked Zhenjiang and Nanjing. On July 4th, the British attacked Nanjing. Unable to withstand modern weaponry, China declared negotiations for peace. On July 24th, Imperial Commissioner Ilibu and Qiying signed a peace treaty of thirteen articles, known as the Treaty of Nanjing, with British Plenipotentiary Sir Henry Pottinger. Article Two of the treaty stipulated the opening of five ports:

"(1) Henceforth, His Majesty the Emperor graciously permits British subjects, along with their families, to reside and trade in the five coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, without hindrance. The British monarch may appoint consuls to reside in these five cities, managing commercial affairs and corresponding with local officials. British subjects shall clearly pay duties and taxes according to the regulations outlined below."

Article Six of the Supplementary Treaty of Commerce signed in the twenty-third year of Daoguang (1843) stated:

"In the five ports of Guangdong, etc., British merchants, whether residing permanently or traveling occasionally, must not venture into the countryside to wander freely, nor may they enter the interior to trade. Chinese local officials should, in consultation with the British consuls, determine boundaries based on local customs and terrain, which must not be crossed, to ensure lasting peace between the parties. Sailors and crew members may only come ashore after the consul and local officials have established binding rules. Should any British subject violate these rules and venture far into the interior, regardless of their rank, local civilians may apprehend them and hand them over to the British consul for punishment, but these civilians must not assault or injure them, to preserve good relations."

Article Seven further stated:

"The perpetual treaty stipulates that British subjects may bring their families to reside in the five ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, without molestation or coercion. However, Chinese local officials must, in consultation with the British consul, determine which locations, what types of houses, or land may be leased by British subjects based on local customs. The price must be based on the current market rates in the five ports, ensuring fairness. Chinese citizens must not extort, and British merchants must not forcefully lease. The British consul shall annually notify the local officials of the number of houses built or leased by British subjects, who will then report to the authorities for record. However, the increase or decrease in housing depends on the number of merchants and the prosperity or decline of trade, making it difficult to set a fixed number."

The above clauses all pertain to Shanghai and constitute the fundamental treaty for the opening of Shanghai as a port. On September 17th of the twenty-third year of Daoguang (1843), the first British Consul, George Balfour, accompanied by his translator Walter Henry Medhurst, arrived in Shanghai from Zhoushan. A week later, he declared Shanghai officially open as a port.

With Britain having opened the door to China, France and the United States followed suit. In September of the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang (1844), France and China signed the Treaty of Whampoa, comprising thirty-six articles. In May of the same year, the United States signed the Treaty of Wanghia with China. Both treaties were agreements for the opening of the five ports to trade.

After Shanghai's opening, foreigners gradually arrived to reside and establish settlements, which became known as concessions. The first was the British concession, which had regulations known as the Land Regulations or Property Regulations, commonly called the Yangjingbang Regulations. The first set of British Land Regulations, consisting of twenty-three articles, was promulgated by Shanghai Daotai Gong Muji in the twenty-fifth year of Daoguang (1845), later increased by one article to a total of twenty-four. These regulations stipulated boundaries, procedures for leasing land, and matters to be observed by foreign residents. Subsequently, foreigners repeatedly revised these regulations on their own, forming the basis of today's municipal laws of the International Settlement, unrecognizable from their original form. The original Chinese text of the first set of Land Regulations is no longer available. The English text was published in the North China Herald on January 17, 1852, and a translation is published in the first issue of the Shanghai Municipal History Museum Journal, which scholars can consult for research.

Before the second year of Tongzhi (1863), there was no so-called International Settlement in Shanghai, as the British and American settlements were independent. The establishment of the American Settlement occurred in the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang (1848), initiated by "Wen Jianshi," namely Rev. William Jones Boone of Wen Jianshi Road. Later, due to security issues in the American Settlement, Americans proposed merging the American Settlement with the British Settlement, thus the International Settlement was established. Initially, the British Settlement covered only 138 mu. By the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899), the area of the International Settlement had expanded to 5,583 acres, equivalent to over 33,000 Chinese mu. However, the 47,000 mu of roads built beyond the boundaries were not included. The above figure represents the current area.

The origin of the French Concession in Shanghai dates back to the twenty-seventh year of Daoguang (1847). The first consul was M. de Montigny. The road in front of the Great World (Dashijie) running south from the north, known as Rue Montigny, commemorates this consul. The land initially leased by the French was very small, only two mu, three fen, eight li, and five hao. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year of Daoguang (1849), the French Concession was formally established, covering an area of approximately 56 hectares, with the following boundaries: south to the city moat, north to the Yangjingbang Creek, west to Guandi Temple and Chu Family Bridge, and east to the Chaozhou Guildhall, along the river to the eastern corner of the Yangjingbang Creek. The agreement for the French Concession also stipulated that "if the area is insufficient in the future, other land will be discussed separately." The French Concession expanded once in the eleventh year of Xianfeng (1861), increasing its area by approximately three hectares. It expanded again in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900), increasing its area by another 1,112 mu, totaling 144 hectares. In the third year of the Republic (1914), it expanded a third time, reaching an area of 1,002 hectares, twenty times larger than its initial size.

The administration of the International Settlement was managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局). The organizational structure of the SMC consisted of a meeting of foreign taxpayers, which elected a board of directors. The board then established various committees for different departments. Under the military affairs committee was a director-general, who oversaw the general office. The general office's subordinate departments included the Volunteer Corps, the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Health Department, the Works Department, the Education Department, the Finance Department, and the Intelligence Department.

The Municipal Council currently has fourteen directors: five Chinese, five British, two American, and two Japanese. There is a chairman and vice-chairman. The inclusion of Chinese directors was achieved after a struggle and was realized in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930). The Board of Directors decides on important administrative matters of the Municipal Council and has the power to appoint or dismiss officials within the bureau. Meetings are held every two or three weeks, and important documents are distributed to the directors for their opinions.

The administrative body of the French Concession was the Conseil d'Administration Municipale (公董局). Initially, the directors were appointed by the French Consul, but were later elected according to the organizational laws of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale of the fifth and seventh years of Tongzhi. In January of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), a new organizational law was promulgated, replacing the board of directors with a temporary committee. The committee included five Chinese directors and three Chinese committee members. The participation of five Chinese directors was decided after the victory of the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), following amendments to the regulations of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale.

The internal organization of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale was divided into five departments: (1) the General Administration Department; (2) the Municipal Administration Department, which was further divided into: (i) the Political Affairs Secretariat, (ii) the Finance and Legal Affairs Office, (iii) the Land Office, (iv) the Classified Business Office, (v) the Salt Affairs Office, (vi) the Health and Relief Office, (vii) the Slaughterhouse, and (viii) the Education Office; (3) the Technical Administration Department, which included: (i) the General Technical Research Office, (ii) the Radio Station, Signal Station, and Observatory, (iii) the Fire Brigade, (iv) the Planting and Cultivation Office, and (v) the Public Works Office; (4) the Legal Advisory Department; and (5) the Police Department.

There were three types of courts in the Shanghai concessions: (1) Consular Courts, (2) Mixed Courts, and (3) Special District Courts. Consular Courts were established based on consular jurisdiction. Mixed Courts were organized by consuls from several countries and were established based on the Land Regulations of the eighth year of Tongzhi. The power of the Special District Courts, formerly known as the Mixed Court (会审公堂), was controlled by foreigners. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the Jiangsu Provincial Government negotiated its return and established a Temporary Court. In the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), representatives of the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of five countries—Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil—signed an agreement in Nanjing regarding the Chinese Court in the Shanghai International Settlement. The French representative subsequently signed the agreement as well. The Temporary Court in the Shanghai International Settlement was abolished, and the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established on April 1st. On July 28th of the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), the Chinese government and France signed a Sino-French Agreement regarding the Chinese Court within the French Concession, consisting of four articles and seven appendices. Following this agreement, the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District District Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established in the French Concession.

### Shanghai's Museums

Events and objects recorded in books, no matter how numerous, become mere empty words on paper without real objects to prove them. Hence, the institution of museums exists to supplement the deficiencies of books. The creation of Shanghai's museums can be attributed to Father Heude, a French Catholic priest, who founded the Xujiahui Museum in the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867). The second was the Shanghai Museum, founded by the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874). The Shanghai Municipal Government recognized the importance of museums in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933) and proposed building a museum in the city center. It officially opened in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), and Shanghai finally had a municipal museum for Chinese people. The history of Shanghai's three major museums is described below.

(1) Heude Museum (Aurora Museum)

Father Heude was a biologist who arrived in Shanghai in December of the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867). Seeing that the Xujiahui Catholic Church already had a small collection of biological specimens, he decided to expand it and establish a museum. Soon after arriving in Shanghai, Father Heude began to investigate the interior of China, paying particular attention to the Yangtze River basin. Each return brought a large number of unique specimens. He went to the northwest regions to collect Père David's deer, and his achievements were enormous. His book "On the Deer" has become one of the world's most famous works in biology. In the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), he built a museum south of the Xujiahui Jesuit Generalate to store specimens. It was open to the public every afternoon, free of charge. At that time, the downstairs stored animals, fish, bird skeletons, and the upstairs stored beetles, shells, crustaceans, and taxidermied animals, birds, and snakes. Father Heude presided over this museum for thirty years. Afterwards, it was directed by Father Pierre Marie Le Bourgeois, then by Father Licent Émile, and now by Father Teilhard de Chardin. However, Father Licent Émile is still in the museum as a researcher.

Over time, the collection of specimens grew. The old building was not enough, so in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), a large-scale museum was built within the Aurora University campus. The museum has three floors, each about 80 meters long, divided into three display halls, as well as research rooms, laboratories, libraries, photography rooms, etc. To the south of the museum is a botanical garden for cultivating flowers and trees for research. It opened in the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), with visiting hours set from 2:00 to 5:00 PM on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Admission was two jiao. Currently, the first and second exhibition halls are open to the public. The first exhibition hall displays Chinese antiques collected by Brother Gilles of the Tushan Orphanage. The antiques are divided into metals, jade, pottery, and embroidery. At the north end of the hall is the remains of Huang Quan, a juren from Chongming Xie Jia Town during the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, who died in the sixteenth year of Kangxi. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), his descendants exhumed his grave. The body was not decayed, and his clothes were as new, as was his wife, Madam Lin. The coffin was obtained by Brother Gilles, who sculpted an image of Huang Quan in wood, dressed it in the original burial clothes, and placed it in the coffin along with other items. One of the exhibited embroideries is a type of Gu embroidery, a famous Shanghai product, known as hollow embroidery. The second exhibition hall features biology, such as mammals like rhinoceroses, bears, boars, deer, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks, and insects. The bird specimens are beautifully arranged and lifelike. The insect specimens are also very elaborate, as the museum is currently focusing on entomology. There is a separate plant room with 50,000 specimens. Furthermore, the various books published by the museum are very substantial and highly admired by experts around the world.

(2) Shanghai Museum

The Shanghai Museum is located on the fourth and fifth floors of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 20 Museum Road in the International Settlement. The museum was founded in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874) and has been in existence for over sixty years. The honorary curators have mostly been naturalists and biologists, and the current honorary curator, Sha Weipeiyu (沙韋佩尤), is a giant in the field. Therefore, the museum's exhibits are mostly biological specimens, although there are also many works of art and antiquities. The objects come from China, as the museum focuses on the study of China. The first honorary curator of the museum was Park Lai-a (朴來阿). On the seventh day of the tenth month of the first year of Guangxu (1875), Shen Bao (申報) published a news report about the museum:

"It is a long-standing practice in major cities in the West for residents to build a museum to display birds, animals, and various objects for the enjoyment of those interested in natural history. In prefectural cities, they display items from the state and county; in capital cities, they display items from around the world, calling it a museum. Western merchants residing in Shanghai are now imitating the Western practice and establishing a museum in this port, gathering objects from China and the East. Although the project is just beginning, there are already many items on display. Among the insects are wild boars from the shores of Lake Tai; among the birds are eagles, magpies, sparrows, etc. There are also various objects from the waters, too numerous to mention. Others, such as mantises, grasshoppers, and butterflies, are also divided by species, each labeled with its name. Each object is marked with its origin and the name of the person who donated it. Chinese and foreigners are welcome to visit without charge. The West has a wonderful method for preserving feathers of all kinds, so that even when the skin is dry, the feathers do not fall out. This method has now been obtained by the Chinese, and glass eyes have been purchased from abroad, so that no matter what exotic beasts or rare birds are decorated, they seem to come alive. Everything in the museum is provided by Westerners interested in natural history. The person in charge of this matter is Mr. Park Lai-a of Yuanfangxiang Firm."

Museum Road was originally named Yuanmingyuan Road. The municipal authorities of the settlement, valuing the museum, renamed it. From the second year of Guangxu (1876), the Municipal Council began to donate funds to support the museum annually.

(3) Shanghai Municipal Museum

The Shanghai Municipal Museum was proposed in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933). The funding came from public bonds, with 300,000 yuan allocated for the museum's construction. The exterior of the building was similar to that of the library and located opposite the library. The two buildings faced each other, forming the left and right wings of the municipal government. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), the museum's preparatory committee appointed a temporary board of directors. The chairman was Mr. Ye Gongchuo. Mr. Ye was a lover of art and skilled in managing affairs, so he was well-suited to lead the museum. The board of directors decided that the museum's focus would be on art and history, with a particular emphasis on Shanghai's history.

The museum's construction was completed on Double Tenth Day in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935). The internal layout was roughly as follows: (1) Ground floor: The central entrance is a lobby, approximately 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long, with stairs to the upper floors and cloakrooms and sales rooms attached. From here, one enters the great hall, approximately 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long. The hall displays the Four Great Square Stele of Lu Shen, a worthy son of Shanghai, and twelve Gu embroidery tapestries, a specialty of Shanghai, are hung on the walls. Two clocks are placed, which can indicate the Shanghai time and the corresponding time in various countries around the world. Inside the great hall is a first exhibition room. The corridors on both sides of the hall display various documents related to Shanghai. The left and right wings of the front part of the corridor are offices. The protruding part on the left is the library, and the protruding part on the right is a lecture hall. (2) Second floor: The central part is divided into two sections; the front is the art section, with a large puppet stage, and the rear is the history section, displaying clothing, utensils, music, embroidery, and models of hairstyles from different eras, which are particularly eye-catching. The corridors also display historical objects. The wings with the best lighting display calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, and pottery, which are the focal points of the art section. (3) Central second floor: Above the front display hall is a mezzanine floor, level with the flat roof of the rear half. From here, open-air stairs lead to the gate tower on the fourth floor. The gate tower also has a platform for panoramic views. There is a basement under the great hall for boilers. In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic (1936), the museum opened with a Chinese architecture exhibition, attracting a large number of visitors who expressed great admiration. In January of the twenty-sixth year (1937), the museum was officially opened to the public, with thousands of Chinese and foreign visitors coming to see it every day. The city center was bustling with traffic. July 7th was Shanghai's memorial day, and various exhibitions were held by the municipal government's affiliated organizations to celebrate. The museum held an exhibition of Shanghai documents, which was praised by all for its excellent and systematic presentation. Unexpectedly, on that day, the Japanese invaders created the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, launching their war of aggression against China. Soon after, the August 13th Incident occurred in Shanghai. Although some of the museum's exhibits were evacuated in advance, large items such as stone steles and various models, such as the models of Shanghai's three major industries (fishing, cotton, and salt) displayed in the rear hall on the ground floor, were left in the museum due to the difficulty of moving them, and are now likely reduced to ashes.

Odds and Ends

### Our North Jiangsu Guerrillas Forbid Japanese Ships from Transporting Pigs

Shanghai Residents May Have No Pork to Eat

The Zi Lin Daily reported on the 31st that in two or three days, Shanghai may have no pork for sale. Currently, the pork supply is only enough to last for about two days. If the North Jiangsu guerrillas rigorously enforce their order prohibiting Japanese ships from transporting piglets, then farmers in that area will no longer be able to transport their piglets to Shanghai. Currently, ships transporting pigs to Shanghai must be designated by the "Shanghai Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Since this market is an organization under Japanese protection, the designated ships are all Japanese. The North Jiangsu guerrillas, upon learning of this monopoly, prohibited farmers from using boats to transport pigs to Japanese ships. In severe cases, they not only confiscated the pigs but also burned the boats. Pig dealers on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek refused to register with the new market, causing pigs from the interior to be detained by the market authorities. Over the past two weeks, the supply of pork to Shanghai has decreased due to this non-cooperation movement. Now, the guerrillas are prohibiting livestock farmers from transporting pigs to Shanghai, dealing a fatal blow to this industry. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is said that the new market is now controlling the transportation of other livestock, which is part of Japan's economic invasion of Asia. However, the authorities have not yet made any announcement on this matter.

### A New Police District to be Established on the North Bank of the Suzhou Creek

Assistant Police Chief to be Appointed by Japanese

According to the Japanese-owned Continental News reported on the 31st, the Shanghai Municipal Police is expected to announce the establishment of a new police district on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in mid-June, headed by a newly appointed Japanese assistant police chief. The district will be named "E" District and will include the extra-settlement roads where many Japanese reside. Hongkou and Yangshupu, currently included in "C" and "D" Districts respectively, will be separated. The assistant police chief will be a Japanese police officer currently serving in a department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The Japanese side has been demanding the establishment of a new police district including areas where many Japanese reside, with patrolmen under the command of a Japanese assistant police chief. The action of the Shanghai Municipal Police suggests that the long standing negotiations have yielded a "satisfactory" outcome.

### Obstructing Navigation and Ship Clearance Not Valued by Foreign Ships

Believing × Faction Has No Right to Interfere

Since the Japanese Commissioner of Customs announced that from June 1st, ships sailing to Funing, Qidong, Haimen, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Hanjiang, Xinyang Port, and Haimen in Zhejiang must first obtain permission from the Japanese naval authorities before being allowed to clear customs and set sail, shipping companies sailing to Xinghua, Quanzhou, and the Beisha lines believe that the Japanese have no right to interfere with foreign ships. Therefore, before the Japanese obstruction becomes a reality, they are determined to continue to dispatch ships as usual. The foreign ships cleared for Beisha from the Jianghai Customs on the 31st were Wantung, belonging to a British firm, and Parade, belonging to an Italian firm. The foreign ships cleared for Beisha from the Jianghai Customs on the 1st were Yihe, belonging to a British firm, and Deyao, belonging to a Portuguese firm.

### A Residence on Yu Yuan Road Blocked by the Police

Guarantee Requested that Gambling Den Will Not be Set Up

On May 30th, the Shanghai Municipal Police (工部局警務處) heard that a gambling den would be established at No. 864 Yu Yuan Road. On Sunday evening, they placed obstacles at the gate of the residence and at Lane 839. All those entering were questioned, and a final notice was delivered to the owner of the residence (said to be Chinese), demanding a guarantee that the residence would not be used as a gambling den. However, no response was received within the time specified by the police. Chinese and foreign personnel from the police department have been stationed at the two entrances of the residence all day. As of the 31st, the situation has not changed. This is the second time in recent weeks that a private residence has been surrounded by obstacles. The first time occurred several weeks ago when a residence on Haig Road was also sealed off for being converted into a gambling den.

### × Faction Claims to Have Captured Many Anti-Japanese Elements

Unfortunately Impossible to Confirm

According to the Japanese side yesterday, recently, cadres of the First Brigade of the Zhongyang Salvation Army (忠養救國軍第一大隊) entered the settlement to engage in anti-Japanese activities. Their base was located at ×× Bridge. The Japanese side, due to the special nature of the settlement, was unable to arrest them directly. Therefore, they used methods of enticement and, after a day, achieved their goal. The members of the group were lured to ×口 to buy weapons on May 28th. When they crossed the Sichuan Road Bridge to ×口, they were quickly arrested by members of the Japanese Kempeitai. Eight people were arrested. The Japanese side also claimed that they had repeatedly fought with the Japanese army around Shanghai. They were ordered by the Chongqing government to infiltrate the settlement and contact various parties in an attempt to carry out terrorism. However, according to inquiries made by reporters to foreign sources, the above news could not be confirmed.

### Jews Display Entrepreneurial Genius in Hongkou

Japanese Business Will Be Hit

The English-language Greater American Soldier’s Paper reported that Jewish immigrants have opened many shops in the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, displaying goods which are quite attractive. There are already 9,000 refugees from Germany and Austria. Their numbers may exceed 20,000 this year. These people are not merely weeping and lamenting their fate. Instead, they will expand their activities. Japan's plans will be disrupted. The influx of Jewish immigrants to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek has become a serious problem for the Japanese community. The rights and interests of Chinese and foreigners in Hongkou have already been mostly eliminated. The area is still under strict Japanese control. Foreigners outside of Shanghai have suffered great losses due to the Japanese army's tyrannical actions. Now, the rights and interests of the Japanese in Shanghai are also threatened.

### Shanghai's Native Banks

Shanghai's native banking industry occupies an extremely important position in China's financial world. It has a long history. Native banks existed before the opening of Shanghai as a treaty port. Originally, Shanghai, a hundred years ago, was an important hub for north-south shipping. The northward transport of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the southward transport of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast all used Shanghai as a central point of convergence. With countless sails filling the harbor, trade was frequent. The collection and disbursement of debts and the operation of capital naturally required a third party to provide services, and thus the organization of native banks came into being. Subsequently, it closely followed Shanghai's progress and gradually developed. Today, it has evolved with the times and shares the financial center stage with the banking industry.

Shanghai's native banks are divided into "exchange settlement (huihua)," "clearing house (tiaoda)," and "coin exchange (qiandui)." "Exchange settlement" native banks are members of the Shanghai Native Bankers' Association. "Clearing house" native banks are not qualified to join the association, although their business is very similar to that of "exchange settlement" banks. "Clearing house" native banks are further divided into four types: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, based on the difference in their capital standing. As for "coin exchange" native banks, they are the smallest organization in the native banking industry with the least capital and the smallest scope, and are fundamentally different from "exchange settlement" and "clearing house" banks.

The focus of Shanghai's native banking industry rests on the "exchange settlement" banks, so when discussing the native banking industry, one should talk about "exchange settlement" banks.

In the early days, a capital of 20,000 or 30,000 taels of silver was considered a large scale for an "exchange settlement" bank. But that is not the case now. 100,000, 200,000 is not uncommon, and there are several with 500,000 or 1,000,000. Their organizations are all partnerships. Before starting business, they must first join the association. When joining the association, they must submit the total amount of capital, the names of the shareholders, and the shares held to the association. After examination by the representatives of all members and a vote, it can be approved. The restrictions are very strict. It is difficult to pass unless the shareholders have a solid financial background and the "Ah Da" manager has an outstanding reputation. The amount of tangible capital of the native bank itself is a secondary issue that is not worth paying attention to. However, in recent years, in order to further consolidate the foundation of each native bank, its capital amount has increased several times compared to the past.

In the past, the location of native banks in the Nanshi (southern city) area was mostly in Limahu (inside the moat) area, and in the Beishi (northern city) area, it was mostly in Houmalu (back road) area (Ningbo Road), because of the convenience of their business targets and the interaction between the banks. However, in recent times, they have mostly gathered in the Beishi area, and there are fewer and fewer in the Nanshi area. The reason is that most of the commercial activities are in the Beishi area.

The task of native banks is, of course, to prosper the market and support commerce, so they have a deep relationship with merchants in various industries. Extending credit and loans was the main business of native banks in the early days. Now, because of the experience of failure in specializing in credit and loans, the current business of native banks is no longer limited to the old model. In other words: in the past, native banks focused on the commercial sector. All loans were based on the investigation and experience of the manager ("Ah Da" manager) and the runners. The quality of the clients, the quality of credit, and the gains and losses of operations could all be judged based on personal relationships and emotions, turning bad into good, and turning loss into gain. Everyone feels that this kind of business approach is not feasible in modern society and is dangerous. Therefore, they have also changed their approach and have begun to serve society, such as accepting current deposits, setting up insurance businesses, running trust businesses, and operating warehousing businesses, which also have a considerable history.

The Shanghai Native Bankers' Association is the evolved form of the past Native Bankers' Guild. The purpose of its organization is to enhance social welfare and safeguard the interests of the industry. However, in the early days, like other guild organizations, it was only used as a gathering place for industry sacrifices in spring and autumn. Later, due to the encouragement of the times, it successfully became an organization for seeking the interests of the industry and a place for exchange settlement and short-term lending. During the "January 28th Incident," in order to cope with the turbulent situation at that time, they established a Native Banking Reserve under the Native Bankers' Association. In addition to keeping the assets gathered by the industry, the Native Banking Reserve also served as a clearing house and facilitated short-term lending for the industry. The organization of the Native Banking Reserve not only saved the native banking industry from danger at that time, but also stabilized the hearts of the people in the entire financial market at that time. It has indelible achievements and valuable records in the history of the native banking industry.

After the "August 13th Incident," the colleagues of the Shanghai native banking industry also provided a lot of labor for the anti-Japanese war effort. However, because most people in the native banking industry are quiet and do not like to move around, their direct performance was very limited. As a result, they were forgotten, which is very regrettable.

The war brought by the fascist juggernaut has destroyed everything in old China, and Shanghai's native banking industry is certainly no exception and cannot escape this huge aggression. Therefore, they are now facing a difficult and arduous fate. At the same time, the foundation of Shanghai's native banking industry in the past was built on the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but now the wealthy areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have turned into ruins, and they have deeply felt that their own reliance has been lost. The future destiny is quite terrifying, so they are prepared to learn from this bloody lesson, and plan to develop inland areas in order to seek their own revitalization and the rebirth of their business.

### Female Basketball Players Plead for Refugees, the Shenbao Cup Opens Tomorrow Night, The First Game at Seven is Southwest vs. Zhi Xing, The Last Game at Eight is China vs. Hua Xiong, Tickets are Divided into Two Types: 50 Cents and 20 Cents

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The summer is scorching, the land is like fire, and people in Hong Kong naturally have many places to enjoy themselves.

In the North Point swimming pool, couples often float and sink on the water surface, enjoying themselves. I say that this scene only envies mandarin ducks playing in the water, and does not envy the gods in the Guanghan Palace.

But during the national crisis, without the necessary spirit of shared hatred against the enemy, we live in this "Shangri-La," and we cannot ignore the rise and fall of the country.

The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, what a magnificent sight. We are far away from the flames of war, living in a peaceful land. Try closing your eyes and thinking about the soldiers' loyalty, courage, and their tragic sacrifices, how can we not be moved?

Therefore, in this difficult and struggling period, our enjoyment should not forget the need to save the country. If we can transform useful money into the work of saving the country, it will be meaningful.

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the basketball players in Hong Kong have often initiated charity matches to raise funds for disaster relief. This kind of work is very valuable.

The Basketball Association has always been willing to put in effort for good deeds. Since accepting a silver cup donated by this newspaper as a prize for holding a women's charity match, it has immediately actively prepared and received help from all sides. The competition will begin on schedule tomorrow night in the YMCA gymnasium to plead for the refugees.

Although there are only four teams participating in this charity match, namely Zhi Xing, China, Southwest, and Hua Xiong, there are many good players in each team, and their strengths are strong. Zhi Xing and China are especially valued by the general public.

The order of the competition has been re-edited due to the postponement of the event a few days ago. It will be held over three nights, two games each night, using a single round-robin system.

The battles on the first night (i.e. tomorrow night) will start with Southwest vs. Zhi Xing at 7:00 p.m., followed by China vs. Hua Xiong at 8:00 p.m. At that time, the good show will begin. The female soldiers, one by one, with fragrant powder and lotus arms, jade-like faces, will dance gracefully, swirling like flying. Their skills must be extraordinary.

In general, people expect that in the first game, Zhi Xing will be brave enough to defeat Southwest, and in the second game, China will be fierce enough that Hua Xiong will not be their opponent. But in any case, there will be fierce competition.

Tickets for the first two nights are divided into two types: 50 cents and 20 cents. Such a good show at such a cheap price. I urge the general public not to miss it.

The third night is the final, and the ticket price will be slightly higher, one dollar for the lower level and fifty cents for the upper level.

Basketball players contribute their strength, and spectators contribute their money, to jointly support the good cause. What could be better? The scene will definitely be very lively at that time, and the full schedule is recorded as follows (from the Basketball Field Marshal):

June 10th

7:00 p.m. Southwest vs. Zhi Xing

8:00 p.m. China vs. Hua Xiong

June 12th

7:00 p.m. Southwest vs. China

8:00 p.m. Hua Xiong vs. Zhi Xing

June 17th

7:00 p.m. Southwest vs. Hua

8:00 p.m. Zhi Xing vs. China

### From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games

— Ding Lao

——Precious Report of Sports History——

Sparta

The native Spartan population consisted of only nine thousand people, while the next lower class of commoners numbered one hundred and twenty thousand, and the lowest class of slaves reached as many as two hundred and twenty thousand. In order for such a small number of people to control the majority, it was especially necessary to promote martial education. During the period of 776-760 BC, a great man named Lycurgus emerged from the Spartan Dorians. He established a constitution for Sparta called Khcru. The sole purpose of the constitution was to promote national defense, to make the people brave and good at fighting, to have a spirit of regarding death as returning home, and to be invincible. Among them, the method of selecting and rejecting children is indeed able to evoke strange feelings.

(1) Identification of Children: The constitution has provisions for the selection and rejection of children. When citizens give birth to children, they must first report them to the national testing ground. In the field, older and more impartial citizens are appointed as inspectors to conduct strict examinations of the infants. If the inspectors believe that the body is strong and can be a pillar of the country in the future, they will order their parents to raise them. If they believe that the infants are weak and cannot be trained, they will be discarded in the Apostns cave in Mount Laygetosi. When the citizens of Athens gave birth to children, they also had to be examined by inspectors. However, if the body was found to be weak, they had to consult with the parents and obtain their consent before discarding them, unlike Sparta, which absolutely had to abide by the laws of the country.

Ancient Five-Sport Games Carved on Ancient Utensils

(2) Child Rearing: Children allowed to be raised by the state are raised by their parents at home before the age of six, focusing on physical training. At the age of seven, they must leave home and enter a common educational institution, where they are trained by teachers with slave status, Padapog, to develop habits of obedience to rules. Among a group of children, each group is divided into subgroups, with the bravest and most courageous as the leader. Many children in the group must absolutely obey him. At this time, education is entirely about cultivating discipline, valuing cooperation, gentleness, obedience, and other virtues. After the age of fifteen, these groups of children are transferred to other educational institutions. The method of education is the same as before. Young people over the age of eighteen receive special military training in addition to gymnastics until the age of thirty before they can marry, but they cannot freely enter and leave educational institutions.

(3) Curriculum: In Sparta's curriculum, whether it is reading, arithmetic, all departments are not as important as gymnastics. Even music is only singing religious and patriotic folk songs, or reminiscing about the deeds of ancient heroes, all of which are to inspire the spirit of the people. That kind of sweet-sounding music is absolutely prohibited. In addition to gymnastics, other sports such as running, long jump, high jump, wrestling, discus throwing, and javelin throwing are also highly valued, especially running, which is the most common. Running is divided into armed and unarmed. As for using weapons to scout enemy intelligence, it is a necessary subject in the curriculum. In short, the purpose of all curricula is to forge a strong and tenacious body, cultivate a strict sense of self-esteem, and be able to endure the hardships of war. It can be called a military training-centered education method, which is a kind of voluntarism education, not an education that focuses on knowledge. Therefore, everything must be concise and clear. Music that makes people happy and obscene and moving words are discarded like relics. Later generations called the texts they wrote the Lacnoia style, which is a dry and uninteresting style. The most surprising thing is the test method for examining the tolerance of pain of young students. During the festival day, the teacher can arbitrarily flog the students on the altar. If he says a word of pain when he is beaten, everyone will think that he is a useless fellow. If he is beaten until blood is all over the ground, does not cry out in pain, and does not change his expression, he can win the praise of the crowd. Even the parents who are being beaten feel very honored and will never feel pity. Even if he is beaten to death because of this, the teacher will not commit a crime.

(4) Clothing and Food: Spartans have short hair and bare feet, and never decorate themselves. They often wear no clothes when doing gymnastics. Even the clothes they wear on weekdays, regardless of winter or summer, are only allowed to wear one piece of upper and lower clothing. They are not allowed to apply oil when bathing, and they do not choose a place to sleep, but take the very rough spike of the reed by the river as a quilt. As for food, it is restricted to the point that one cannot be full. If one cannot bear the hunger, one may steal. If the means are clumsy and one is discovered, one will be severely punished. I will give two stories to show the Spartans' unbearable attitude towards food.

(1) One day, the king ate with the young people. The food was so bad that it was impossible to swallow. When someone sighed that the food was tasteless, the king said, "If you want the food to be tasty, you must add two things." What are the two things? Fatigue and hunger. (2) Plutasch recorded the story of a young man stealing a fox. His belly was broken by the fox, and even his genitals flowed out. He never made a sound and died.

(5) Women's Education: According to Spartan law, women do not have the qualifications of a household head, but are the property of the country. They are given military education in the same way as men, but they are very free and respected by the people, regardless of high or low, rich or poor, because they can produce strong citizens who are solely responsible for the country. They only marry after the age of twenty. Although the boundary between men and women is not very strict, the character of women who are not allowed to go out in Athens is more pure. They pay more attention to national affairs than their own lives. Their farewell speeches when they send their husbands or sons to war have become a very common saying: "Return with your shield, or return on your shield." This catchphrase at the time has become a timeless maxim. (To be continued)

### Budge Wins Golden Crown

[New York Electric] American tennis star Budge has been awarded the "Golden Crown" of the World's Fair as the best athlete in the United States for 1938. At the official presentation ceremony in the Sports Hall of the Fair, Major Rickinbach, Chairman of the Fair's Sports Advisory Committee, personally placed the Golden Crown on Budge's head.

Sports reporters and writers across the United States and responsible personnel in the sports world all recognize Budge as the most appropriate recipient of the award. Budge won four major tennis championships last year, namely the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the French Open, and the Australian Open.

In addition to Budge, the second-place winner was baseball pitcher Mill, the third-place winner was soccer star O'Brien, the fourth-place winner was track and field star Cunningham, the fifth-place winner was world lightweight boxing champion Armstrong, the sixth-place winners were world heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis and golf star Snead.

### After Reading "The Proposal for Improving Physical Education"

— Zou Falu

This National Education Conference has outlined seventeen principles for the improvement of physical education, encompassing the establishment of physical education administration, the allocation of physical education funding, the improvement of school physical education, the promotion of social physical education, the training of physical education teachers, and so on. There are clear stipulations for all of these. It is foreseeable that the physical education program formulated under these seventeen principles will surely transform the past practices of independent action, emphasis on relaxation, and the focus on athletic prowess, into a coherent, mass-oriented, and universal physical education system. This will enable all people to benefit from physical education, thereby strengthening the foundation for resistance and national reconstruction. However, in my opinion, there are several matters that were not explicitly stipulated in the principles but must be considered when drafting the program. I am writing them down to consult with the enlightened pioneers in the field of physical education.

I. Improving School Physical Education Requires Specifying a Central Curriculum Progress — The proposal states regarding school physical education: elementary schools should aim to develop lively and natural instincts and establish the foundation for sound citizenship; secondary schools should aim to cultivate practical skills and complete the task of self-defense and national defense; and universities should aim to maintain interest in sports and adhere to good habits. These are clearly stated goals that those engaged in physical education should regard as golden rules. In the future, the implementation of physical education must target these goals and adopt appropriate materials and methods without a doubt.

School physical education in our country has been promoted for decades, yet no effective results have been achieved. Although there are many reasons for this, teachers acting independently and seeking convenience account for the majority. In the past, physical education materials were mostly based on the teachers' preferences. Teachers who were skilled in soccer taught soccer, and those who were skilled in basketball taught basketball. This extended to everything. The distribution of teaching materials did not consider difficulty or progression. Regardless of the level of the school or the grade, everything was the same. As a result, students believe that the simplest thing in the world is physical education, which gives rise to a sense of contempt and creates a culture of negligence. The effects are, therefore, impossible to mention.

Any science has a certain progression. When the teaching materials are constantly updated, students naturally do not find it boring. When the teaching materials are both easy and difficult, students naturally do not become negligent. To eliminate the past drawbacks of physical education, the highest national physical education administrative organ must select materials suitable for the current environment as a central curriculum. Analyze its movements, and according to the level of each school grade, compile a systematic progress outline to be circulated to schools nationwide for implementation. Schools nationwide should then consider the situation and, according to the outline, compile detailed curriculum progress items for each grade and teach them accordingly. In addition to the central curriculum, all other teaching materials should be used as supplementary teaching materials. At a minimum, students must learn the movements of the central curriculum according to the progress. If their abilities are sufficient and the central curriculum is easy to learn, they can use supplementary teaching materials as much as possible.

The meaning of specifying a central curriculum is, first, because there are too many types of sports. Without a central curriculum, students cannot learn everything due to insufficient abilities. Second, because there is a progress, the movements must be concrete. In many sports, only the results can be used to distinguish between high and low, and the difficulty of the movements cannot be differentiated. If only the items are changed in pursuit of progress, the true meaning of progress is lost. The sports with concrete movements are none other than national martial arts and lively apparatus exercises—parallel bars, horizontal bars, pommel horses, vaulting horses, mat exercises, etc.—two categories. Their movements are not only clearly differentiated in difficulty and can be used to specify concrete progress, but they can also cultivate practical skills, a habit of risk-taking, and a courageous spirit, adapting to the environment of resistance.

Today, only a few students in our country can automatically pay attention to physical training. To enable them to individually obtain the practical benefits of physical training, supervision is essential. If the school has this...

Movies and Drama

### Hollywood Hosts—Amusements During Dinner Parties

When a host entertains guests, the most boring thing is probably when the guests start to look uninterested halfway through the meal.

Under such helpless circumstances, the host has no choice but to take out antique movie magazines. These books are still printed with the years 1914-1918. In these books, you can still see Gloria Swanson in the arms of her husband Wallace Beery, and Mary Pickford tightly holding onto an escaped convict. This result can only make the guests laugh and cry.

When Joan Crawford hosts a dinner party, she often shows a film of her own miniature garden theater after the meal. After showing the film, she plays a piece of nostalgic music, and then lets the guests chat and play as they please.

Recently, men have generally wanted to inquire about their girlfriends' work in the kitchen.

Claudette Colbert has an all-electric kitchen in her acting studio. The equipment used for heating milk and washing dishes is all driven by electricity. Once, Claudette invited guests to a Sunday brunch. She taught them how to cook and peeled garlic for them to see.

Dorothy Lamour is also a woman who likes to take her guests to visit the kitchen. She is especially happy to show them how to make toffee, fudge, and corn candy.

When Stuart Erwin hosts a party, he always likes to take out a phonograph and records from twenty years ago and play them for his guests one by one.

Otto Kruger likes to play a few popular modern songs on the piano to entertain his guests. Joan Fontaine always asks her guests to choose ten ancient queens when they are at home and let them freely comment and compare each queen. George Burns and Gracie Allen simply spend a lot of money to create a great performance program in front of their friends.

### Soviet Children's Films

The progress of Soviet films in form and content has been recognized by the world. Recently, the Soviet Union has also put in twelve points of effort to focus on "children's films" and has already had good performances. According to the new five-year plan for women and children, children's films accounted for 25% of the productions in 1938.

Soviet children's films are not only completely shown to children, but also completely acted by children.

However, in the Soviet Hollywood, just like the star system for adult films, there are no children in children's films. There is no need for a Shirley Temple to attract audiences. Soviet child actors must leave the life of an actor after completing their first film and cannot continue to act in a second film, because the Soviet authorities do not want individual children to enjoy great fame and be in the limelight.

Although Soviet child actors cannot continue to act in a second film, and their time on the screen is very short, the conditions for being a child actor are very strict, not casual. The great director Eisenstein once tested three thousand rural children for an actor before selecting one.

The so-called children's film is a general term. Children's films also vary in form and content according to the age of the children. For example, films for the youngest children are often story-based and accompanied by special music. Films for children aged eight to twelve are often about new inventions such as radio-controlled ships. Films for children over the age of twelve all have scripts. Not only must the production of children's films meet the needs of children of different ages, but the construction of children's cinemas must also meet their conditions. Moscow now has eight cinemas dedicated to children, and the height of the seats varies with age.

The most revolutionary thing in Soviet children's films is that no child actor knows where the camera is. In other words, they don't know they are acting when they are acting. Such a performance truly expresses the psychology and personality of an innocent child without reservation. Of course, it is very different from Shirley Temple's affectation.

### "The True Story of Ah Q" Brought to the Stage

— Hao

Mr. Lu Xun's famous work, "The True Story of Ah Q," describes the Chinese national character very thoroughly. In the past, many theater groups tried to rehearse it, but all failed due to the excessive number of actors and the difficulty of finding the protagonist.

Now, the Shanghai theater community is jointly holding a charity performance with more than a dozen theater schools. Hosted by the Gonghua Theater Troupe, a total of six famous plays are being staged. "Ah Q" has the largest scope, so it is jointly rehearsed by the Gonghua, Jingwu, Yiyou, and Baolian theater troupes. After the performance, all proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to refugees. The venue will be either the Lyceum Theatre or the Xuan Palace Ballroom. The performance period is set for around June 15th. Although it had previously failed due to problems that were difficult to solve, they are willing to dedicate their spirit and material resources to speak up for the refugees in order to take care of the refugees' lives. This spirit is commendable. Moreover, the performers in this performance—including the staff—number about one hundred people, among whom there are many excellent ones. Therefore, the performance results can be predicted to be wonderful.

### Sonja Henie Takes a Luxurious Trip

Average Daily Cost of £166, One of the Distinguished Guests on the Normandie

The liner "Normandie" set sail from New York. This was an unexpectedly luxurious voyage, as there were 743 passengers on board, all wealthy merchants. Most of them were millionaires. The total cost of the trip for all passengers was £200,000. Sonja Henie, the ice-skating star, was also one of the passengers. When the ship arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas in the British West Indies, she and her entourage disembarked there. The price of the cabin she booked cost £1,500.

Sonja Henie's party consisted of six people, including her mother, brother, and two attendants. The travel expenses for those followers alone also cost £1,800. As for Sonja Henie's personal bill of £3,300, it did not include the cost of external expenses.

The "Normandie" is preparing to sail to South America and the West Indies. This voyage of £200,000 will last only 24 days.

The amount of champagne and various precious wines consumed on board is unknown. Many delicacies and exquisite meals are cooked by highly reputable chefs on board, because the distinguished guests embarking on this trip are figures rarely seen on passenger lists.

Sonja Henie's diet is rich, and her behavior is luxurious, worthy of being a model wealthy woman. She is currently 26 years old and earns £1,000 a week. Her personal performances cost £80,000 on her tour in America.

During this trip, she spends £500 on stockings alone. The silk tights she wears while skating cost seven dollars a pair, but she has to change them five times a day.

On average, Sonja Henie spends £166 a day on this luxurious trip, but given her daily income, this amount of expenditure is not considered an overdraft.

### Business with No Capital

— Hua Fu

When people think of a business with no capital, they immediately think of robbery, because as long as your fists are big and your arms are strong, or you have knives and guns in your hands, you can turn what is mine into yours. Everyone knows that this business requires no capital.

However, robbery is, after all, a serious crime. If caught, you will be sentenced to several years in prison at best, and you will be asked to wait eighteen years to be a young man again at worst. Therefore, although this business does not require capital at first, the interest paid later is too considerable. Some smart people, therefore, came up with another method, a method that is easier and does not involve great risks: theft.

Picking pockets on the street is a small thing; embezzling public funds and creating false accounts is a big thing. These things, if the case is solved, do not pose a threat to life, and the benefits are far above robbery. This is welcomed by small adventurers who avoid the heavy and take the light. Similar to theft in that it requires no capital, but with different results, the wonderful thing is gambling.

Opening a gambling den can certainly make money, and you can even rely on clever tricks to be the dealer and show off capital that exists in name only, gaining a lot. Moreover, those who lose money, no, those who send money, are all willing. Although it is also an illegal act, at least there are fewer people who will report it, which can save a lot of trouble. Compared to robbery, not to mention, compared to theft, it seems to be a further step of convenience. Apart from gambling, all other tricks, methods, and deceptions used to obtain property can also be regarded as businesses with no capital. The most obvious examples are Taoist priests and monks, shamans and sorcerers, who either chant incantations or make alarming statements to make you obediently take out money for them to use. Fortune-telling by character analysis, making reckless statements, teaching you how to seek good fortune and avoid misfortune, and how to get out of bad luck, can also be viewed in this way.

This kind of business is almost completely legal, and the degree of security is even greater than opening a gambling den. As the saying goes, deceiving someone to death does not require compensation, which is what this means. However, once the deceived person becomes aware, there will inevitably be disputes and increased trouble. For the sake of 100% security and to avoid any future troubles, one should think of other methods. What other methods? Begging. Some beg from door to door; some "file a complaint with the land," some "adopt piglets"... As long as you reach out your hand or kowtow, coins will continue to come. The coins that go into the beggar's bag are his own property, and he can use them however he wants, openly and honestly, with no future troubles. This is what it means to be unwilling to become an official after being a beggar for three years. Begging seems to be the ultimate business with no capital.

However, what is obtained by begging is only coins: if you are blessed, you may see silver coins, but you will never see paper money. Although the business is safe, making money is too slow and uncertain. If there is a business that is as safe as begging and as easy to make money as robbery, then it is truly an unparalleled mantra and supreme blessing. Once implemented, the world will be at peace. Thinking about it, the ghosts and gods understand it, and heaven does not disappoint those who work hard. This kind of business has finally been thought of: issuing banknotes, issuing banknotes without reserve funds. Each banknote is at least one yuan, and others are five yuan, ten yuan, and even hundreds or thousands of yuan. As long as you print a few words on it and issue it, the cost is almost zero, but the value is so great. Occupying the most promising position in the business with no capital is undoubtedly beyond doubt.

If one yuan is worth one yuan, of course, you are earning it yourself. Even if one yuan is only worth a few dimes, or even a few cents, as long as it does not fall below the cost of paper and printing, you are still earning money after all. This is the ultimate achievement in the business with no capital. Is it not? In the past, Russia issued such rubles, and Germany also issued such marks. Although they are now worthless, they saved their institutions at the time.

However, the business with no capital that issues banknotes without reserve funds is truly amazing. Why don't all those who want to get rich do this? It turns out that some are limited by their talents and can only be robbers or thieves, but cannot be "financiers." Others, although they have the talent of such a "financier," have not yet reached the level of experience and can only continue to learn on the path of robbers or thieves.

Moreover, to get rich, you cannot specialize in one way. As the saying goes, the vastness of the rivers and seas also comes from not rejecting small streams. Therefore, a person who does great things and achieves great success often also does small things and small businesses. In order for the future of a group to be limitless, it is especially necessary for people to divide the labor and cooperate, and follow different paths to reach the same goal. Therefore, various businesses with no capital are still being carried out by individuals or groups at the same time.

I think if people in the world can truly engage in this, perhaps the world will indeed become civilized and progressive. Oh, what a great business with no capital!

### Five Minutes (4)

— Luo Feng

As He Jing replied to this sentence, he had already walked close to the enemy commander. Facing the light, he had distinguished the vague face of the other party: it was a fierce statue. He gave a silent cold laugh at that statue...

The enemy commander suddenly turned off the flashlight.

A moment of silence immediately plunged into terrifying darkness. In that instant, they seemed to be replacing questions and answers with rough breathing. The horse seemed to be participating in this conversation as well.

In order to surrender to death, He Zheng obeyed the enemy commander's order and began to step onto the road to death alone. At the same time, the flashlight again opened its huge circle of light, shining from He Zheng's back to the distant front—the front seemed to be a small path of a new pass. The further he walked, the steeper the road became.

Although He Zheng had doubts about death with every step he took, his determination was constantly advancing towards the goal of death. His eyes were fixed on the light, and he was also carefully monitoring which direction death would fly from.

He struggled to climb upwards. Now, except for the slight disturbances of the shackles, everything was still as silent as usual. He Zheng complained in his heart:

'Where are you letting me go?' Is death so difficult?'

However, he realized that he had approached the edge of the cliff.

"Jump down!"

He Zheng jumped out of the pale circle of light without hesitation. At the moment when his body had left the cliff, he still heard the communications officer repeating:

"Jump down!"

A minute later, darkness still embraced this steep and desolate mountain, as if all living things were suffocated by this more depressing night... (The End)

### Ningbu

— Sheng Dan

—War Zone Report—

Before Wuhan was abandoned, the headquarters of the ×th War Zone was stationed in Songbu, the first town of Macheng. Here, it connects Shangcheng to the north, controls Xiaogan to the west, shields Lihuang to the east, and controls Wuchang to the south, appropriately located in the central hub of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; the southeastern war zones along the river in Guangji, Qichun, and Wuxue can also echo each other remotely. During the tense period of the Wuhan peripheral battles, Songbu was quite important. We originally wanted to enter the mountains from Luotian to join a torch parade like a group of wind, but suddenly heard the news that the cultural circles of Wuhan were going to Xinyang to comfort the troops. Moreover, the war on the Pinghan Railway was proceeding in the northern part of Jigong Mountain, so we decided to go to Songbu from the highway first. If time allowed, we also planned to go to Xinyang and Guangshan, and then return to Anhui via Shangcheng.

That night, we continued on our journey. The highway had already been automatically destroyed, so we had to rely on first-class feet and proceed quickly under the hazy moonlight. Experience told us that most of the time during the day would be wasted on hiding from the indiscriminate "egg-laying" of airplanes. It's better to be quick at night. "Only fifty miles. It takes at most six hours to run!" Everyone said nonchalantly, "However, it's still far from the Long March!" Someone was mocking Lao Yao, because he had criticized the Northwest Economic Investigation Group and expressed dissatisfaction with Du Chongyuan's riding in a car, so everyone often used this sentence to laugh at him.

The moon slowly set in the west, and darkness engulfed the earth; but before long, the blood-red sun poked its head out of the mountain hollow. Looking into the distance, the branch veins of Dabie Mountain—Lishan—were initially hiding in the misty dawn, but at this time, they had already revealed their true faces. We patrolled the town once, and then walked along the winding path.

In front of us was an ancient temple, surrounded by tall willow trees, so quietly moving, and groups of war horses were gnawing on the green grass on the ground. Beside the temple gate, we saw Councilor Chen Dongzao.

"Did you just arrive?" Councilor Chen asked.

"Yes!" I said.

"Then, let's go inside to talk!"

The ancient temple is the ancestral shrine of the Qu family. The Grand Tutor Qu Yuan, who drowned in the Miluo River, was their ancestor. Councilor Chen told me: the entire Political Training Office had set off. He had not yet received a telegram from the Wuhan Office about when the troop-comforting delegation would arrive. If we wanted to go to Xinyang, he could find a way to get a truck.

In the evening, we stayed overnight at the headquarters. Swarms of mosquitoes, as if unwilling to miss the opportunity, attacked together under a general mobilization order.

Unable to fall asleep, let's hum a few crooked poems, the poem says:

The sound spreads through the battle signals,

How many brave men sleep with their spears as pillows;

Here, the crowd conceals the vast moon,

What is the night scene like in Jiangnan?

### Suppressed and Roaring

— Ding Di

Feeling oneself small and insignificant, one becomes more despairing.

Like a dwarf standing before a "giant," respectful, constrained, and full of timidity. Humiliation is like a brand burned into the skin, so deep that you cannot confidently wash it away.

Centuries of deep hatred, engraved in the bones and imprinted on the heart, passed down from ancestors tens of thousands of years ago, have also carved many scars in the depths of everyone's heart. The welts of humiliation come year after year, blood congeals and forms scabs, and the scabs fester and turn into pus. Pain brings back many memories, like a string of beads, threaded with the rosary of humiliation.

Humiliation cannot be forgotten; over the years, it has piled up high and thick. Thinking of the past is often a bitter dream.

With the nest broken and a lifetime of painstaking effort ruined, your family may unfortunately die as strangers in a foreign land, buried in a tiger's den. All the ruin and misfortune oppress you, leaving you unable to breathe. When there is no forgiveness or leniency, one's own interests outweigh sympathy. Thus, you will weep blood, tear your heart, remove your hat, and dishevel your hair.

"Centuries of deep hatred! Centuries of deep hatred! My tears wash, my heart grieves, my breast is filled with sorrow."

Thus, everyone is gnawed by sorrow, brows are furrowed, hearts float, and legs ache with hidden pain. Anger stirs the muscles, but does not swell them; sorrow becomes a flowing stream, but does not collapse; the volcano emits a faint flame, but does not erupt. Women sob softly, drunkards remain drunk for a thousand days, poets write "Li Sao," and sleepyheads sleep forever, wanting to die.

You say, just sir, is this also being blind to the situation?'

I cannot help but feel sad, watching a group of people, broken and foolish, not forgetting their deep hatred. I suppress my pain, I pity them, and remain silent for a long time.

Suddenly, I understand, so I ask:

"Can you strengthen yourselves! Transform suppression into roaring: make muscles swell, streams collapse, volcanoes erupt, not just stir, trickle, and emit flames."

The vast crowd tries to roar. The air is like death, the wilderness like a tomb, mouths and tongues seem restrained; everyone thinks the same. The sword of dawn may be able to cut through the long night, and a loud, long song in the deep mountains where no one dwells may make the Chu sky entirely blue. So everyone starts to sing, a song of justice. Buried in their hearts for many years, cowardly forbearance, weak muteness. The song does not rise naturally, a bit hoarse, a bit trembling. Long neglect makes the technique somewhat clumsy, weak, the sound low, the tone chaotic. Not high-pitched, not majestic.

In the distance, jackals chuckle, mixed with the sounds of dogs barking and wolves howling threateningly.

The chuckling of the jackals gradually ceases, replaced by the sound of frantic running and charging, gradually approaching the source of the roaring. Savage commotion covers the roaring, everyone is dull. "Our roaring has invited danger." The timid are pale as death.

Gradually, the roaring sound changes from low to high, from weak to strong, from narrow to wide, from delicate to powerful. The boundless falling leaves tremble, fish and dragons listen intently, the river waves shudder, and the forest beasts are silent.

"This is not the roaring of the past." The jackals are all terrified, each looking at each other with new eyes. No more chuckling, no more ridicule, only serious attention and bowing of heads.

Rise up with clenched fists, and from now on you need not worry about being overpowered. If there is no hatred, you must swallow it; if there is no grit, you must chew it; if there are no thorns, you must bury them. There is hatred, but not silent dark clouds, the breath of a gentle breeze, the sadness of light rain. There must be violent winds, torrential rain, raging fire, and rushing springs. We must strengthen everything. Inwardly, we must open up; stillness must become dynamic; softness must become strong; shallowness must become deep; shortness must be lengthened; transience must become lasting; sparsity must become dense.

After a successful battle, everyone learns a skill: forging suppression into roaring: transforming emotion into action, and transforming long sighs into war songs.

Like white-hot iron forged into pure steel: those who were sad in the past are forged into a vengeful army.
