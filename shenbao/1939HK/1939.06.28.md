### Occupation and Knowledge

— Zhang Yumei

— Dedicated to shop clerks and apprentices —

Due to the different family circumstances of each person, some lucky individuals, upon reaching your age, progress from elementary school to middle school, or from middle school to university, leading their precious school lives. However, you, burdened by the inability of your families to afford these expensive school fees, serve as junior clerks or apprentices in shops. I believe you possess a strong desire for knowledge, and I also understand that your level of knowledge likely does not exceed that of higher elementary education. Therefore, I know that among you, there must be many who, unable to satisfy their thirst for knowledge, feel aversion towards their occupations, or even become passive due to an excessively strong desire for knowledge. Here, the writer sincerely hopes that shop clerks and apprentices do not become passive or resent their occupations, thus wasting your precious futures, simply because your circumstances do not allow you to pursue higher knowledge.

Occupation and knowledge are inherently inseparable. However, most merchants, with their stubborn minds, believe that a person should seek knowledge in their youth, but once they step through the door of a shop, they should no longer talk about knowledge, only needing to use their brains in business. This gives rise to the current phenomenon where those employed in shops are not allowed to seek knowledge. Because of this, countless promising young people are ruined. This is entirely because they do not understand the importance of knowledge to occupation. It is said that a person without high intelligence will naturally not obtain a better occupation. Similarly, if one does not even have an elementary school education, it is impossible to employ them as a shop clerk. Furthermore, national changes and social dynamics can all affect the development of commerce, all of which require judgment based on observation. And the development of observational skills largely depends on your knowledge. In addition, everyone's thoughts and actions can also receive correct guidance through knowledge. Therefore, knowledge and occupation are inseparable.

Currently, especially in old-fashioned shops, leisure time is out of the question. It is indeed difficult to find three to five hours to study the knowledge you need in your spare time. However, I hope that with your personal perseverance and determination to seek knowledge, and with a sincere attitude, you will try your best to persuade your managers. If you cannot obtain sufficient time, you should still try to set aside one or two hours before your scheduled wake-up time in the morning. I think this is probably possible, as long as you are determined and willing to work hard continuously, there will definitely be a day of hope in the future. Look at Mr. Wang Yunwu; his current position in the cultural world was also obtained through continuous self-study. Therefore, you must not succumb to your circumstances.

Finally, the writer sincerely recommends a publication that suits your practical needs – the Self-Study Weekly. Its contents include national and English common knowledge, bookkeeping, and more, making it a good educational reading material for leisure time. Of course, publications like "The National Resistance War" and "Reading Monthly" are also excellent new reading materials for you.

Modern Youth, inscription by Cai Yuanpei (Second Issue)

### Youth Movement and National Liberation

— Ma Li

It is no accident that China's youth movements have all emerged in the posture of fighting for national liberation. This precisely illustrates that the youth problem in China is merely a part of the national problem, and striving for national liberation is the prerequisite for resolving the suffering of the youth.

Over the years, China has suffered direct oppression and exploitation from invaders, even to the point of seizure, and the constraints imposed through the remaining feudal forces have deprived Chinese youth of not only proper guarantees but also the freedom and rights they deserve in terms of thought, activity, love, occupation, and even fundamental life.

Our Chinese youth have suffered, and the root cause of this suffering lies in the gradual advance of the invaders. Because of their suffering, they feel indignation. Because of their indignation, they rise up and resist. The purpose of their resistance is to establish a free and independent democratic republic in order to eliminate suffering and find a way out. The target of their resistance is undoubtedly the invaders and the feudal forces they utilize.

Therefore, China's youth movement is inevitably connected and intertwined with the anti-aggression and anti-feudal national liberation movement.

From the "May Fourth Movement" of 1919, the "May Thirtieth Movement" of 1925, to the "December Ninth Movement" and "December Sixteenth Movement" of 1935, whether their development led to the New Culture Movement, the National Revolution, or the united resistance against Japan, their origins lay in resisting the oppression of the invading countries, and their essence was the same, permeated with the meaning of the national struggle.

In China, which is in a state of being an oppressed and invaded semi-colony, not only the youth feel incomparable suffering, but the masses of the entire nation are also experiencing incomparable pain. This is a very obvious fact. However, because the youth are keenly aware, emotionally passionate, strong-willed, clearly aware, and possess robust minds and bodies and a superior position, they always stand at the forefront of the national liberation struggle, acting as vanguard warriors who are prescient, leading, and fighting.

There are indeed many factors in the outbreak of our country's all-out war of resistance against Japan, but we should recognize the role played by the accumulation of youth movements over the years, especially the role played by the heroic struggles of the December Movement against aggression, traitors, division, and puppets. This role is being nurtured and developed in today's war of resistance against Japan. Many young people have already rushed to the front lines to participate in the war, and many young people are engaged in practical work such as propaganda, organization, fundraising, and comforting troops in various places.

Looking back at the youth here, some are living a life of luxury and indulgence, some are studying dead books in an academic style for the sake of a diploma, and some are frustrated because they cannot go to the inland or front lines to do something earth-shattering. There are very few who can truly recognize the reality and bury themselves in hard work. They have to do this and that, day and night, exhausted. This is truly regrettable.

Intensify self-education, young friends! Stand up and carry forward the glorious history created by your peers: do not seek temporary stimulation and excitement, but treat every foothold as a front line, and arduously and practically undertake your own tasks in the current environment, contributing every ounce of strength and light to the brilliant future of the nation!

After the complete victory of our national liberation struggle, the youth problem will be solved one by one, and the youth of all of China will then be able to live a rational and ideal life!

### World Science News: Children's Telephone Bureau

A telephone bureau has been established in the English Scow "Central Park for Culture and Recreation," and all work is undertaken by children. There are a total of 80 lines, connecting all the houses and institutions in the children's farm in the park. There are also 25 telephone receivers installed in various parts of the farm, each representing the name of a famous city in a foreign country. The intention is to encourage children to use the telephone to make international calls, and when communicating with a certain country, they use the language of that country. Those in charge of the telephone bureau are 50 skilled members of the Archimedes Society, which is dedicated to young inventors. (Soviet Yearbook, Dan)

### Wireless Electric Light

Frenchman Costel has invented a way to light lamps with radio waves and has recently obtained a patent. This new type of light bulb is spherical and has no filament. The interior is a vacuum coated with phosphorescent or other luminescent powdered chemicals. When excited by high-frequency radio waves, it emits bright light. When in use, it is hung on a line (metal wire), which is used as the antenna of a small radio transmitter. From this, we predict that in the future, this type of light bulb may be used to illuminate streets and homes. When used to illuminate streets, the antenna used is a single wire, and when used to illuminate rooms, the antenna can be parallel or fan-shaped wires. (New York Times, Dan)

### Several Model Children

— Wei

China is roaring, and China's children are also roaring.

The following are stories of several model children during the War of Resistance.

1.  Yang Huimin, the girl scout who presented the flag to the four hundred isolated troops. Yang Huimin is a brave girl scout. In late October of the previous year, when our army retreated from the Songhu area, four hundred soldiers remained stationed in the Sihang Warehouse on the Suzhou River, vowing to fight to the last drop of blood and demand the price they deserved from the invaders. Yang Huimin braved the dangers and sent a national flag into the warehouse, expressing her respect to the four hundred isolated troops who were loyal and brave in defending the country. In the last position in Zhabei, amidst smoke and surrounded by enemy flags, the bright and dazzling national flag of the Republic of China flew on top of our Sihang Warehouse, showing that our army was still holding Zhabei and promoting our great Chinese spirit!

2.  A Scout on Edward Road. One day after the "August 13th Incident," a group of people on Edward Road in Shanghai were beating up a "traitor." A Scout happened to see this and immediately broke through the crowd and hugged the "traitor." The crowd stopped beating him. The "traitor" was taken into the police station by the Scout, and it was found that he was innocent and not a traitor, so he was not injured. The man and his family were grateful to the Scout for saving him and regarded him as their savior.

3.  Shoeshine Scout Wu Weisou—Wu Weisou is a shoeshine boy in Guangzhou. When Guangzhou held a fundraising campaign, he shined shoes for the donors and spectators in front of the donation platform all day long, and at any time, he would hand over the proceeds to the platform. He shined shoes a total of one hundred and eighty-five times, earning more than twenty yuan. Every time he donated, he received a donation certificate. By evening, his clothes were covered with donation certificates.

4.  Elementary school students in Xikang knock tiles to donate money—Outside the city of Hueli County in Xikang, a road was being built, and all the elementary school students of the local fourth elementary school went to knock tiles for the adults, earning a total of sixteen yuan. They sent the money to the Executive Yuan of the National Government as a donation to save the country and attached a letter to comfort the soldiers on the front lines.

5.  Pan Bizheng, who fasted to persuade his father—Pan Bizheng is a seventeen-year-old boy from Guangdong. His father is a wealthy man. After the fall of Guangzhou, Pan Bizheng was very sad and angry. He asked his father to deposit the money in foreign banks into the National Bank and donate four million yuan to the government. When his father refused, he went on a hunger strike to awaken his father. Later, Pan Bizheng finally achieved his goal of saving the country.

6.  Ma Shu, who works as a medic on the front lines—Ma Shu is the captain of the fourth direct team of the first wartime service group of the Chinese Boy Scouts. He led forty team members to serve on the front lines, facing danger and hardship. During the fierce battle of Mahui in Jiangxi, they braved enemy poison gas, ate only taro every day, and still bravely performed their work of rescuing the wounded soldiers. The Chinese Boy Scouts have made great contributions to the country in this war of resistance. The above-mentioned Ma Shu is just one example. According to the Chinese Boy Scout Association, since the outbreak of the war, 350,000 Chinese Boy Scouts have served on the front lines or in the rear, and 10,000 of them have also assisted in the war on the front lines.

"There can be no 'peace' with the enemy!"

Editorial

### A Brief Discussion on the Current War Situation

The main characteristics of the current war situation are:

On our side, it is to intensify guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and accelerate preparations for the future implementation of the "strategic counter-offensive" while maintaining a stalemate with the Japanese, in order to realize the elimination and expulsion of the Japanese from China as soon as possible and plant our flag of blue sky and white sun at the head of the Yalu River!

On the Japanese side, their current operations are mainly to coordinate with political and economic offensives to create a situation of "neither war nor peace" in order to intensify the consolidation of their rule over the occupied areas, utilize the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of our occupied areas, and painstakingly arrange for the "complete conquest of China and then dominating East Asia." Therefore, their current military requirement is to realize "using war to sustain war."

Since the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the early stage of the War of Resistance came to an end. The Japanese strategy turned towards the above direction, and the facts of the past few months since the capture of Nanchang have further proved that the Japanese military's intention is to "use war to sustain war." This is because the Japanese military has encountered significant difficulties and setbacks in its military invasion of China, and its war strength has been greatly weakened and depleted, so it has had to begin to take defensive steps!

However, the Japanese army is still an army with the latest modern equipment and configurations. It has great mobility and still holds several larger cities, controlling several major railway transportation lines. Therefore, although it has to adopt a defensive and replenishing strategy, it is still possible to select places it considers weak and places where it believes our army's mobile operations and reinforcements are poor, and launch fierce attacks, "effectively occupying" them, and then rest and look for a second target. The attack on Nanchang was for this purpose, as was the encirclement of Mount Dahong, the seven attacks on Mount Zhongtiao, and the recent landings in Shantou, Dinghai, and other places.

Whether it is an attack on Shanxi to threaten Shaanxi, or harassing our coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, the current Japanese offensive can be said to have the same intention, that is, to try to prevent our army on the front lines from launching a counter-offensive in the Japanese-occupied areas, to try to suppress the guerrillas destroying the Japanese army's rear in North China, Central China, and Southeast China, to try to strengthen the rule of the Japanese puppet regime in the occupied areas, to try to strengthen its cultural anesthesia and economic plunder of the occupied areas, and to try to destroy and plunder the power of the European and American powers in China and plunder the foreign trade interests of the coastal provinces of Southeast China. In short, it is to try to realize its new sinister plan of "using war to sustain war" by "requisitioning grain on the spot and seeking self-sufficiency" in its invasion of China.

The Japanese attempt to "use war to sustain war" and create a situation of "neither war nor peace" also has a more vicious conspiracy, which is to use the "victory" of the leaping war to stimulate its domestic people and numb the emotions of our country's resistance to Japan, that is, to use slogans such as "peace" and "anti-communism" to entice our wavering elements and stubborn elements to divide our national unity, destroy the "proactive, long-term, and comprehensive war of resistance" led by Chairman Chiang, and use deceptive means to force the United States to abandon its policy of aiding China and compromise and cooperate with Japan to force us to submit, and then realize its "preliminary step in dominating the world" and establish a "new order in East Asia"!

Due to our national unity, political progress, and improved international reputation, due to the strengthening of our front-line combat effectiveness, due to the hard struggle of the people in the occupied areas, due to the establishment and development of anti-Japanese base areas in the anti-Japanese guerrilla areas in North China, Central China, and even Southeast China, especially due to the nationwide and even international condemnation of Wang Jingwei's traitorous words and actions, we firmly believe that this new Japanese strategy will encounter a more embarrassing failure. However, from the observation of the current war situation, we must raise everyone's vigilance against the Japanese traitors, and we must preemptively break the "neither war nor peace" and "both war and peace" that the Japanese hope for; we must completely smash the Japanese conspiracy of "using war to sustain war." To realize this hope, the main thing is to follow Chairman Chiang's instructions: we must strengthen unity in politics, we must economically blockade the Japanese, we must enhance friendly relations with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in diplomacy, we must strive for initiative and perseverance in the military, persist in a comprehensive war of resistance, we must intensify the mobilization of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support and develop the war behind the enemy lines, and what is particularly important is to concentrate our efforts to crush the treacherous words and actions of the Japanese running dogs and traitors who deceive the people and sell the country.

### A New Educational Method: Improving the Efficiency of Small Group Training; Zhizhong Middle School Essay Competition Team Champion

— Eagle Team

The more advanced the society, the more collective the work of the people will be, and only collective work can generate huge power. A group is the concentration of huge power, and among the national system, the organization of small groups can be said to be the simplest organization. A small group is like a cell in the human body, and like a small iron ring in a strong iron chain. We can use the principle of cell division and growth and the principle of small iron rings being linked into long iron chains to create and promote the progress of all work. The results obtained in this way will inevitably exceed the total power of the same number of people without organization! It is undoubtedly true that a small group is a good organization.

We understand the meaning of small groups, and we understand that small group training is the correct and progressive educational policy and a correct and progressive learning plan. Then how should we strive for this plan? How to improve the efficiency of small group training?

(1) Implement the spirit of democracy: If a group is required to make progress, then it must establish the spirit of democracy. In the past few weeks of small group training, because the foundation of pre-event publicity and mobilization was not well done, although the small groups had been forcibly organized by the Department of Training in the form of random combinations, we did not feel that each person in a group was connected, and every activity was forced and supervised by the superiors, making us unable to actively and energetically develop our abilities. In order to increase the effectiveness of work, on the one hand, we must establish the democratic spirit of the small groups so that every student can consciously and actively develop each person's creative ability, sense of responsibility, and vitality to work. On the other hand, we must adopt democratic centralism, so as not to go to the extreme of laissez-faire. Such bottom-up activities will definitely progress more than using various methods to supervise and force progress!

(2) Enrich the content of activities: The content of the activities must be closely integrated with the new situation of the current war of resistance. Saving the country and building the country require sound core organizations. In particular, the future masters of the country must have organized training with an active atmosphere. The school should aim to cultivate war of resistance cadres, so that every student studies for the war of resistance, and the competition between groups becomes an automatic, lively, and intense work. After each activity, there should be self-educational reflection, learning from each other's strengths, and helping each other overcome weaknesses. We must not create a tendency towards trophyism. At the same time, we must be able to give equal importance to schoolwork. We must actively strive for both aspects of work, and we must not mechanically separate the importance of each other and suppress any one. If the content of the work is enriched! We believe that if we struggle according to this policy, the efficiency of training will have considerable progress!

(3) Improve the discipline of small groups: The tendency of individual liberalism is absolutely impossible in small groups, so there must be iron discipline to maintain and consolidate the organization of small groups. Discipline is the second life of a circle, and it is the guarantee for the implementation of the route. Without discipline, the development of work cannot be promoted. In the organization and training of small groups, the minority must obey the majority, the individual must obey the group, and the lower level must obey the higher level. This is the manifestation of the spirit of democratic centralism. Every student cannot destroy it, but it is not one-sided commandism. It must be based on the students' awareness. In the past, the small group training of our school was too inclined to commandism. It is hoped that in the future, democratic centralism will be adopted, and every activity will require the students' automatic consciousness.

(4) Establish model small groups; obtain a high-achieving small group from many competitions and make it a model small group for the whole school. Every activity is shouldered by the model small group to take on the active tasks. The model small group is progressive, and all other small groups must catch up. In this way, all work can be carried out quickly with standards and combat effectiveness. The establishment of model small groups in the current situation of our school is extremely rapid. Rapidly build it up.

The above are just my humble opinions on promoting the efficiency of small group training in our school. I hope that enlightened gentlemen will actively teach us for this correct educational policy and strive for the victory of this correct educational policy and fulfill a sacred responsibility for cultivating war of resistance cadres.

### Japanese Troops Land in Eastern Zhejiang's Yuhuan, Unrest in Fujian Sea, Occupy Jianfeng Island, Announce Blockade of Wenzhou and Fuzhou

[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 27th] Japan's ambition to seize the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang is becoming increasingly urgent. The number of warships outside the Minjiang River Estuary has increased to about ten. They occupied Jianfeng Island on the morning of the 27th. The situation in the Oujiang River is also quite tense. Japanese troops have landed in Yuhuan, outside the estuary. After Dinghai was occupied, Japanese planes frequently appeared in the Wenzhou-Taizhou area, bombing and distributing absurd leaflets, claiming they would soon launch an offensive.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 27th] At 8:10 AM on the 26th, five Japanese warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian boats, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly landed at Yashan and other places in Kanmen Town, Yuhuan. Our troops fiercely counterattacked, and the battle was extremely fierce. Japanese casualties were very heavy. The fighting continued late into the night.

Evacuating Foreign Nationals Refused by Both Britain and America

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] According to reports from outside Shanghai, the Japanese consul in Shanghai recently sent a letter to the head of the consular corps, the Danish consul, stating that the Japanese army would soon commence military operations in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, and requested that vessels of third countries in Wenzhou quickly withdraw to the east of 121 degrees 15 minutes east longitude, and those in Fuzhou should withdraw to 119 degrees 50 minutes east longitude. All ships of all countries should withdraw before noon (Tokyo time) on June 29th. Japan will not be responsible for any dangers encountered by ships traveling to and from Fuzhou and Wenzhou after that deadline.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] The Japanese side recently notified the British authorities that it would blockade the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou after noon on the 29th of this month. This blockade "will employ dangerous obstacles, which is a military necessity. After such a blockade, entry and exit from the ports will be impossible." The Japanese authorities also stated that Japan cannot be held responsible for any damage to ships caused by these obstacles.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] The British authorities have recently rejected the Japanese request to allow British ships and nationals to evacuate Fuzhou and Wenzhou, as both places are treaty ports and Britons have the right to unlimited access. The British authorities also notified the Japanese side that Japan would be fully responsible for any damage to British lives and property resulting from Japanese military actions.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Reports from Shanghai indicate that after Japan ordered American ships in Fuzhou and Wenzhou to leave immediately, American nationals should also evacuate entirely by the 29th. It is learned that Commander Yarnell of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet intends to send a note to the Japanese side, rejecting the demand, using similar language to the rejection of Japan's demands in the Shantou area.

[Local News] Currently, the only foreign warships in Fuzhou harbor are the British warship "Daffodil" and the American warship "Asheville," which is believed to be near Fuzhou. The foreign ship calling at Wenzhou is Jardine Matheson's "Pao Hai" steamer. This ship was scheduled to sail to Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. Jardine Matheson's "Tai Sang" steamer, which leaves Hong Kong at 4 PM today, will still call at Shantou as usual, but whether it will call at Fuzhou will depend on the situation.

Fierce Battles on Chao-Shan Line, Stable Situation on All Fronts

[Special Dispatch from Min Ge News Agency, Chao'an] The reporter recently met with a general, the supreme commander of the Shantou operations, in a certain place in eastern Guangdong. According to him, abandoning Shantou City was a predetermined plan by our army to lure the Japanese forces deep into the area for encirclement and annihilation. Currently, our main forces have deployed a tight encirclement around Shantou City, adopting an encirclement strategy against Shantou and seeking an opportunity to counterattack. After the Japanese forces occupy Shantou City, it will be difficult for them to advance further.

[Central News Agency, Chao'an, 26th] More than 500 Japanese troops launched several fierce attacks on Caitang on the 25th, engaging in fierce battles with our troops. On the evening of the 25th, Japanese cavalry were discovered in Fuyang, about 20 li northwest of Caitang, and fierce battles ensued.

[Min Ge News Agency, Wengyuan, 27th] Shantou City fell into Japanese hands on the night of the 22nd. On the evening of the 23rd, Japanese troops engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with our forces at Anbu. The Japanese used motorboats to transport more than 1,000 soldiers, attacking us from the Meixi River. Another unit of about 500 Japanese troops landed from the Zilai Factory and attacked Anbu. Our battalion commander, Du, led his troops in a brave resistance, sustaining serious injuries. Company commander Li was killed in action. Under the pressure of the Japanese's superior firepower, they were forced to retreat and defend the Liulongxian Bridge and Wuxi areas.

[Min Ge News Agency, Wengyuan, 27th] At around 9 AM on the 24th, Japanese reinforcements moved north from Shantou City. The main force was near Yuepu, and its advance troops, accompanied by cavalry artillery of about 70-80 men, advanced along the railway and had already crossed into the area north of Huamei Station. Our troops have been continuously arriving at the front lines for reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, Chao'an, 26th] More than 20 Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed various towns and villages in the Chaozhou area in batches. The town of Chaozhou is under air raid alerts daily. Residents of the urban area have been evacuated as much as possible.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 26th] On the night of the 24th, a unit of our army ambushed the Japanese in Xiahan, 2 li northeast of Nanlinqiao. The Japanese were caught off guard and over a dozen were killed and more than 20 wounded. The remaining Japanese retreated north, and Xiahan was recovered by our army. We seized over 100 jin of electric wire, three rifles, and over a dozen documents.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 26th] On the afternoon of the 18th, about 200 Japanese troops from Jingle, with two mountain mortars, launched an attack on Fuzhihui (directly west of Jingle). After a fierce counterattack by our forces, the fighting lasted seven hours. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled in disarray towards Jingle. In this battle, over 40 Japanese soldiers were killed.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 26th] More than 1,500 Japanese troops from Quwo sneaked into Jicheng a week ago and burned the town to the ground when passing through Nanfanzhen, leaving it in ruins.

[Central News Agency, Fuliang, 27th] The Japanese troops near Anqing were ambushed by our forces and suffered heavy casualties. They now dare not act rashly. On the morning of the previous day, our troops split into multiple routes and swept away the remaining Japanese troops in the Heisiling area of the Anhe Road, completely destroying the Huangtuling-Yuexingshan highway that had been repaired by the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in that area dared not confront us and immediately fled. We are now advancing towards Anqing.

### Orders from the National Government

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] On the 27th, the National Government ordered: [1] Xie Shuying, a supervisory member of the Control Yuan, has submitted a request to resign. Xie Shuying is hereby relieved of his original post. This order.

### Craigie Visits Arita, Discusses Tianjin Situation, Allegedly Violates British Attitude on the Issue, Japan Fails to Incite Anti-British Sentiment in North China

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, met last night for forty minutes to discuss the basic principles for Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident. However, according to the Kokumin Shimbun, the British Ambassador yesterday conveyed to the Japanese Foreign Minister the British government's attitude towards the Tianjin incident, and requested a formal response from the Japanese government to various British protests.

Current Situation in the British Concession of Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Tianjin - This morning, the situation in the British Concession is even more severe than before due to the shortage of milk in various hospitals. A Japanese customs officer recuperating in the isolation ward of a British hospital, who originally relied on milk to sustain his life, is now unable to obtain it. The hospital director has notified the Japanese Consul General, stating that the life of the Japanese customs officer is in imminent danger. A Reuters reporter inspected the borders of the concession today and saw that everything was normal. People wishing to enter the British and French concessions still had to be interrogated and inspected by Japanese troops. According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, around 11 PM the night before, a guerrilla force of 60 people attacked the Tianjin Southern Suburbs Police Station. Clear gunfire could be heard within the British and French concessions. Later, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the guerrillas retreated, taking several prisoners.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Tianjin - This afternoon, Lieutenant Simmons of the British Army was stopped by a Japanese sentry near the racecourse. At the same time, another eight British soldiers were transporting food from the racecourse to the Japanese concession and were also stopped. After negotiations with the Japanese side by Lieutenant Colonel Bowman of the British Army for an hour, the Japanese finally allowed the passage through the racecourse road to purchase food for the British garrison.

[Reuters, London, 27th] The Japanese commander here declared today that he had issued new instructions to sentries stationed outside the concession borders, stating that there was no need to strip search foreigners and that the Japanese authorities would not prevent food from being brought into the concession, and that water traffic would remain open as usual. Fifteen Europeans who arrived here last Friday on a sea liner were only allowed to disembark today. The ship had been experiencing food shortages since last Saturday, but the Japanese side had consistently refused to allow the people on board to disembark.

Anti-British Movement in North China

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Beiping - The anti-British movement led by the Japanese has made no progress in the Chinese population. Yesterday, the Japanese invited countless students, teachers, merchants, and officials to participate in an anti-British mass rally, but the attempt was a complete failure. Only 500 people attended the rally, and the subsequent parade failed to attract public attention. Newspapers under Japanese control continue to publish anti-British articles, but their rhetoric is no different from before. A letter was received here yesterday from Captain Spire, the British military attaché who was detained by the Japanese army. According to the letter, food and books sent to him had been received, proving that Captain Spire's condition was good. However, there are currently no signs of his release.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 27th] Since Japan blockaded the British and Japanese concessions in Tianjin, anti-British sentiment has become even more profound. Puppet organizations in the lost areas of eastern and northern Henan, driven by Japanese chieftains, have organized anti-British associations. This movement has even spread to various counties and towns, but only puppets are seen waving flags and shouting slogans, and no real masses are being exploited.

### After the Ministry of Finance Restricted Withdrawals, Shanghai's Financial Situation Stabilized, Silver Firms Handle Discounting, to Revitalize Market Finances

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai - After the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals, speculators had no means to apply their skills due to the contraction of currency. Therefore, the rise in gold prices subsided, foreign exchange lengthened, and commodity prices lowered, all proving that restricting withdrawals was a wise measure. The Four Banks Discounting Association delegates the handling of discounting applications from various banks and firms to the silver firms' preparatory committee, in order to revitalize market finances.

### Japanese Gold Collection

[Our Shanghai Office, 27th] According to foreign nationals arriving in Shanghai from Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has newly promulgated a decree ordering all Japanese residents (regardless of nationality) to register their gold coins, goldware, and metal ornaments containing more than seven carats of pure gold with the Ministry of Finance between July 1st and 5th. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that it will purchase them at a rate of 3.85 Japanese yen per gram of pure gold, which is far lower than the market price. Anyone possessing Tokugawa dynasty gold coins or American ten-dollar gold coins must declare the number of pieces.

### Devaluation of Puppet Currency

[Reuters, Beiping, 27th] According to sources close to the Japanese authorities, the currency of the puppet Federal Reserve Bank will soon be devalued again, possibly falling to eight fen per yuan. The puppet government will also expand export controls, greatly increasing the variety of controlled export goods.

### Wind and Rain Disaster in Northeastern Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] According to Japanese sources, northeastern Japan experienced severe wind and rain yesterday and the day before. Nine fishermen drowned, 30 fishing boats went missing, 16 capsized, and 21 other boats had their hulls breached by the water.

### Executive Yuan Meeting, Lü Jingcun Appointed to Guizhou Provincial Committee, Revision of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Organization Law

### Jiangxi-Anhui-Jiangsu-Zhejiang War Zone Launches Movement to Rescue Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

[Central News Agency, A Certain Location in Eastern Jiangxi, 26th] The Supreme Military Authority of the Xth War Zone, in light of the expanding war zone, inconvenient transportation, and the urgent need to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees, has launched a campaign to solicit medical supplies for the war zone to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Eleven measures have been established, and each province in the war zone will form a War Zone Solicitation Committee, responsible for four types of fundraising activities: donations, artistic performances, and solicitations of both cash and practical Western medicines. It is hoped that compatriots in the rear will diligently donate to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers and compatriots.

[Central News Agency, A Certain Location in Eastern Jiangxi, 26th] On the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, the local Anti-Japanese Support Association specially prepared 100 yuan in comfort money and sent it to wounded officers and soldiers at a certain garrison hospital in a certain location, to show the people's concern for the wounded soldiers. All the wounded officers and soldiers agreed that during the Anti-Japanese War, when funds are needed, even during festivals, there should be no waste. They decided to donate all the funds to the nation's difficulties, and yesterday, they submitted it to the battlefield political department for forwarding to the National Government. The patriotic spirit of the wounded officers and soldiers in this hospital is particularly commendable.

Upon completion, graduates will be assigned to work.

### Pen Brigade in Chengdu

— Hai Fan

[Min Ge News Agency, Chengdu Correspondence] The Pen Brigade, a newly established vital force of literary figures from the Chinese Literary Resistance Association, arrived in Chengdu from Chongqing on the 19th. The reporter paid a visit at 9:30 PM on the 21st, inquiring about the team's planned route for this expedition and work plans. Vice Leader Song Zhidi provided the following detailed information:

The Pen Brigade belongs to the Chinese Literary Resistance Association and is a mass organization. Funding is relatively scarce. This trip to the front lines is funded by the Party and Government Committee of the Military Affairs Commission. The original plan was to travel from Chongqing to Chengdu on a transport truck, but due to a lack of vehicles, they switched to a highway bureau vehicle. The connecting tickets have been purchased, and they are preparing to depart from Chengdu to Xi'an soon. Although funding is very difficult, major problems are not expected to arise.

As for the Pen Brigade's organization, Wang Lixi serves as the team leader, with Song as the deputy leader. The team members include Wan Yihong, Yuan Bo, Fang Yin, Luo Feng, Bai Lang, Li Huiying, Zhang Zhou, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Xiaonan, Yang Sao, Ye Yiqun, and Yang Shuo, totaling fourteen people. Among them, Wang Lixi has a multifaceted development in academic cultivation, with in-depth research in literature and social sciences. Yang Sao's poems and plays, Luo Feng's novels, and Qian Xinzhi's essays are all well-known to literary enthusiasts. Others excel in playwriting, critique of women's studies, or poetry and novels, each with their unique strengths. I will not elaborate further. The reporter further inquired about the route of this Pen Brigade expedition. According to Song's response: The planned route for the expedition is to go directly to Xi'an via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, cross the Yellow River via the Suohai Road, go from the First War Zone to the Second War Zone, and go deep into the various troops in southeastern Shanxi. They will also visit the Taihang Mountains area and the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region to participate in the writings led by Song Zhuwen. Then they will go to Hebei to see the administrative overview and achievements of Guang Zhonglin, then pass through Shandong, and return to Chongqing via the Fifth War Zone, Xiangfan, and Yichang.

The work plan is roughly divided into the following three items:

(1) Bring existing publications and booklets, distribute them to various troops or the masses on the front lines, and use popular and concrete propaganda to make soldiers and the masses deeply understand their own tasks and the situation of the war of resistance. There are many writers currently working in various war zones, and we are very willing to connect with them and help each other.

(2) At the front lines and behind the Japanese lines, use collective interviews and creative methods to collect materials and provide them to the rear. On the one hand, we can also take this opportunity to collect many historical materials on the war of resistance for future creative materials.

(3) Briefly translate the heroic resistance materials and news from our various war zones and publish them abroad, and contact foreign writers to promote the spirit of our people's resistance against Japan. As for the topics to be compiled and sent abroad, it is planned that the Hong Kong office of the Literature Association will receive and forward them abroad. After returning from the expedition, we plan to publish a special issue with the materials collected from all parties for the readers. At this point in the conversation, all the team members had returned to the team, and visitors and farewell-senders successively left, so the reporter also said goodbye.

As the reporter walked alone, thinking of the Pen Brigade of the Literary Resistance Association, they were able to sweep away the old habit of literary flourish. With a spirit of perseverance and hard work, they actually went to the battlefield. This kind of spirit and courage is truly exciting and admirable. We hope that the Pen Brigade, this vital force, will work hard on its own position to carry out enlightenment education. We hope that they will use their pens on the cultural front to crush the cultural invasion conspiracy of the Japanese and the puppet organizations, and use the power of the pen to cooperate with the military power to attack the Japanese. They have already bravely set off for the battlefield, and we wish them success with high enthusiasm.

### The Fall of Shantou City: An Eyewitness Account of the Japanese Plundering of Shantou

— Special Article by Our Newspaper (2) Lin Gao

II

Around nine o'clock, people near the pier were running towards the center of the street. Two Japanese planes then landed on the water. I couldn't believe it and ran to the coast to see. The Japanese planes were still flying overhead.

People carrying boxes and bags hurried into Jardine Matheson & Co. I stood at its door, wondering what was happening.

A relative forcefully pulled me inside, saying seriously, urgently, and frantically: "What are you doing running around in the street when the planes are flying so low!"

Jardine Matheson & Co. was crowded with people and luggage, in a state of chaos, sweat, and heavy breathing.

"The Japanese flag is flying on Mount Ma'an!"

"Ten enemy warships are sailing into Ma'an Estuary!" News spread.

The crowd squeezed out of the gate, ran across the pier, and boarded the "Yingzhou Wheel." Mount Jiaoshi on the opposite shore lay heavily, its peaks lined up on either side. At the eastern end of this line, four small black dots looked like bird droppings. These black dots were slowly moving and growing! Anger and terror also grew accordingly.

Around ten o'clock, ferocious warships, flying the banner of scattered blood droplets, sailed past the Yingzhou Wheel.

"Boom, boom, boom—boom, boom, boom!" The sound of cannons rang out, and cruel bombing began. Soil and sand sprayed up in heaps, each explosion causing pain in the chest.

Japanese gray-black motorboats scurried on the sea, armored, uncovered, like rats, searching for food. Large wooden boats, small motorboats, and customs patrol boats, which had been moored near the mountains to avoid Japanese aircraft strafing and bombing, were all taken away by them and also displayed that glaring banner of scattered blood droplets. However, they absolutely dared not approach the shore.

III

A gray small boat, with a layer of iron wrapped around the front, sprayed white water waves on both sides, and ferociously sailed to the pier of the Water Police Bureau.

The heartstrings on the ship seemed to swell and tighten, as fierce fighting was about to begin.

However, two Japanese soldiers who crawled out of the boat, wearing dark green uniforms, stood up, carrying a glaring banner, looked around, climbed up the pier, preparing to insert the flag. But, suddenly, they shrank their necks, and hurriedly fled back to the boat, causing the small boat to sway greatly, and tend to escape towards the sea.

The "Imperial Army" is as timid as rats.

IV

Puff, puff, puff!

Cannon fire and smoke emanated from the reinforced concrete gun emplacement in the eastern corner of the Chaohai Customs pier, and murderous bullets assaulted it like a torrential rain. On the walls of the customs inspection yard behind, many holes had been opened.

A soldier in a camouflage uniform, holding a rifle, his left hand drooping, slipped past the wall. People and artillery shells continued to raise against the wall, dirt clods and smoke kept shooting down from the heap behind the stacks. (To be continued)

### Hull States: British and American Consultation; Discussion on Addressing Far East Situation; Rumor of Consideration to Dispatch Ships Eastward

(Reuters, Washington, 26th) Secretary of State Hull, in responding to a reporter's question at a press conference today regarding whether the United States is considering taking broader action in the Far East, stated that he had no preconceived notions. Regarding the Swatow incident, the situation has recently calmed down, so the American marines who had landed in Swatow have returned to their warships. Hull also said that American representatives are currently in London consulting with the British government on all matters and continuously exchanging information with each other.

(Reuters, Washington, 26th) According to an article in "The Washington Star," Washington is reportedly discussing the possibility of dispatching the American fleet to the Far East to "curb aggression." The article's author stated, "Given that the British and French navies have a tacit understanding regarding the European theater, then, in terms of using force to promote the rights of democratic nations in the Far East, the United States should shoulder the main responsibility." The commentator continued, "President Theodore Roosevelt dispatched a fleet on a world tour in 1907, with Japan as its specific target. Whether this can be done again is now under consideration." Political circles have not commented on the above proposal. However, in the past, when the Far East situation was tense, naval authorities discussed moving the fleet to Hawaii or Manila. Sources claim that the government is most concerned with the amendment of the Neutrality Act and hopes to avoid any action that could hinder the passage of the amendment. However, anyone who says that the United States is too busy with domestic affairs to be concerned with foreign affairs and tries to take advantage of this is greatly mistaken.

(Central News Agency, London, 27th) The Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting last night to discuss the Tianjin issue. The British ambassador to Japan will soon submit a report to the British government regarding the attitude of the Japanese government. It is rumored that the British government intends to hold a naval demonstration in the Far East. It is understood that the British government can certainly dispatch warships to the Far East, but the effectiveness of the fleet if it is not substantial is questionable.

[Reuters, London, 26th] Labor MP Fletcher asked in the House of Commons how the Swatow situation affects British shipping and trade between Hong Kong and Swatow. Undersecretary Butler replied that the impact on British shipping is still unclear. Although the local situation is chaotic, British naval authorities are doing their utmost to secure the free movement of British ships. It is too early to discuss the impact of the Swatow incident on British trade in Hong Kong, but the authorities are closely monitoring the situation.

[Reuters, Singapore, 27th] After the conclusion of the British-French joint defense conference here, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Noble, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, McNiece, will leave for Hong Kong tonight. Today, Noble and the Director of the Australian Navy, Colvin, had lunch together. When meeting with Reuters reporters, he said that Australia is paying close attention to the British-French talks. He also presented the results of the Pacific defense conference held recently in New Zealand and discussed them with Noble. Colvin is scheduled to depart for London on Friday to report the results of the two conferences to the Admiralty.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Former Director of Naval Intelligence, Vice-Admiral Osbert, recently gave a broadcast address on the topic of Pacific defense, stating that if war breaks out between Britain and Japan, China will automatically become an ally of Britain. China can easily obtain assistance through railways, aviation, and highways, and thus China's resistance will become stronger, while Japan will be exhausted and ultimately defeated. Fortunately, both Britain and Japan are willing to resolve various disputes through agreements, so war between the two countries may not occur. In his opinion, Britain, France, and the United States should form a conference in the Far East. When necessary, they can jointly send a note to Japan, which Japan would not dare to ignore, because the combined military strength of the three countries is too strong for Japan to provoke.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] The Admiralty recently issued a statement stating that the summer leave for officers and men of the ships under its command will be brought forward from July so that the ships can be docked for repairs in July. The exercises can then be brought forward to August. The original plan for the ships to sail to a certain place north of the main base in mid-July has also been cancelled. The Navy Week, which is held at the beginning of August every year, will also be cancelled this year. Members of Parliament have commented on this matter, saying that according to German sources, the international situation may become extremely tense again in the second half of August. The Admiralty is taking precautions and has decided to bring forward the date of naval exercises (held in September last year) in order to prepare for the worst possible situation, so that there is the greatest hope of safeguarding peace.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations: Prospects Gradually Optimistic; Rumor that Britain is Prepared to Accept Soviet Demands

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain recently stated in the House of Commons that the government will send new instructions to Ambassador Seeds regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] According to various newspapers here today, the British government has decided to prepare to accept all Soviet demands. The Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting for an hour and a half and instructed Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again to indicate that Britain is prepared to agree to offer guarantees to the three Baltic states. This guarantee will be included in an annex to the Anglo-Soviet agreement but will not be published. The British government is also prepared to begin staff talks immediately after the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet agreement. Political circles here believe that under these circumstances, the Anglo-Soviet agreement will certainly be completed in the near future. "The Daily Mail" stated, "The British government wishes to see the Anglo-Soviet negotiations completed quickly, and the Soviet Union shares this wish."

### Germany and Italy Intensifying Brewing of New Conspiracy; Germany Secretly Training Special Forces; Scheduled to Enter Danzig at the End of Next Month

[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Diplomatic circles here have recently obtained information from abroad that the totalitarian countries are actively engaging in military activities, similar to what they did before the previous European crises, indicating that the international situation will face another crisis in a few weeks. This can be seen in the following matters: (1) Before the signing of the German-Italian military alliance treaty, German Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Mendel and Italian Undersecretary of the Army Balia held talks in Innsbruck. Until recently, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder and Italian Undersecretary of the Navy Gavagnari also held talks in Friedrichshafen, Germany, to discuss cooperation between the two navies. As for cooperation between the air forces, German Aviation Minister Goering is also holding talks with Italian Undersecretary of Aviation Valle. (2) German-Italian military measures have been extended to Africa. German Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch went to Italian Somaliland in North Africa to lay the foundation for joint German-Italian action in North Africa. (3) Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio recently inspected defenses in Albania and has now returned to Rome. There are now 120,000 Italian troops stationed in Albania, which was occupied by Italy. (4) The Italian Navy's First Fleet, including the battleships Cavour and Giulio Cesare, ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, is conducting a "symbolic cruise" in the Atlantic Ocean. The Second Fleet will sail east on July 1st to Libya, Albania, and the Aegean Sea. In practice, the Italian Navy is about to be fully mobilized. (5) The Italian Army is about to hold large-scale exercises in the north. (6) The German Army will have 1.4 million personnel this summer. There are now 200,000 workers rushing to build fortifications along the German-Polish border, which is a clear threat to the Free City of Danzig. The re-emergence of tension in the European situation can be seen in the above.

[Central News Agency, Danzig, 27th] The Germans have started to organize special forces in Danzig, with key members being the shock troops, Blackshirts, and Hitler Youth. The organization method is exactly the same as that used by Germany before annexing the Sudetenland. Young people aged 16 to 20 have been conscripted and sent to East Prussia and other parts of Germany for two weeks of rigorous training. The location of the training is kept secret. The trainees are scheduled to return here on July 1st. Sixteen barracks have been built here for the use of the special forces.

### German Newspapers Continue to Insult Britain

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] A certain newspaper here is encouraging the Japanese to insult British residents in Tianjin. The newspaper claimed that British national power is weakening, its position in China and Palestine is becoming increasingly precarious and subject to humiliation, and even London is threatened by anti-British activities by the Irish Republican Army. In the event of war, Britain will not be able to resist.

### France and the United States Supplying Japan with Military Supplies; US Sells Large Quantities of Aircraft to Japan; France Also Supplies Japan with War Materials

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The US Department of Commerce recently released statistics on aircraft exports, stating that in the first five months of this year, aircraft exports totaled only $38,247,052, of which Japan purchased over $1 million worth.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to the new trade agreement signed between Japan and France on the 13th of this month, Japan has switched from importing luxury goods from France to purchasing "essential goods." Japan will purchase approximately £2.3 million worth of iron machinery and chemical raw materials from France in the coming year, while purchases of spices, cosmetics, and alcohol will be discontinued. France will purchase canned tuna, carp, porcelain, and cotton textiles from Japan.

### British and French Public Opinion Unanimously Hardline

[Reuters, London, 27th] The "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent Bartley stated that the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee met tonight and believes that the Japanese anti-British movement in Tianjin can be ended, but only under certain conditions. Britain should strengthen China's currency, as this is the best way to force Tokyo to change its policy. The newspaper's editorial also urged the government to provide large-scale financial and economic assistance to China, saying, "There is a real danger that if we do not retaliate against Japan's provocations, the Nazis may think that we can also be despised in Europe." The "Daily Herald" urged housewives across the country to stop buying Japanese goods, as this would let the Japanese government know that there is no benefit to pursuing a policy of insulting others. The "Manchester Guardian" stated, "Britain's most important ally in the Far East is China, not France or the United States. Many of the retaliatory steps under consideration involve restricting the import of Japanese goods into the British Empire, but we should not forget that assisting China is also a retaliatory step. We can provide China with loans, aircraft, and tanks, which is not the least effective." "Our real front line in the Far East is not Tianjin, Hong Kong, or Singapore, but the Northwest and South China areas."

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The "Financial News" wrote yesterday that it is difficult to determine what benefits the government can gain from its policy of procrastination. However, the world is watching the position taken by Britain in the Far East dispute. If it fails, Britain's credibility will be seriously damaged and difficult to restore. Therefore, the time for compromise has passed.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] London dispatch: Newspapers here unanimously advocate that Britain should take immediate action on the Tianjin incident. The "Sunday Pictorial" stated that British Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that Britain could not accept Japanese domination, but in fact Japan has further insulted Britain. The "Sunday Express" stated that there are 50,000 Japanese merchants in Britain. If Britain imposes a blockade on them, the blow they suffer will be much greater than the insults that Japan has inflicted on British residents in Tianjin. The "Sunday Times" stated that Britain should adopt a firm and calm policy and consider mediation if there is a possibility of it. If one responds to this matter with excessive emotion, one must be careful not to fall into Hitler's conspiracy. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that the government should know that if the government is determined to resist aggression, the entire nation will stand behind it. The British Prime Minister's expression of indignation at the Japanese military's humiliation of British residents reflects the unanimous assessment of the people of the whole country.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Newspapers here are commenting on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the 24th. Pardonnaux wrote in "L'Ordre," "It would be better if Mr. Chamberlain temporarily shelved the attempt at appeasement and first formed an agreement with the Soviet Union." Mrs. Tabouis also wrote in "L'Oeuvre," "Germany's response to Mr. Chamberlain's speech has once again proved that Germany will not change its resolve." "La République" stated, "Germany's response to Mr. Chamberlain's speech is to make France believe that British-French cooperation is tantamount to trapping France in a subordinate position, in order to make France leave the alliance later. However, if France must eventually become a vassal, it is better to be a vassal of Britain than a vassal of Germany."

### Tianjin Incident to Be Resolved in Tokyo; Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary; Urges British Government to Pay Attention to Tianjin Situation

[Reuters, London, 26th] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent reports that after the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee met tonight to reconsider the Far East situation, the government may soon announce the start of negotiations with Tokyo. The committee will also discuss the situation of the talks with the Soviet Union. It is understood that the new instructions mentioned by Chamberlain today have not yet been issued because these instructions.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] As a result of the meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, the Japanese side has agreed to hold formal talks in Tokyo. Therefore, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's report to Parliament yesterday expressed optimism. The government believes that Japan's willingness to use Tokyo as the negotiation location, rather than Tianjin, is a good sign, as holding the meeting in Tokyo can reduce the pressure from the Japanese military. Neutral observers generally agree with this view. The British Defense Committee held a special meeting yesterday to discuss Sir Noble's report on the Singapore conference. It is said that Britain will send a large fleet to the Far East as a demonstration. The British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, and Guo called the British authorities' attention to the relationship between the Tianjin incident and the Nine-Power Treaty, as China is also one of the signatories to the treaty.

### Butler Speaks at the Imperial Press Conference

[Reuters, London, 27th] Undersecretary Butler delivered a speech to the Imperial Press Conference today, discussing the establishment of the External Publicity Department, stating, "Our purpose is not to engage in any unfounded propaganda, but to promote our own views." He then described the British government's foreign policy, saying, "Under the provisions of the League of Nations system, peaceful change is possible. We are not opposed to any change, but we are opposed to change achieved by force."

### US Senate Passes Currency Amendment

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The Senate today passed a currency amendment increasing the price of newly minted domestic silver to US$0.774 per ounce. The Treasury Department can only profit 40 percent from purchasing domestic silver. The Senate also passed an amendment eliminating the Treasury Department's power to purchase silver abroad.

### Japan Today

— Shichang

Japan's war of aggression against China will soon reach two years. China's unity and resistance against foreign aggression is something Japan did not expect. Recently, the Japanese army occupied Swatow, which on the surface seems to be another so-called "victory" for Japan. However, let's take a look at Japan today:

Soon after the outbreak of this war, Japan felt the pain. The armaments accumulated over many years were being turned to ashes, and most of them were intended to deal with a formidable enemy - the Soviet Union. The lack of currency and raw materials is an inherent phenomenon of wartime economic contraction, which is not surprising. However, in Japan today, all industries are depressed, people are suffering, and danger is everywhere. Now, let's briefly discuss food, materials, commerce, and finance.

Food - The government has implemented controls on milk, butter, eggs, and other major foods. The cost of food has increased by an average of 13 percent in one year, and by 23 percent since July 7, 1937.

Materials - Iron utensils and old razor blades are being collected and melted to make armaments. Silk and wool clothing have disappeared in the retail market. The Japanese government is preparing to replace silk fabrics with rayon, but without success.

Commerce - The government has instructed banks to reduce interest rates on small loans and control prices, but has not controlled salaries. Therefore, millions of large and small merchants have suffered losses and gone bankrupt.

Finance - The instability of Japan's financial foundation is well known. Recently, the sharp drop in the yen was not accidental. Recently, the Japanese Minister of Finance expressed "disappointment" with the metallurgical industry in 1938, which was not without reason. In April of this year, Japan did not have a penny left to buy war materials from the United States.

From the above situation, we can clearly find two points: First, Japan's gold reserves are about to be exhausted; second, inflation, if not true inflation, is gradually unfolding in Japan. The wartime problems in Japan are extremely serious.

Brief comment

### × Covets Fuzhou and Wenzhou

After forcibly occupying Swatow, the Japanese × have now advanced to Chaozhou. At the same time, they landed on the Zhoushan Islands and forcibly occupied Dinghai. According to last night's news, the Japanese × have also attempted to advance on Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Thus, the coastal situation is once again tense.

The Japanese × are one of the three major naval powers in the world, with a strong modern navy. China has no navy, so at the beginning of the war of resistance, it was prepared to exchange space for time, consume the × army's combat power, and strive for final victory. The coastal areas have long been prepared. The Japanese × 's invasion of our coast is not surprising. However, the fact that they have started a large-scale invasion at a time when the Japanese × 's war of aggression against China is encountering unprecedented difficulties is enough to expose their ugliness!

× 's harassment of the coast is to coordinate political offensives, especially economic offensives. The reasons have been seen in today's editorial. The significance lies first in threatening Britain, and secondly in our inland production and × rear combat troops. As for our countermeasures, they lie in strengthening the guerrilla war in the × rear, and combating all traitors and puppet organizations, while stepping up the promotion of the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, especially the aid-China and ban-Japan movement.

The Japanese × 's harassment of the coast is only a desperate struggle at the end of their rope. Not only can they not threaten us, but they can also increase our belief in adhering to the war of resistance and winning. The mountains of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces will be the Japanese × 's final tomb!

### An Oriental Drama: Searching for Gold

The Japanese × 's invasion of China has encountered great difficulties, so they are extremely vicious and their poisonous flames are high. On the one hand, they are stepping up the destruction and robbery of all British rights and interests in China (such as the recent blockade of Tianjin and the forced occupation of Swatow, advancing on Qianzhou and Wenzhou, etc.), on the other hand, they are making a pretense of attacking Soviet Outer Mongolia and exaggerating propaganda of "good news." Here, we would like to ask readers to pay attention to the fact that Britain and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo! Who are the Japanese × putting on these tricks for? Isn't it clear yet? Aren't the Japanese × 's desperate and fierce looks clear yet?

Today there is also news from Tokyo that the Japanese government will start gold registration on July 1st, and all foreign residents must register their gold savings. Here we can see the truth about the Japanese × 's empty treasury and their urgent attempt to search the people for gold! In fact, the property of the Japanese people has long been transformed into the fierce weapons of the Japanese army's invasion of China through various means. This time the search for gold is mainly aimed at foreigners. "Do not dwell in a dangerous country." We see that the Japanese × 's situation will become even more isolated and dangerous. We don't know how those who have been frantically exaggerating the Japanese × 's military strength will show their ugly faces.

### Mongolian Puppet Border: Continued Air Battles; 25 Japanese Aircraft Shot Down; Japanese Side Again Makes Mythical Propaganda

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 26th] Semi-official sources recently received news from the Soviet-Mongolian Army Headquarters in Outer Mongolia that 60 Japanese fighters invaded Outer Mongolia near Lake Ber and engaged in fierce air combat with 50 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft near Mongoliliba for two hours. 25 Japanese aircraft were shot down, and the remaining 35 fled immediately. Soviet-Mongolian aircraft chased them to Ganjur Monastery before returning.

[Reuters, 26th] According to news from Tokyo and Moscow, fierce air battles have broken out again on the Outer Mongolian border. According to the Soviet announcement, 60 Japanese aircraft that invaded Mongolian territory were intercepted by 50 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft. As a result, 25 Japanese aircraft were shot down and three Soviet aircraft were missing. According to Japanese propaganda, 60 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft fought with three Japanese aircraft, resulting in six Soviet-Mongolian aircraft being shot down in half an hour, while the Japanese aircraft returned safely. Both the Soviet and Japanese sides said that they had driven the other side's aircraft out of the territory.

Spring and Autumn

### The Two Tyrants of Danzig: A Chronicle of the Nazi Officialdom

Although many large countries have one tyrannical ruler, the small Free City of Danzig actually has two: one is Senate President Greiser, and the other is Forster, the head of the Nazi branch.

Both are devoted Nazi lackeys, but they are deeply hostile towards each other. In fact, both have nothing to do with Danzig; they are all outsiders who barged in. The tall Greiser is from western Poland, while the long, eagle-eyed Forster was born near Nuremberg.

Greiser is forty-four years old this year, more than ten years older than Forster; however, despite his advanced age, he is still Forster's subordinate in the Nazi Party. Therefore, in Danzig, Greiser must yield to Forster everywhere.

Several years ago, Forster was already shouting "Heil Hitler," while Greiser was still working dutifully as a clerk in a Jewish shop. When he came to Danzig, he only carried a medal he had won in the Great War, claiming to be a skilled pilot. Forster was even more pathetic when he arrived; wearing ragged pants and a hungry stomach, he wandered around aimlessly, eventually becoming a minor official.

Now? Greiser has an inexhaustible supply of checks, while Forster owns many magnificent properties around Danzig. Both are greedy for money, but Greiser is a big spender, while Forster is a miser.

Greiser became famous in Danzig for his numerous scandals. Forster rose to prominence after attacking Hindenburg, which cost him his official position.

Perhaps because he had suffered enough in the Jewish shop, Greiser became an expert in anti-Semitism. The previous President of Danzig, Dr. Rauschning, was ousted by Hitler for his insufficient anti-Semitism, and Greiser was appointed in his place.

Forster, on the other hand, came to Danzig to be a petty emperor because of a recommendation from Hitler's sister.

Greiser is a devoted follower of Goering; he even considers himself somewhat like Marshal Goering. Therefore, he imitates Goering in everything: wearing uniforms, hunting, and even having the same fondness for wearing medals. It is said that because he did not have enough medals himself, he even hung up his father's Red Cross medal, earned in the Franco-Prussian War. He often dresses in full military attire and walks down the street, only happy when people call him "Captain" instead of "Mr. President."

Forster is the complete opposite; he follows the principle of imitating Hitler. However, he did get married. His father-in-law is an architect, and as a result, all the public buildings in Danzig have been rebuilt.

Neither of them is well-liked in Danzig. Greiser is slightly better at it, able to give speeches for an hour or two, stirring up the emotions. Perhaps because he is still Polish, and retains a bit of conscience, he is relatively kind to the Poles and to the League of Nations' administrative committee, which is something Forster vehemently attacks. Sometimes, Greiser will also "go among the people" to chat and joke with them: in Forster's eyes, this is too vulgar and should never be done.

There cannot be two suns in the sky; that is undoubtedly true. How can this small Danzig accommodate two tyrants? Therefore, the constant squabbling has become commonplace. You will often see Forster storming out of the Senate in a rage, forgetting his hat; then, Greiser throws his hat out after him. Similarly, in public, you will see Greiser refuse to shake hands with Forster.

After arguing, Forster always runs to Hitler to complain, while Greiser seeks out Goering and Goebbels to pour out his grievances. In the end, Forster usually prevails.

Greiser has already been summoned by Hitler and reprimanded twice, told that his attitude is too weak and that he will be dismissed if he continues in this way. Goering and Goebbels can only sigh in vain. And Forster naturally becomes even more arrogant and domineering.

Perhaps, in the near future, Danzig will become a one-tyrant state.

The Japanese are most proud of the excellence of their domestic police administration, and that is indeed true. The stalking skills of Japanese secret detectives and the arrest capabilities of the royal military police are truly outstanding. If you don't believe it, please see below:

Once, a prisoner escaped from a jail in a small town near Tokyo. The police chief immediately sent eight photographs of the escaped prisoner in different poses to the neighboring police station, requesting their assistance in capturing him. The next day, he received a telegram in reply:

"Seven of them have been captured, and the remaining one is expected to be apprehended within days."

### One Person a Day

That Chu "Big Beard," who once pulled a carriage for a mermaid and made a splash, is proficient in the six arts in addition to being an official: shuttlecock kicking, Tai Chi... all are his specialties. In addition, he often puts on makeup and appears on stage to show off his talents.

Once, Chu "Big Beard" was again hired by some association to perform on stage. The role he played was inevitably one with a white patch painted on his nose.

"The Empty Fort Strategy" was staged, with Chu "Big Beard" playing Sima Yi, the white-faced general, leading his troops out.

Playing Zhuge Liang was the famous amateur actress, Ms. Wei Xinlü. Just as she was singing with great enthusiasm, Chu "Big Beard" suddenly had an inspiration, thinking that since it was clearly an empty city, why should they retreat forty li? So he shouted:

"Listen to my command, soldiers! Follow me and charge into the city!"

The stage was thrown into chaos, and the female Zhuge Liang nearly fainted. She could only blurt out a line:

"Oh no! I never thought that my Zhuge's Empty Fort Strategy would fail one day!"

Mussolini Hunting - Arrogant at First, Respectful Later

### Maritime Storm

— By Lieutenant Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi

Previously excerpted: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship 'Königberg' was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Chooks Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wildly without a destination. Soon, a message came through the wireless that there was an iceberg nearby. Fortunately, the iceberg soon slipped past, but shortly after, a British warship came to intercept them and opened fire, hitting the stern. However, fortunately, fog descended...

"That's right, this game of hide-and-seek in the fog is driving me crazy." Bill grumbled.

At dusk, the ship had passed through the fog, but every eye was anxiously watching, fearing that another black hunting dog of the British would emerge from the gray sea and sky.

However, they did not encounter anything like that again, although, in the evening, far to the east of their route, they could see the searchlights of cruisers, white beams like fingers stretching out, searching everywhere. The next day passed peacefully again. On the morning of the third day, when a faint dawn appeared in the sky, Jack poked his head out of the wireless room and discovered that their ship was heading towards a strange, peculiar, and crude coastline.

At this time, the passengers began to stir. Approaching the edge of the coast, they gradually saw small huts and wooden houses. While they were having breakfast, the ship entered a port, and the anchor dropped with a rumble. The people in the dining room suddenly emptied out and rushed to the deck.

"Why, that house looks exactly like my home in White Harbor," a woman exclaimed.

Ten minutes later, it was proven that she was not mistaken. This place was indeed White Harbor in the United States. The captain, because he dared not sail to New York or Boston, chose this world-famous summer resort, a place that British cruisers would not pay much attention to. Sure enough, his calculation was correct. The "gold ship" had finally arrived safely at a paradise after some risks. After the ship was moored, almost all the passengers went ashore an hour later. They were all busy sending telegrams, reporting their safe arrival everywhere.

Wireless broadcasts traveled thousands of miles, and everyone knew that the ship had arrived safely. A few days ago, the news of the "gold ship" going missing had indeed kept people busy for a while. The newspapers published many speculative dangers, saying that she had been captured and entered a British port; or that she had sunk, with all the cargo lost, but no one guessed that the "gold ship" had actually slipped back on the treacherous seas.

The next day, Jack Red and Bill Nanno Rumongalo stayed in a hotel. Jack received a telegram from Mr. Chooks, which read: Glad to hear you are safe and sound. Come to my office for a discussion when you get to New York. There is an important matter to discuss.

"What's it about again?" Jack asked Bill in surprise.

"I don't have the slightest idea," Bill said, "but I have a feeling that your vacation is over."

"You can still call it a vacation," Jack laughed.

"That's right, perhaps 'experience' is a more appropriate word," Bill also laughed.

### Weather Forecast

The Tianjin issue has been deadlocked for a long time. The British have talked about it again and again, negotiated again and again, stopping and starting, with no result. Yesterday's news said that the British government will announce formal negotiations with Japan. What does this mean?

You should believe it now. Military affairs are a comprehensive conspiracy of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Japan performs on stage, while Germany and Italy cheer from the sidelines. An Italian newspaper says: The old empire is shaking. Goebbels says: Britain has no real strength to back it up. Well, let the appeasement policy appease these cries!

News has come that Britain is preparing to intensify negotiations with the Soviet Union and will agree to all the Soviet Union's conditions. Hopefully, it will materialize soon. A wise man adapts to the times.

Our port is increasing the number of reserve police. Amitabha, good, good. I hope it will be filled soon, trained, and show the thieves a little color. Long live the police!

It costs two yuan for an epidemic prevention fee to go to Macau, and it actually costs a hundred yuan in security deposit to go to Annam. Since the fall of Guangzhou, entering the country has become a necessary route. Those who have gone through it are complaining endlessly. Now, to ask for a security deposit seems too "that." If the matter is true, I hope the diplomatic authorities will come up with a proper solution.

Opening a newspaper, the front page is advertising "Naked Country Scenery" starring Chen Shachang, etc. The second page is "Chen Yunshang's Announcement," denying that she has starred in "Naked Country Scenery." The world of the twentieth century, the world of advertising, the world of business eyes.

5.  Interbank Lending

Since August 17 of last year, the Association has been handling interbank remittances and lending. At that time, the Shanghai war had just begun, and banks needed a large amount of money to prepare for withdrawals. Therefore, the amount of lending gradually increased, reaching a maximum of more than 8.34 million yuan. This year, due to the increase in deposits in various banks, the capital of banks is more abundant than before. The Association's lending amount has gradually decreased. At the end of June, the Association's lending balance was 4,513,608 yuan in national currency. At the end of the year, the lending balance was 3,740,800 yuan. The average lending rate for the whole year was 22%. The Association's interbank remittances and lending were originally complementary to the head payments and remittance lending handled by the four banks of the Central Bank. This year, in order to concentrate on dealing with the situation, most of the applications for lending from various banks were entrusted to the Association by the four banks. The amount of lending and the collateral were still jointly approved by the four banks. As of the end of the year, the Association's lending totaled 1,620,000 yuan in national currency, including 600,000 yuan for head payments and 1,020,000 yuan for remittance payments.

6.  Remittance Discount

Since there was a fact of remittance discounts in the market, the discount per thousand yuan was initially only 6 or 7 yuan. Since the government announced foreign exchange control in March, the discount gradually rose to 30 or 40 yuan. At the same time, the demand for legal tender increased day by day, and the legal tender in circulation in the market became increasingly scarce. In April, the Association was entrusted by the Central Bank to try to adjust the situation in moderation, but for a time there was still not enough supply. On June 7, the discount per thousand yuan rose to as high as 79 yuan. At that time, the Association was entrusted by the Central Bank to maintain the situation as much as possible, and the market discount rate was stabilized at around 50 yuan. The process is as described above. In November, Wuhan fell one after another, and people were uneasy. The rate rose again to more than 60 yuan, but soon returned to about 45 yuan. At the end of the year, it fell to 38 or 39 yuan, and the market has shown a stable trend. The Association's discount rate for remittance bills is determined by the Association's temporary review of the market, in consultation with the three banks.

7.  Interbank Deposits

This year, banks, trust companies, and money shops other than exchange banks have opened accounts with the Association for the purpose of loan settlement or to facilitate the collection of bills. These deposits are listed in the interbank deposit accounts in the Association's balance sheet. At the end of the year, the total deposit balance was 7,523,297.36 yuan, of which head deposits accounted for 35.19% and remittance deposits accounted for 64.81%.

(B) Bill Exchange Department

1. Exchange Banks

Due to environmental reasons, the Bank suspended business on February 5 of this year and stopped its bill exchange from the same day. After the Guangdong Bank was reorganized and resumed business last year, it was originally exchanged by the Association. On March 1 of this year, it joined as an exchange bank. On July 4, the Coal Industry Bank and Zhengming Bank simultaneously entrusted the Association to exchange. On October 4, Hengli Bank was reorganized and resumed business, and from the same day entrusted the Association to exchange. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the exchange. This year, branches of various banks in the city have still been reduced or merged. As of the end of the year, the Association still has 36 exchange banks and 10 banks that entrust the Association to exchange, an increase of one from last year. There are 77 branches of various banks in the city participating in the exchange, a decrease of 11 from last year. The total number of exchanges for the whole year was 2,176,344,120.89 yuan in national currency and 1,423,501 bills. Compared with 1937, the amount decreased by 62.53% and the number of bills decreased by 40%. The average daily exchange amount this year was 7,352,513.93 yuan in national currency and 4,809 bills. The exchange amount on January 29 reached 64,286,55,631 yuan, and the number of exchange documents on October 11 reached 13,608, both of which were the highest records for this year.

### Reflections on the Sixth Performance of the Chinese Arts Troupe

— Yang Ouyuqian

Originally, the Chinese Arts Troupe counted each rehearsal of a new script as a performance. However, this calculation was quite troublesome. Therefore, starting from this time, the method will be changed. Hereafter, each staging will be counted as a performance. - This time, the Cantonese group is the first performance, and the Mandarin group is the eighteenth performance.

Looking at the economic situation and material equipment of the Chinese Arts Troupe, not only can it not perform charity like Ms. Lin Meiqi, but even the rent of the venue is personally assumed. Such a heroic act means that each performance must go through many difficult plans to be barely realized.

This time, it can be regarded as acting through, and everyone is very happy. It does not matter whether the performance is good or bad, as long as the work that should be done is done within the possible range. Performing once at a time, advancing the work step by step, this is the attitude taken by the Chinese Arts Troupe at the current stage.

What we support is the War of Resistance and nation-building. The so-called drama work is the expression of every dramatist dedicating their spirit and physical strength to the War of Resistance and nation-building. We can use all kinds of methods—direct, indirect, linear, curved, roaring, gentle, straightforward, roundabout, encouraging, satirical, whole, fragmented—to promote the War of Resistance. At the same time, we must also gradually establish China's emerging drama in the work with a research, accumulation, open-minded, and constructive attitude and spirit.

The War of Resistance is long-term, and nation-building also requires a considerable period. Therefore, drama work is long-term, and the establishment of emerging drama is not a short-term matter. We must use all our energy to advance the work to the predetermined goal, and we must irrigate the buds of this emerging drama with all our energy to make them grow and develop.

Our work is long-term, so we must prepare for the long term. We must identify an ideal goal, follow certain steps, and thoroughly advocate with constant effort. In the progress of work, we must never think this way for a while and that way for another.

It is not certain that every play we put on is popular, and it is not certain that every tune we sing is equally high. There are bound to be occasional mistakes and failures in strategy. As long as we have a clear understanding of the principles and propositions and grasp them firmly, we don't need to take temporary gains and losses to heart. The most important thing is: do not cover up mistakes, and do not go around the bush to ask for understanding; do not cover up failures, just pay attention at any time and improve at any time. The more tempering of gains and losses, the more solid the career can be developed.

The Chinese Arts Troupe was established in Hong Kong, and the work naturally starts from Hong Kong. There are more than one million compatriots here. If we don't regard them as uncivilized, it may not be considered meaningless to perform a few more meaningful plays for them here. Many people come from the mainland and have been threatened by war and bombing. Although Hong Kong has not been bombed at the moment, the various difficulties in doing drama work here may not be able to crush a person's fragile heart.

The drama troupes staying in Hong Kong may as well talk more to the audience in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and give them more comfort and stimulation. If they think it is necessary to supplement the content, they may as well use the space and time here to supplement it well. If it is necessary to go to the mainland, there is no hesitation in going to the mainland, just as the drama troupes in the mainland should leave the mainland when necessary. Leaving the mainland has its own mission, and returning to the mainland is not to create qualifications in the bombing.

At present, the drama propaganda teams working in the mainland, only those directly under the Political Department of the Military Commission, have forty or so teams assigned to work in various war zones. Their organization is of course completely different from that of professional theater groups. There is much in their experience that can be used for our reference and learning, but there are also many places where they need to ask for advice from experienced and trained professional theater groups. For example, there is a great lack of directors. If there are people who can act and direct, they are needed everywhere. Another thing is the script. In the mainland, acting is used for propaganda, which is mostly mobile performances. There is no need for a large number of new scripts like in Hong Kong. However, the current situation has changed somewhat. Because in order to make the members of the performing troupe and the local people in the war zone become one and have close contact, each performing troupe has to stay in the war zone for a relatively long time. If they perform the same script every day, wouldn't it be boring? So I also hope that the production of scripts will increase. These may be divided into labor and cooperation, and the writers in the rear can work hard. If a writer is urgently needed in the front to supplement, he should immediately carry his gun and go to the battlefield. Otherwise, he can be left in the rear to work hard and write. It's just like skilled workers, they take guns when they need to take guns, and increase production in the rear when they don't grab guns. If drama workers in Hong Kong can unite, strengthen organization and training, and establish communication with drama workers in the mainland, discuss and help each other, there will be considerable achievements. However, this kind of thing also needs a dedicated person to preside over it, and it also needs considerable funding. It is true that drama workers in Hong Kong are too poor, but they cannot wait until they have money to do it. They can only do it and then see. If someone initiates and organizes, the Chinese Arts Troupe will definitely follow.

As for charity performances, it is not originally the task of drama workers themselves. For the sake of relief and fundraising, it should naturally be done. Before this performance of the Chinese Arts Troupe, there were two charity performances. After the performance, there will be another charity performance immediately. Isn't it also good to indirectly help refugees and wounded soldiers? But it's just a very plain thing. At this moment, it is always good to do more for the society. It's just that drama workers often put a lot of effort into achieving their own tasks, but the results they get are not as satisfactory as expected. This is worth adding to the training effort.

The Chinese Arts Troupe has not been established for a long time. Although the work has not been done very little, the content cannot be said to be very sound. This performance is just a small sub-station in the process. We only cultivate and do not count the harvest. However, mutual comparison of the results of each performance and detailed and strict review are also necessary. I also hope that the ladies and gentlemen who watch the play will give their advice at any time?

A Calf Waiting to be Slaughtered

### Summer Night Serenade

— Shulun

In a daze, I stroked the tail of the summer night. Isn't the night cat hiding outside the wall calling out a misty tune?

The window lattice filters the color of the deep night, and the night is progressing. Wind, agitator of midsummer night! Blow open the tightly furrowed eyes of the insomniac on the bed.

The black night protects the crawling of fleas. This makes the eyes of the sleepless so empty and helpless!

The deep night, can it give people a huge amount of contemplation and memories? I asked myself, will the events of distant years all return to my mind at this moment?

The night cat is just calling wildly, and the fleas are just filling my body. However, can the memories of the early years really search for its shadow and come?

I remember that I was a young singer, right? In those years, didn't I spend my time singing moving tunes?

However, none of these are worth people's nostalgia. What is forever engraved in people's minds is still the song of liberation that fills the streets.

Isn't it? On the night of victory, we who were always filled with enthusiasm for the South, didn't we rush into the lively streets for the victory report of Taierzhuang that was spread by the wind?

At that time, passionate young people? Patting shoulders, stepping on feet, singing loudly, passers-by opened their smiling iron faces and turned to us.

Now, although the night is obscured, the road of my memory, however, the current dawn is the most beautiful color!

### The Muddy Waves of the Haihe River

— Xianghou

This is a letter from Englishman A in Tianjin to Englishman B in Shanghai. B is my friend, and with his permission, I am able to translate and publish a section of the letter about Tianjin. But he refused to publish his real name, so they are only referred to as A and B here.

In Shanghai, the air is still relatively fresh, although we have felt suffocation: but in Tianjin, this ancient city, only the muddy waves of the Haihe River can freely surge. As a foreigner, it is not easy for me to obtain the same preferential treatment here as in other parts of China. Sure enough, we also have our concessions here, but the situation is ten times worse than in Shanghai. The concessions are also like the Haihe River, overflowing with muddy currents.

When I first arrived here, it was like a prisoner arriving at the courtroom. The interrogation was extremely strict, and after seeing the "little ghosts", I had to see the "gods"—the so-called "little ghosts" and "gods" are popular slang in Tianjin. "Gods" refer to the Japanese, and "little ghosts" are self-evident. —In the past few days, it seems that my actions have been under surveillance at all times. Later, I specially visited a Chinese friend I knew in Harbin, who has a not very unfamiliar name: "Tao Yanxin" (transliteration). He was once detained by the young general Zhang Xueliang, but now he is here as an educational administrator. I haven't seen him for many years, and this middle-aged politician has grown a Nazi-style beard. I know that his past years have been spent on "good deeds", and now he seems to have partially succeeded; but his position is always faltering as if in a dream. The "little ghosts" in the north—I'm afraid it's not just in the north—on the one hand have to be suspected by the suspicious "gods", and on the other hand have to take into account the attention of the children who grow up in this land.

The greatest danger for Chinese in Tianjin is the issue of thought. "Thought criminals" are almost impossible to accommodate in prisons. Because the so-called thought criminals have a very broad meaning. A Chinese accountant was arrested by the police for drawing a plum blossom under a circle. According to the painter, the circle symbolizes the moon, and Chinese people usually draw plum blossoms with the moon. However, the Japanese said that the circle symbolizes the sun, and the plum blossom is the national flower set by the Chiang government!

Here, the Japanese who serve as police in China use the number of their compatriots arrested as the standard for promotion. Therefore, the police in Tianjin are busy with the sole duty of arresting people all day long. Often when two policemen meet, they ask each other: "How much gold did you find today?" Gold has become a synonym for criminals! However, the police in Tianjin often become other people's "gold" when they perform their duties at night!

Here, there are many burning incidents, and the places where the fires start mostly belong to a certain party's property. As for the cause of the fire, even the parties involved avoid it like the plague!

Economic plunder can be said to be thorough here, and you can see their means of extortion here.

### Throwing Herself Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—Still a Story of a Girl—

She seemed to hear those pleading and weak words again!

"Qingzhi, are you just leaving home like this?"

"Why not? I think all young people no longer need to stay here. I have to work, otherwise I will be bored to death."

"I understand what you mean, but I don't believe that a weak woman like you can do much. Of course, I don't look down on you, but I think your family needs you more, and me, I need you more."

"Hum, if the whole nation does not exist, what is the use of the family? What is the use of the relationship between you and me? Don't try to dissuade me anymore."

"Of course I will remember you. Naturally, I also hope that on the day of victory, I will see you come back healthy. I know I am useless, but my heart is good for you..."

So her mind flashed through such a delicate face again. Under those deep eyes, hung two lines of tears; a thin and long figure, shaking as if sinking into the noisy crowd, sinking into the vast and boundless sea...

"Now I am really alone, without any worries, without any emotional burden. I should dedicate my life to the revival of the whole nation."

The night didn't know whether it was hanging down from the top of the sky or pulled up from all around. It enveloped everything. The dark clouds were blocking, there was no moon and no stars, and the boat continued to break through in the darkness, increasing the fear of the person who was sailing for the first time.

She seemed to have slept for a while and then turned over, and hurriedly turned on the light. Only then did she know that the dream was not real. The narrow wooden bed made her waist and legs ache, and the sound of the sea waves was even louder. It seemed that there was a storm falling from the sky, and she naturally thought of some terrible scenes; she pushed Jingwen who was sleeping below with her hand; but she didn't wake up at all, and was still sleeping sweetly. She put on her clothes alone, put on her coat, and ran to the deck.

The darkness that could not distinguish anything was squeezing all around, and the blurred light on the top of the mast was shaking as if it was there or not. There was no green sea water, no snow-white waves, and no wind and rain, just darkness and darkness. Suddenly, several strong lights came from afar, shooting towards this ship from different directions. Suddenly, the sea water was sparkling, and everything on the deck was illuminated very clearly. A crew member came out of the cabin and said to her:

"Miss, please don't stand outside. This is the searchlight of the Japanese warship. I'm afraid of causing any trouble."

"Okay, I'll go down."

As she spoke, she walked back again, losing her fear, but giving rise to unparalleled anger. She knew that if China had a decent navy, the Japanese would not be able to set foot on Chinese soil first. But now on the land, in the air, we have done our best; at sea, we have to let the enemy run rampant.

Four days of sailing took them to a new and unfamiliar place. When they entered the port, they stopped in the sea, and there was no berthing or a small boat to pick up passengers, which made them two unfamiliar travelers. They were even more worried. When they asked others, they found out that they had to go through a quarantine procedure before they could go ashore.

"Then what should we do? They said they would come to pick us up." (To be continued)

### × Blockade of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, Hong Kong's Freight Transportation Greatly Affected, Wenzhou as an Important Port for Import to Hong Kong After the War of Resistance, Goods from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi are Concentrated Here for Export

× After falling into Shantou, they attempted to invade Fuzhou in Fujian and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, two trading ports, resulting in a sudden interruption of traffic between the two ports and Hong Kong. Since the year-long War of Resistance, Wenzhou has been one of the most important ports for the export of goods to Hong Kong from the central provinces of China, so in the future, Hong Kong's foreign trade will suffer another serious blow.

Freight Transportation from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi Cut Off

After the fall of coastal trading ports such as Qingdao, Shanghai, and Xiamen, only Wenzhou and Fuzhou maintained freight traffic with Hong Kong. Fuzhou is 445 miles away from Hong Kong, and Wenzhou is to the north of it. Shipping companies in Hong Kong that have ships traveling on this route include Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Chee Shun. In terms of freight transportation, goods from Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces are concentrated in these two ports for export to Hong Kong and transshipment overseas, especially Wenzhou. Each ship traveling on this line, traveling south to Hong Kong, must be fully loaded with wood oil, tea, and minerals, of which tea is the most. After the War of Resistance, these two ports accounted for an important part of the figures for Hong Kong's trade with China. Now that it is × blocked, Hong Kong's foreign trade will be destroyed.

Telegraph and Exchange to Hong Kong Still Open

Currently, telegraph transmission between Hong Kong and Fuzhou and Wenzhou is still as usual, which shows that the two ports are currently safe. As for exchange, banks also handle transactions as usual. Currently, among the coastal ports of our country that are still in our hands, only Beihai remains, and it is still sailing as usual. Recently, × has opened the port, and Taikoo's Suiyang will sail from Hong Kong for the first time today. We will observe the situation later and consider dispatching ships to travel.

Since the Women's Military Disaster Association launched the fundraising for standard national flags, various tasks have been actively carried out. It is reported that Cantonese opera master Xin Liangjiu (Guan Dexing) heard the news of the association's flag donation and fundraising, and expressed great sympathy. He wanted to make a large donation to help the country in distress, but due to being unemployed for a long time and the environment not allowing it, he was forced to pawn a box of his valuable theater costumes, which were tools for making a living, and obtained $150 to send to the Military Disaster Association to buy a standard national flag. The association deeply admires Guan's sincere patriotism and sent a letter to hire Guan as the chief flag donation leader. Guan also felt that it was his duty and readily took on the arduous task. The association is deeply grateful for having him and expects to achieve good results. The flag donation team is scheduled to assemble at the association at 9 am this morning for departure.

### Assisting in Maintaining Public Order, Continue to Recruit Auxiliary Police, Auxiliary Police Patrol the City, Petty Thieves Disappear, Hope to Enthusiastically Participate in Seeking Happiness for the Public

Recently, in various districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories, bandits have been rampant and robberies have occurred frequently. In order to maintain public order in the urban areas, the police authorities, in addition to ordering their officers to strictly investigate and arrest bandits, have also dispatched auxiliary police to patrol the urban areas and assist in maintaining public order. It is estimated that since the mobilization of the auxiliary police, petty thieves have disappeared and the results have been very excellent. In order to strengthen the police force, the authorities are still continuing to recruit auxiliary police.

According to a certain officer of the auxiliary police, the police authorities are actively recruiting auxiliary police to assist in maintaining public order in order to maintain social peace. As of today, the number of auxiliary police has increased to 160. In the past ten years, the number of auxiliary police in Hong Kong has not exceeded 100, and there has been a considerable increase. Recruitment is still continuing, and the more people, the better. The qualifications for applying are generally (1) Fluent in English, able to speak fluent English, (2) Strong physique, (3) Noble character and able to endure hardship. After being admitted, they must enter the police academy for one year of training. The training subjects are (A) Gymnastics, (B) Learning police law, (C) Practicing shooting, (D) Using gas masks.

Currently, because it is in a special period, the auxiliary police have been dispatched to patrol the city for many months, every evening from 8 pm to 12 pm. The gymnastics item has been temporarily canceled. Since the auxiliary police have been patrolling, petty thieves have disappeared, and robberies have rarely occurred, which has greatly helped the regular police. The authorities are still continuing to recruit auxiliary police. It is hoped that our compatriots in Hong Kong will enthusiastically sign up to join. Because the residents of Hong Kong, especially our compatriots, are in the absolute majority, although joining the auxiliary police is to serve the Hong Kong government in their work, it is actually to protect our compatriots and seek happiness for the public. This is what our compatriots hope for.

Since the fall of Guangzhou, telecommunications traffic between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been interrupted. After Guangzhou was captured by ×, business, economic and all other relations with Hong Kong have been severed.

The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau
　　Publishes Letter to Relatives of Overseas Chinese
　　National Postal Savings are Safe and Reliable
　　Overseas Chinese Love Their Motherland and Are Happy to Save
　　The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau recognizes that the number of our compatriots scattered overseas is enormous, and that they remit tens of millions annually back to their hometowns. The overseas Chinese community lacks a specific savings institution, so we are publishing a letter to the relatives of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, advising them to use the postal savings service, stating that "Our country's post offices have been providing savings services for over twenty years. Offices are located throughout the country, and savings are becoming increasingly safe and reliable. People nationwide are happy to save. Postal savings are divided into three types: passbook, children's, and fixed-term. Passbook savings require a minimum deposit of one national currency unit to open an account, with an annual interest rate of 4.5%. Children's savings require one yuan to open an account with an annual interest rate of 5%. There are also savings stamps in denominations of five cents and ten cents, which can be purchased and affixed to special grid paper provided by the post office. Once one yuan is accumulated, it can be deposited into an account to earn interest. Fixed-term savings require a minimum deposit of fifty yuan, with a term of six months at an annual interest rate of 5%, one year at 6%, and two years or more at 7%. Our overseas Chinese compatriots have a close relationship with postal savings and remittances services and trust them deeply. For example, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances paid out by post offices in Fujian and Guangdong provinces reaches tens of millions of yuan annually. Their enthusiasm for loving their motherland and trusting the post office is evident. Many use these remittances to support their families, while others accumulate them for investment. Since overseas Chinese entrust our country's post office to handle their remittances back home, they would surely be pleased to save their money in the post office as well. Therefore, after relatives of overseas Chinese receive remittances at the post office, they can open a savings account with the post office for any funds that are not immediately needed. When funds are needed in the future, they can be withdrawn from the post office at any time. When collecting remittances, simply sign the remittance slip and submit it to the post office to be credited to the account. The procedures are simple and the security is solid. Interest can be earned and the risk of theft is avoided. The post office is thinking of the relatives of overseas Chinese and offers this sincere advice."

Fundraising Performance for the Women's War Relief Association
　　The China Salvation Dramatic Troupe's Farewell Contribution
　　Choi Chak
　　Rehearsing Three Great Plays to be Performed at Lee Theatre This Weekend
　　Special Article by Our Newspaper
　　"Bravo! Another one!"
　　-- This is the unanimous cheer from the audience after the China Salvation Dramatic Troupe's public performance. This enthusiastic cheer is not frivolous nor is it of low taste; rather it is the sincere, tragic, and impassioned cry from the heart after receiving the cleansing of the great nation and answering the call of the rising dramatic arts.

　　Truth be told: the China Salvation Troupe has been excited, comforted, and supported by the great outpouring of compatriotic love over the past twenty-odd months of arduous and difficult life.

　　To satisfy the demands of those who missed out on the performances and the sincere invitations from various groups, "China Salvation" had already decided to perform on a large scale in Kowloon, just like at Lee Theatre. However, good things are often beset by obstacles, and no matter how they tried, they could not find a vacant theatre. Furthermore, the troupe was about to leave the country, so they could not delay their stay in Hong Kong for too long. Therefore, the wish to perform in Kowloon had to be abandoned with regret.

　　Now, the troupe's departure procedures have been completed, but the ship's departure date has not yet arrived. They still have a short time to stay in Hong Kong. Ms. Liu Qingxuan, the organizer of the China Women's War Relief Association, is enthusiastic about saving the country and is also astute and capable. Seizing this opportunity, she specially invited China Salvation to put on a farewell charity performance before leaving the country, in order to raise funds to help wounded soldiers and refugees. This also compensates for the regret of not being able to perform in Kowloon.

　　Speaking of the "China Salvation Troupe" and the China Women's War Relief Association, there is also a "marriage" worth introducing:
　　When the "China Salvation" traveled from Shaoguan to Shantou, the Fourth War Zone Command sent a escort, and that ambulance happened to be donated by the Hong Kong China Women's War Relief Association. Therefore, the troupe was already grateful to the Women's War Relief Association on their way to Hong Kong. Because of its concern for the country, the China Women's War Relief Association treated the "China Salvation," which came from the front lines, with special courtesy. After the "China Salvation" arrived in Hong Kong, they first held a grand tea party to welcome them and show their appreciation for their hard work. They also planned to cooperate in fundraising for disaster relief. However, due to the organization of a charity performance by young ladies from prominent families, they were unable to manage both, so they proposed that the United Relief Association invite "China Salvation" to perform a charity performance, which is the origin of China Salvation's previous charity performance at Lee Theatre.

　　This time, the Women's War Relief Association has set the time for China Salvation's farewell charity performance on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd for three consecutive nights at Lee Theatre.
　　The plays to be performed are great new plays adapted by China Salvation. The first night, "By the Yongding River" is a collective creation of the National Dramatists Association after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7th ignited the flames of the War of Resistance. The original play is divided into three acts. After several performances by "China Salvation" and revisions, a prologue was added, which was changed from a famous symbolic play to "Strange Old Man," making the content more complete. The whole play is tense and passionate, and the scenery and lighting are also designed to be as good and beautiful as possible.
　　The second night will feature "The Calamity of the Earth," which consists of four independent plays. "Surviving Death" and "The Ghost's Night Cry" have already won the audience's praise in the previous "Protecting Our Motherland" performance and need no further description. As for "Pregnant Woman" and "The Roar of the Yangtze River," they should be reported to the readers.

　　"Pregnant Woman" was written by Zhang Min and adapted by Jin Shan. The plot depicts the tragic situation of pregnant women in the occupied areas. The degree of cruelty involves robbers dissecting pregnant women with sharp knives to determine whether the fetus is male or female, using it as a gambling game.

　　During performances in the war zone, some real pregnant women were deeply moved but dared not watch to the end, leaving in fear. From this, we can further understand the immense power of drama's propaganda.

　　"The Roar of the Yangtze River" is an opera written by Tian Han. The content is also very tense and lively. In the entire "Calamity of the Earth," it will surely tell the audience more touching and vivid facts.

　　The tragic passion and greatness of the third night's "Blood Splatters on Peach Blossoms" are probably already familiar to the audience and need no introduction.
　　For this performance by "China Salvation," all the scenery, lighting, props, and costumes are specially made for these plays. In addition to the several thousand yuan spent on the previous performance, more than a thousand yuan has been added (still volunteered by the troupe). Its grandeur and splendor go without saying. All three plays are directed by the troupe leader Jin Shan. Reporters saw them sweating profusely under the scorching heat yesterday rehearsing the scenery. The lighting is also being handled by the talented Lu Fu, Shen Yan, Xiao Ziying, Liu Yingfeng, and others with a fighting spirit, applying it to their entire lives. They have been working overnight lately and have almost completed it. When the performance comes, it will surely be another resounding success. It is heard that the troupe will take a ship to the Philippines after this performance and then travel to the Americas to promote their cause.

Rumors that Annam's Haiphong and Kwangchowan
　　Will Restrict Transit and Entry
　　Requires Guarantees from Businesses or Cash Deposits for Landing
　　However, No Reports Received Regarding Hong Kong
　　Since South China has suffered from enemy invasion, inland transportation has been severely disrupted. Those wishing to travel to Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan mostly go to Haiphong first and then return to China. Due to the war in South China, many people are unable to make a living and are seeking opportunities abroad, so the journey south is endless. The areas of Haiphong and Kwangchowan in Vietnam have suddenly become transportation hubs. Not only has the number of travelers increased sharply, but also the demand for goods from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces uses French territories as transit routes. Yesterday, it was rumored that the Vietnamese authorities had issued new regulations with strict restrictions. Anyone entering Kwangchowan after July 1, whether for transit or long-term residence, must first find a substantial and formal business to provide a guarantee before being allowed to land. If someone is only transiting and cannot obtain a guarantee from a business, they must pay a deposit of one hundred French Indochinese piastres, which will be refunded upon departure. This rule will be enforced uniformly in all French territories such as Haiphong and Kwangchowan in Vietnam. After this news spread, merchants and travelers paid close attention. The visa offices of diplomatic missions stationed in Hong Kong and the French Consulate all said that they had not received any notification and had not heard of it. Reporters also inquired among the travel agencies in Hong Kong, and all the inns had not received this notice. According to the manager of the French postal ship company, the company had not received any notification regarding this matter. It is said that "July 1st" is still several days away, and if the French government implements this new rule for foreign visitors, the company will receive formal notification in advance.

Mei Lin Yin He Poetry Society
　　To Hold a Large-Scale Debt Burning
　　Since the Mei Lin Yin He Poetry Society launched the debt-burning movement last year, the society has built the first furnace for burning debts. For this year's second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the poets continue to solicit poems, but the restrictions are quite strict, and poems that do not benefit history will not be recorded. A large-scale debt-burning ceremony will also be held on that day. Whether or not they are members of the society, those who wish to burn debts must send the bond number, quantity, name, address, and a brief history of the debt burner to Hong Kong Post Office Box "1176" six days in advance, so that it can be reported and announced. On that day, the poets will also skip lunch and use the money to buy bonds. A vegetarian group dinner will be held in the evening, costing one yuan per person. The surplus funds will be used to purchase public bonds. Poets from outside the society are welcome to participate.

Zhongda Service Corps
　　To Publish Battlefield Series
　　Since the National Sun Yat-sen University Battlefield Service Corps sent the Dongting Team back to China to serve, it has been very active in carrying out work in both the front and rear areas. It is reported that in addition to publishing the "First Year of Work" report, which reports on the work experience in the front and rear areas over the past year, the corps is now compiling and publishing the first volume of the Battlefield Series, which includes "A Record of Conscription in the Second Army Group," "One Year's Digest" (two volumes), "Speeches on Farmers and the War of Resistance," and "One Month in Dongjiang." Each issue or piece of work is systematically discussed. Part of the printing cost has been approved by the university authorities, with a subsidy of 300 national currency units. The publication date is set for July 7th, as a gift for the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction.

Staff of Registered Overseas Chinese Schools
　　To Hold a Symposium
　　The First Meeting to be Held This Week
　　In the past, to connect the feelings of staff at overseas Chinese schools in Hong Kong and to enhance the cause of overseas Chinese education, it was proposed to organize an association of staff from registered overseas Chinese schools in the country. All the regulations have also been drafted. However, according to recent reports, the organization has undergone some changes. It is said that the organization of the association has been unable to adapt to the actual environment, so the association has been changed to a symposium. It is scheduled to hold the first symposium at a certain hotel this week. According to the reporter's investigation, the registered overseas Chinese schools in the country include Pui Ying, Tung Fong, Tak Ming, Fang Lin, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Ling Dao, Chung Nam, Tao Hsiu, Mei Fang, Southwest, Hua Nan, Far East, Fudan, Si Si, Wah Ying, Zhi Xing, Holy Trinity, Min Fan, Ru Yong, Dao Qun, Zhonghua, Wah Ying Girls' School, Guangdong Affiliated Middle School, Min Da Affiliated Middle School, Xiehe, Pui Ching, Guangdong Accounting, Overseas Chinese, Yang Zhong, Zhen Guang, Pui To, Southern, Guanghua, Lingdong, Han Chi, Xiu, Culture, Lingnan Branch School, Jiujiang, Shidou, Peizhi, Hanhua, Yaozhi, Meihua, Qionghai, Lingda Affiliated Middle School, Practical Accounting, Xinghua, and Zhenzhong. There are a total of 49 schools.

Wang Yunyu Licensed as an Auditor
　　In Hong Kong
　　Wang Yunyu, a registered accountant of the National Government, has recently been licensed as an auditor by the Hong Kong government. According to law, he can be appointed in Hong Kong to audit the accounts of various industrial and commercial organizations, issue certificates, and handle liquidation matters. It is found that Mr. Wang graduated from Jinan University in Shanghai and later entered the graduate school of the University of the Philippines, specializing in accounting. After returning to China, he obtained the accountant's certificate from the National Government and has been practicing as an accountant in the Lixin Accounting Firm in Shanghai and Xiamen for many years, and also served as a lecturer at Jinan University and Xiamen University. According to the record, Mr. Wang is the first Chinese accountant to be licensed as an auditor by the Hong Kong government.

Public Works Department
　　Improves Street Lights
　　Indirectly Suppressing Crime
　　Since the population of Hong Kong has increased sharply, the streets in various districts have become prosperous. The Public Works Department has planned to improve street lights to meet the needs of residents. The first step is to replace the old street lights with new ones to increase the brightness. This has been completed on the Kowloon side, and the construction is also underway on Hong Kong Island. The second step is to increase the number of street lights and improve the lighting positions. The construction project on Des Voeux Road Central to Des Voeux Road East has already started, and many new lights have been added. After the Des Voeux Road East project is completed, the same will be implemented on other roads. Recently, petty theft has been rampant in Hong Kong, and theft cases have occurred from time to time in various alleys and narrow streets. Despite strict patrols, thieves are often able to escape due to uneven lighting. It is hoped that the improved street lighting will increase the brightness in these streets and suppress crime.

After holding out until 6:00 PM, the enemy was finally unable to withstand the attack and retreated in a panic. Our army captured two boxes of enemy military supplies in this battle.

　　Offense in Muzhou Fails
　　At 10:00 AM on the 22nd, three enemy ships, covered by six gunboats, sent dozens of enemy soldiers to invade Muzhou, attempting to land at the Panguhuang area of Haikou, and shelled the coast. Liu's Security Team, in coordination with the local self-defense teams, calmly fought back and held out against the enemy for about two hours. The enemy was ultimately unable to break through our fire net and land, and retreated in a panic.

　　Enemy Deserters Commit Suicide
　　According to another report, on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, three enemy sentries at Huimin Gate and Gangzhou Station in Huicheng committed suicide by cutting their stomachs with bayonets in protest against the warlords' warmongering. The suicide notes addressed to their families were full of sorrow and strongly criticized the enemy warlords. It was also found that the enemy soldiers who have been harassing various lines in recent days have no desire to fight. As soon as they come into contact with our army, they retreat in a panic. On the 20th, when the enemy army was harassing Mulang, they left behind many small leaflets, which said, "Forced to come to China, not of our own volition, please be lenient with our troops."

Enemy in Guangzhou Cannot Sleep or Eat in Peace
　　Holds "Security Movement"
　　Young Men in the City Are Pressured and Flee
　　Shops of All Sizes Are Forced to Resume Business
　　(Dispatch from Guangzhou) The enemy army occupying Guangzhou has recently realized that our plainclothes guerrillas and special operations teams are very active in the city, and that the puppet police in the city are insufficient and their strength is empty. Therefore, many dare not stand guard at night. The enemy chief Ando has decided to strengthen "security." In addition to ordering the enemy gendarmerie to increase the number of gendarmes patrolling the streets of the city day and night to monitor the puppet police, he has also ordered the puppet municipal government to recruit 1,000 more puppet police officers to stand guard and watch closely. The puppet municipal government has decided to conscript young men from merchants in the city for training and assign them to the puppet police. Guangzhou will be divided into five major districts, and young men will be conscripted from each household by district. If no young men are handed over, each household will be required to pay a "security fee" of five yuan, otherwise they will be arrested and severely punished. The puppet municipal government issued a notice on the 15th of this month, ordering all merchants to comply by the end of the month. Currently, young men in the city are fleeing.

　　Encouraging Japanese Merchants to Set Up Shops
　　In order to attempt to prosper Guangzhou, in addition to forcing all shops of all sizes in the city to resume business, the enemy army is also encouraging Japanese merchants to set up shops, holding so-called "commercial loans," and designating Huiai Road Central, Hanmin Road, Xiqiaokou, and Changdi, the most prosperous areas in the city, as "Japanese commercial areas." The enemy dispatches one soldier to each shop in the designated areas to guard against harassment and sabotage by our special operations teams. However, because Japanese merchants are aware that high-quality goods cannot be sold and that our special operations teams and guerrillas appear frequently in the city and are difficult to guard against, many dare not do business.

　　Security Movement Is Strictly Guarded
　　The enemy army in Guangzhou is now coming up with a fantastic idea to hold its so-called "security movement." On the 18th and 19th of this month, the enemy general Ando personally summoned all enemy merchants in the city to announce that the "Imperial Army" and "Gendarmerie" have decided to eliminate "bad elements" in the city within a time limit to ensure the smooth running of business in the future. They also ordered the puppet municipal government to hold a "security movement" in conjunction with the enemy gendarmerie starting from the 20th of this month, in effect implementing a state of emergency in an attempt to reduce the sudden attacks by special operations teams and guerrillas. As a result, the city is filled with military and police, presenting an atmosphere of strict security.

The Xi River Rises Sharply

Due to the impact of the rapid currents, many have been destroyed. Moreover, the high river level threatens to flood the areas southwest of Hekou in Sanshui. Enemy Major Dongtian of Sanshui is very worried and has transported a large amount of English cement, sand, and cement from Guangzhou.

It has been verified that there are more than 200 enemy and puppet troops stationed in Lintou, belonging to the "Araki" unit. Our team first sent more than 40 plainclothes soldiers on the evening of the 21st, who infiltrated and ambushed near the market and the Sanjie Temple. When the enemy soldiers were fast asleep, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy from different directions. The enemy soldiers were awakened and fought back, but they were at a loss. Our team, with a spirit of sacrifice, bravely moved forward and threw hand grenades at the enemy, killing 40 or 50 enemy soldiers.

　　Enemy and Puppet Troops in Chancun Fight Each Other
　　In addition, the number of enemy troops stationed in Chancun is only half that of the puppet troops, and the enemy soldiers oppress and mistreat the puppet troops in many ways. On the 19th at noon, more than 50 puppet troops from the Northeast stole a lot of grain and property in Liubian Township near Chancun. The enemy soldiers discovered this and forced them to share the loot, but the puppet soldiers refused. As a result, a firefight broke out and they chased and attacked each other. Later, the enemy chief in Chancun came out to mediate and stop the fighting. In this battle, a total of more than 30 enemy and puppet troops were killed or injured.
