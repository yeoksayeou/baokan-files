### Editorial: Active Creation

Life is a great struggle, and humanity's responsibility lies in continuous creation and perpetual evolution. Currently, the whole world is at war, and all of humanity is affected by war. If a nation wants to gain independence and freedom, and a people want to secure perpetual survival, they must actively create. This mission of active creation is the responsibility that every citizen bears in this great era.

Creation is not just empty talk; it requires tangible achievements to demonstrate. Therefore, active creation means active work. In the current tense situation, no citizen can be exempt from the duty to work. For example, in the Allied nations, all citizens, regardless of gender, age, or occupational boundaries, must diligently labor in their proper positions. Under the major policy of prioritizing production, key industries such as coal, iron, light metals, shipbuilding, and aircraft have achieved the highest results and the newest creations. The fundamental reason for this is diligent work. In peacetime, a citizen's failure to work only affects their personal advancement; in wartime, a citizen's failure to work can affect the entire national strength. Therefore, the government must be willing to weave (織) [a typo for 視, regard] working for the country as its future, and even more willing to add more work. (The Allied nations, such as Japan, abolishing Sunday rest for all institutions is a further expression of increasing work.) Only with the spirit of active work can new creative achievements be produced.

Creation is not an easy task. Edison said that his inventions were 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. Therefore, creation is a painstaking, time-consuming, and enduring endeavor that requires hard work to succeed. On the path of creation, there are countless difficulties. People with determination and courage can break through them one by one. Only those who can endure hardship can withstand it. Yu the Great's flood control is the best example. Mencius said that Yu was away for eight years, passing his home three times without entering. Mozi said that Yu's calves had no flesh and his shins had no hair. Despite these hardships, he was eventually able to create the most magnificent achievement in Chinese history. All creation must struggle with difficulties; this is a theorem of human history, and historical facts provide countless examples. Now is a great era, and the Greater East Asia War is even more of a period of creation. It will bring about an epoch-making transformation in world history, and the Greater East Asian nations bear the responsibility of creating new life. There are still many difficulties in the war. Those who bear the mission of creation must learn from the spirit of Yu the Great and overcome them step by step. Yu's flood control liberated China from the scourge of floods and established a country. The Greater East Asia War will liberate China from the oppression of Britain and the United States and establish an independent and free nation. If we want to create a permanently independent and free China, we must use the blood and sweat of all our citizens to strive diligently.

Creating a new world is our mission. Identifying work and burying oneself in hard work are the methods of creation. Those who do not work and cannot endure hardship cannot create and will be despised by humanity and will naturally tend toward extinction. Those who are willing to work and endure hardship, advance bravely and respectfully, and establish a permanent and unshakable foundation for the nation and the people. Which to choose, may our citizens deeply reflect.

### Germany's New Weapons: Unmanned Aircraft, Meteor Bombs, Tiger Tanks

After the anti-Axis forces indiscriminately bombed German cities and launched an invasion of Europe, Germany, in retaliation, used various mysterious weapons that greatly terrified the enemy. Among them, the most powerful were the so-called "unmanned aircraft."

Britain first discovered unmanned aircraft on the night of January 14 of this year. On that night, several giant bombs suddenly flew over London and its suburbs, causing significant damage. Affected by this unexpected blow, the city was in a state of considerable chaos. Originally, Britain had established a dense air control surveillance network in the English Channel, but at that time, it was completely unaware of the attacking German aircraft. Therefore, British military observers speculated that Germany was using unmanned aircraft to launch meteor bombs.

### Bombs of Various Colors

According to the British "Daily Mail" in early March of this year, regarding the radio-controlled bombs used by the German army on the Italian front line, it stated: "The tail of the bomb shows a bright light for a moment after launch, probably for ease of radio control when visibility is poor. This red, yellow, or white light, like a shooting star, radiates brightly and glides toward [皂中, literally 'soap center,' possibly a typo for '目標', the target]. When the bomb is near the ground, sparks scatter, like rain. Its explosive power is strong, and the German army does not easily use it except in special combat situations."

The unmanned aircraft imagined by the British side is nine feet long and ten feet wide. The tip of the body is the same as ordinary German bombs. The rear half of the body has a receiving device [州, likely a typo] and aircraft elevators. The electrical equipment used for joints. The wingspan is short, and the true chord is wide and equipped with auxiliary wings. This unmanned aircraft is usually hung under the body of the mother aircraft. It waits until it approaches the target, then it is launched and uses radio control to hit the target. Under the body of the unmanned aircraft is a rocket-type engine that slowly injects propellant gas backward. The mother aircraft stays away from the target, maintaining an altitude of 600 to 1200 meters, manipulating the unmanned aircraft in places where high-altitude guns cannot reach, such as the target city and ships.

Since June 15, Germany has used this type of unmanned aircraft to bomb the coastal area of the British mainland from London to Bristol, an area of 80,000 square kilometers. Fires broke out everywhere in London. The vast British military factory, Woolwich Arsenal, was also hit and caught fire. The British air defense mobilized hundreds of thousands of people, using flares and anti-aircraft guns to defend desperately. On June 19, the German authorities announced: "The German army is attacking London and southern France with a new weapon called 'Danamat Washing Star'. It is not far from the Normandy battlefield, and the new weapon will soon appear." The British side was even more terrified when they heard this. (Translated from the June 18th and 20th issues of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### The Power of the Tiger Tank

The German mechanized units intercepting the Anglo-American landing forces in Western Europe have a well-established reputation for their power. Here is an explanation of the heavy tanks that are their mainstay.

For the anti-Axis landing forces attempting to establish a bridgehead in the Caen area, the German forces under General Rundstedt, with their elite mechanized units... that is, mechanized divisions composed of heavy tanks and heavy tanks...

At the beginning of this great war, the German army achieved lightning victories on the Polish and French fronts by using tank groups.

The German army's powerful heavy tank "Tiger" was born from the valuable experience of the Eastern Front. It weighs 60 tons. The Tiger tank is characterized by its thick armor. It is equipped with a sharp weapon that can crush enemy heavy tanks, namely a cannon with a caliber of 8.8 cm and a barrel length of more than 4.84 meters. Such a long barrel is very disproportionate compared to the vehicle body.

Since 1940, the armor of tanks in various countries has become increasingly thick. The cannons and main parts of American and Soviet heavy tanks are made of 18 cm or 20 cm bulletproof steel. To penetrate this kind of steel plate, the muzzle velocity must be high, so Germany used cannons with very long barrels.

The operational objective of this heavy tank is to defeat the Anglo-American landing forces and annihilate the Anglo-American forces attempting to establish a bridgehead in the coastal area. It is said that super-heavy tanks have appeared in the German mechanized units advancing and retreating in the Caen area. Judging from the fact that the American M21 self-propelled gun is equipped with a 15 cm howitzer, it is at least equipped with a 15 cm cannon.

However, the vehicle body of these super-heavy tanks is very heavy. If the problem of manufacturing endless tracks that can withstand this weight and withstand the impact of uneven ground is not resolved, then the mainstay of the mechanized division will probably still be the 60-ton Tiger heavy tank.

At the beginning of this great war, the German army gathered 45,000 tanks and automobiles in the Western battlefield, breaking through the center of the Anglo-French forces and staging the tragedy of Dunkirk. Mechanized divisions with Tiger tanks as their mainstay will also be able to achieve great combat results. (June 10 Asahi Shimbun)

### Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely on Saipan, Tennyo Highlands Are Strongly Defended, Japanese Planes Attack Aslito Enemy Airfield Again

Japanese Army Base, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The decisive battle between Japanese and American forces on Saipan Island is intensifying. Relying on massive amounts of material and under the cover of artillery, enemy troops are attacking Japanese positions day and night. Japanese troops are still fighting alone [孤軍奮戰] and bravely carry out night attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 21st that since the US military began landing, it has lost 9,752 men. This loss is more than three times the loss at Tarawa. From the 23rd to the 26th, the unit led by Lieutenant Otake in the high ground southwest of Mount Tapochau destroyed six enemy pursuit guns and eight platoons of soldiers (approximately 120 men). On the 26th, Lieutenant Otake led a suicide squad of 14 men, broke through the enemy lines, bypassed the enemy defense lines, and attacked the enemy command post located around the high ground, defeating 150 enemy guards and destroying the command post. In addition, in order to compensate for the heavy losses after landing, the US military reinforced a large number of tanks, attempting to break through the Japanese First Platoon on the western high ground of Mount Tennyo, but failed. On the 28th, five enemy tanks and three artillery pieces were destroyed in this area, so the enemy's attempt to advance north of Mount Tennyo has become a bubble.

Tokyo, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. A certain Japanese army base in the central Pacific, Second Day Telegram: Japanese aircraft formations attacked Aslito enemy airfield on Saipan Island again on the night of the first day and bombed it severely, destroying five enemy aircraft parked on the ground. In addition, nine enemy military facilities were hit, causing a major fire. On the same day, another formation of Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy ships off Saipan Island.

### Japanese Troops Attack Hengyang City from Three Directions, Military Facilities Bombarded with Heavy Artillery

Guangzhou, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese troops have taken control of the Chongqing army airfield east of Hengyang and are now fiercely attacking the remaining Chongqing troops entrenched in Hengyang city, making a final resistance. The Chongqing Military Commission issued a war situation communiqué on the first day, stating that fierce fighting is still taking place in the suburbs of Hengyang. With reinforcements from powerful units, Japanese troops are constantly bombarding military facilities in Hengyang city with heavy artillery. Japanese infantry units have begun attacking Hengyang from the south, north, and west, with the most intense attacks occurring in the southwestern suburbs. Japanese troops have broken into the Hengyang city defense line in several places, and Chongqing troops have suffered heavy losses. Japanese troops are still actively attacking.

### Japanese Troops Advance Southward Along the Yuehan Line

Guangzhou, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese troops are advancing rapidly southward along the Yuehan Railway from the north and have now reached Hengyang. Another unit of Japanese troops has crossed Hengyang and is continuing to advance southward along the railway. As a result, most of the Yuehan Railway, which stretches 2,000 kilometers and connects Wuchang and Guangzhou, is under Japanese control. Hengyang is a key point in the central section of the Yuehan Railway. Losing Hengyang means losing not only the entire Yuehan Railway. Recently, the Chongqing side has had to admit its importance. American news agencies have also commented on the importance of Hengyang, saying that the Japanese army is about to open up the Yuehan Line. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 23rd reported that the Japanese army began its Hunan campaign on May 27 and advanced 250 kilometers in just four weeks, advancing from Yueyang to Hengshan. Currently, 300 kilometers of the Yuehan Line between Hengshan and Shaoguan is still in the Chongqing [遇見, likely a typo for 渝方, Chongqing] 's control. Chongqing [有　者, likely a typo for 有識者, knowledgeable people] speculate that the Japanese troops will further advance southward from Hengguan to open up the Yuehan Line. A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 24th also reported that if Japan seizes Hengyang and continues to advance southward, the entire Yuehan Line will be under Japanese control. The current situation is not optimistic. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th excerpted an essay published by Liu Weizhang, Deputy Minister of the Military Command Department of the Chongqing Military Commission, in the Saodang Newspaper as follows: "The Japanese army's attempt to open up the Yuehan Line is certain and undoubted. Opening up the Yuehan Line will be quite difficult, but this move will make Chongqing even poorer." On the same day, an Associated Press dispatch excerpted an editorial from the China Times as follows: "The Japanese army will soon open up the Yuehan Line. If this move can be realized, it can be said that the Japanese army has achieved its purpose." From this, it can be seen that Chongqing believes that Japan is planning to open up the Yuehan Line.

### Japanese Troops Shoot Down Many American Planes

Hunan Japanese Army Front Line, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The activities of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing in Hunan and its battles with Japanese ground units are now intensifying. For example, on the 27th of last month, American planes engaged in a decisive battle with Japanese ground units southeast of Liling. During the battle, two planes were shot down by Japanese troops. At noon on that day, 13 American P-40s appeared while Japanese troops were advancing southeast of Liling and continuously strafed the ground. Japanese troops immediately returned fire with rifles. In an instant, one plane had both wings hit, black smoke billowed, and it crashed into the mountain in front of the area. Another plane was also hit and smoking, and it crashed into a nearby river. The entire engagement lasted five minutes.

### Chongqing Troops Suffer Annihilating Blow

Hunan Japanese Army Front Line, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. After capturing Zhuzhou on the 14th, Japanese troops surrounded the Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army, which was retreating from the area, near Lukou in Zhuzhou and completely annihilated it. In this battle, Gan Jingsheng, commander of the Provisional 8th Division of Chongqing, was killed in action near Lukou. In addition, more than 320 senior Chongqing army officers (including approximately 20 field officers) were killed in action, causing the Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army to suffer an annihilating blow. The Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army is a direct line army of Xue Yue and is the core force of the Chongqing 9th War Zone.

### Xiang Japanese Army Completes Capture Strategy

A Certain Japanese Army Unit on the Hunan Front Line, A Certain Base, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The Japanese army's capture strategy of Changsha was a rare success in military history. At the beginning of the capture strategy, the Japanese army's boat unit sailed upstream along the Xiang River, breaking through the obstacles laid by the Chongqing army. At the same time, thanks to the boat unit's brave fighting? the artillery unit under Yuelu Mountain also advanced bravely. Therefore, the boats became the foothold of the combat army and bore the important task of supplying the rear. Moreover, due to continuous rainy days, the roads were muddy and difficult to travel, and the artillery unit could only advance by water. However, the Chongqing army had also laid underwater mines on the waterways, making navigation extremely dangerous. However, Captain Sawai of the Japanese army's boat unit personally led twelve Tenma boats and advanced along the waterway to Changsha. Several of them hit underwater mines and were destroyed immediately, but Captain Sawai's team immediately launched a torpedo attack, resulting in the completion of the great feat of breaking through underwater mines. As a result, the artillery unit landed at its destination and suppressed the Chongqing army's mountain positions. Furthermore, the boat unit's brave fighting was not limited to this point. It also made great contributions to the logistical support of the army. The supply for this operation was carried out entirely by water, but it was not easy to do so because enemy planes were constantly scouting. Moreover, due to a shortage of ships, thousands of civilian ships were mobilized. Fortunately, with the assistance of the Chinese people, who shared the responsibility of transporting supplies, it was a great success. In this transport mission, the civilian ships completed their mission under the bombing of Chongqing planes.

Furthermore, Ba Maw, the National Representative, is quite friendly with Bose, the head of Free India. Representative Ba Maw once said that without India's independence, there would be no Myanmar's independence. From this, it can be seen the closeness of the relationship between the two.

### Complete Destruction of Harbor Facilities

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German frontline military reporter reported on the destruction of the Cherbourg harbor facilities as follows: The iron and concrete pillars of the wharf station were completely destroyed using 800 kg of explosives for each. To destroy the French docks, a ditch 2.5 meters wide and 15 meters deep was dug along the entire bridge. In addition, two freight cars fully loaded with landmines were pulled to the front of the station and detonated, causing all the stone materials to collapse into the turning basin. Furthermore, a 10,000-ton freighter was scuttled at the entrance of the turning basin to block it. For the breakwater, in addition to installing landmines at its base, it was also bombed from below with landmines. The gate of the large dock for accommodating ships has been shattered. Cranes, warehouses, etc., have also been blown to pieces. The Cherbourg harbor facilities have been completely destroyed by such blasting and sinking methods. It will take the enemy a considerable amount of time to restore them in the future. Especially since the difference between high and low tides in the Cherbourg harbor is usually ten meters, it will be even more difficult for them to transport weapons, land, or conduct reorganization and aftercare.

### No Significant Changes in Commodity Prices Last Week

There were no significant changes in commodity prices last week. The market prices of a few essential items were relatively high due to smooth sales and sluggish supply. However, there was little demand for non-essential items, and the business transactions in the retail shops were very light. According to people in the industry, these items were previously handled by vendors from various provinces, but in recent years, due to the difficulty of transportation by land and water, even small-scale vendors are hesitant to proceed and have shifted their focus to the sale of essential commodities such as food, fuel, cooking oil, and daily necessities. The economic authorities are still actively conducting investigations, and anyone who violates economic regulations will be punished in accordance with the rules, either with fines or suspension of business.

### Commentary: The Tragic Ferry Accident at Gao Miao Wharf

The tragic ferry accident at Gao Miao Wharf in the Huangpu River, Pudong, on the morning of June 26th, in which passengers were drowned, has been reported in this newspaper. The sinking of a small boat in the Huangpu River, with more than a dozen casualties, may seem like a trivial matter, but it is worth discussing for three reasons:

The boat was a small, privately-owned craft used exclusively to ferry workers of the Yufeng Textile Mill at the wharf, but it did not have a permit from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for operating in the Huangpu River, nor did it join the Ferry Industry Association. It was clearly an illegal ferry. It is obvious that it was not an isolated incident for someone to ferry passengers on the Huangpu River without a permit from the government and to make a business of ferrying workers across the river. Why hadn't the competent authorities discovered it, or if they had, why had they tacitly permitted it under certain conditions? One of these must be the case. It can be seen that the boat owner dared to conceal his actions and act recklessly, leading to overloading without anyone questioning it. The responsible authorities cannot shirk their responsibility.

Passengers rushed to board the boat, crowding the deck before the ferry had come to a complete stop. Fearing an accident, the boat owner hastily steered the boat away from the dock, but the passengers had not yet settled down, and the boat was overloaded, causing it to lose balance and capsize. One can imagine the chaotic scene at the time. The passengers' failure to maintain order and their ignorance of the benefits of mutual assistance made it difficult for them to absolve themselves of the responsibility for the disaster.

With the above two internal defects and the high tide and rapid current, the tragedy was unavoidable. Recalling the accident involving the Huatai Wheel at Xingang on December 9th of last year, the severity of the matters may have been slightly different, but the main causes of the tragedy were the same. It must be understood that safety is paramount in the transportation industry, especially in passenger transport, and the guarantee of safety is the joint responsibility of the competent authorities, the personnel in charge, and the passengers. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the past cannot be undone. It is hoped that after repeatedly undergoing profound lessons, everyone will be vigilant to prevent future problems.

Whether the matter is significant or trivial, the principle is the same. In a country where government officials neglect their duties and in a society where the masses are chaotic and compete for resources, few can escape annihilation in the face of external disasters. The tragic ferry accident at Gao Miao Wharf is another example of a microcosm following the Huatai Wheel accident. Do not ignore it because it is trivial!
