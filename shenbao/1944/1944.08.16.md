### Regarding the New Japanese Cabinet

Question: Since the establishment of the Koiso cabinet, general opinion holds that it will not have a particularly special impact on the overall situation in East Asia and is merely a successor to the policies of the Tojo cabinet. Is this viewpoint correct?

Answer: Our countrymen often engage in various speculations regarding the changes in the Japanese cabinet. This stems from a complete lack of understanding of Japan. Since the issuance of the declaration of war, there has been no room for discussion of Japan's national policy; it has been solely focused on defeating Britain and America. Therefore, it is correct to say that the Koiso cabinet is a successor to the policies of the Tojo cabinet. However, it would be a grave error to mistakenly believe that the Koiso cabinet is identical to the Tojo cabinet.

Question: In what ways, then, does the Koiso cabinet differ from the Tojo cabinet?

Answer: The Koiso cabinet is a cabinet that has risen to undertake an extraordinary mission, adapting to the international war entering a decisive stage. It seeks to further mobilize the nation's total strength to achieve final victory. Therefore, it first emphasizes the reorganization of national organizations, namely, through the so-called "national consensus formation" and "unification of national political entities," so that all citizens, during this time of national destiny, can unanimously rise up with their loyalty and enthusiasm, on the front lines of the decisive battle, alongside the soldiers, to protect the motherland and defend East Asia.

Question: The so-called "powerful national cabinet" probably refers to this, but what are its specific contents?

Answer: The reorganization of national organizations begins with realizing a political organization of one country, one party, so that the only existing political association—the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會)—and the "public service association"—the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society (翼贊會)—can more effectively assume the task of uniting the government and the people. It also involves organizing the entire lives of the people in the three areas of military production, distribution, and consumption, absolutely subordinating private interests to public duty, obeying orders like soldiers, and completing the victory of the war with a spirit of martyrdom.

Question: The ultimate goal of enhancing this popular fighting spirit and unifying the government and the people is, of course, to achieve victory in the decisive battle. But while spiritual strength is important, the significance of material resources cannot be ignored!

Answer: Precisely because Japan's current enemies boast of materialism to the world, the second mission of the Koiso cabinet is to concentrate its power on uplifting fighting spirit and increasing production through complete unity between command and state affairs, especially focusing on strengthening key production and unifying the administration of weapons production. The concrete strategy is to reform the Ministry of Munitions, achieve consistent cooperation among the military, government, and people, and establish a decisive production system that unifies both political and war efforts, making the Ministry of Munitions not only a ministry for aircraft production but a comprehensive ministry for increasing the production of aircraft, warships, and land weapons. At the same time, it will establish a model factory system, implement production guidance, and, based on a labor command organization, establish a labor management system, implement a key industry personnel system, and mobilize technicians, aiming to complete the so-called "sure-win production strategy" as soon as possible.

Question: The content of the so-called "sure-win production strategy" that unites the military, government, and people is as you describe, but demanding its thorough implementation seems to be an internal affairs issue.

Answer: That's right. Therefore, the third mission of the Koiso cabinet is to thoroughly reform domestic administration. The current internal affairs issues in Japan involve adapting to the demands of warfare, focusing on increasing aircraft production, ensuring the increased production of major food supplies, materials, labor, and transportation, and thus carrying out an extraordinary mobilization of all domestic institutions and talent. All of this depends on the government's strong political power to thoroughly implement various important policies. Therefore, on the one hand, efforts must be devoted to thoroughly reforming central politics, with the newly appointed Minister of Home Affairs as the core, working in collaboration with the ministries of the military, health, agriculture and commerce, transportation, education, and the Information Bureau to implement national comprehensive armament arrangements in the areas of labor, production, transportation, communication, propaganda, food, health, and the general public, thereby realizing a fundamental reform of domestic administration.

Question: If the reform of central politics is like this, what about local administration?

Answer: Regarding Japan's local administrative system, there have been repeated improvements in recent years. Among the most important is the Local Administrative Council, originally a strong wartime organization connecting officials and civilians, as well as local and central governments. In the past year, Japan has vigorously expanded the authority of local administration, especially with economic controls, mining, forestry, and maritime transport gradually being transferred to local management. In addition to maintaining this new system, the new cabinet will further establish a "道州制 (Dōshū-sei, regional administrative division system) broad-area administration," strengthen the authority of the Local Council, and strengthen local administrative organizations in order to closely connect the government with the people and to enable local areas to work with the central government to refresh administration, so that production enterprises, economic controls, air defense, and national defense projects can all be promoted according to ideals, jointly striving for the final victory of the decisive battle.

### Mutiny of the American Jungle Warfare Unit in the Vicinity of Myitkyina, Northern Burma; The Reason Being the Failure of the American Military Authorities to Fulfill their Promises

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The mutiny of the American jungle warfare unit in the vicinity of Myitkyina has attracted considerable attention in American public opinion. According to the American Army authorities' announcement on the 13th, the incident occurred due to the failure to fulfill promises that could not be fulfilled without preparation, and did not mention the actual situation of the mutiny. Secretary of War Stimson also did not provide a more detailed explanation, which suggests that this issue will inevitably cause considerable disputes in the future. The jungle warfare unit, which is composed of special volunteers from the so-called "vagabond unit," was ordered to send wounded soldiers to the battlefront during the intense fighting in the Myitkyina area, with the intention of completing their promotion. After the fierce fighting ended, they were supposed to be sent back to their home country, but the promise was not fulfilled, leading to this unstable behavior.

### Japanese Forces Launch a Sweeping Operation Against Areas Surrounding Hengyang and Attack Chinese Positions Northwest of Xiangxiang

A certain Japanese military base on the front lines, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army occupied Chongyang, they carried out a sweeping operation against the Chinese army that attempted to recapture Hengyang and launched a counterattack, and prepared for the second phase of operations. The Chinese army suffered heavy damage due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese army for days. Since the 14th, the fighting in the western and southwestern areas of Hengyang has stopped, and they are currently constructing positions.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 14th that after losing Hengyang, the Chinese army still aimed to retake the city and was currently engaged in fierce fighting in the surrounding areas of Hengyang. The Japanese army attacked the Chinese army several times and repeatedly launched strong assaults south of Hengyang. Another unit of the Japanese army crossed the Xiang River at a location 29 kilometers northwest of Leiyang, attacking the rear of the Chinese army that was attempting to attack Hengyang from the southwest, and launched a sweeping operation. In addition, the Japanese army attacked various Chinese positions northwest of Zhuxiang.

Enemy American Counter-Offensive Wishful Thinking Shattered

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the Japanese army launched operations in Hubei Province on May 27, it has been more than 70 days, during which it launched mobile warfare within the Hunan Province, the strategic center point of the Chinese-American Allied forces, After capturing the two major strongholds of Changsha and Hengyang, the strategic failure of the Chinese-American forces was fundamentally defeated. The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 14th that the damage to the manpower and material resources of the Chinese-American forces during this operation was extremely large. This operation has shattered the enemy's American wishful thinking of launching a counter-offensive against Japan on the Chinese mainland. The great strategic significance lies in this. The enemy has always been trying to drive the Chinese army to launch an offensive against Japan and cooperate with the American air force stationed in China to attack the Japanese army from the east and west. This attempt has already been frustrated by the enemy. Before the Japanese army, it continued to stir up trouble, resulting in a heavy military blow. The situation is truly pitiful. Since the Japanese army withdrew from Guadalcanal, the Chinese side has underestimated the Japanese side and believed that Japan is no longer able to fight against China. After the Henan campaign this spring, there was the war in Hunan, but the Chinese army did not give up its dream of a quick victory, and did not believe that the Japanese army could still attack Hengyang. Its combat guidance was always slow, and once it came into contact with the strong combat power of the Japanese army, it immediately fell into an unrecoverable situation, only increasing losses. As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 14th, in the southeastern region of China, Xue Yue's 30 divisions of the best-equipped troops were defeated by the Japanese army, and the First War Zone of Tang Enbo's army has been wiped out, putting the Chinese side's resistance camp in a desperate situation. In addition to losing the Hunan granary in terms of economy, tax revenue has decreased by about 10%. After losing the railways and river transport, there is no way to use the rice from Jiangxi and the materials from Guangdong and Hubei. Food in the Chongqing area will gradually become insufficient. In addition, the continental war line is long and many admire the strict military discipline of the Japanese army and return one after another. Once preparations are completed and the next phase of operations is launched, the Chinese side's suffering will inevitably deepen.

### Anti-Axis Forces Encircle and Attack Northern France, Increasing Pressure on Argentan

A large number of troops are needed to defend this defense line. General Patton does not have enough troops, and the pincers have not been joined. However, the American army still maintains pressure on Argentan and Falaise. The German reserves are engaged in fierce fighting against General Patton's tank forces. The German forces in Normandy are gradually moving away from the protruding positions, and the rearguard units are engaged in fierce fighting with the American First Army.

Director Liang first reported on the significance of the reception, stating: "Recently, the embezzlement case of the former staff of the First District Public Office Special Tax Office has attracted great attention from all sectors of society, and the public opinion has also continuously expressed opinions, hoping that the municipal authorities will thoroughly investigate the truth of the case. Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau has paid great attention to this and has also made two statements. Today, we are specially inviting you to have Director Yuan give a detailed report on the correct content of the case and the handling process."

Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau Reports

Director Yuan then reported on the revenue and expenditure of the city's finances over the past three years, with the content divided into ten items. The original text is recorded as follows:

There Are Indeed Cases of Investigators Extorting Money

The letter to Mr. Lin Zhefu is an old item from the former Municipal Council. It is said that the delivery to the newspaper office also used the district office's delivery slip, which was probably also an old item. Although the organization of the sections has not yet been revised in accordance with the municipal government's organizational law, the internal structure does not completely use the previous names, mostly using Section Number. The Section A-E mentioned in the letter was what a group of Western staff members used to call them. Since the resignation of more than 40 Western staff members, the names Section A-E have long been unheard of within the sections. There are indeed cases of investigators extorting money from taxpayers who are cheating, but it does not happen every day or in every household. Whenever it is discovered, it is immediately dealt with. There are currently two people detained in the police station. The largest amount of extortion was this time, reported to be 100,000 yuan. Usually, there are no such large amounts, sometimes several hundred to several thousand.

Openly Receiving Rewards is an Open Secret

Merchants buy and sell on the black market and record their accounts at market prices for tax purposes. Investigators use their technical skills to investigate the actual amount of cheating, report it, and determine the amount of the fine, and then take a reward from it. This reward is an open secret among the investigators. The letter probably refers to this when it says that the investigators get 30% and give 70%. This only involves the investigators and their associates, and the section chief does not care, because if they interfere, it is necessary to turn the entire reward over to the government. They do not have to put in the effort to investigate, and they do not want to offend the merchants for nothing, which would reduce the government's revenue. For example, if the actual amount of cheating is found to be 100,000, and the penalty is 200,000, they will add a certain amount of reward. If they are not allowed to solicit rewards, they will not use strict methods to investigate, and they can only obtain evidence of 50,000 yuan in cheating. The fine turned over to the government is only 100,000, which is 100,000 less. There are many examples of this kind of thing, but I will just mention one.

Exhausting All Methods Cannot Eliminate It

It has been impossible to eliminate this kind of bad habit of soliciting rewards even after exhausting all methods. We originally wanted the government to print and issue receipts, but the cost is too high, and most stores do not use receipts, and there are no such personnel to write them. We are now studying how to have a strict system that prevents merchants from evading taxes, so that these investigators will have no way to collect rewards. Are large companies and silk stores cheating? Absolutely not. The business tax in Nanshi and other places is the same, because a collection agency needs at least 20 people, because taxpayers never pay on their own, and they always have to go to their door to collect, and they can't collect it at once. There are many people, and everyone has to supplement their income in addition to their salary to survive. This supplement is the government's loss.

Taxpayers Should Have Civic Virtue

There is no need to elaborate on the rest. In short, the system and the level of the tax collectors are important, and the civic virtue of the taxpayers is even more important. How to train them is our responsibility. The level of the people is not easy to change, and the system needs to be studied. How to train them, I hope everyone will give us guidance and express their opinions at any time. We should accept them and implement them in accordance with the Mayor's orders. The staff handling the 400 million number do not take it seriously and think that this is definitely not the case and are very frank. However, the person in charge cannot but take responsibility, so he first transferred the section chief to another section, waiting for the higher authorities to investigate. If the truth is revealed in the future and there is any malpractice, it will be severely punished and there will be no leniency. If this is not the case, they will definitely not want to suffer this injustice. Since the consumption tax was launched in February, it has collected a total of 760 million yuan, and nearly 400 million yuan has been turned over to the Ministry of Finance, and it is increasing month by month.

### Memorial Service for the Late Minister Zhang; Generous Donations from All Quarters; Funds Collected to Support Education and Social Welfare

The memorial service for the late Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yunbo, initiated by various sectors and groups in the city, is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM on the 18th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Tianhou Palace Bridge. For this memorial service, all condolence gifts will be converted into cash, so that the collected amount can be used to set up scholarships and social welfare undertakings, in line with Zhang's lifelong dedication to self-discipline and his enthusiasm for social welfare. In recent days, donations have been pouring in from all quarters, reflecting the deep and continued inspirational power of Zhang. In addition, anyone who wishes to express their respect for Zhang, whether as a group or individual, is welcome to participate freely. However, schools and groups with large numbers of people can contact the preparatory office for the memorial service at 160 Da Shanghai Road, 3rd floor, in advance. The memorial service will be simple and solemn, and Mr. Wen Lanting has been appointed as the chief mourner, with Li Sihao, Yuan Lüdeng, Lin Kanghou, and Pei Yunqing as the assisting mourners. At that time, Liang Hongzhi, President of the Control Yuan, Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, Chen Enpu, Minister of Judicial Administration, and other central government officials will also make a special trip to Shanghai to participate in the memorial service.

### Health Bureau Intensifies Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections

After the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee decided to start the second phase of epidemic prevention injections on August 1st, the Health Bureau launched the work as scheduled and dispatched personnel to various traffic arteries to carry out injections. As of now, more than 200,000 people have been injected. Recently, due to the merger of the Health Bureau and the First District Health Office, the command of epidemic prevention workers has been unified, and the progress has become smoother. Cholera injections must be administered in two phases to be effective. Those who received the first phase in May and June should receive the second phase in August. Those who received the first phase in July can postpone the second phase until September. The general public often waits and sees regarding epidemic prevention injections because the weather is turning cooler, but they do not know that cholera is most likely to occur between summer and autumn, which is still a dangerous period, and slight negligence cannot be tolerated. In addition to ordering its subordinates to intensify their work, the Health Bureau hopes that the public will take the initiative to go for injections and not avoid them, so as to ensure safety.

### Advisory Committee Investigates Vacant Factories and Houses Throughout the City

In order to understand the vacant enemy-owned factories and houses throughout the city, the Municipal Advisory Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government requesting an investigation. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Baojia Committee to inform all neighborhoods, towns, and villages to report in detail whether there are any vacant enemy-owned factories and houses within their jurisdiction. After receiving the order, the Nanshi neighborhood offices have been conducting investigations separately in order to report them by a certain date.

### Self-Defense Corps Forbid Use of Flashlights During Air Raid Alarms

It has been understood by the general public that the use of flashlights is prohibited after an air raid alarm is issued in order to avoid light leakage. However, members of the Self-Defense Corps and air defense personnel are using them arbitrarily on top of observation posts and other high-rise buildings, and some are even shining flashlights upwards to signal to turn off the lights at high places, which violates air defense prohibitions. It is reported that the Baojia Office has issued strict orders to prohibit this in order to implement light control, and it is hoped that citizens will also pay close attention and comply with it together.

### Do Not Touch Air Defense Obstruction Bombs

Air defense obstruction bombs have unparalleled power, and the explosive force is extremely thick. Once used and landed on the ground, citizens must not touch them without authorization to avoid accidents. They should report to the nearby military police immediately. The Nanshi Self-Defense Corps Headquarters and various neighborhood offices have recently received the Handling Measures for Dropped Obstruction Bombs issued by the Municipal Government and have instructed all teams and Lianbao chiefs to pay close attention to avoid accidents.
