### Further Discussion on the Grain Problem

We feel that the recent soaring black market rice prices indicate the severity of the food crisis is just beginning. If we do not earnestly examine the causes of past failures, and address the current environment with measures that tackle both the symptoms and the root causes, the people's suffering will be even worse than it is today, and this cannot be taken lightly.

In our editorial on the 2nd of this month, titled "Requesting the Government to Encourage Agricultural Production," we pointed out that farmers have a hesitant attitude towards planting food crops, interwoven with indecisive choices, which may lead to two possible outcomes. First, a reduction in rice planting area to avoid losses from low-price purchases. Second, even if they plant, they may be passive and unwilling to work diligently. Both of these outcomes result in reduced food production. Therefore, we advocate: 1. Prohibiting the military from directly purchasing rice from farmers. Military rice needs should be collected and distributed by a unified agency at reasonable prices, to reduce farmers' psychological panic. 2. Rice purchase prices must take into account farmers' costs, plus a reasonable profit, to reduce the psychological impact of low prices on farmers. 3. With regard to civilian rice consumption outside of military rice needs, given the painful past experiences, it is worth re-examining and considering.

Furthermore, in our editorial on the 9th of this month, titled "The Timing for Considering the Grain Problem," we reviewed the past failures of grain policy and considered the direction to take in the future. The reason why we repeatedly raise the issue of grain is that, seriously speaking, food is the top priority among people's livelihood issues. Without solving the grain problem, there is no basis for social stability. When people's livelihood cannot be stabilized to a certain extent, not only will the rural areas be chaotic, but the cities will also be increasingly vulnerable, which will inevitably form a large-scale refugee situation caused by artificial famine. Try to imagine this with your eyes closed, how terrifying it is!

We have no new or different insights, only a reiteration of what we have advocated in the past:

The most urgent matter at present is to hope that the authorities will promptly issue measures to encourage farmers to plant rice. The goal is to make rice planting profitable for farmers, so they will automatically increase the planting area and output. Passively, we should no longer forcibly purchase rice at a fixed price. At the same time, we should utilize wasteland and relocate displaced people to engage in cultivation.

During this wartime, military rice is undoubtedly the top priority, but the central government should be fully responsible for its supply. Local (county) governments should cooperate with local rice merchants to undertake the purchasing work, taking into account the farmers' costs and reasonable profits, and adjusting the purchase price according to the price situation. On the other hand, for farmers paying taxes, we can try to collect taxes in kind. Local governments should be rewarded for handling the work well, and severely punished for poor management or fraud.

Regarding the rice supply issue in Shanghai, according to news from the Municipal Advisory Committee a few days ago, a solution has been drafted and is awaiting approval from the Mayor. We hope that the municipal authorities and the committee will quickly implement practical and easy-to-implement measures. At the same time, the cooperation of the Allied authorities is particularly necessary. We believe that the Allied authorities have long deeply understood the importance of the food issue and will not underestimate it. In addition, it is also extremely important for rice merchants to abandon their self-interest and cooperate from the sidelines. It is time for everyone to work together to save the situation.

Translated Commentary

### The Grain Contribution Reward System

Currently, the average yield per "duan" (300 square steps, each step 6 square feet) of rice paddy nationwide is two "shi," valued at 125 yuan. Meanwhile, the income from planting fruit trees and vegetables on a "duan" of land often reaches hundreds of yuan. Therefore, the income from rice crops is relatively low. Although the government has been encouraging changes in crops for the past two or three years, travelers can see everywhere that the central parts of the plains are still planted with endless rows of fruit trees. The reason why farmers are unwilling to change crops, and why local authorities cannot make farmers change crops, is due to the economic factor of low profits from rice cultivation. Planting non-essential crops not only occupies land, but also absorbs valuable fertilizer and labor. How much can the grain contribution increase due to the implementation of this contribution reward and incentive system? It is not yet known whether farmers will be willing to reduce planting fruit trees and switch to rice cultivation, but it is fortunate that we can see some progress in implementation.

Moreover, rural areas throughout the country have a habit of using substitute food. Due to the implementation of this system, since it is necessary to contribute as much rice as possible, the gradual recovery of this old habit is also a welcome trend. Therefore, it is not excessive for the bonus reward to be set at 75 to 100 yuan per "shi."

However, many worries have been raised, believing that rural inflation may occur. But this is not a cause for concern. Although there is more money in the countryside, there are fewer materials to buy. Therefore, the remaining funds are almost entirely saved. In fact, there is nothing better than the countryside when it comes to saving to serve the country. If cooperation is required to prevent wartime inflation, attention should be paid to the financial aspects with the largest expenditures and the prosperous industrial relations. Efforts should be made to save money in this regard, so as not to despise money and waste expenses. However, it would be difficult to pre-determine the quota for this contribution affair, based on past performance and statistics, ignoring recent trends, and setting figures that are not in line with actual harvests.

Secondly, how to plan in advance when stipulating the quota for the decisive materials that govern food production, such as the increase in cultivated land and the reduction of fertilizer and labor, is also a question, and the most important thing is the climate and disasters. Regarding these points, when adopting practical quota methods, eliminating malicious sabotage movements by powerful people in the locality, and eliminating unequal factors in rural areas, are also points that the authorities must pay the most attention to. It is of course very appropriate for the Ministry of Agriculture to consider the current situation based on past performance and set quotas for various prefectures and counties. But those who are in charge of the actual work are the prefectural and county authorities. Therefore, the effectiveness of this system depends entirely on the efforts of the prefectural and county authorities, and the task of local officials can be said to be becoming increasingly important. We cannot help but hope for the self-respect and efforts of the local authorities. (Xiang: Translated from the May 1st issue of Japan's "Hochi Shimbun")

### Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Determination to Complete the Greater East Asia War; Unprecedented Grand Gathering of National Total Uprising

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Central General Assembly of the National Total Uprising Movement, jointly organized by the Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, was held this morning from 8:00 AM at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo. Present were advisors to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, general affairs councilors, executive members and staff of organizations affiliated with councilors from the Tokyo Cooperation Conference, executive members and chiefs of the Asia Development Headquarters, the Japan Women's Association, the Greater Japan Youth Corps, the Commercial Patriotic Association, the Imperial Rule Assistance Senior Corps, all members in Tokyo from the Political Support Association, and from the government side, Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet ministers, vice-ministers of various ministries, Governor of Tokyo Prefecture Tatsuta, and Director-General of Medical Affairs Usuta, totaling approximately 3,500 people. The assembly began with the reading of the Imperial Rescript, followed by the Vice-President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association reading an oath, then a speech by Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, and a speech by Kobayashi, Chairman of the Central Cooperation Conference. Afterwards, Prime Minister Tojo gave a speech, earnestly expressing his determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, moving the entire audience. Later, the assembly elected representatives to visit the Ise Grand Shrine, the Meiji Shrine, and the Yasukuni Shrine for prayers of victory. At the same time, to express gratitude to the frontline soldiers, the assembly drafted a telegram to the frontline soldiers, which was handed over to the Army and Navy authorities for transmission. Finally, the assembly closed in a solemn atmosphere.

### Main Points of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech are as follows: Overview of the Current War Situation - On the Pacific, Burmese, and Chinese fronts, due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, the East Asian war situation is truly entering a decisive phase. In dealing with this severe war situation, Japan has been able to utilize resources from China, Manchuria, and various parts of the South over the two and a half years since the start of the war, achieving complete self-sufficiency in military supplies and producing aircraft at quantities never imagined before the war. In addition, self-sufficiency in food, mobilization of manpower, and unity of spirit from top to bottom, along with superior strength, are all sufficient to take on the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. On this day of national emergency, we deeply feel the necessity of the uprising and unity of 100 million citizens in order to focus all our strength on the path to victory. The key to the national movement is to awaken the loyalty of the people and promote and develop it. Based on this, all those in authority must be loyal to their duties. At the same time, those in a position to guide the people must instill this great cause into people's hearts so that the true voices of the people are reflected in policy. We must deeply understand the nation's integrity, endure all hardships, and fight for the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. To build this great cause, we, the 100 million citizens, must thoroughly unite in order to unleash the full power of Greater East Asia. The so-called final victory depends on the fighting will of our people. If we can overcome all hardships, we will surely be able to seize the key to victory or defeat. Today, it is definitely not about material resources, but only by relying on the most resolute spiritual strength can we decide the outcome.

### Japanese Army in Henan Adopts Encirclement Tactics Against Luoyang; Completion of the Pinghan Railway

Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch, Reuters from Chongqing) - The Japanese army in the Henan war zone is advancing fiercely towards Luoyang from all directions. The fall of the city is only a matter of time. An advance unit of the Japanese army has already approached Luoyang to within eight kilometers.

Shanghai, Central News Agency News - A spokesman for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission told reporters on the 12th: "The Japanese army has successfully opened up the Pinghan Railway in this operation in Henan. Therefore, the Japanese army has achieved its goal of driving the Chongqing army along the railway line far into the western mountainous areas." Regarding the war situation after the opening of the Pinghan Railway, foreign journalists stationed in Chongqing observed that the Japanese army is currently shifting the center of the battle line to the Luoyang area, which is now completely surrounded by the Japanese army, and its fall is only a matter of time.

Enemy Aircraft Near Luoyang Thwarted

Xinzheng, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the progress of the war in southern Henan, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force are also gradually becoming active. Especially after the Japanese army captured Xuchang, the frequency of their attacks has increased. However, these enemy aircraft have been repeatedly intercepted by Japanese aircraft and have suffered heavy damage. For example, on the morning of the 12th, a Japanese army unit shot down three P49-type aircraft near Luoyang with machine guns. At 10:45 AM on the 12th, they also intercepted five enemy P49-type aircraft attacking near Luoyang, immediately shooting down one of them.

### Ministry of Industry Returns Private Silkworm Seed Farms in Zhenjiang and Jurong

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to return the private silkworm seed manufacturing farms in Sibaidu, Gaozi Town, Dantu County, Jiangsu Province, and Qiaotou Town, Jurong County, which were handed over by the former China Central Silk Company, the Ministry of Industry has specially formulated provisional measures, which have been promulgated and implemented by ministerial order. It is reported that when the original owners or entrusted agents apply for the return, they should submit a recovery plan and documentary evidence such as ownership deeds, silkworm seed manufacturing farm permits, and shareholder rosters for verification. If they are lost, they should obtain a certificate from the local competent authority or the trade association and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for verification. After the Ministry's review deems it qualified, the original owners or agents must publish a statement of property rights in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Suzhou newspapers for three consecutive days. If no objection is raised, it can be returned. After the return, the owners should report to the county government where the farm is located and forward it to the Executive Yuan for filing. All expenses incurred during the period when the Ministry acted as custodian will be reimbursed by the original owners or entrusted agents in accordance with the amount approved by the Executive Yuan. The deadline for applying for the return is three months from the date of the newspaper announcement. It is deeply believed that after all the aforementioned private silkworm seed manufacturing farms are returned, there will be further development in the future of China's silk industry.

### Ministry of Industry's Department of Agriculture and Forestry Promotes Hemp Planting

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since its establishment, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry has been actively promoting various increase production projects, sparing no effort.

### Northern Kuril Islands Defenses Impregnable; Enemy Attempts to Invade Will Inevitably Meet with Misfortune

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United States is counterattacking like mad in the southwestern Pacific and central Pacific, but so far has only occupied a few small islands on one end of Japan's outer defense perimeter. The purpose of their counteroffensive operations is, of course, to attack Japan's inner defense line and even the Japanese mainland. In this sense, the current US invasion operations against Japan's northern Kuril Islands should be paid attention to. Since the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, it has been a month, and both sides are facing off, with little progress. Why is the United States so silent? This must be said to be the credit of the solid defense of the northern Kuril Islands. The northern Kuril Islands' defenses have four great fortresses: First, the icy and snowy fortress that benefits from the windy and snowy weather; second, the water's edge fortress that benefits from the treacherous reefs and currents; third, the mechanized fortress formed by mechanized land mobile units; and fourth, the air force fortress with complete equipment and powerful strength. With these four fortresses, it is only natural that the enemy army has only been able to engage in reconnaissance work for almost a year. In terms of defense in that area, the US military should dispel its delusions as soon as possible. If they continue to indulge their emotions and attempt an invasion, they will suffer a major blow that will affect their overall counteroffensive and leave them unable to recover.

### Mrs. Gandhi Memorial Service

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Treats Foreign Guests to a Tour of Xuanwu Lake

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The weather has been clear and the breeze gentle in recent days, perfect for outings. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially hosted foreign guests in Nanjing for a spring outing at Xuanwu Lake at 3:00 PM this afternoon, enjoying the beautiful scenery of mountains and water.

Many ministers and officials also attended to accompany them. At 3:00 PM, the foreign guests arrived at the lake one after another, enjoying the lake view. They then went to Yingzi Hall to rest and watch a performance of Chinese arts. For a time, distinguished guests gathered and the atmosphere was unusually enthusiastic. It was truly a grand occasion.

### Southern Italy Adopts Offensive Stance; Prelude to the European Land War; Both Sides Reinforce, Intensifying the War

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: The British and American forces on the Italian front have launched a large-scale offensive, which seems to be the prelude to the European land war. The German High Command announced yesterday that "this offensive is intended to contain and distract the enemy forces," and should not be seen as a single military operation. The Italian war should be seen in connection with the anti-Axis forces' plan to invade Europe. The German High Command believes that the intensified air raids by the British and American air forces on German-occupied areas in Western Europe are "preparations for the invasion of Europe." The anti-Axis forces' offensive in southern Italy is clearly intended to divert the German High Command's attention from the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, drawing German troops from that area to southern Italy. The intensified air raids by anti-Axis aircraft on the southern coast of France are also noteworthy. There is no clear center of operations in the Italian war. It is also possible that the anti-Axis forces intend to adopt a pincer strategy on both the north and south sides of Pescara. The enemy has dispatched reinforcements, and the German army has also increased its reserves, making the war increasingly fierce.

Heavy Atmosphere of Murder on the Rapido River

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to German estimates, the anti-Axis forces are using approximately four to five divisions in this offensive, totaling approximately 60,000 to 75,000 men. Combining previous reports, the battle is unfolding in a zone of approximately 30 miles from Cassino to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The anti-Axis forces used boats and pontoon bridges to cross the Rapido River, and then pursued the German army from the outer perimeter of the Gustav Line.

### Western Europe Suffers Continuous Air Raids

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A communique from the German Fuehrer's Headquarters stated that a large formation of US bombers bombed eastern Germany on the 12th during the day. Although some damage was sustained, 91 of the attacking enemy aircraft were shot down. Among them, 50 were four-engine bombers. On the night of the 12th, the British Air Force attacked the northern coast of Germany and several areas of Belgium in small formations. The German night fighter squadron shot down 13 four-engine bombers. The recent continuous air raids by the anti-Axis forces on occupied areas in Western Europe are clearly a prelude to landing operations.

### Wallace to Depart for Chongqing

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a report from Washington, US Vice President Wallace will depart for Chongqing soon. It is rumored that after visiting Chongqing, he also intends to visit India and the Soviet Union.

### Amended Regulations for Ship Navigation in the Central China Area: Statements from Both Authorities

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency): To ensure the unimpeded flow of materials, a rational solution to the transportation problem is a prerequisite. Water transport in the Central China area has always been convenient, so the transportation of general materials relies heavily on ships. After the Incident, the Allied land and naval authorities formulated management regulations for ship navigation in our Central China area, which were implemented. Since implementation, they have had a significant impact on the overall shipping operations. Now, our national government authorities, in order to further establish a wartime transportation system, have repeatedly consulted with the Allied land and naval authorities to propose amending the above-mentioned ship navigation regulations to adapt to the actual situation. We are grateful for the sincere assistance of the Allied authorities. As a result of consultations, it was decided to formally amend and implement the regulations from the 15th of this month. The previous regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel will be completely abolished. Civilian ships under 30 tons are allowed to freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland waterways without applying for navigation permits. Ships over 30 tons that have joined the Central China Ships (Junk) Association or the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship Association as members generally do not need to obtain permits when navigating the Yangtze River and inland waterways. However, if navigating along the coast, a permit must be obtained from the naval authorities. Furthermore, the procedures for other ships to apply for permits will be simplified. We will continue to make every effort to prevent all kinds of illegal private transportation and navigation that obstructs public order. It is firmly believed that after this amendment, the number of ships navigating will certainly increase due to the relaxation of restrictions. Therefore, the shipping problem will naturally become more rational and smooth, which will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Furthermore, the smooth flow of shipping will further promote the smooth exchange of materials. Therefore, the amendment of these navigation regulations can directly improve shipping and indirectly contribute to the great cause of material exchange and stabilizing people's livelihoods. While we eagerly anticipate this, we deeply appreciate the sincere assistance of the Allied land and naval authorities. Vice Premier Zhou of the Executive Yuan and the authorities of the Japanese Embassy yesterday issued important statements respectively, concerning the significance of this move. They also deeply hope that all ship owners and sailors will understand the purpose and cooperate to accomplish the authorities' intention to improve shipping.

Statement by Vice Premier Zhou

Water transport in the Central China area has always been convenient, so material transportation relies heavily on ships. This time, after consultations with the Allied land and naval authorities, and thanks to their utmost sincere assistance, it was decided to amend the regulations governing the general ship navigation control in the Central China area. It will be implemented from May 15th. In the future, the number of ships can be increased, and transportation will be smoother, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods. The main points of the amendment are as follows: All previously established regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel will be abolished and handled in accordance with general rules. Provisionally, civilian ships under 30 tons are not required to apply for permits and can freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland waterways. For ships over 30 tons that have joined the Central China Junk (Ship) Association or the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship General Association, they may be exempted from obtaining navigation permits when navigating the Yangtze River and inland waterways in principle. If member ships navigate along the coast, they should apply for permits from the naval authorities. The issuance of navigation permits for other ships will be further simplified to improve shipping efficiency.

The National Government expresses its utmost admiration for this wise measure of assistance from the Allied land and naval authorities. In the future, with the smooth flow of shipping, we will work harder to promote the circulation of materials and stabilize people's livelihoods. All measures that hinder shipping, various donations and taxes that have not been approved will be abolished and strictly prohibited.

At the same time, we will continue to make every effort to prevent all kinds of illegal private transportation and navigation that obstructs public order. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.

Statement by the Japanese Embassy

The Japanese land and naval authorities stationed in China yesterday announced the revision of the "Regulations for Controlling General Ship Navigation in the Central China Area," easing control over general ship navigation. There are four main points of the revision: (Already seen in Vice Premier Zhou's statement on the regulations.) This is because the Japanese military authorities are considerate of the people's feelings, and on the other hand, it is due to the general public's efforts to maintain security. It is sincerely hoped that ship owners will, in the future, thank the Japanese military authorities for their kindness, deeply understand the purpose of this revision of the regulations, truly dedicate themselves to increasing transportation and cooperating to ensure security, and not transport materials beneficial to the enemy or engage in smuggling, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.

Statement by the Person in Charge of the Civilian Ship General Association

After our country's authorities agreed with the Allied authorities to revise the "Regulations for Controlling General Ship Navigation in the Central China Area," it will greatly benefit the transportation of materials and the stabilization of people's livelihoods. The reporter recently interviewed the person in charge of the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship General Association, who said on this matter: "Our country and the Allied authorities' decision to revise the general ship control regulations is a very wise measure. According to recent surveys, there are a total of 18,895 civilian ships in the Central China area, totaling 542,360 tons, with 326,000 men and women making a living by operating these ships. In the past, due to strict controls, the shipping industry could not fully develop. In the future, with freedom of navigation, the lives of these hundreds of thousands of people can be stabilized, and they can contribute to the circulation of materials and the construction of the national economy, especially to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. We are sincerely pleased and look forward to it."

### Authorities Actively Strengthen Material Control: Price Management Countermeasures Committee to be Established

Since the National Government implemented wartime economic policies, established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, and charged the National Commercial Control General Association with implementing the national materials control task, it has been a week, and the results have not yet reached the ideal goal. Therefore, in order to complete the control task and balance the supply and demand of materials, the control mechanism is being actively strengthened. Various major materials related to people's livelihoods are being thoroughly adjusted. The authorities are currently studying a thorough adjustment of the overall policy of material control and distribution. At the same time, preparations are being made to establish a price management countermeasures committee to fairly coordinate prices and unify operations, while focusing on urgently increasing production.

### 4th Middle and Elementary School Games: Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday, Over 80 Participating Schools, Extremely Grand

The 4th Shanghai Municipal Joint Middle and Elementary School Sports Meeting was held yesterday (14th) morning at 10:00 AM in Hongkou Park at the end of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education, Vice President of the Conference and Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Lin Jiong'an, Municipal Government Advisor Pan Da, National Sports Association Shen Siliang, and Xi Peiwen, among others, attended to provide guidance. Eight thousand people, including all staff members of the conference and athletes from various schools, were present. At 10:00 AM sharp, the opening ceremony began. The venue was arranged in an orderly manner. After the opening music was played, the flag was raised. All the athletes circled the field in the midst of military music. Each school was led by its flag, fluttering in the wind, brilliant and dazzling. At the front of the platform, everyone stood at attention and saluted. The entire assembly faced east and paid their respects to Chairman Wang. Vice President of the Conference, Chairman Lin, reported on the significance of the opening. Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education, Pan Da, Shen Siliang, and others successively gave speeches. The entire assembly sang the Sports Meeting Song. The schools jointly performed a grand exercise, and Shunhua, Director of the Second Department of the Population Department of the Ministry of Social Welfare, led a demonstration of simple exercises. The sports activities then began.

Chairman's Report

He briefly stated: "Mayor Chen, the president of the Municipal Sports Meeting, is unable to attend and give instructions today due to official business, so I will represent him. Since the Incident, the Shanghai Municipal Sports Meeting has been progressing slowly but steadily. Shanghai can be said to be the most progressive place for sports in the country. Therefore, I believe that the results of today's sports meeting will be very good. Due to venue issues, it has been postponed until today. The significance of today's sports meeting is that the people of the whole country must achieve the development of the nation and the state, and create a sound physique for our people. As you all know, if the national spirit is weak, the country will also be weak, and vice versa. Our country has always lagged behind other countries in sports, so we should vigorously promote sports, and especially pay attention to regular training. Today is just a joint training. This year's conference is even more grand than last year's. Since the recovery of the concessions, more than 80 middle and elementary schools in the city have participated, which has a more unified meaning. We are grateful to the officials present and the assistance of all sectors of society in donating prizes and bonuses." Then, Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education gave a speech.

### Dance Schools in the Nanshi District to be Banned by the End of June

In addition to all large casinos being ordered to close in the Nanshi District, the Second Police Bureau of the city, following the instructions of the municipal government, ordered all dance schools within its jurisdiction to be closed by the end of June without delay.

Speech by Deputy Minister Zhao

He briefly stated: "The Minister of Education sent me as a representative to participate, and I feel very happy. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen and Director Lin, the Ministry has made very obvious progress in promoting education. Promoting sports is not just a matter of holding a few sports meetings and then letting it go. We must actively promote it. First, it must be universalized. Second, it must be permanent. Not only young men and women should pay attention to their physical health, but every citizen should also exercise their bodies. Holding sports meetings is just a way to promote it. Its importance lies in the participants competing with each other and learning from each other. In this way, the sports meeting can promote sports. There are various difficulties in promoting sports in Shanghai. The first point is that the population is dense and there are many schools. Whether each school can obtain a large sports field is a major shortcoming. The second point is that Shanghai attracts people to places of less noble entertainment. Therefore, everyone in Shanghai must work hard to overcome these difficulties. Everyone must have a physique of copper tendons and iron bones in order to shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending East Asia."

Group Exercises

More than ten middle and elementary schools participated in the group exercise performance. Those who performed in the morning included Gezhi Middle School's Human Pyramid, the Second Normal School's Fitness Exercise, Hanbi Li Western Children's Middle School's "Human Pyramid" and "Human Horse," and group exercises from Yinghua Elementary School, He'an Elementary School, Tongcheng Elementary School, Feihong Elementary School, Tianzhu Elementary School, Nancang Elementary School, Hanbi Li Elementary School, and Huxi Elementary School.

### Shanghai Market Conditions for Finance, Industry, and Commerce Last Week

The market conditions for finance and various industries in Shanghai last week were stable as usual. Because the authorities are strictly cracking down on speculation, investors in general are unable to act, so there are very few changes in financial dynamics. However, due to strong selling pressure and an abundance of chips on the market, Huagu stocks were unable to absorb market transactions and were swayed by rumors, causing the market to fall. The silver market became tighter again last week, but fortunately, the silver and money industries raised funds to adjust, so legitimate industries and businesses were not affected in any way. The market prices of major goods remained stable, but rice prices soared in the black market due to the delay in household rice distribution and the private increases by rice merchants, and the panic over food for the people is becoming increasingly serious. It is reported that the authorities are actively adjusting the rice distribution, and it is expected that the food problem will be solved soon, and rice prices may fall back. The authorities will severely punish those who hoard rice privately if they are found out.

### Black Market Coal Briquettes: Quality Needs to be Corrected

Since the implementation of coal briquette distribution by household, it has been three months, but because the quantity distributed each period is insufficient for residents' use, they have been adding other fuels to replace it.
