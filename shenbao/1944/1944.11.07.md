Acting Chairman Chen’s Speech

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani, esteemed guests, today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. I am delighted by your presence. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is an unprecedented and epoch-making great undertaking in the history of Greater East Asia, the foundation for overall peace in Greater East Asia, and the foundation for the overall liberation of Greater East Asia. This is what we should express our respect and gratitude to Japan for today. As for China itself, since participating in the Greater East Asia War on January 9th last year, following Chairman Wang's instructions, we have been unswerving in our determination to share hardships and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life. No matter how difficult the war or how urgent the situation, we stand firm, cooperating with Japan to achieve victory. What China believes in is righteousness, and what it seeks is liberation. Apart from these, success or failure, profit or loss, are not considered. This we can be confident in, and hope that it is what all the peoples of Greater East Asia believe in. Recently, Japan has achieved unprecedented victories in land, sea, and air battles, which has brought boundless joy to all the peoples of Greater East Asia. We believe that with hundreds of millions of people united as one, we can overcome all enemies and break through all defenses. In the future, we will not only drive Anglo-American imperialism out of Greater East Asia, but also prevent any imperialism from reviving. This is the important meaning of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the important mission of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, on this important anniversary, is not only a day of joy for the Chinese people, but also for all the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia. The complete victory of the Greater East Asia War is imminent. I raise my glass to wish you all good health, and to celebrate the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Ambassador Tani's Response

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani, in his reply at the banquet hosted by Acting Chairman Chen, stated the following: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has announced the significance of the Greater East Asia War to the world, and the noble mission of the Greater East Asia War is fully demonstrated in this declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is a charter for the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia to develop individually and then seek common development and common liberation. In contrast, the Anglo-American conferences have always aimed to exclude dissidents, which is vastly different from the Greater East Asia Declaration. Moreover, this war is a war for the survival of all the peoples of the world. In the various battles, the Japanese army has achieved great victories. The recent victories of the Japanese army in the Taiwan and Philippine seas further prove that the Japanese army has secured the victory. Japan is currently cooperating with various countries to complete the war based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is truly admirable. Here, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the development of your government.

### Strive for Freedom and Independence for the Entire Greater East Asia – Broadcast Speech by Acting Chairman Chen

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the 6th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, Acting Chairman Chen delivered a broadcast speech in the evening. The original text is recorded below:

On November 6th last year, following the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the countries of Greater East Asia, in order to coordinate the completion of the Greater East Asia War and build a new order in East Asia, held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo to jointly strive and achieve common goals. The attendees included representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma, as well as the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, representing the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia, and commencing an unprecedented meeting in the history of East Asia. On the first day, the representatives of the countries respectively stated their determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. On the second day, with a unanimous resolution, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the essence of the conference, was issued. This declaration is a great charter in which the peoples of Greater East Asia place their highest belief in world peace, and also a vow that the peoples of Greater East Asia will abide by unswervingly.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the deeply rooted evil forces of Anglo-American aggression have gradually been driven out of the East Asian region, the original appearance of Greater East Asia has been restored, and all past misunderstandings and estrangements between East Asian countries have been eliminated due to the alignment of external interests. The instigation and discord sown by Anglo-American aggression were the main factors in the various grievances between East Asian peoples. Once they are completely eliminated, the natural and potential friendship and sincerity among East Asian peoples, due to historical and geographical relations, immediately reappear. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the total crystallization of this friendly sincerity.

A Glimpse of the Declaration's Contents

The content of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the first paragraph points out the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace, the second paragraph points out the cause of the Greater East Asia War, the third paragraph points out the determination to complete the war and complete construction, and the fourth paragraph points out the program for the construction of Greater East Asia. The first article of the program is to establish the common goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. The second article is to establish the political principle of independent autonomy, mutual assistance and amity. The third article is to establish the cultural principle of respecting tradition, developing national creativity. The fourth article is to establish the economic principle of mutual benefit and cooperation, and common prosperity. The fifth article is to establish the world ideal of harmony among all nations, abolishing racial discrimination, promoting communication of culture, and opening up resources. Over the years, the four major programs of political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication that we have put forward have now been more concretely established with the guidance of our ally Japan and the overall support of the countries of Greater East Asia. And the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Founding Father has also obtained the opportunity for realization. From the content of the declaration, we can clearly understand the purpose of our ally Japan, which is to fully assume the vanguard of the Greater East Asia War, drive out the forces of Anglo-American aggression, and seek the overall liberation of East Asia, so that all countries that have been invaded by Anglo-American countries can be independent and autonomous, and cooperate with each other. This great spirit of righteousness is inherent in the East, but in the past, it was not able to express itself due to the machinations of Anglo-American aggression. Now it can extend its inherent free will and express itself fully.

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, before the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, our ally Japan had proven with facts that it was committed to assisting the independence and autonomy of the peoples of East Asia. For example, China's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights, Burma's independence, and the Philippines' independence are all seen by people around the world. After the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, our ally Japan has been even more active in this effort. For example, assisting the Indian National Army to carry out the struggle for national revival, and assisting the Philippines and Burma to resist the invasion of aggressors, are the most prominent examples.

From the content of the declaration, we must also be clear about the just demands and expectations of the countries of East Asia for world peace. We are fighting for survival and for self-defense. Our ultimate goal is peace, and the main task of war is also peace. In order to guarantee peace, we have no choice but to eliminate the obstacles to peace. The peace we demand is not only for East Asia, but also for the world. Racial discrimination is the cause of national hatred and must be abolished. Resource monopolies are the fuse for the struggle for survival and are also unacceptable to us. At the time when the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was discussed and issued, Chairman Wang said: "The characteristic of this declaration lies in revealing the Eastern spirit of righteousness and sweeping away the utilitarian views of the West. In more detail, it is to fundamentally eliminate the traditional policy of Anglo-American plunder and exploitation, and to reopen up a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia... In this way, the countries of East Asia will inevitably move towards sincere unity, so that national interests and people's welfare will increase day by day, and at the same time, world peace will inevitably originate from this." He also said: "The Greater East Asia War is a war of co-prosperity against colonialism... The passive aspect is to sweep away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and the active aspect is to establish Greater East Asian co-prosperity. In order to achieve this goal, the peoples of East Asia must be united in sincerity, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, from sharing hardships to seeking common prosperity, and from sharing death to seeking common life. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Conference is based on this, to fully display the Eastern spirit of righteousness, so that all of East Asia can be united as one to break the oppression and exploitation policies of Anglo-American colonialism, so that the people of all East Asian countries can enrich their independent and autonomous patriotism, and at the same time organize the necessity of coexistence and co-prosperity. All countries in East Asia should cooperate on this fundamental spirit, and then the Greater East Asia War will be won, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere will be completed.

It has been a year since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was published. The war is still continuing, and the construction in destruction is of course constantly striving, but in terms of destruction, the intensity of the war has increased. Currently, we are facing the most urgent moment, which is also the final moment of the total decisive battle for the survival of the entire East Asian nation. Judging from the recent situation of the Anglo-American actively launching counter-offensive operations in the Pacific, the prelude to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War has clearly begun to be unveiled enthusiastically. Some superficial observers may think that this is just a war between Britain and the United States and Japan. The enemy has been adopting a "island hopping" strategy, in order to cut off the connection and encircle Japan, and use its so-called "fatigue bombing" and "carpet bombing" methods, vainly attempting to harass the rear and threaten Japan, and at the same time high-sounding its so-called "second East Asia front," using Chinese territory as its scorched earth warfare base, its purpose is only to attack Japan. In fact, the Anglo-American attempt to attack Japan is to dominate East Asia and enslave East Asia, which is to scorch China and sacrifice China. May I ask what we have today, besides Japan serving as the vanguard to defend East Asia, what else can resist the rampant of Anglo-American aggression? What exactly did we get from scorched earth and sacrifice? Originally, Japan's strength at sea, land, and air in the Pacific has been accelerating and strengthening in recent years, forming an unbreakable iron formation. The counter-offensive that the British and the United States have been promoting for more than two years has been delayed for a long time and has not dared to launch a major attack, which is a kind of worried hesitation. However, they saw that Japan's strength was strong, the overall awakening of the countries of Greater East Asia was awakened, their strongholds in East Asia were lost, and the poisonous schemes of instigation and discord also failed, and all the bases were shaking together, so they had to bet everything on a foolish move, not hesitating to work hard and try it at risk. They believe that Japan is the only strong enemy in East Asia. By defeating Japan, they can slaughter the entire East Asia, enslave the entire East Asian nation, and control the world of East Asia and do whatever they want. However, their adventure and their dreams will eventually fail and will eventually be reduced. We only need to look at the recent land and sea battles in mainland China, Taiwan, and the Philippines to see how poor the enemy is, and we can understand everything. After the fall of important locations in the battle on the mainland of China, almost all the enemy's important air bases were destroyed. In the air and sea battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy's fleet was almost defeated. This is the fact that gives the response to Anglo-American aggressors. In this situation, it is not difficult to imagine how anxious and impoverished the enemy's final struggle will be. After that, the intensity of the war will inevitably increase.

Firmly Believe in Victory

For the survival of East Asia, our efforts cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Today, we must exert the entire strength of Greater East Asia to strive for final victory. We deeply express our greatest respect and excitement for the ally Japan, who, up and down, are united, fighting hard, brave, resolute, and marching forward without hesitation. We sincerely believe that the ally Japan will be able to uphold the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and do its best to assist the countries of East Asia, so that they can automatically use their own strength, drop by drop, to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we firmly believe that other friendly countries will also be able to firmly believe in victory, and jointly cooperate with the ally Japan to complete the war, and contribute to the Greater East Asia War with their own strength, without any omission, for their respective countries, for the entire East Asia, to strive for autonomy and independence. Finally, I hope that Chinese compatriots in the areas controlled and suppressed by Anglo-American aggression will no longer be deceived by Anglo-American aggression and be blinded by it. Let us rise up, realize comprehensive peace between China and Japan, let us rise up, strive for the liberation of the entire East Asia, and strive for China's independent autonomy. We want to survive and want independent autonomy. Apart from going to the enemy with all our strength, completing the Greater East Asia War, and crushing Anglo-American aggression, there is absolutely no other way.

We further believe that if the aggressors do not give up their ambition to re-invade one day, and do not stop their adventurous actions to re-invade one day, the angry tide of freedom and liberation of the East Asian nation will surely rise and surge day by day. Our will for freedom and liberation cannot be hindered by any force, and our determination to fight cannot be shaken by any trick.

Chinese compatriots! Japanese allies! Comrades of all East Asia! We, the tens of thousands of people in Greater East Asia, on this day can only abide by our common blood oath, face the light of victory ahead, exhaust our total strength, take the same steps, follow the open path of the common declaration, and advance bravely forward!

### Comparison of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Atlantic Charter

— Li Quanshi

Yesterday was the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The City News Association and other five groups held a commemorative speech meeting, inviting folk representatives from various countries to speak. The Chinese representative was Mr. Li Quanshi. Mr. Li's speech is moved and recorded here. —Editor's Note

It is truly an overestimation to have me, in my capacity, represent our people in expressing my feelings about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. However, at the moment of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, I am delighted to be able to talk with you all on this commemorative day with profound meaning. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the spiritual manifestation of the cooperative construction of the common prosperity sphere by the countries of East Asia, and also the manifestation of the assistance of our ally Japan to various countries. By comparing the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the so-called Atlantic Charter of Britain and the United States, it can be clearly understood.

First, the Atlantic Charter was announced in August 1941. According to progressive principles, the Greater East Asia Declaration is naturally superior to the Atlantic Charter. This is in terms of time. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.

Second, the founding countries of the Atlantic Charter are only two imperialist countries, Britain and the United States, while the founding countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration are seven East Asian countries. This is in terms of the number of countries. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.

Third, although the Atlantic Charter is said to have eight principles, they are all fragmented. Although the Greater East Asia Declaration only has five programs, each one is very important. This is in terms of content. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.

Fourth, the Atlantic Charter guarantees the territorial integrity of small countries (such as Poland), but the current trend is that the southeastern half of Poland will probably not be guaranteed, so the spirit of the charter has been destroyed. The seven countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration jointly ensure the stability of East Asia, and mutually respect autonomy, independence, and the traditions of nations, which is the manifestation of East Asian morality. This is in terms of practicing the spirit of the declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.

Fifth, of the eight principles of the Atlantic Charter, there are two (namely the fourth and fifth) that pay attention to post-war international economic cooperation. Of the five programs of the Greater East Asia Declaration, there are also two programs (namely the fourth and fifth) that pay attention to post-war international economic cooperation. However, if Britain does not abandon its imperial preferential tariffs after the war, and the United States does not abandon its domestic extreme protection tariffs, then the so-called international economic cooperation is just a deception. This is in terms of the possibility of implementing the entire declaration in the future. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.

Sixth, the sixth article of the Atlantic Charter declares that it is necessary to defeat Nazism, but it does not mention a word about racial equality. The first article of the Greater East Asia Declaration speaks of coexistence and co-prosperity, and the fifth article speaks of harmony among all nations and equality among all races. This is in terms of the spirit and meaning of the declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is greater than the Atlantic Charter.

By observing the above comparisons, we can know that the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the so-called Atlantic Charter of Britain and the United States cannot be mentioned in the same breath at all. On the occasion of commemorating the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration today, we should work harder to implement the spirit of the declaration, so as to realize the autonomy, independence, coexistence, and co-prosperity of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia as soon as possible.

### The Greater East Asia United as One, Jointly Build a New Order – Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies the True Meaning of this War

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the 6th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a radio speech to various parts of Greater East Asia at 7:30 PM, clarifying that from the perspective of Britain and the United States, this war is actually launched without a name, while in Japan, it is a war of self-preservation, self-defense, and liberation of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, it is a holy war with the ideal of re-establishing the world order, so the final victory should belong to Greater East Asia. The general idea is: ×××

Different War Aims

In this Great War, the Japanese Empire and the countries of East Asia, whose circumstances and positions are the same, have proclaimed their common war aims to the world, and a year has passed since then. At this time, the East Asian war situation has obviously entered the decisive stage. Today, Britain and the United States are developing their dreams of achieving world domination, and are permanently conquering and enslaving the Axis nations. They are further strengthening their colonial oppression and exploitation of the East Asian nations, and are driving their own troops to sacrifice themselves in the malaria-infested mountains and wild lands, or the vast ocean, and even inflicting sins on their own people that are intolerable in terms of humanity. This is the common war aim of the Japanese Empire and the countries of Greater East Asia, and the war aim of the enemy Britain and the United States is fundamentally different. The reason for this difference will be proved to the whole world. Not only that, the British and American people will also be aware of the harmful and unprofitable war actions of their own country, and even resist the rulers of their own country. Therefore, we believe that the decisive stage of the war situation will enter a new historical process, and the reason for this is due to the completely different war aims between us and the enemy, and the fact that the officials and people of the enemy country are about to stand in opposition to each other.

Declaration Principles Must Be Realized

What the Japanese Empire sincerely hopes for is to eliminate political autocracy and economic monopoly in the world, and then to mutually understand the intentions of each nation, respect the sovereignty of each country, and thereby realize mutually beneficial international relations. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the specific principles of East Asia, and after the countries of East Asia have driven out the British and American military forces from their related regions, the countries of East Asia have been able to cooperate with the Japanese Empire to form an alliance and stand on the common front against Britain and the United States. This is because the countries of East Asia firmly believe that only by eliminating British and American oppression and aggression can they open up the path to their own freedom and liberation. After the countries of East Asia have broken away from the shackles of British and American military forces, they have now launched a new national struggle to resist the re-aggression of Britain and the United States in East Asia. This is a sacred war to firmly defend the already established national sovereignty and national independence. The war I fought was launched with the self-preservation and self-defense of the Japanese Empire as a starting point, and its essence can be extended to the broader purpose of the so-called common defense of all East Asian nations.

Unwavering Belief in Victory

The Japanese Empire need not be mentioned, that is, the countries of East Asia are not only fighting to defend their own independence and sovereignty, but also to re-mutual their independence and sovereignty. Therefore, the purpose of Japan and the countries of East Asia is also to form and maintain a strong common front to resist the common enemies, Britain and the United States. Therefore, the foundation of peace that the Japanese Empire intends to establish is not limited to the East Asian region, but also to restore the normal status of East Asia, which has been oppressed and subdued in the world in the past, so as to make this foundation the foundation of world peace. Therefore, if Britain and the United States are still obsessed with their war aims of enslaving the East Asian nations and annexing the countries of East Asia, the Japanese Empire will be determined to fight to the end. In other words, this is the unwavering belief held by the countries of East Asia, which share the same historical destiny as Japan. In this struggle for survival, we firmly believe that the countries of East Asia will surely achieve a glorious final victory.

### Chairman Bose of India Pays Respects at the Imperial Palace

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, who is visiting Japan, paid respects at the Imperial Palace at 1:30 AM on the 6th to express his respect to the Japanese Imperial Family. He respectfully expressed his gratitude for Japan's righteous support, and then left in fear and trepidation.

### National Assembly Session: Highlights of Shigemitsu's Address: Utilizing Diplomacy Based on Fundamental National Policies

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Grand East Asia Joint Declaration Anniversary National Assembly, sponsored by the Greater Japan Political Association's Asia Development Headquarters, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall on the afternoon of the 6th. Attendees included Prime Minister Koiso and other ministers, ambassadors from various countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, who is staying in Tokyo.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - At the National Assembly session, Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu's speech highlights were as follows: To conceal domestic contradictions and strengthen national defense, Britain and the United States sent large forces to lands far across the ocean to fulfill their ambitions and wage reckless wars. However, due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, they were dealt severe blows in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. Their valuable warships and countless lives have all been devoted to their Pacific war plans, with the intention of perpetually invading Asia and engaging in limitless exploitation, hoping to turn East Asia from a state of awakening to a dark struggle. They promised war to Chongqing, but in reality, they aimed to gradually erode China's military, political, and economic strength. They plotted to make East Asians suffer mutual destruction to achieve their savage desires. They violated justice, attempting to monopolize hegemony, permanently oppress the Axis powers, and forcibly make other countries follow their own organization, disregarding the interests of small countries. Therefore, our allied countries are cooperating with East Asia to shatter the enemy's ambitions and realize a just world, engaging in a holy war. The Grand East Asia Joint Declaration, concise and powerful, clearly demonstrates the cause of the Greater East Asia War, explains the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace, and expresses our determination. The Japanese Empire is formulating policies and utilizing diplomacy. Currently, various East Asian countries are striving to realize the spirit of this joint declaration. In the mainland, the State of Manchuria is first contributing its industrial equipment and abundant natural resources to East Asia. Key figures of the Republic of China, a cornerstone for the revitalization of Greater East Asia, are also assisting the chairman in leading 400 million people, awakening as East Asians, and standing on a common front with the allied countries, striving with a spirit of shared life and death. Only the Chongqing regime, driven and utilized by Britain and the United States, willingly serves as the enemy's tool and has recently been frequently scolded by Britain and the United States, which is truly a great spectacle of modern times. In Thailand, under the leadership of the newly appointed Prime Minister Apaiwong, the new cabinet has been well-organized and is cooperating with Japan at the forefront of the liberation of a new Asia. In Burma, under the guidance of State Representative Ba Maw, they are cooperating with the Japanese army in the vanguard of the liberation of Asia. As for the Philippines, despite the enemy's American invasion, they resolutely stand with Japan on the same front, cooperating with the Japanese army in decisive battles under the command of President Laurel, which is particularly noteworthy to the whole world. In addition, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India, as well as the gentlemen of the Provisional Government of India present at this conference today, are also leading many Indian National Army soldiers, fighting to achieve the great cause of liberating India. All of the above are cooperating with Japan to complete the war and advance the Asian structure for realizing the Grand East Asia Joint Declaration. Now the enemy Britain and the United States are building up their war power, launching an invasion from the two lines of East Asia. The war situation is intensifying day by day and is about to enter a decisive stage. East Asia has now reached a critical moment. Fortunately, the remarkable war results achieved by the Japanese army are gradually expanding, so the belief that the Greater East Asia camp will win is becoming stronger. We vow to defend our homeland and further contribute to the lasting peace of the world with the principle of justice, and we must not stop until we achieve the final victory of this operation. Here, we are determined to cooperate with our allied countries to achieve the final victory.

### Statement by the Prime Minister of Manchukuo

Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of Manchukuo, issued the following statement: The Grand East Asia Declaration is noble and far-reaching. The post-war peace organization advocated by the enemy uses deception and schemes to seize world power, subjugating all nations under its control to satisfy its selfish policies. The final victory of the war will surely descend upon the heads of those who uphold justice and humanity, which is the will of Heaven and our firm belief.

### Kamikaze Squadrons and Submarines Sink Four Enemy Aircraft Carriers: Japanese General Headquarters Continues to Announce War Results East of the Philippines

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 6th: (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Squadrons attacked the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines on the 5th, sinking and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier each. (2) On November 5th, Japanese air units attacked the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines, destroying one enemy aircraft carrier. (3) On the night of November 3rd, Japanese submarines ambushed the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines, sinking one Albemarle-class aircraft carrier.

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - This time, the enemy Americans are fighting in the Philippines, finding themselves in a state of bewilderment, anxiety, and unease. Their aircraft carrier forces have suffered almost complete losses due to the weakening of the rear forward airbases and the defeat of the mobile unit forces in the waters off Taiwan. At the same time, they cannot secure the most important air supremacy. They are now planning to reinforce from New Guinea. According to an enemy commentator who used a radio station to explain the situation to the large city of Leyte, broadcasting on the 31st, "The fighting in the Philippines this time is fraught with difficulties for three reasons: (1) The Japanese forces in the Philippines are extremely strong. (2) The ferocity of the Japanese air force's counterattack was unexpected. (3) The Japanese strongholds are heavily fortified."

(Continued Fierce Fighting in the Philippines)

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The war situation on various fronts today is as follows: In the Philippines, the two armies continue to engage in fierce fighting day and night. The Japanese ground forces are fighting bravely, expanding their war results. At the same time, the Japanese air squadrons are responding and launching strong attacks on enemy airfields in Leyte Bay, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. When enemy planes attacked the Japanese base on the 4th, the Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down seven enemy P-38s and forcing them to flee. The Japanese air force also continued to attack Tacloban on the night of the 3rd, burning more than ten enemy planes. There was an explosion in one location in Tacloban, and an enemy ship was burned in Leyte Bay. In addition, on Peleliu Island, enemy troops have been landing, and the defending troops are continuing to fight fiercely, launching fierce attacks on a portion of the enemy troops who have invaded Observation Hill and the southern end of Mount Amiangal. The enemy troops have suffered extremely heavy damage. Currently, the enemy troops fear Japanese surprise attacks and have prepared earthbags and barbed wire to build strong defenses. On Angaur Island, they are also responding to Peleliu, engaging in fierce and bloody battles with the enemy troops day after day.

(Japanese Planes Bomb Tacloban Fiercely)

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - From the night of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese air force raided the enemy airfield in Tacloban, destroying more than 100 enemy planes. They continued to attack on the 3rd, destroying three enemy facilities, one of which caught fire. The streets of Tacloban were also ablaze with light. Two military supply warehouses on the coast of Talac were burned. The Japanese side lost two planes in this battle.

When a reporter went to inquire about his impressions of this trip, he said the following: This time, I went to Japan to inquire after the Chairman's health and to inspect military affairs. After arriving in Japan, I immediately inquired after the Chairman, whose health is gradually recovering and will soon be completely healed. In addition, during my visit to Japan, I exchanged opinions with various parties in the allied country and had very pleasant conversations.

Travel Communication

### A Day Trip to Datuan

— Yifei

There are three routes from Nanhui City to Datuan Town: For land travel, in addition to taking trucks that run along the highway, one can take a shortcut and walk there. For water travel, one can hire a private boat outside the East Gate and go down the river. For the sake of time and economy, the reporter took a truck out of the South Gate at 1:30 p.m. on October 28th. The truck came from Zhoupu Town, and more than half of the passengers got off here, so the truck was not as crowded as when it came, but the highway was steeper than the previous section, so the degree of bumping was worse than before. From there, the truck drove straight east, then turned into the sea dyke and headed south. The houses on both sides were mostly thatched cottages, with fewer tile houses. Occasionally, one or two tall tile houses, like cranes standing among chickens, were built with fortifications, which were quite eye-catching. Upon inquiring with the fellow travelers, I learned that this was the residence of the local landlord, while the thatched cottages were the shelter of ordinary poor peasants and tenant farmers. These people were the villagers from Chongming, Qidong, and Yuyao mentioned in the reporter's first communication who had migrated to this place. The farmers in the fields, men and women mixed together, were quite busy, as it was the time to sow wheat. One characteristic of the women here is that they all have three thousand strands of hair behind their heads, and there are no women like those in the city who have their beautiful hair cut off. When the truck passed by, they did not pay attention and continued to farm as usual. Their leisurely attitude and simple clothes gave the impression that they did not know there was a Han Dynasty, let alone the Wei and Jin Dynasties. After about an hour, the truck arrived at Datuan Town.

(A Glimpse of the Market)

Datuan is the second largest town in Nanhui County, and its commercial situation is second only to Zhoupu. The market town is in the shape of a line, about four li long from north to south. Although the streets are narrow, they are cleaner than the county seat. The shops on both sides are lined up densely, and pedestrians are bustling. The business is mostly based on daily necessities. The local native cloth is known far and wide. The colors are diverse, the texture is firm, and it is well-known. It is woven by the women of the town themselves and is also a major sideline of the farmers. Its contribution to regulating the rural economy is significant. In addition, there is a native paper mill, whose products are sold in various villages. It is a pity that it is difficult to develop due to adherence to outdated methods and insufficient capital. Cotton is the main export commodity, and Xiang Sheng Cotton Firm is the leader among the cotton firms. The main sales area is Shanghai.

(Social Customs)

The social situation in Datuan and the status of men and women in society are quite different from other places. The women are strong, able to endure hardship, and work very hard. They are worthy of being heroines and strong producers in the countryside, unlike the women in general cities, who "eat their fill all day long and do nothing," specializing in applying powder and rouge to beautify themselves, and playing mahjong for eight rounds in their spare time, not engaging in production and willingly being parasites. The men are very idle, with the style of the Eight Banner children of old Beijing. Therefore, the teahouses and taverns here are always full, and business is very prosperous.

(Gambling and Smoking are Lively)

The prevalence of gambling in Datuan is the highest in the county. The size of the chips won and lost is truly shocking. The number in one game is not an exaggeration by the reporter, but tens of thousands of yuan is common and not surprising. Even the so-called new-style mahjong, which is popular in Shanghai, and various patterns were invented in Datuan Town. The reporter lived in the Daopai and talked to the shopkeeper about the local gambling trend. He learned that 19 out of 10 gamblers are farmers from various villages who use the money they get from selling the harvested crops in April and May as gambling capital and gamble heavily, not caring about the money that is easily earned with blood and sweat. Usually, the wins and losses are counted with chips. At the end of the game, the loser writes a check as proof of credit. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a farmer with only three to five acres of thin land to owe millions of yuan. When the time comes, they cannot pay the money, so they have to flee, causing their families to be ruined. These large-scale gambling dens are mostly located in deserted villages and move around every night. They also have special forces to support them, so although the county government has repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, it is not easy to eliminate them.

The prevalence of opium and morphine is rampant in the coastal villages here, and it is common for even women and children to be addicted. The harm caused by opium and heavy gambling to rural production and rural security should be taken seriously. I hope that the authorities can have the greatest determination to start cleaning up, so that we can talk about revitalizing the countryside and establishing security.

(Finance and Security)

There are only two banks in the local financial community, Qichang and Pudong, with a capital of 3 million yuan each. The main business is discounting and remittances, and the scale is not large, so the contribution to the countryside is really minimal.

In terms of security, the town has a strong military force. In addition to friendly forces, there is also the Fourth Security Company and the police special team. The current district chief, Gu Ming, is the commander of the police special team. This person also serves as the principal of the county-run No. 1 Middle School, which can be called a military-educational integration policy.

(Educational Situation)

There are two junior high schools in Datuan Town. District Chief Gu Ming also serves as the principal of the No. 1 Middle School. Because he holds many positions and is very busy, he does not often stay at the school, but he is usually very enthusiastic about education. The teachers at the school receive better treatment than those at other public schools. In addition to public funds, he personally raises the amount needed for the school's expenses, so the teachers do not have to worry about their meals and can serve with peace of mind, achieving remarkable results. The other is the private Donghai Middle School, with a budget of 4 million, which comes from donations from gentry and merchants from the town who live in Shanghai. When the reporter visited, he saw that all the students at the school wore uniforms made of local cloth, which was quite spectacular. There are more than 100 students in the two schools. In the reporter's opinion, the two schools should be merged, which would save expenses and increase efficiency. There are a total of three elementary schools, Datuan, Disheng, and Donghai, with a total of more than 700 students. According to the reporter's inquiries, the density of schools here is lower than in other districts, which seems to be a shortcoming and needs to be developed. The next day, the reporter hired a small boat to return to the city (the truck only runs once at 7:00 a.m.), and the two places are only four li apart, but the boatman asked for 400 yuan. The reporter thought the price was too high and showed reluctance, but the boatman kept muttering, saying that 400 yuan could only buy four catties of rice, which was only enough for two people to eat for a day. Alas! If the price of goods is not suppressed, talking about stabilizing people's livelihoods is simply going against the grain. As it was getting late, I let it go. The boat was so small that it could barely accommodate a person. I was squeezed in and dared not move. I only heard the sound of the oars splashing water and looked up at the sky. The long sky was as clean as if it had been washed, and the reeds on both sides rustled in the wind, making me intoxicated by the embrace of nature. Because I had been running around all day, I was exhausted, and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up, I had already arrived outside the East Gate of Nancheng. I left the boat and went ashore, and it was already dark when I entered the city.

The Shanghai Special City Government, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, and the Manchukuo Consulate General in Shanghai jointly held a tea party of China, Japan, and Manchukuo at 3:30 PM at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. Among the leaders of the three parties of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in Shanghai were Secretary-General Wu representing Mayor Chen, Minister Usami, the plenipotentiary envoy to Shanghai of the allied nation, and Ye Yaogong, the Consul-General of Manchukuo stationed in Shanghai.

### Minister Matsudaira Discusses: The Worsening Relationship Between Chongqing and the United States; The Attitude of Pro-American Faction is Worthy of Attention

The situation between the allied nation, Japan, and the United States in Shanghai has reached an extreme point.

The office of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Hua Mao Hotel. Information Chief Matsudaira made the following remarks regarding the dispute between Yu (Chongqing) Chiang (Kai-shek) and Stilwell: "On October 23, it was pointed out that public opinion in the United States was deeply dissatisfied with Yu, the situation was worsening, and Chongqing's poor politics were fiercely attacked. Moreover, Ambassador Gauss stationed in Yu made harsh demands, interfering in Yu's internal affairs. From this, it can be seen that the pressure from the United States on the Yu regime is increasing. On October 28, the White House announced Stilwell's recall. The next day, there were frequent reports of Ambassador Gauss's resignation. In this situation, the relationship between Yu and the United States has already

As for the reason for the recent upheaval in the United States, President Roosevelt himself claimed that the problem was actually a personal relationship between Chiang and Stilwell. However, British, American, and neutral newspapers and communications all paid extraordinary attention to it, believing that it was not just a personal problem but a serious political cause. In particular, according to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 31st, Stilwell initially made three demands to Chiang Kai-shek: (1) Appoint Stilwell as the supreme commander of the Yu joint forces and grant Stilwell the authority to allocate weapons. (2) Thoroughly reorganize the Yu military. (3) The Yu Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of China should coordinate and adjust their affairs in a unified manner. It is found that these demands were not intended to be put forward by Stilwell and Gauss themselves; the issue was what President Roosevelt insisted on. In other words, the United States wanted to further control Yu's military and government. The cause of this was the Japanese army's attacks on Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, which aroused American dissatisfaction. They then sought to achieve a common ambition. Chiang Kai-shek therefore, regarding China's fate, and the entire collapse of his own independent and autonomous label, strongly refused. As a result, Gauss and Stilwell resigned. Yu is currently maintaining its original views temporarily to avoid being unfavorable. However, the stubborn United States is still attempting to achieve its goal by both hard and soft means. We must therefore pay close attention to the attitude of the pro-American factions, such as Kong Xiangxi, Soong Ziwen, Soong Ziliang, Soong Meiling, Wei, Ming Dong Zhaoguang, etc."

### Shanghai Chinese and Japanese Cultural Circles Hold a Cordial Discussion

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, scholars from Waseda, Imperial, and Keio Universities in Japan stationed in Shanghai, along with figures from the business community, invited members of the Chinese press to the China Club for a cordial discussion between China and Japan. In addition to Captain Ta of the Reporting Unit of the Japanese Fleet in China, and Lin Houfu and Wang Bingnan, participants included Otani Yukiteki, Ruzawa Junsuke, Akutsu Masami, Sugizaki Toshio, Moriwake Iwao, Dosen Kichinosuke, Oya Toshitsugiro, and Nagai Isamu, totaling over fifty people, gathered in a grand hall.

First, Captain Kenada reported on yesterday's announcement from the Allied Forces Headquarters and elaborated on the following points: (1) The Allied forces suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, as evidenced by the recent decrease in enemy aircraft attacking the Philippines, proving that the Japanese Air Force is more active than in the past. (2) The Japanese people are all accumulating materials to turn them into war power, creating great war results. (3) The sacred special attack team members are actively training, etc. He then analyzed the reasons for Stilwell's recall to the United States, followed by a cordial discussion on various issues.

### Central Market Abolishes Fixed Pricing; Price Evaluation Committee Resolves

The Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Committee convened its twelfth committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month in the conference room of the Municipal Economic Bureau. Committee members Yuan Chang, Feng You, Luo Nezhai, Sun Zhongli, Xu Tianshen, Dai Ailu, Liu Weijun, Pan Da, Chen Guoquan, Chen Binhe, and representatives, totaling more than ten people, attended. Representatives from the Central Market, Anzai Kaneji, Liu Juezhen, and Hui Ziren, also attended. The meeting began with a report by Chairman Xu Tianshen on the progress of suppressing and stabilizing prices, followed by a discussion. The important resolutions are summarized below:

(1) Regarding how the committee should establish close contact with the price evaluations of various controlled organizations, markets, and military-managed goods to unify the city's price management, a public proposal was made. It was resolved that each production management organization should assign a responsible person to contact the committee's secretary at any time.

(2) Regarding the evaluated items of local produce and vegetables at the Central Market, all of which are fresh goods that cannot be stored for long and are prone to spoilage. In the past, the fourth meeting of the committee authorized the chairman to approve and announce them in advance and then submit them to the committee for ratification at each meeting. It has now been found that there are still items such as fish, meat, and eggs in the publicly set price list, which are all fresh goods and have the same properties. It is proposed to handle them in the same way as the previous case of the Central Market. A public resolution was requested, and it was resolved that the perishable items such as fish, meat, and eggs should be handled in accordance with the resolution of the fourth meeting.

(3) The Economic Bureau forwarded a letter from the Municipal Oil and Grain Control Committee stating that some of the oil and grain prices evaluated by the committee were set according to the rationed price, which was very different from the ordinary market price. Before the committee's approval, please suspend execution, etc. A reply was sent requesting them to quickly adjust and reply. However, it was found that there were many similar situations other than oil and grain. Should all relevant management organizations be requested to quickly approve reasonable prices so that they can be evaluated and announced? A public resolution was requested. It was resolved that all relevant competent authorities should adjust themselves and send them to the committee for evaluation and announcement.

(4) After the public prices evaluated and resolved at the eleventh meeting of the committee were announced, the prices of various commodities still remained at the original prices. However, on November 1, the Central Market published the prices of vegetables, local produce, and north-south goods in the newspaper, which did not comply with the resolution of the fourth meeting of the committee and caused misunderstandings among the people. How should the committee handle this? A public resolution was requested. It was resolved that in addition to the market itself publishing a retraction in the newspaper, subsequent evaluations must be approved by the committee or the chairman before they can be announced.

Short Commentary

### On Tax Adjustment

We are striving to reform municipal administration, improve the treatment of public officials, and increase administrative efficiency. Of course, without improving the treatment of public officials, any talk of increasing administrative efficiency or reforming municipal administration is empty talk. Improving treatment cannot be done out of thin air. The most important thing is to replenish funds. The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee organized by the city government has already discussed the issue of tax consolidation several times, and it is said that it is gradually achieving results. We are willing to wait and see its achievements. Here, we would like to offer some opinions in advance:

(1) Levy tax on the admission tickets of Jai Alai and dog racing stadiums. Since the gambling venues in Nanshi were banned, the two foreign-style gambling activities of Jai Alai and dog racing should also be banned. However, due to tax revenue and its special purchase, it still exists. This is already adapting to the environment. However, it is harmless to only charge admission tickets and collect donations for the two venues. It is said that the French responsible person of the dog racing stadium opposed this, believing that it would reduce business. This is completely standing on the position of the interests of a small number of French people and ignoring the public interest of the Chinese government and people. Then, even if the government tolerates the facts for special agreements, we citizens have the power to jointly sanction. How can business be maintained if there are no customers entering the venue at all? Therefore, we want to arouse the vigilance of the French responsible persons of the dog racing stadium, not to value private interests too much, neglect the overall interests of the Chinese people, and cause regrets.

(2) Levy special entertainment tax, such as for mahjong games in hotels, brothels, clubs, etc., stipulating a certain tax for each game. All other luxury consumption should also be taxed appropriately, taking from the wealthy without hurting the manufacturers.

### Three-Defense Welfare Football Match: Joint Battle Between Hualian and Shanghai Police

It has been found that the Hualian team, which will participate today, is composed of the elite forces of the two major Chinese giants, formed into an army, which can be called sharp and solid. As for the Police, it is the incarnation of the First Police Team of the previous session. The strength of this session is also very fierce. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.

### Five Organizations Held a Commemorative Speech Meeting Yesterday for the Greater East Asia Declaration; Representatives from China, Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and India Gave Speeches

Yesterday, the 6th, was the first anniversary of the joint declaration by the countries of Greater East Asia. The city's Press Association, Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Industry and Commerce, Civic Welfare Association, and National Diplomacy Promotion Association, recognizing that over the past year, the strength of the East Asian nations has grown stronger through united cooperation, and that the Allied Japanese forces have displayed their divine might, continuously achieving major victories in various frontlines, and that the Greater East Asia War has entered a stage of certain victory, and that the East Asian nations should uphold the spirit of the joint declaration and make further efforts, specifically held a "Anniversary Commemorative Speech Meeting for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration" at the Great Light Theater at 5 PM yesterday, to awaken citizens' understanding of the progressive organization of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The presidium consisted of Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Tatsuichiro Funatsu, Yoichi Osaka, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binsu, Jin Xiongbo, Huang Jingzhai, Yuan Shu, Takashi Moriyama, and Wu Yunyi Zhai, with Ren Yunpeng as the Director-General. Guests included Chief of the Army Information Department Idebuchi, Chief of the Fleet Information Department Matsushima, Captain Kameda, Chief of the Information Department of the Embassy Office Matsudaira, Vice Consul Fukuma, and Director of Propaganda Liang. Entertainment included songs of famous Chinese and Japanese songs by Tomiko Hattori, Shen Ping, and Gu Ying, which were highly praised. Over three thousand Chinese and Japanese guests attended, the atmosphere was enthusiastic, and unprecedented. The conference proceeded in an orderly manner under the direction of Director-General Ren Yunpeng. At the beginning of the conference, Lu Feng, the monthly director of the Press Association, delivered an introductory speech, followed by speeches by representatives from various countries. The speeches are recorded below:

Speech by Lu Feng: Everyone, last year today, the countries of Greater East Asia, based on the spirit of East Asian morality, issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. In this year, the countries of Greater East Asia have worked together to strive for victory. This is gratifying. Especially for the compatriots in Shanghai, who have suffered under the oppression of the British and Americans in the past, they have been unable to bear the suffering. Whether or not there will be countless more instances of Anglo-American aggression depends on whether we win the Pacific War. Therefore, it is even more necessary for the East Asian nations to put into practice the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. On this anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Press Association and other organizations, in order to strengthen public understanding of the Greater East Asia Declaration, are holding this speech meeting as a celebration. We have specially invited representatives from various countries to speak, starting with Mr. Li, the representative from China. (The structure of the speech can be found in today's newspaper dispatch).

Speech by Representative Yasui Gengo

The first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just passed, and now we are celebrating the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration. I am truly honored to have the opportunity to say a few words of celebration in front of everyone, and I am personally very pleased.

Anglo-American Forces Invaded East Asia. China and Japan, whether viewed from a historical perspective, a geographical perspective, an ethnic perspective, or a cultural perspective, have a close and inseparable relationship. This is something that everyone already knows very well. However, why have the Chinese and Japanese peoples been in conflict with each other in recent years, engaging in wars that shed blood? Thinking about it is truly regrettable! Not only is it regrettable, but from a broader perspective, it can also be said to be a tragedy of East Asia. Why did this tragedy of East Asia occur? There are many reasons, and it is truly impossible to explain them all in a few words. Some of the responsibility lies with the Japanese, and some of the responsibility lies with the Chinese. Those who wished to avoid this tragedy of East Asia and strive to improve the relationship between China and Japan, hoping to establish an ideal good neighborly and friendly relationship, were indeed few in number, but they existed in both China and Japan. For example, your country's Mr. Zhang Zhidong, Mr. Liu Kunyi, and Mr. Sun Wen were representative figures, and Mr. Arao Sei, Mr. Nezu Hajime, and Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, who passed away not long ago, were also their representatives on the Japanese side. However, although these great figures in China and Japan made efforts, the result was still failure, and the tragedy of East Asia occurred. What is the reason for this? What is the cause? In my opinion, although there were indeed great figures and pioneers among the wise men of both China and Japan at that time, there were no great statesmen in the court, that is, those working in the government, and the people had not fully understood the major trends of the world. However, this is still a very small cause in proportion, and the greater cause lies elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, what is it? You must know. That is the enormous power of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia. This point, I am sure, need not be elaborated upon in front of you today. Why? Because you already understand it very well. Do you know what the Opium War was all about? A great British politician once said, "No other war has exposed Britain's immorality more nakedly than the Opium War." The British themselves, who had committed the crime, also said that it was an extremely immoral war. Even if it were not Mr. Lin Zexu, anyone else would have been filled with righteous indignation. In short, Britain was engaging in aggression against China and East Asia in terms of politics and territory. Seeing this situation, Japan resolutely implemented the Meiji Restoration domestically, reorganizing national affairs, and externally, it cooperated with China, striving to protect East Asia and planning to eliminate the enemy Anglo-American forces. Why was this? Because China was the first to be invaded by the Anglo-Americans, and the next to be invaded would be Japan. Therefore, in July of the 4th year of Meiji, which is 1871, China and Japan signed a treaty of friendship and a trade agreement. This was a treaty concluded by China and Japan on a completely equal footing.

Conspiracy to Separate Sino-Japanese Cooperation At this time, Britain and the United States were extending their clutches towards China, engaging in aggression. Not only did they conclude unequal treaties and expand the power of their concessions, but they even planned to partition China. At the same time, in order to obstruct cooperation between Japan and China and prevent them from resisting, they cleverly implemented a policy of separating Japan and China. Unfortunately, their conspiracy succeeded, and the war between Japan and the Qing Dynasty was due to their trickery. As a result of this war, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed. In this treaty, the most humiliating clauses began to appear, and there were also unequal treaties between China and Japan. However, compared with the harsh unequal treaties concluded between Britain and the United States and the Qing Dynasty, it can be considered light. Since then, Anglo-American aggression against China has become increasingly severe, and Japan has had no choice but to confront Britain and the United States. Thus, in form, Japan also oppressed China in the same way as Britain and the United States. This is a truly regrettable thing! In this way, the relationship between China and Japan became increasingly worse, and with the addition of Anglo-American incitement, the tragedy of East Asia that exists today was brewed. In short, the mutual hostility between China and Japan can be said to be entirely the result of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia.

The Dawn of East Asia Has Finally Arrived But the dawn of East Asia has finally arrived. This is the opening of the Greater East Asia War. Ladies and gentlemen, in this Greater East Asia War, Japan has swept away the Anglo-American aggressive forces within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, Japan has returned the concessions to China, abolished extraterritoriality, and recently concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance to replace the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. At the same time, it has abandoned various attached documents. If Japan had other intentions, it would never have abandoned extraterritoriality and all its interests. This also proves Japan's moral spirit. On the one hand, the Pan-Asianism advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen has also largely been achieved. Cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan is the most troublesome and opposed thing for Britain and the United States. Now, not only is the relationship between China and Japan already like this, but Japan has also recognized the independence of the Philippines and Burma, and is making every effort to assist Mr. Jiang Shila Baus, who is striving to liberate India, to form a provisional Indian government, and has allowed the East Indian Islands to become independent in the future. The Greater East Asia Declaration is being implemented in this way. What is the reason for this? Because the power of Britain and the United States has been eliminated.

The Foundation for Final Victory Has Been Laid However, Britain and the United States, who want to destroy this Greater East Asia peace construction, are now attacking with all their strength. However, ladies and gentlemen, Japan, together with China and the other allies of Greater East Asia and the allied state of Manchukuo, is working together to crush Britain and the United States, and the foundation for final victory has already been laid. No matter how strong Britain and the United States are, in order to achieve our ideals and to put into practice our belief in liberating East Asia, we must fight on. A war with ideals and beliefs will surely be won. Facts speak louder than words. Are not the great achievements in the sea battle east of Taiwan and the great achievements in the sea battles east of the Philippines and in the Leyte Gulf good evidence? On this first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, I join with you in celebrating this anniversary from the bottom of my heart, and I pray that the day when East Asia is liberated will come soon.

Speech by Representative Liu Gui from Manchukuo

The allied nation of Japan is leading the Greater East Asia War, which has already entered the decisive stage. The army, navy, and air force have all achieved brilliant results. Today, as we hold the first anniversary celebration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand ceremony and express my thoughts. In retrospect, the development of the mechanical revolution by the enemies of Britain and America has only been in the last 150 years of the world's five thousand years of history. In the past, among the nations of Greater East Asia, such as the Huns, Mongols, Turks, and Indians, there have also been historical facts of entering Europe. Therefore, it is by no means as arrogant and conceited as the Europeans and Americans believe that the white race is the leader of the world and can arbitrarily trample on the various parts of Greater East Asia, implementing their so-called responsibilities, drawings, unilateral transactions, or various inhumane and unequal aggressive means to treat us, the nations of Greater East Asia. The enemies of America and Britain even call it "protection" for us, to develop so-called "happiness" for us. Their so-called "protection" is actually to turn our lands of Greater East Asia into their colonies or to become their de facto colonies. The enemies of America and Britain trample on our lands of Greater East Asia, dare to insult us, the nations of Greater East Asia, with arrogant and shameless words. This is a deep shame and hatred for us. Therefore, the responsibility for the Greater East Asia Holy War should be borne by all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, rising up together, fighting shoulder to shoulder, uniting with the allied Japanese Empire as one, adhering to the belief that we will surely win, sharing weal and woe, and striving for final victory. On behalf of the people of Manchukuo, I express our determination to be of one mind and one heart, and to diligently advance toward the completion of the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

Speech by Representative Wei Xian from the Philippines

Fellow compatriots, one year ago today, the supreme leaders of the seven countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concluded a solemn alliance, vowing to cooperate and collaborate permanently in order to establish a new order in East Asia. This new order is based on five major principles: coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, development of economic prosperity, and contribution to world peace.

One year ago today, these free and independent nations, under the brave leadership of Japan, held a meeting with the sincerity of the people of Greater East Asia, eliminating the minor differences between each other and sweeping away the rights and wrongs that Western imperialists had manipulated in the past.

One year ago, we, these oppressed East Asian powers, awoke from our slumber and discovered a common soul. This soul, after hundreds of years of being divided and destroyed by the insatiable British and Americans, had almost completely disappeared.

One year ago today, hundreds of millions of Asians were liberated from the hands of Anglo-American financial groups. With unprecedented joy, they welcomed the historic Greater East Asia Declaration from Tokyo, Japan, and vowed to defend their sacred land with unwavering loyalty, preventing the encroachment of Anglo-American imperialism. When necessary, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to prevent Japan's newly established bonds of kinship and understanding with us from being harmed.

The Deep Significance of the Joint Declaration The Joint Declaration is a proper expression of Japan's efforts to unite the nations of Asia for the Japanese people. For the Chinese people, it is a sweeping away of their former semi-colonial status. But for the Filipino people, the meaning is even deeper and more far-reaching. This is the true Great Charter, which finally freed the Philippines from slavery and returned it to the embrace of East Asia. The East is originally the land where we grew up. For four hundred years, the Filipino people have been constantly fighting for freedom, first against Spain and then against the United States. For centuries, the noble traditions of the Filipino people have been mercilessly trampled on by the United States. Culturally, they could not resist the invasion, and economically, the situation was even worse. Under the oppression of the American regime, the Philippine economy was completely in the hands of speculators on Wall Street in New York. The United States never thought of improving Philippine industry, because it feared that it would compete with American industry in the future. American money is the cross that strangles the independence of the Filipino people.

Freedom and Independence Have Now Been Realized But today, the Filipino people are breathing the heroic spirit of a new era, filled with fresh ideals, thinking that they are now an independent nation, able to control their own destiny and put into practice the sacred principles of the common goals of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is truly an honor. In the past, the Philippines had no freedom or independence. Now they have freedom and independence. In the past, the Philippines was completely in a passive position, and its culture was dominated by the American nation. Now it is piecing together its inherent and beautiful culture from broken pieces. In the past, it could not be economically independent. Now, although it is still weak, it can strive to rely on itself and cooperate with its Asian brothers to create its own destiny. Because the Filipino people deeply understand the doctrines contained in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Philippine nation is working with its natural brotherly countries in harmony and cooperation. Therefore, this great document, which was issued a year ago, is being commemorated by all the people of East Asia today and will be regarded as the Bible. When we march toward Anglo-American imperialism, we will jointly draw lessons and inspiration from it. It must be closely integrated with the political education system of all East Asian youths. It must serve as the foundation for promoting culture, so that the various trends of thought prevalent among all the people of Asia can proceed in this correct direction, which is in line with our Filipino traditions. This important meaning must be promoted to industrial leaders as a tool for managing their enterprises. From the stage, on the stage, in the theater,

In schools, the meaning of the Greater East Asia Declaration must be advocated. If so, in a few years, the minds of Asians will be filled with a broad sense of patriotism, contributing to the construction of the welfare of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Defend the Sacred Territory of the Motherland Now, when Japanese friends are waging war to drive the American invaders out of the Philippine coast, the Philippines is facing a rigorous test. The Philippine government, under the wise and capable leadership of President Laurel, is deeply respected and trusted by the people. The cooperation between the government and the people, for the sake of the nation's dignity and for the sake of the Co-Prosperity Sphere's claims, is determined to defend the sacred territory inherited from our ancestors. This land has been sprinkled with the blood of heroes and martyrs. We will have even more generations of martyrs, but not only for the claims of the Philippines itself, but also for the claims of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Commemorative Speech Meeting by Five Organizations (Continued from page 3)

Now, the United States wants to return to the Philippines and trample on Philippine territory. The American army is attempting to reconquer the Philippines. A fierce war is unfolding in the Leyte area, but because the United States has no just cause, it will not achieve victory. For forty years, the United States could not give the Philippines independence. This time, they are using the excuse of liberating the Filipinos from Japanese rule to invade the Philippine coast again. If the American government and people are generous and give us independence, we will be their responsible representatives forever. On the other hand, the Japanese government gave the Philippines freedom and independence without waiting for us to apply and without any restrictions. The Filipino people are therefore extremely grateful. The leaders of the Philippines, harboring this sentiment, decided to sever all relations with the United States. The Filipino people are very willing to maintain friendly relations with Japan, China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and other nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. But what I want to ask is, what achievements have we made in establishing close friendship, enjoying common prosperity, spreading the inherent culture of the East, or promoting freedom and education? If not, we should rededicate ourselves from today onwards to this common claim of the Asian nations. Do not be impulsive with your own feelings. We must help each other. We must die together and live together.

### Speech by Indian Representative Naheke Jiangte

Today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. It is a true honor for me to be able to speak to you.

One year ago today, the news of the Joint Declaration from Tokyo, Japan, gave the countries of Greater East Asia the goal of striving for permanent prosperity and peace. This declaration was initiated by the former Prime Minister of Japan, General Tojo. General Tojo must have carefully considered the past and present development of the East Asian countries, and then speculated on the future destiny of the countries, and obtained this correct goal of striving.

The devastation of British imperialism India has been devastated by Britain for about two hundred years. Britain willfully plundered to fill its own pockets, diminished Indian culture, and promoted British-style so-called "civilization," even trying to erase India's great history. They made the Indian people poor, so they could get cheap workers to use. In order to maintain its superior position in the world, Britain issued military bonds, absorbing all of India's resources. As a result, India became a coolie nation, only earning money for its British master, and also becoming an employee and servant of the British Empire.

Burma has suffered great humiliation under British rule for the past sixty years. Its forests and mineral resources have flowed to the British market. The Burmese people, like the Indians, have become farmers in despair, making money for their British masters. It was thanks to our powerful ally Japan that Burma was fortunate enough to regain its right to survival.

Speaking of the Philippines, initially the Spaniards used the excuse of promoting Christianity, but in fact, they were engaged in looting. Later, the Americans came, claiming to be the saviors of the Philippines, driving away the Spaniards, and starting an even more blatant plunder of resources, invisibly strangling the lifeline of the Filipinos. Now the Filipinos have enjoyed complete freedom and independence, and are truly grateful for the goodwill and lofty sacrifice of the Japanese government.

The pain of the governed countries Other governed countries have also suffered the same pain. For example, China, the British knew that China's land was vast and difficult to swallow, so they were as ferocious as demons, wantonly destroying and poisoning, using force to import opium and implementing humiliating treaties to seek private gains, making China financially and politically enslaved. Later, the Americans appeared and colluded with the Central Nationalists to jointly exploit China's rich resources. Now the pests have been eliminated, and China, under the leadership of the National Government, is moving towards the path of recovery.

As for Japan, it is different from other countries. Japan has far-sighted plans, preventing the devil from spreading poison on its land, and has been very successful. Therefore, in the past hundred years, Japan has become a great power in the world, enjoying peace, prosperity, and harmony.

The countries of Greater East Asia have now ushered in a new era. After the expulsion of British and American forces, there is hope for peace and prosperity. Japan is in a leading position, restoring peace to those countries that were previously plundered.

One billion people have been liberated from now on Japan is not only concerned about the peace of Greater East Asia, but also its main goal is to truly establish world peace. Japan has reviewed the past and present misfortunes of the governed countries and has come to the conclusion that there must be a kind of unity and mutual cooperation between the countries of Greater East Asia.

Tens of millions of East Asian people have been bound in the past and have now been liberated from the shackles of the British and Americans. Now the war is spreading all over the world, which is truly unprecedented in history. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is actually a war to liberate the entire Asian continent. Now the time is near. The East Asian national movement will surely achieve success with effort. The new order of East Asia and the new order of the world are one and the same. The deadly blows given to the enemy by the Japanese Imperial Army, and the meritorious deeds of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force are praised by all the nations of East Asia, and are also admired by the continents of the world.

Finally, I would like to say a few words for India. Indian patriots know that this is the best time to break away from British oppression. Greater East Asia is like a big family, and everyone in the family works together harmoniously. Therefore, all the countries of Greater East Asia must regard the same family as their focus. We must exchange ideas and opinions, maintain warm friendship with each other, and helping others is our respective duty.

### Donations to the Child Welfare Association; Enthusiastic Pledges from All Circles

The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association, in order to raise funds for the education and upbringing of orphans, has launched a fundraising campaign with a target of five million yuan. It convened a full committee meeting the day before yesterday, attended by over fifty people including Lin Kanghou, Wu Yun Zhai, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Luo Hongyi, and Wang Zhenchuan. Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered the opening speech. Standing Committee members Zhao Jinqing and Sun Ruihuang reported on the association's affairs and financial situation. Ding Boxiong then reported that the association has now set a fundraising target of five million yuan, which can only cover half a year's expenses based on current prices. However, based on the association's past fundraising performance, it is believed that this fundraising campaign will definitely raise ten million yuan for the full year's expenses. After Chen Binhe proposed that the committee members present should make pledges first, Luo Hongyi and Ding Boji immediately pledged five hundred thousand yuan each, Chen Binhe, Wang Zhenchuan, and Xiang Kangyuan pledged two hundred thousand yuan each, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yun Zhai, Fang Zijun, Le Fucheng, Ding Huikang, Zhang Xiangwen, Xiong Mao Yanwen, and Hao Mingsan pledged one hundred thousand yuan each, Chen Xunxun, Sun Wenhao, Fang Yunxian, and Huang Jingwan pledged fifty thousand yuan each, and Wu Shenzhi and Xie Youting pledged twenty thousand yuan each. It can be seen that all circles are deeply concerned about children, and their sincerity is deeply admired.
