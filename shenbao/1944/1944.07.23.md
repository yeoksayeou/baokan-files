### Awakening Scientific Consciousness - Starting with "Dart Throwing" -

— Jiang Yugui

Recently, walking on the road, I often see children throwing small wooden sticks at each other, shouting repeatedly, "Dart throw, dart throw!" This is similar to wielding the Azure Dragon Crescent Blade and the Pear Blossom Spear; the "dart" is Huang Tianba's, in reality Er Dun's, secret weapon, while the Azure Dragon Crescent Blade and the Pear Blossom Spear are the weapons of Guan Yu and Xue Dingshan. However, even if today's students all become Huang Tianbas and Xue Dingshans in the future, will China become good?

Foreign students, on the other hand, throw model airplanes on the street and play with toy trains and machine guns at home, constantly stimulating their scientific and military literacy and inventive intelligence. That is why foreign countries have ultimately become modern nations.

Most Chinese middle school students read romance novels, write short essays for newspapers, or try hard to put out small literary publications. They are always as afraid of science as they are of tigers and wolves. Foreign middle school students, on the other hand, read science magazines, some publishing their very simple inventions, and some learning to make models of airplanes and warships according to the instructions. As a result, the thinking of Chinese youth is focused on personal enjoyment, romantic fantasies, and a "don't care" attitude towards the nation. The thinking of foreign youth, on the other hand, is progressive, practical, and down-to-earth.

Chinese university students study law, because law is fashionable, and they are bearing the mission of transforming China into a country ruled by law. Chinese university students study commerce, because the banking sector is prestigious and comfortable. Chinese university students study literature; some study ancient books, hoping to preserve or promote national essence, some study Western literature to improve China's corruption, and others study politics and economics. After graduation, if they have connections, they can immediately become high-ranking officials.

Foreign countries have agricultural universities, industrial universities, colonization universities, fisheries schools, and mining schools. Those university students are like workers. They don't have the titles of lawyers, bankers, or politicians in their heads. They only know how to work hard to learn technology, hoping to become technologists in the future.

However, foreign countries have become scientific nations, while Chinese villages are always closed off by feudal ideas. The means of production are not improved. The few light industrial factories around the major cities use a small amount of machinery, but the machinery is bought from foreign countries. Ultimately, Chinese products are inferior to foreign ones, and China becomes an economic market.

But then again, why are students, middle school students, and university students not interested in science? The reason is that Chinese parents and educators do not work hard to promote science; or it is due to economic constraints. But why don't parents give their children the money they spend on Azure Dragon Crescent Blades to buy toy trains? Why don't educators use the money they spend on establishing universities and middle schools to open a simple industrial school?

The fundamental reason is that Chinese people lack a scientific understanding, so they are unwilling to give their second generation a scientific education, and at the same time, they have a kind of fear of difficulty towards science, so they carelessly do not delve into it.

But if we think carefully, or look through history, and look at the paths of development of other countries, is there any other way to develop into a modern nation besides scientific means? I'm afraid not. All modern nations have gone through a scientific stage. So, unless our country does not want to become a modern nation, the approach to science is an unavoidable thing. Since it is unavoidable, how can everyone hold a careless attitude and not delve into it?

The evolution of countries in the world, if divided by science, we can divide it into three stages: the first is the pre-scientific era, the second is the era of scientific invention, and the third is the era of applied science. The first era is the era of theocratic politics dominating society, where people live under a kind of spiritual constraint! The second era is the period of enlightenment of modern nations, when scientists such as Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Watt, Darwin... etc. invented scientific applications. The third era is the era of applied science. In addition to material life, the application of science sometimes reaches the realm of spiritual life. Now the advanced countries in the world have all reached the third era.

We Orientals have a kind of advantage, that is, we can surpass the second era and leap from the first era to the third era. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan worked hard to adopt the essence of science and technology, and as a result, it steadily surpassed the second era and became a nation of the third era.

As long as China works hard, it can of course surpass the third era, and what is the tool for this transcendence? It is "science."

Now China is still stuck in the first era, because everyone still does not have a scientific understanding. However, in the first era, the ideals of all lawyers and others, such as transforming China into a rule of law, are like the ideals of children practicing flying swords and palm thunder. It is an impossible to realize "utopia." Only after going through the scientific stage and China becoming a country of the third era can other ideals be realized. Therefore, from any point of view, understanding science is really the first priority.

Now the time is of the essence, everyone urgently needs to approach science in a crazy way, engage in learning as much as possible, break the previous shrinking, and eliminate the mentality of neglect.

If China does not break out of the circle of the first era in a certain period, and does not use science to realize a nation of the third era, the Chinese nation will be destroyed, or with utopian ideas, become the second "Gypsy" in the world!

Now some people in China have become wandering Gypsies. They cannot live in their peaceful hometowns because of political and economic reasons, so they wander to other places. There are no families to provide food in other places, no property, no jobs, and they wander the streets day by day. Haven't they become Gypsies?

However, the Chinese people are always careless and do not care about the overall situation. Even if some people have full pockets, they can only be happy for a short time, and soon they will become Gypsies with the majority of people, or the entire nation!

Now the only indicator is that everyone should start from now and recognize "science"!

Beyond gratitude, I am filled with fear. Now the war situation is extremely serious. In order to break through this unprecedented national crisis, the only way is for the nation to unite and crush the enemy's Anglo-American counterattack. The government will internally strive to closely integrate political and military strategies and strengthen various measures for national governance. At the same time, it will resolutely implement measures to carry out the war, striving for certain victory. Externally, it will consistently adhere to the previous diplomatic policy, thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and complete the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the people will trust and cooperate with the government's determination, truly recognize the gravity of the war situation, and without falling into anxiety, calmly and diligently overcome all difficulties, and contribute all their strength to the country.

The Newly Appointed Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech Affirms the Belief in Certain Victory

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Koiso gave a newly appointed broadcast speech at 7:00 PM on the 22nd, after the completion of the cabinet formation, expressing his fervent belief in fulfilling the duties of completing the war and the people and breaking through the war situation, and calling for the rise of 100 million people. The main points of the broadcast are as follows: This time, I, together with my ally, Admiral Yonai of the Navy, jointly received the imperial command to form a cabinet in this critical situation. I am filled with fear and gratitude. I can only rely on the imperial prestige and the united cooperation of the people, sacrificing myself and serving my duties to appease the imperial heart. The true meaning of the Holy War has been clearly stated in the imperial rescript, and everyone in the government and the public knows it. Moreover, the goals of the people's efforts have been clarified since the start of the war, and there is no need to repeat them. However, at this time, I still want to say one thing, that is, in the face of the current national crisis, our people's beliefs and their practice must be more thorough. The Greater East Asia War occurred after the Sino-Japanese Incident. This is based on the expression of the lofty national essence and the traditional moral spirit of the people. Therefore, we have established remarkable achievements abroad and increased our war capabilities at home. However, we must humbly and frankly reflect on the various situations in the country and give play to the inherent moral spirit of the people. We must also purify our hearts and cultivate ourselves. All 200 million of our compatriots should understand the true meaning of the national essence in the long-standing spiritual legacy, and understand the importance of the responsibilities we citizens bear at present. Therefore, we should stand up and open up a new world, bravely move forward, and firmly believe in certain victory. Now the seriousness of the war situation is in front of us. Therefore, for the sake of the revival of the island nation and the happiness of all mankind in the world, there is no other way but to devote all our strength. Our 100 million people should use the inherent traditional moral spirit and the belief in certain victory to overcome difficulties and preserve the glory of the country. This is the only way. I, without considering my abilities, intend to jointly promote morality with the people from this point of view, in order to enhance the material and spiritual war capabilities, strengthen close ties with allied countries externally, and move forward to achieve the war objectives. I believe that the people will surely resolutely strive for the war situation with the unity of gold and stone, and further cooperate with the government's decisive strategy. There is no doubt about this.

### Admiral Nomura Appointed as Military Councilor

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Admiral Takakuni Nomura, who was the Commander of the Kure Naval Base and then appointed as Minister of the Navy in the Tojo cabinet on the 17th, in place of Mitsumasa Yonai, was appointed as a Military Councilor on the 22nd.

### Establishment of the Powerful Japanese Cabinet; The National Government Specifically Issues a Statement; Advancing Together with the Spirit of Allied Righteousness

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the emergency and refresh the people's hearts, the Tojo cabinet in Japan carried out a general resignation on the 18th of this month. The cabinet organized by Generals Koiso and Yonai has completed its organization on the 20th, and the list of cabinet members has also been announced. The National Government specifically issued a statement, stating that the National Government is determined to maintain the spirit of alliance and righteousness of the past, concentrate human and material resources, and advance together towards defeating the Anglo-Americans. The statement of the National Government is recorded below: "This time, the Tojo cabinet, in order to deal with the major war situation and refresh the people's hearts, carried out a general resignation on the 18th of this month. The successor cabinet has officially announced that General Kuniaki Koiso and General Mitsumasa Yonai will jointly organize a powerful cabinet.

Looking back at the Tojo cabinet, during the period of two years and nine months, it received the declaration of war and launched the Greater East Asia War, destroying the Anglo-American invasion bases in East Asia in one fell swoop. It also signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our country and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, so that the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere could be laid. Its great achievements will be remembered forever.

Now that the new cabinet has been established, it will surely have a more powerful new posture to adapt to this new situation. The National Government will still maintain the spirit of alliance and righteousness of the past, concentrate human and material resources, and advance together towards destroying the Anglo-Americans in order to obtain final victory. We hereby declare."

Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The new Japanese cabinet was formed on the 22nd, and our Foreign Minister Chu specifically issued the following remarks: "The situation in the East is the most tense. Not long after I returned home, General Tojo soon received the declaration of war on December 8 and declared war on the Anglo-Americans, destroying the Anglo-American invasion bases in East Asia in one fell swoop. On the one hand, he signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our country, and on the other hand, he held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued a joint declaration. Internally, he completed the national wartime system based on the standpoint of total war. Externally, he united the nations of Greater East Asia and established the foundation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. His great achievements have long been known to the world. This time, in order to deal with the current major war situation, he resolutely retired and gave way to the capable, and changed to Generals Koiso and Yonai to take on the arduous task and form a cabinet with a strong wartime system in order to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, General Koiso was appointed as Prime Minister, and General Yonai was appointed as Navy Minister, so that the army and navy were more united in order to cope with the emergency. The Foreign Minister is still Mr. Shigemitsu, who has always been the highest economic advisor to our country and is admired by the people. It is expected that the future of Sino-Japanese relations will still maintain the spirit of the past, and we will cooperate more closely to create a different color for Greater East Asia.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The new Japanese cabinet has been formed, and General Staff Officer Bao issued the following remarks: "Looking back on the Tojo cabinet since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, it destroyed the Anglo-American invading forces in East Asia in one fell swoop and laid the foundation for certain victory, which is truly a glorious achievement in history. Now that General Koiso is the Prime Minister, assisted by Army Minister Marshal Sugiyama and Navy Minister General Yonai, we know that the army and navy will cooperate closely, and there will be amazing developments in the future of the war. I deeply hope that the people of the country will follow the Chairman's instructions, work hard to increase production, and cooperate to complete the victory of the war. I also hope that the Chongqing side will realize their mistake as soon as possible, not double the Anglo-American propaganda, promote overall peace, and realize the common undertaking of a major mission.

Salute to the New Cabinet

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese cabinet was formed, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi telegraphed Ambassador Cai, instructing him to pay respects to the new Japanese cabinet and convey his congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: "Tokyo, Ambassador Cai Ziping, this time the Japanese cabinet is reorganized, and the strength is even greater to cope with the emergency. This is very gratifying. From Prime Minister Koiso onwards, many are old friends. I hope that you will use this opportunity to pay respects and convey my congratulations. No separate telegram will be sent. Chu Minyi."

Our Government and Public Are Delighted

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the list of new cabinet members of the allied nation was announced, all sectors of our government and public expressed their delight. The point that the new Japanese cabinet will be even more powerful has completely met our initial expectations. This is not only because the new Prime Minister General Koiso personally has skilled political hands and brains and an actively progressive personality, but also because the ministers of various departments, such as Minister of Home Affairs Tatsuo Odate, are all first-class talents who are highly regarded by the Japanese public and are famous at home and abroad. We can especially promote two points from this new cabinet selection: one is that the Japanese diplomatic policy will

Remain Unchanged

The re-election of Mr. Shigemitsu, who has vast diplomatic experience, as Foreign Minister can prove this, and there is no need to elaborate. Therefore, Mr. Shigemitsu's concurrent appointment as Minister of Greater East Asia, with his rich diplomatic experience, can be said to be exceptionally appropriate for uniting East Asia. In particular, Mr. Shigemitsu has deep connections with our country, so not only can we know that Japan's policy towards China will not change at all, but also from the overall character of the new cabinet, we can infer that it will be further strengthened. As for Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, who was re-elected as Minister of Finance, he is a financial expert in Japan and used to serve as the highest economic advisor to our government not long ago. In the future, he will cooperate more closely with our country in finance, which is naturally expected. This can also be advocated in passing. The first point is that the character of this Japanese cabinet is more clear, so its political power in guiding the decisive battle will

Be Stronger

This can be proved by the personal experience of each of the cabinet members. For example, Minister of Education Harushige Nikan and Minister of Health and Welfare Hisatada Hirose, the former is a military man with a meticulous staff talent, and the latter is a meritorious figure in the sound grassroots system. As for Justice Minister Hiromasa Matsuzaka, he has held various positions in the judicial sector. In the past five years, he served as the Chief Prosecutor of the Tokyo High Court, equivalent to the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court in our country, and then rose to the Chief Prosecutor General, and has always been a famous figure in the legal world. What is particularly noteworthy is Minister of Home Affairs Odate, because his personality is extremely strong and his skills are brisk. In the past, while serving as the governor of Fukui Prefecture, he resigned due to disagreements with Tatsuo Yamazaki and other ministers of home affairs. He usually disliked political parties and refused to compromise. In the early days of the Greater East Asia War, when the Special City of Shonan was established, he

Was Known for Hard Work

and was appointed as the first mayor. Amidst the flames of war, he devoted himself to the restoration and construction of the entire city, and with a rough style, he restored Shonan to its pre-war situation in just over a year. When Tokyo was reorganized into a metropolis last year, he was invited by the Japanese government to be in charge of the preparations, and when the metropolitan system was completed, he became the first governor. Summarizing his life experience, he is quite creative. It is not difficult to predict that he will use his strong skills to promote the domestic wartime system when he takes office as Minister of Home Affairs during the war. Also, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada has a spirit and perseverance that are beyond the average, and he is especially good at words. Therefore, former Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi often praised him as a "politician who gallops in the midst of thousands of troops and horses." The strength of his ability is not difficult to imagine. As for Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, he is an industry tycoon who used to serve as Minister of Commerce and Industry. Under the Greater East Asia War, he engaged in

Munitions Production

with all his might. Therefore, in the Tojo cabinet, he was appointed as a Minister of State, taking charge of planning and increasing munitions production, and made outstanding achievements. Former Minister of Transportation and Communications Maeda was a senior member of the Seiyukai party and was usually taciturn. He once said that "the secret to living in the world is not to make meaningless remarks." His spirit of doing more and saying less is a representative of the Japanese national character. Minister of State Machida is known for his careful consideration. Minister of State Kodama has successively served as Minister of Colonial Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs. Minister of State Ogata is currently the editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's three major newspapers, and is a

Powerful Figure

in the Japanese newspaper industry. All of the above individuals have a firm and active personality, and with their enthusiasm for not fearing difficulties, they are taking charge of various departments of the decisive battle politics under Prime Minister Koiso. The strength and lineup of the cabinet can be said to be unprecedented, and with the addition of the army elder Marshal Sugiyama as the head of the army and Admiral Yonai as the head of the navy, the administration of decisive military affairs has these two pillars, which is enough to cope with any difficult situation. In summary, we can know that the cabinet members of the new cabinet include veterans, young people, those from political parties, civilian commentators, industry tycoons, and staff members. It can be said that they have recruited

Talents from All Walks of Life

and completed the situation of great unity. Therefore, it can be asserted that the strength of the cabinet and its ability to gain the trust of Japan and abroad are undoubtedly strong. As a result, it is expected that a new situation in the Greater East Asia War will unfold due to the emergence of this powerful cabinet. We can also absolutely trust that we will work together with the allied countries with a more determined determination in the future to strive for victory.

### Chairman Wang's Telegram Congratulating Japanese Prime Minister Koiso; Also Telegraphed Former Prime Minister Tojo

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Generals Koiso and Yonai have been entrusted with the great responsibility of forming a new cabinet, which has now been completed. General Koiso will serve as Prime Minister. Chairman Wang has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Koiso to offer his congratulations. The original text is as follows: Ambassador Cai in Tokyo forwards to His Excellency Prime Minister Koiso of the Japanese Cabinet: As the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, Your Excellency has been entrusted with this great responsibility to handle this extraordinary situation. You will surely be able to seize the opportunity and powerfully advance the country's established goals, thereby achieving lasting glory. I also wish you good health and well-being. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following the resignation of the Tojo Cabinet, Chairman Wang sent a telegram to former Prime Minister Tojo. The original telegram reads: Ambassador Cai in Tokyo forwards to His Excellency Former Prime Minister Tojo of the Japanese Cabinet: As the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, it is deeply regrettable that your cabinet resigned unanimously to address this extraordinary situation. Since Your Excellency accepted this great responsibility, you have been resolute and decisive, overcoming all obstacles to resolve the current situation, eliminate the British and American forces in the Pacific, promote the unity of one billion people in Greater East Asia based on international morality, and lay the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Your great achievements shine throughout the world. It is hoped that you will continue to cooperate tirelessly to complete this great undertaking. This is what is truly hoped for. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.

Japanese Dispatching Large Forces to Attack; Intense Fighting in Hengyang

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced the situation in Hengyang on the 21st as follows: The Japanese army has not abandoned its determination to attack Hengyang and is currently dispatching several divisions to attack the city. The fierce fighting between the two sides has lasted for twenty-five days. The Chongqing army is now increasing troop deployments to aid Hengyang and is advancing from the west and south of the city. Therefore, the fighting in this area is extremely intense. Furthermore, the Japanese army, located in the streets of Hengyang, is attempting to prevent the Chongqing army's reinforcements from joining forces with the defending troops under heavy pressure in the city.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch: Zhang Pingqun, a spokesperson for the Chongqing regime, issued a statement on the 19th, stating that the Japanese army is gradually reinforcing the Hunan front with large numbers of troops and heavy artillery. Therefore, the battle of Hengyang has reached its climax. The Chongqing army dares not predict the outcome of this battle.

督戰隊迫驅作戰
The Supervisor Team Forcing Combat

Hunan Front, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 20,000 defending Chongqing troops inside the city of Hengyang are completely isolated due to being surrounded by the Japanese army. Although the Chongqing army's resistance is generally weak, the resistance of the Chongqing front line is quite strong. It has been determined that this is due to the Chongqing side dispatching a fighting force that shoots and kills anyone retreating from the front line from behind. Therefore, one day, the Japanese army waited for an opportunity to take advantage of the dark night to break into the Chongqing army's position in Hengyang city. However, around 9 PM that night, they suddenly saw Chongqing army activity. About a large Chongqing army unit, shouting "kill," counterattacked. As a result, the Japanese army lured them to the front of the position and suddenly launched a fierce attack from the left, right, and center, annihilating most of them and pursuing the Chongqing army retreating into the city. At this time, the Chongqing army at the front sorrowfully roared and attacked again. This was actually because the machine gun supervisor team was forcing them to attack forward. According to an English operational order picked up in a certain area, American officers are serving as commanders in the Chongqing army. In order to ensure their own safety, the American army is driving the Chongqing army to fight the Japanese army. This kind of cruel behavior has been seen repeatedly on the Burma, India, and Southern fronts. The American army's attempt to use the Chongqing army as a sacrifice to destroy mainland China is self-evident.

### Fierce Fighting on the West Coast of Omiya Island; Japanese Army Bravely Responding; Enemy Suffers Over 4,000 Casualties in Two Landing Areas

Furthermore, at 8:00 AM, thirty transport ships carrying about half a division of troops landed in Agat Bay on the west coast of the island. The Japanese garrison troops immediately intercepted them, and fierce fighting is still underway. It has been determined that approximately 3,200 enemy soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Asan area and approximately 1,100 have died in Agat Bay, totaling 4,300.

### Zhengzhou Gradually Regaining its Former Appearance

Beiping, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese army occupied Dengzhou, people returned one after another, and Zhengzhou city is gradually regaining its former appearance.

### Enemy's Vicious Plot Foiled; German Political Situation Increasingly Stable; Frontline Generals Declare Loyalty to the Leader

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Xu Lede, the chief interviewer of Haitong News Agency, commented on the atrocities and results of the conspiracy to harm Führer Hitler, stating: Several German generals and colonels conspired to harm the Führer and seize power, but they were immediately purged. Reports from various places came in a few hours later, indicating that the National Socialist regime was very stable and any attempt at a coup would fail. Last night, precautionary measures were taken in the center of Berlin, which were very new and did not involve a single shot or barbed wire, indicating that they were fully prepared and everything was calm. The responsible parties have not yet revealed the names of those involved in the conspiracy and rebellion. After the police investigation, the German authorities will issue a detailed announcement. Based on the already announced announcement, the person who attempted to carry out the conspiracy was Colonel Stauffenberg. The conspirators deliberately fabricated rumors that the Führer had died and issued false orders, but the orders were not carried out and had no response. General Beck (who had already retired) was also one of those involved in the rebellion. Beck was removed from his position as Chief of the Army General Staff in 1938, and he has now lost his life. In summary, there are three results of the failure of this conspiracy: 1. The small group of conspirators who betrayed the country has now been purged. 2. The Führer appointed General Himmler as the commander of the domestic defense forces and General Guderian as the chief of the general staff. 3. No group of people in the entire country supported the conspiracy coup. From this, it can be seen that the National Socialist country is extremely stable, and no other system can meet the needs of the German people. The enemy's vicious plot to overthrow the country was foiled within an hour.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: Field Marshal Kluge, commander of the German forces in Western Europe, issued a declaration to his subordinates, expressing his continued loyalty to Führer Hitler. The text reads: Soldiers of the Western Front, a small number of dismissed officers attempted to kill the Führer, but the Führer was unharmed. Last night, he even broadcast to the people and soldiers that the criminals have been eliminated, domestic order is quite good, and the fighting at the front and rear continues. We soldiers are extremely indignant upon hearing this news. We will never allow a similar Austrian coup to occur as in 1918. We soldiers of the Western Front only know to continue fighting the enemy with unwavering determination and loyalty. Long live Führer Hitler, long live Germany. Furthermore, yesterday, the fighting on the Western Front continued as usual. The situation at the headquarters remained the same. Representative units at the front held a parade yesterday to show their loyalty to the Führer.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: General Weijie, commander of the German forces in Southeast Europe, recently telegraphed Führer Hitler, expressing his relief that the assassination attempt on the Führer failed and representing all German troops stationed in the Balkans in expressing their absolute loyalty. The commander of the 2nd German Mechanized Army Corps also telegraphed the Führer to express his loyalty. The commander of the German forces stationed in Norway also issued a statement to his subordinates regarding this matter.

The Rebellion Conspiracy Was a Flash in the Pan

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: Responsible parties here stated that after the Führer was unsuccessfully assassinated, Führer Hitler, Reich Marshal Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, German Army Commander Keitel, and Navy Commander Dönitz communicated by telephone and were able to control the situation throughout. At the same time, German dignitaries made contact with other departments of Germany. Revealing the details of this conspiracy, the mastermind who placed the time bomb was Colonel Stauffenberg, who is 37 years old. He was used by a small number of ambitious rebels to carry out their plans. Documents discovered within a few hours after the incident proved that the rebels had close contact with one of the anti-Axis countries. Before the execution of the mastermind, the relevant perpetrators were thoroughly investigated, and truthful evidence was obtained. The rebels were organized by a small number of retired generals and some important officers in the reserve army. These generals have already retired, so they have no connection with the military. They have no prestige on the front lines or in the country, so the orders issued by the rebels were not followed on the front lines or in the country. After the incident, the rebels used a means of transportation managed by a certain lower-ranking officer to issue orders to the front-line and domestic troops. Fortunately, those who received the orders were able to immediately realize that this was done by the rebels and did not comply. Well-informed sources in Berlin said that the rebels had seized certain means of transportation, forcing the German Führer to deliver a speech at night. When the German Führer, Reich Marshal Göring, and Admiral Dönitz delivered their speeches, they did not yet know how long or to what extent the rebels could use their means of transportation. The development of the situation later proved that this speech had a preventive effect, so as not to give the rebels any basis for their orders.

International Background Revealed Shockingly

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Dr. Ley, Minister of Organization of Germany, recently gave a speech to his munitions factory workers on Saturday, explaining the unsuccessful assassination attempt on the German Führer, with shocking revelations. It is said that the bomb used by the rebels was a super-heavy type imported from England. Dr. Ley also quoted a German worker to substantiate his claim. He also said that the rebels were partly responsible for the German army's retreat on the Eastern Front and in Italy. He claimed that this situation would change. The executed murderer had international relations, his mother was British, his wife was Polish, and his sister-in-law was Soviet. Therefore, his rebellion was an international conspiracy. When Dr. Ley began his speech, he clarified that the Führer's safety was related to Germany's survival. The Führer's safety this time was more important than a certain victory, because its meaning is that the Germans will be victorious. Dr. Ley then represented the German people in appealing to God to protect the Führer and shouted "Long live the Führer."

Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.

The Soviet army's target of attack was Limberg. The Soviet army launched an offensive on a broad front, attempting to encircle the city from the north and south at the same time.

Manuilsky is a Jew and has no ethnic connection with Ukraine, so everything can be ordered by Moscow.

According to a recent investigation by various entry permit offices, the daily amount is about 10,000 piculs, with the most at Hu-Min Road, Hongqiao Road, and the Jianghai Customs North Station. The sources are mostly transported from Wuhu, Dexian, Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Qingpu and other producing areas to Shanghai. Large quantities of new goods are stored in designated warehouses. The city has gradually decreased due to the thriving number of sealings. Yesterday (22nd) it has retreated to within eight passes.

In addition, the Statistics Department of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange will send personnel to investigate the assets of companies whose stock prices have fallen below par value and those that have newly increased capital, as a reference for the responsible authorities.

### Reassessing House Tax Values in Each District

The Municipal Finance Bureau issued orders to all its subordinate offices on June 19, year 33 of the Republic, to comply with these procedures.

### China Railway Restricts Passengers' Luggage

In order to prioritize wartime transportation, the Central China Railway Company has reduced passenger trains, leading to increased disorder and crowding inside the carriages. Many passengers are experiencing extreme inconvenience. The cause of this chaos and congestion is that many passengers are only concerned with their own convenience, bringing large packages of rice, flour, and other items into the carriages, often two to four per person. Bringing excessive luggage into the carriages not only makes travel unpleasant for passengers but also damages the passenger cars. It is reported that the company will implement restrictions starting July 26th, allowing each passenger to bring only one piece of luggage weighing no more than 15 kilograms into the carriage. Luggage exceeding this limit must be consigned to the baggage room for transport. Violators will be fined 600 yuan in national currency per item, as a fee for transportation and a penalty. China Railway hopes that passengers will exercise self-discipline in implementing this method.

### Old Zha Division Cracks Assault Case

The Old Zha Division recently cracked a brutal assault and rape case. The details are as follows:

Confidential Report from Mailbox

The Old Zha Division has a confidential mailbox, number "1887," at the post office, for citizens to report illegal activities. On the 19th of this month, they received a confidential letter stating that "Xiangcao, a singer at the Shihua Singing Girl Company at No. 30, Cide Lane, 329 Guangxi Road, was burned with cigarettes in more than eighty places on her body and raped by a customer. The company owner does not allow reporting to the police, attempting to destroy evidence. Please investigate." Section Chief Lu Lu of the Administrative Section was secretly ordered by Bureau Chief He to investigate thoroughly. Section Chief Lu immediately went to the company in plain clothes to investigate the case, bringing the company owner and the singer to the bureau for questioning.

Burned All Over

Investigated by Detective No. 266 of the Judicial Section, Bureau Chief He personally interrogated the singer Xiangcao, who stated: "My stage name is Xiangcao, my real name is Mao Xiaobao, I am from Ningbo, 17 years old, and I live at No. 2, Hongqing Lane, Xin Zha Road. I work as a singer at the Shihua Singing Girl Company. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the accountant sent me to room 330 of the East Asia Hotel. There was only one customer in the room. After a brief conversation, the customer demanded sexual favors. I firmly refused. The customer pulled out a gun to threaten me, but I still ignored him. He became angry and burned me with cigarettes on my arm, and then I fainted. I was raped. When I woke up, my whole body was in extreme pain, and I saw that my limbs were full of cigarette burns. The customer was gone. The waiter brought me back to the company late in the evening, but the owner, Zhou Jinshao, did not allow reporting to the police and only applied red medicine." The company owner did not allow reporting, which is wrong. Zhou was detained, and a strict search for the perpetrator was ordered. An investigation was also conducted at the East Asia Hotel, and the customer's name was found to be Li Guifang, 28 years old, from Changzhou. Detectives continued the thorough investigation.

Perpetrator Caught

The perpetrator, Li Guifang, went to Yuan Baoxing's house at No. 35, Beihai Road, at 1:00 AM on the 19th, falsely claiming to be a soldier and attempting to defraud them under the pretext of a light leak. Yuan refused, and they parted unhappily. On the 20th, Li and Yuan met on the street, which led to a quarrel and then a fight. The officer on duty brought them to the Old Zha Division, and Detective No. 266 handled the case. Li confessed his name, age, and hometown. The detective suspected him because his name matched the one in the East Asia Hotel register. Mao Xiaobao was brought to the bureau to identify him, and she confirmed that he was the perpetrator. The case was solved within 48 hours. The bureau is paying close attention to this case and will hand him over to the district prosecutor's office for strict punishment according to the law after the investigation is completed.

Brief Commentary

### Points to Note When Implementing the New Housing Tax

The Municipal Finance Bureau is planning to make reasonable adjustments to the housing tax rate to increase tax revenue, and it has decided that the housing tax amount will be determined by valuation. In principle, we believe this method is reasonable. However, to achieve the practical effect of "increasing municipal tax revenue," the following points should be noted:

The valuation standards should also take into account the degree of prosperity of the location. There should be a distinction between houses in busy commercial districts and those in quiet residential areas.

After the valuation is determined according to reasonable standards, the amount of housing tax to be collected should be fixed and announced publicly. Or, the new housing tax amount should be announced in phases and by district at the announcement office of the tax collection agency, so that taxpayers know what to comply with. According to what we have heard, although the new housing tax amount has been determined, it has not been announced. As a result, some unscrupulous field personnel of the housing tax collection agency go to taxpayers, falsely claiming that the housing tax should be increased by several times, and that if a considerable reward can be paid, they can help reduce the valuation. Taxpayers believe this is true, thinking that paying a reward once will result in permanently lower housing taxes, and they are happy to comply. Even neighborhood officials are engaging in this illegal activity in a manner similar to public fundraising. But the result is that the valuation has already been determined by the competent department of the Finance Bureau and cannot be overturned, so taxpayers suffer a loss for nothing.

The Finance Bureau should strictly screen external personnel, paying particular attention to their integrity. If any malfeasance is discovered, they should be immediately handed over to the police for punishment.

In addition, we hope that taxpayers will not try to obtain unwarranted advantages and be deceived into losses. At the same time, if you encounter such situations, you should immediately report to the police or refuse, so that unscrupulous elements cannot succeed in extortion.

Municipal innovation and the construction of a new Shanghai are not the sole responsibility of the municipal authorities, nor can they be completed solely by the municipal authorities. Citizens also have their responsibilities and must fully cooperate, so that all municipal malpractices and extortion can gradually disappear.

The details are as follows:

Allied Japan was represented by the Army Air Defense Commander, Staff Officer Kumagai of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the head of the Shanghai Liaison Department, the Commander of the Matsushima Fleet Report Department, the Chief of the Shirakami Police Station, and the Propaganda Director of the Yano Deng Unit, among others. On the Chinese side, there was Deputy Director Su Chengshui of the First Police Bureau, Chief Secretary Sun Lifu of the Air Defense Headquarters, and others, totaling more than 500 people.

First, Sun Lifu of the Air Defense Headquarters gave an opening speech, saying: "Today, despite the hot weather, we are holding this premiere of air defense songs and films. We are very honored to have so many guests attend. The Air Defense Headquarters has been established for less than a year. Most of our preparations for air raids have been focused on publicity work for the public. Now, with the assistance of the China Film Company and the Army and Navy Information Departments of the Allied Embassy, we have completed one-third of the air defense film, namely the first installment, the preparation chapter. After we publicly solicited air defense songs in the Shen Bao previously, we received more than 100 excellent songs. We selected the best one, written by Jin Yugu, and asked Liang Yeyin and Li Jinguang to compose the music separately. We will now screen the air defense film and sing the air defense song. We hope everyone will criticize it." Next was a prayer for the inevitable victory of Greater East Asia. After a minute of silence, the singing began. "The Great Shanghai March" (Li Lewu), "Moon Over the Ruined City" (Li Lewu), "Women's Tears" (Qi Zhengyin), "Las Spania Ola" (Qi Zhengyin), "Annoying Morning" (Gu Lu), "Unchanging Heart" (Wu Yong), "Anti-Smoking Song" (Liang Ping).

Finally, the air defense film was screened. The film described in detail all the preparations that the public should make before an enemy air raid. It is believed that after the public watches it, they will gain considerable experience in air defense knowledge and various lighting control methods.

Air Defense Film and Song Concert Held

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has previously produced air defense films and recorded air defense songs, as a way to promote the first installment of the preparation chapter and two types of song recordings. A free public "Film and Song Concert" is scheduled to be held at the Racecourse on Nanjing Road at 8:30 PM on the 24th of this month (Monday). The air defense film was produced by the China Film Company. The first installment will be screened in Shanghai cinemas starting on the 24th of this month. The second installment, the evasion chapter, and the third installment, the fire prevention and rescue chapter, will be completed soon.

### Racial Problems and the American Political Crisis

The United States, a nation of mixed races, is now gradually descending into political and social chaos due to ethnic minorities, particularly the Black population. As the nature of this world war increasingly leans towards ethnic conflicts, the sense of superiority and contempt that White Americans hold towards Blacks is becoming more blatant than ever. However, at the same time, the domestic situation in the U.S. demands intensified war efforts from the Black population, creating a contradictory tragedy.

Today, the White society's core functions have allowed greater participation from the Black masses. The significant increase in military industry since the war began has led to a shortage of White laborers, and now all sectors of society are permitted to participate in the American military. The Black population, which has been concentrated in the southern agricultural regions since the late 18th century, is now tending to concentrate in the Midwest and Eastern states. During this movement, bloody clashes between Blacks and Whites have occurred in places like Detroit and New York.

The main factors of this tragedy can be traced back to earlier times. Although Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Black masses realized they were still nothing more than slaves. During World War I, slogans of "equality with Whites" and "fighting for democracy" were used to drive Black people to shed blood, but after the war, they were once again suppressed to the bottom. Having endured painful experiences, the Black population no longer believes in the so-called democracy of the Anglo-Saxons. Therefore, at the beginning of World War II, a hidden force was forming behind the anti-war movement in the U.S., which represents the difference in attitude of the Black masses between the previous and current wars. In other words, the Black masses have gradually begun to clearly understand the truth about empty democracy and liberal ideology, and are trying to use the chaos in White society to establish the Black population's social status to some extent. Modern warfare cannot avoid becoming protracted, and the opportunity to utilize "time" has arrived. Based on their experiences from the previous war and its aftermath, Black people are gradually leaning towards thorough pragmatism.

This trend naturally affects politics. For example, the issue of Black voting rights is a central point of contention in this autumn's elections. On April 3rd, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Black people in Texas have the right to vote in the Democratic primary election. This is an exception because, while the U.S. Constitution recognizes that Black people have the same electoral rights as White people, in reality, various regulations and customs greatly restrict their right to vote. For example, in the northern states, differential treatment in voting between Black and White people is relatively mild, and approximately three million Black people have the right to vote. However, in the South, where racial discrimination is deeply rooted, Black people have virtually no freedom to vote. Therefore, the Supreme Court's ruling has had a significant impact on White people in the South.

Historically, Black people's interference in politics in the South has been impossible. One reason for this is the requirement to pay a poll tax to obtain voting rights. The poll tax rate is usually very low, at most one to five U.S. dollars per person per year. However, for the Black masses, meeting the minimum standard of living in American society makes it difficult to pay the poll tax. But under the current wartime prosperity, Black people have also benefited, so they have resolutely abandoned their past reluctance towards elections and are determined to fight for equal voting rights with White people. The South has always been a stronghold of the Democratic Party. If a portion of the anti-Roosevelt Democrats and anti-New Deal Republicans give the Black masses an opportunity to exploit and launch a new type of election campaign, the outcome should not be underestimated.

Feeling embarrassed by the Black masses' aggressive offensive, White parliamentarians and commentators have launched a barrage of written attacks on Black power. For example, Mississippi Senator Bilbo made extreme remarks, advocating for "the expulsion of all Black Americans and their banishment to their ancestral homeland in West Africa." At the same time, the famous female writer Pearl Buck recently stated, "Black leaders have never believed that America is fighting for democracy, and this idea is spreading rapidly, permeating among all 12 million Black people in the U.S. In the past, America distinguished between governing races and those being civilized, which was feasible. The Constitution should be amended as soon as possible to make it clear that Black people cannot enjoy the privileges of White people."

These remarks reveal the true nature of the ideals of universal love, freedom, and equality that Americans love to promote. In short, as the war intensifies, the antagonism between White and Black people becomes greater, and the political crisis in the U.S. also becomes more severe.

### Japanese Women Strive to Participate in Production Work

Japanese Women Strive to Participate in Production Work

Decisive Battle! Assault! Now, all 100 million citizens, regardless of gender or age, must quickly participate in the total war effort.

The issue of conscripting women was already loudly proclaimed three years ago. Due to various objective facts, it had not been put into practice. Later, it was decided to organize women's volunteer corps, and the women across the country immediately complied with the state's order: "Women, do this!" Parents have insufficient understanding of young men volunteering for the air force, and mothers also have unclear understanding of women's volunteer corps.

Naturally, it goes without saying that the physique of Japanese women is somewhat lacking compared to Europeans and Americans. Therefore, female porters at foreign train stations, female miners in Ukrainian iron mines, and female crane operators are really difficult for Japanese women to match. However, it is generally recognized that Japanese people, especially Japanese women, are very skilled with their hands. If this strength is utilized, there is a lot of work that can be done. In terms of military supplies, there are countless jobs suitable for women, or even more suitable for women. However, due to women's unwillingness to come out to work, and due to the shortage of female workers, there are many factories that have no choice but to conscript men to replace female workers. If women join the volunteer corps in large numbers today, or enthusiastically participate in production, then men who are engaged in work that is more suitable for women will have to change their occupations and participate in heavy, strenuous work that only men can do. Although this may temporarily cause a decrease in efficiency, the adverse effects of a shortage of male workers can be avoided. Many mothers still have an insufficient understanding of the young women who have already joined the women's volunteer corps. There are many unreasonable mothers who believe that their daughters should first go to work and earn money after graduating from girls' school. The evidence to illustrate this point is: after the ban on men's employment was announced, women came to various departments and Marunouchi offices to request employment, and there were even places that became "women's countries." Furthermore, among those entering factories, there are also very many who want to take on office work.

Reducing Office Staff

All factories are now doing their best to reduce office staff. When it is absolutely necessary, men are sent to the production floor and women are used to replace them.

What is meant by "production floor" here is generally considered by people who don't know factories to be the vocational workplace. Any position in the entire factory is a vocational workplace. The workers in the vocational workplace can generally be divided into two categories: direct workers and indirect workers. However, the indirect workers in all factories average 30% of the total number of employees. (Recently, after several studies, the trend is towards a reduction in indirect workers.) Direct workers, as the name implies, are workers who are directly engaged in production. Indirect workers are those who are engaged in indirect work such as general affairs, accounting, and medical services.

Serving in the administrative department means taking on indirect work, and now is the time when indirect workers must be drastically reduced. Today's women all want to be indirect workers, and mothers are also hoping that their daughters will do so.

If you hear this explanation, you will immediately realize that your past thinking was mistaken.

The indirect industry is full. What they want are direct workers. In short, it is the production floor.

Expecting Women's Participation

Work that women can do, or work that is more suitable for women, is expecting women to participate enthusiastically. Not long ago, the Ministry of Justice and the Juvenile Court had a discussion about the employment of protected girls in a certain factory. The Juvenile Court was very cautious and believed that two months of training were necessary. I said, "Then let's put this issue aside for the future. First, take a look at what kind of work in the production department of the factory is most suitable for women, and see how much this position is expecting women's participation, and then decide when women should enter." So everyone went to visit the factory. As a result, they found a lot of work, and the work that was most suitable for women was everywhere, and most of these positions were vacant. Seeing this situation and hearing this explanation, the stubborn people who had insisted on "waiting until mid-April" also changed their attitude and said, "Now we see very good things. Let women participate in production quickly!"

Everyone is Japanese, because they don't know and haven't seen, so daughters and mothers have insufficient understanding. However, you can't let everyone take a look at the factory. Please trust me and participate in production with peace of mind!

"Women, go participate in production right now!"

### Notes of a Female Train Driver

We, six young women, came to apply for the position of the nation's first female train drivers recruited by the Miyako Engine District of the Sendai Railway Bureau, holding high the banner of "The railway is a women's battlefield." We were selected from many applicants and, before participating in the transportation front as female drivers, we serve from morning to night, with full spirit, amidst the sound of train whistles and layers of coal smoke.

When we first came to the engine district, we admired the sight of everyone working there, their faces and hands blackened with grime, barely recognizable, busy and constantly moving, working hard.

The supervisor said:

"What do you think? Can you do work like this, with blackened faces and grimy hands?"

I immediately replied without hesitation:

"I will definitely be able to do it satisfactorily."

This spirited reply made the supervisor encourage me with a smile:

"For the sake of defeating Britain and America, please persevere!"

In addition, the district chief gave us many instructions, which made the blood of us women boil, determined to show that we are no less than men.

When we received the blue work clothes and hats and put them on, we felt that all the cells in our bodies had become men, and our determination to work became even stronger. We already felt like a member of the depot, and our hearts were expanding.

The locomotive looked like a huge monster beside us. Climbing onto the car and cleaning the machinery one by one, scrubbing and sweeping was the first job. While working, we learned that this was the ventilator and that was the water injector. We gradually deepened our understanding of the various parts of the locomotive in the work.

Then we went to clean the warehouse. The work was to carry iron and wood. I, who had never carried heavy objects, found it difficult to walk while carrying things. The supervisor, looking worried about me, said gently several times:

"Don't overdo it!"

But my heart refused to give in, so I gritted my teeth and worked hard. When I went home, I was exhausted, and my hands, feet, and shoulders were throbbing, but after a week, I got used to it and did it well.

Breaking through this difficulty, we went to work in the sand house. The sand house is where the fine sand used by the locomotive when going downhill is dried and loaded onto the locomotive. To dry the fine sand, we used an iron shovel to load the fine sand into a large pot and then burn it with fire. The work of loading fine sand was also very strenuous. The dried fine sand was then sifted through a fine wire mesh. The workshop was full of sand smoke, making this work of stinging the eyes and nose difficult to endure.

However, now I am used to everything. Whether it is the work in the sand house, carrying wood and iron, or cleaning the machinery, I am confident that I can do any job. I already feel that I have a depot hand qualification, and I work happily every day. So the superiors are talking about:

"If women work seriously, they are more capable than men."

"Everyone is working very hard, and there are indeed results."

Hearing these words, my emotions became more firm, and I wanted to work hard and amaze them even more. Especially me, if a probationary female depot hand is said to be "after all, women are no good," then later women will be despised. No matter what happens, I cannot admit defeat. I have to make people think that "women can also do great things." Bearing such a great responsibility, of course, I have to work hard. Fortunately, I have not been absent from work for a single day, and I have overcome such difficult and arduous work. Everyone is encouraging me, saying that I am really happy in the job, and I am receiving kind guidance from everyone, so my confidence is getting stronger.

Recently, in my spare time, I often sit beside the long-awaited driver's seat and hold the propulsion machine. I really feel refreshed and happy, like I have already become a driver, so I can reveal hope in my relaxed expression. In order to win the war, women should also work in place of men for anything. At the same time, I also feel that I can do anything.

A letter from my brother on the front line said to do his share of the work as well, so I also want to do my brother's share of the work, and I am determined to serve the country, stand on my job position, and do my best.

### The Trend of Japanese Drama in the Decisive Battle Stage

—Isao Oyama

It has been almost three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and Japan is fighting with great difficulty. Needless to say, on the front lines of land, sea, and air, the 100 million people in the rear must also implement a total war in all aspects. In this time of life and death, it is undoubtedly a matter of course to eliminate the old system of liberalism in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and implement a new system of collectivism.

Establishing a Drama Route

The ideological route for art and especially drama, which was the most backward in the past, remains unchanged. Naturally, compared to the sharp battles on the front lines of politics or economy, the drama aspect is undeniably lagging behind. Even so, today's Japanese drama is also moving towards the battlefield, which is a fact that no one can deny.

Especially after the implementation of the decisive battle emergency measures not long ago, this progressive tendency has become more and more obvious. The situation of hesitating and looking left and right before is gradually being purged, and it is making great strides towards a truly wartime drama system. Various confusions and thorns are manifested in the operation, and there are no good results yet, but the direction in which it is currently proceeding can be said to have been established, and it is working towards this goal. This is the undeniable reality of Japanese theater companies today.

Reorganizing Combat Drama

So, in which direction is Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage moving? What specific form does it take? What kind of realistic posture does it take?

Needless to say, there is only one direction in which Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage is moving. This is, as people say today, "combat drama," which means establishing the future form of drama, completing the fundamental mission of drama, and thereby moving towards a cultural direction that is effective for the national total war. (This is not limited to the decisive battle stage; it must be the same in peacetime. However, it must be especially emphasized during wartime.) In all aspects of drama, this is an urgent task that must be directed towards combat without delay.

The Nation's Cultural Property

Japanese drama in the decisive battle stage is moving in this direction. What form does it take in reality? First of all, it can be said that it should promote the popularization of drama culture and equal opportunities to watch drama. In the past, most of our Japanese drama was concentrated in large cities and monopolized by the leisure-consuming class. The general public had no right to enjoy it. This distorted phenomenon must be corrected: drama must become a cultural property that truly belongs to all the people of the country. Especially in the increasingly fierce decisive battle stage, priority viewing rights must be arranged for the hard-working industrial soldiers.

This has been concretely realized due to the formation of the Japan Mobile Theater Alliance (June 1941). Under the active guidance of the Information Bureau, the kind assistance of various cultural groups and entertainment organizations, and the cooperation of industrial service to the nation groups and industrial associations, the activities have become more lively year by year. Especially after the emergency measures, the establishment of the Mobile Arts Headquarters in the Information Bureau has made this movement more actively controlled and lively. This kind of activity had great achievements before. This movement is spreading not only in Japan, but also in Korea, Karafuto, Manchuria, Taiwan, China, and other places.

The hearing business drama in big cities is also gradually strengthening this trend. For example, large theaters in Tokyo and Osaka started performing plays to comfort industrial soldiers before the emergency measures, and they became more active after the emergency measures. The number of comforting performances also increased greatly. At the same time, there was a restriction on tickets below five yuan to restrict the leisure-consuming class and give priority viewing opportunities to industrial soldiers. As a result, the majority of the population who had no power to watch plays before also had entertainment opportunities. This can be said to show a new phenomenon of mobilizing new audiences.

Evacuating Actors and Theater Companies

Due to this emergency measure, the fact that the drama ticket price cannot exceed five yuan is a big blow to today's professional drama groups. In the past entertainment situation, this kind of ticket price (half of which is a loss) would be a loss. Especially the large revue group felt this way. So now almost all theaters are divided into day and night sessions, but even this often cannot balance income and expenditure. After the implementation of the emergency measures, many large theaters went bankrupt. As a result, the internal part of the theater inevitably suffered economic destruction. The lives of the actors themselves were lowered, and they actively turned to mobile theater groups, changed careers, etc., forming the reorganization and rectification of theater groups.

There is no doubt that this is a blow to today's capitalist entertainment. But from the perspective of drama itself, or from the perspective of drama culture, it is a gratifying thing. In addition, since the emergency measures, actors and theater companies have been evacuated, and there has been a lot of talk about it. Some of them have gradually implemented it, which is also a phenomenon that can be noted. (To be continued) (Translated from the July 6th issue of Mainichi Shimbun by Yasushi)

### Usury and the Common People

— Jiga

The crackdown on usury has long been stipulated by law. However, the law is the law, and the reality is the reality. Currently, bank mortgage loans range from 0.5% to 1.5% monthly interest, which is 60% to 180% annual interest. This is calculated based on simple interest only. If calculated based on compound interest, the amount is even greater.

If we take a step further and look at the interest rates of pawnshops, they are even more shocking. The interest rates of pawnshops are calculated at 2.5% monthly interest, which is 25 yuan per month for every 100 yuan. The annual interest rate is 300 yuan, which is 300% of the principal. What is more relevant to the common people is not the bank, but the pawnshop. If someone lives by pawning, his burden is always more than three times his actual expenses. The severity of this problem is no less than the price of rice or coal.

Currently, most pawnshops hang the word "pawn" outside their doors. But they call themselves "new and used goods trading business." Pawn tickets are also renamed "specially agreed fixed-term repurchase certificates." The redemption period is shortened to 30 days. Only the selling price is filled in, which is calculated according to the principal plus 300% annual interest, filled in in advance, and does not specify the monthly or annual interest rate. The method is very clever. This "specially agreed fixed-term repurchase certificate" is divided into columns such as "item name," "selling price," "seller's name and address," etc. It also includes the following explanation:

"The above-mentioned goods and selling price have been cleared by both parties upon the issuance of this certificate. For the convenience of customers, the seller's request is acknowledged, and the above-mentioned purchased goods will be temporarily retained for 30 days. During the retention period, if the seller needs the original goods, he can prepare sufficient funds at any time to repurchase the original goods. At the expiration date, it will be transferred for sale, and no objection shall be raised. If the above-mentioned goods have any unexplained circumstances in the past, the seller shall be responsible, and this store shall not be involved. We hereby declare." Shanghai can be said to be five steps one shop, ten steps one pawnshop. The common people who deal with pawnshops and use pawnshops as working capital may be around one million. If we calculate an average of 1,000 yuan per person, it will reach 1 trillion yuan. Among them, 750 billion yuan is the burden of interest and the expenditure of usury. This is a problem that deserves attention. This is also a problem that should be remedied by legal procedures and the power of public opinion as soon as possible.

Social Services

### Nanyang Hospital Offers Free Tuberculosis Prevention

Mr. Xiannan Qun, the president of Nanyang Hospital, in order to benefit elementary school teachers, has specially established free tuberculosis prevention measures starting from May 1st. Since the implementation, a total of 245 people have been introduced by the social service departments of this newspaper and the News Daily to undergo examinations. Those with mild conditions are given outpatient treatment, free medication, or a discretionary reduction in medication costs, depending on their family circumstances. Those with severe conditions are allowed to be hospitalized for artificial pneumothorax or surgery, and the results have been very good. This free prevention and treatment measure is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month, and will not be extended. Therefore, it is hoped that all elementary school teachers will make the most of this good opportunity and go to the social service departments of the Shenbao and Xinwenbao before the deadline to obtain free X-ray examination certificates and go to the hospital for examination.

It is heard that in order to protect the health of students, the hospital will start providing free health examinations for children from August 1st. On the one hand, it will promote the healthy development of children, and on the other hand, after the source of the disease is discovered, it will be treated as soon as possible during the summer vacation, so that when school starts in the autumn, they will be physically strong and will not be in danger of being unable to attend school due to illness. Detailed measures will be formulated separately and can be decided soon.

### Pudong Fellow Villagers Scholarship

Recently, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, in view of the doubling of tuition fees in schools at all levels, was initiated by directors Chen Zixin and Pan Zhiwen to provide scholarships for poor children. It is tentatively set at three university students, five high school students, ten junior high school students, and twenty elementary school students. All fellow villagers who are studying in Shanghai, whose academic performance is above 70 points, and whose family is poor, can first obtain a recommendation letter from the school they are attending and a fellow villager guarantee letter. From August 1st to September 10th, they can go to apply. In addition, Chen and Pan have also formed a scholarship committee for poor children in their hometowns of Yangsi and Yangjing in the two districts, and have sent investigation forms to various schools for completion and submission to the association's office, so that staff can be sent to the countryside for practical interviews, in order to be practical and not waste money. It is truly a great gospel for poor children.

### Nanyang Used Bookstore Service

Recently, the price of books has soared, and it is difficult for general poor students to buy books. The colleagues of the Nanyang Used Bookstore Service, in view of this, have specially invited several university students to use the summer vacation to organize a used bookstore service (address: No. 18, Longcun, Intersection of Huanlong Road and Ladu Road). The service measures are recorded as follows:

For those who entrust the society to sell books on their behalf, the price is determined by the seller (but it cannot exceed the general market price). After the sale, the society will charge one-tenth as a handling fee.

Types of books sold on behalf of: university and middle school textbooks and all other reference books.

Service hours: from July 15th to the end of September, 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, closed on Sundays.

All handling fees will be used as scholarships.

### Teacher's Grain Allocation

Regarding the issue of grain allocation for municipal schools, the Grain Bureau provides special allocations of rice for teachers and students. Each month, the principals go to the Grain Bureau to collect the rice, sometimes one or two bags, sometimes three or five. However, I have been working at the school for several years now, and I have heard about this allocation countless times, but in reality, I have never received any rice.

Therefore, I hope that the authorities, when making the special monthly rice allocation, will do so in a manner similar to that for the general public, stating that schools such as [names of schools] should come to the bureau to collect the rice. This would prevent the rice from being resold, and we, the poor teachers, would have rice to eat. We would be truly grateful. (A Teacher)

United Voluntary Night School News: The alumni association of Yongjie Elementary School on East Changzhi Road, in light of the recent increase in school fees and the large number of students dropping out of school, has jointly established a voluntary night school with the school, named the United Voluntary Night School. Utilizing vacant classrooms, the school provides completely free education, and all impoverished out-of-school children are welcome to enroll.

YWCA Children's Home News: The YWCA Children's Home, which specializes in caring for homeless street children and children who are lost or abducted, will hold its anniversary celebration at 8:00 AM on July 24th at its location at 948 Changde Road, and invites all sectors to visit.

Lost Residence Permit: Zhang Yucai found a residence permit numbered 567979 belonging to Ni Guoxian and has submitted it to this office for collection.

Without waiting for Lieutenant Nitta's explanation, he saw a Lü-class submarine moored on the rocky headland in the bay. The deck of the submarine, with its gangway, looked like the back of a whale. As he walked on that gangway, Ryuo thought to himself that in the past he had only looked at submarines from here, but now he was finally going inside to take a closer look. This was truly exciting.

Descending the iron ladder from the bridge, he only felt the heavy, stale air inside and the light from the electric lamps.

"Didn't expect it to be so cramped, did you!"

Shinobu said with a smile, but Ryuo was at a loss for words. It was not only cramped, but he had never seen such a complex and intricate "iron precision engineering." Even around the periscope in the conning tower, there were tightly coiled iron rings and pipes. Looking at the command post, it was filled with many machines that would give anyone a headache.

Before he had even finished looking at the torpedo room, the engine room, and the motor room, Ryuo's mind was already a bit confused. He had completely forgotten his prior knowledge about the submarine's two engines and the tanks for discharging water and air. He felt like a speck of dust hidden inside an iron machine. Perhaps it was more like being swallowed by a whale.

"Ah, thank you!"

Seeing the table and chairs in the officers' mess, he finally regained some composure and said this.

"It's nothing. Once you get used to it, it's just like your own home."

Lieutenant Nitta also came over and sat down at the table.

"This place is the officers' bedroom and study, as well as the mess hall and thoroughfare for all the crew. That curtained area is the captain's cabin..."

Ryuo looked inside and saw that there was only enough space for a mat, which was almost completely filled by a bed. What was even more surprising was that there were snake-like iron pipes crawling over the bed, and a round wheel protruding from it. If the captain turned over, that pipe would surely hit his skin.

"This submarine is easy to endure because it's moored and the machines are stopped."

Shinobu explained.

"Once the boat starts moving, it gets hot and smelly, and it's really unbearable!"

Lieutenant Nitta chimed in. Even with just the three of them in the cramped officers' mess, the smell was already quite strong.

"Hey, is there a shrine?"

Ryuo asked loudly. (122)
