### Increasing Agricultural Production and Unifying Institutions

Increasing production during wartime is already an absolute principle for participating nations, requiring no further explanation. We, China, are also a participating nation, and in theory, increasing production has been established as a national policy. The wartime economic policy outline promulgated by the National Government on February 13th of last year included "increasing production" as its first item. In his New Year's Day address this year, Chairman Wang also listed "increasing production" as one of the three major work priorities and stipulated that this year would be a year of general mobilization for increased production. At the same time, the slogan of increasing production has been widely raised in all aspects, almost becoming a household term.

However, what is the actual situation? Let's examine the current industrial and production situation in Shanghai. Repeated power restrictions, difficulty in obtaining raw materials, and inconvenience in transporting finished products make it difficult to maintain the original output, let alone increase it. Shanghai is the center of the country's industry, and if it is like this, the situation in other places can be imagined. Moreover, China's industry is limited by mechanical technology. Heavy industry has no foundation, and even light industry has only established a foundation and a rough scale in the few years before the war. However, after the turmoil of the war, even this roughly scaled light industrial foundation has been damaged. Therefore, even if we produce as much as possible, we still cannot catch up with the pre-war level.

Secondly, in terms of agriculture, due to the turmoil in rural areas after the war, some areas were also invaded by the New Fourth Army, and normal conditions have not been restored. On the one hand, the unified procurement method is not reasonable, which makes farmers fearful and reduces their interest in farming. Although we have no statistics to prove it, from the general situation, the yield of crops in recent years has also decreased rather than increased.

Theoretically, great importance is attached to increasing production, but in fact, the actual effect of increasing production is greatly questioned. Then, who should bear this responsibility? Of course, the government is in a leading position. In the positive aspect, it cannot strengthen the leading and implementing mechanisms, nor can it effectively implement the production increase plan. In the negative aspect, it cannot eliminate the obstacles to production increase, nor can it create an environment and conditions for production increase. The people only occupy the position of producers. With appropriate and strong leadership, such as a unified institution, with an environment of rather die than yield, such as the establishment of public security, and with supply conditions, such as the supply of raw materials and technical guidance, then the actual effect of increasing production is not difficult to achieve.

During this decisive period, the purpose of increasing production is, of course, to contribute to the war effort and strive for final victory. However, we always believe that the work of increasing production is undertaken by the people. We must first stabilize the people's minimum living standards before we can go all out. The most needed things to stabilize people's livelihoods are food and clothing. Therefore, the work of increasing production should start with food and cotton, followed by the flour industry and the textile industry. We will not discuss the industrial aspect for the time being. Only in terms of agriculture, we believe that the unification of the leading institutions is a very important prerequisite.

At present, the government agencies related to agricultural production include the Agricultural Production Increase Committee, the Cooperative Affairs Committee, and the Rural Construction Committee, which are directly under the Executive Yuan. Secondly, there are the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Construction, and the Rural Welfare Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare. In addition, there are various units related to rural work in the New Movement Association, and the part of the Youth Work-Study Corps related to rural work. Although the tasks of the above institutions are different, the goals are the same.

We advocate that, in order to achieve the practical effect of increasing agricultural production, the government's leadership of agricultural institutions must be unified. All parts related to agriculture should be merged and integrated into one unit. The task of this unit is to lead and implement the national agricultural production increase, and a special department should be set up directly under the Executive Yuan, tentatively named the "Agricultural Production Increase Department." Whether it is feasible, we hope that the government and the public will discuss it together.

### The Purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to Destroy Anglo-American Aggression - Statement Issued by the Japanese China Expeditionary Army

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army issued a statement at 3 p.m. on the 17th, which is recorded as follows:

Practicing the Spirit of Morality

"After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all Anglo-American bases in East Asia were completely lost, and they fled outside the East Asian circle. However, they still conspire insidiously, using the beautiful name of resistance to Japan, skillfully appease and win over the Chongqing regime, and extend their claws to the East Asian continent, indulging in their ambition to control East Asia. Our Expeditionary Army, in order to complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, resolutely rose up, destroyed all aggressive forces on the mainland, in order to liberate the Chinese nation and the nation from the shackles they suffered, and launched a great offensive. This operation has already issued orders, the whole army has strict military discipline, and practices morality. And it is announced to the Chinese people that they should live in peace and enjoy their work. However, the people's suffering caused by the war, the desolation of the fields, and the destruction of cultural relics are deeply worried by our army. Therefore, we often limit the disaster of war to a minimum, and at the same time, we try our best to engage in reconstruction. The Chinese people all understand the spirit of our army and automatically cooperate and achieve satisfactory results. This has been proven by facts in various places, and there is no need to repeat it. However, the violent Anglo-Americans burn down city streets and residential houses, destroy transportation facilities, in order to hinder construction, and trample on the people, even massacring innocent people, so that post-war reconstruction cannot be completed as scheduled. It is found that Anglo-Americans use the beautiful name of cooperation to level Chinese territory and make it their own battlefield. They do not care about turning it into scorched earth for the territory of other countries. The happiness and misfortune of the Chinese people are not what they care about. Their inhuman animal nature is truly resented by both humans and gods.

Destroying the Common Enemy

China and Japan are united by Eastern morality, and Anglo-Americans are our common enemy. The Imperial Government stated in its statement: "The purpose of our country's military operations in China is entirely to destroy the enemy's Anglo-American aggressive ambitions. The Chinese people are our friends, and even the Chongqing army, if they can eliminate cooperation with Anglo-Americans, are not our enemies." The Japanese government is willing to make the people of East Asia understand the true meaning of mutual understanding and cooperation. Our army is now following and practicing this statement in order to destroy the rebels in East Asia, assist China's autonomy and independence, and the peaceful life and work of the 400 million people. As for the preservation and stability of the war zone and the rear, the Japanese army is temporarily responsible for this. This is because we aim to quickly restore order, avoid the suffering of the people, respect public opinion and customs, and promote the renewal of local society. There is no other intention. We hope that all Chinese sages, enlightened scholars, and patriotic youths will understand the current serious situation of the fate of China and the ups and downs of the world, and take no wrong steps for the long-term plan of the country, promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, encourage cooperation, and strive to complete China's autonomous independence and unified nation-building."

### Thailand Decides to Fully Cooperate to Complete the Greater East Asia War - First Speech by New Prime Minister Abhaiwongse

Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse met with a group of Japanese reporters for the first time at his official residence at 3 p.m. on the 16th and made the following statement: The policy of the new Thai cabinet has been fully expressed in the parliament. The cooperation between Thailand and Japan is as described in the six major political outlines that I have announced. It is natural to abide by the treaties concluded by both parties. The specific strategy is that Thailand will do its best to cooperate with Japan and carry out the war. The first thing to do is economic cooperation. In addition, the lives of the Thai people are gradually becoming difficult due to the progress of the war, which is a natural phenomenon. The Thai people have to thoroughly realize this. Therefore, the government is currently doing its best to study and stabilize the people's livelihood. Regarding price countermeasures, we are preparing to form a strong committee with representatives from the existing Thai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Indian Business Federation, and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. This will be the representative organization of commerce, and it will implement reasonable and autonomous price management. The government will provide guidance and supervision from the side. Regarding the revitalization of industry, we also plan to work hard to revitalize private industry, and the government will provide technical assistance for this. Regarding air defense countermeasures, in order to ensure everything is perfect, the Air Defense Committee of the Ministry of Interior is currently studying appropriate methods. In order to win the victory in the World War and the East Asia War, Thailand and Japan are allies. Japan's determination to win is the determination of the Thai people. Thailand's prosperity can only be ensured by completing the Greater East Asia War.

### Battles on Bougainville Island Turn Fierce - Japanese Garrison Repeatedly Annihilates Stubborn Enemies

South Pacific Base, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese garrison on Bougainville Island is still inviting enemy landing troops to attack and firmly defending Tan Island. However, since the end of July, the enemy's offensive in all aspects has gradually become fierce. The following is a detailed record: In the Torokina area, since July 27th, about a large battalion of enemy troops has attacked the Japanese garrison's defensive position. On the evening of August 2nd, the Japanese garrison launched a fierce attack on the enemy's left wing, and at the same time, launched a night attack on the enemy's rear with the main force, repelling them. In this battle, the enemy abandoned 15 corpses, and the Japanese army was killed one person. In the Hume Bay area, since the end of July, the enemy has relentlessly attacked the Japanese army's position. The Japanese garrison received assistance from the Numma area. On the dawn of August 7th, one team restrained about 300 enemy soldiers in the east. Another main force surrounded them from the lower reaches of the Lalwe River, and launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. The battle results of the Japanese army were 68 enemy corpses abandoned, three heavy machine guns captured by the Japanese army, and countless bullets. The Japanese army only killed three people. In the Ehrlesita area, since August 7th, enemy planes have frequently attacked. On the 7th and the 8th, about one hundred enemy planes came to attack, and machine-gunned the Japanese army's position. The Japanese army immediately invited them to attack, shooting down two of them. The losses of the Japanese army were very small.

Japanese Daredevil Team Wins Citation

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Japanese army retreated from Guadalcanal at the southern end of the Solomon Islands in February of last year, a small number of Japanese soldiers remained on the island and engaged in an offensive battle with the American army for a year. These facts were recently clarified by the relevant parties, which aroused great emotion among the Japanese people. The Japanese army on the island, in December of the 17th year of Showa (1942), the entire team of the Terasawa Daredevil Scouts risked sneaking into the heavily guarded enemy airfield, bombing airplanes and airfield facilities, etc., which made the enemy army terrified. The commander of the Japanese army in the area previously awarded citations to Lieutenant Terasawa and five warriors of the Daredevil Scouts. This matter was recently reported to His Majesty the Emperor. On the 17th of this month, the Ministry of the Army announced the fact that the unit had won a citation.

Therefore, transportation in Korea, Manchuria, and North China has been smoothly promoted recently. At the same time, the performance of transporting and exchanging materials has also been able to achieve considerable results in accordance with the original plan. Among them, railway transportation in Korea has achieved results beyond expectations. As for the locomotives and military vehicles in various parts of the mainland, their distribution status is also very appropriate, which is the most noteworthy.

According to reports, at the beginning of the battle in Hengyang, there were more than 70 American generals, colonels, and technicians in the city of Hengyang. About 100 technical personnel were on the right bank of the Xiangjiang River at the airfield. In addition, there were 150 missionaries. They all returned to the rear before and after the fall of Changsha on June 18th. The workers at the airfield also retreated together a few days before the airfield fell. The generals and colonels in the city of Hengyang vowed to defend the city to the death at the beginning of the war.

### Japanese Military and Political Authorities Reiterate the True Meaning of Operations in China

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the true meaning of the Japanese army's operations in mainland China has been to break the Anglo-American delusion of controlling East Asia. At this time, the Japanese government has also stated the true intention of Japan, saying that the purpose of the Japanese army's operations is to reduce the Anglo-American attempts to invade East Asia. The Chinese people are, of course, friends of the Japanese army, and the Chongqing army is not an enemy of the Japanese army. The Japanese China Expeditionary Army authorities issued a statement on the 17th, explaining the true meaning of this mainland operation and the violent behavior of Anglo-Americans towards the Chinese people, and stating the administrative guidelines for post-war reconstruction and the war zone, and striving to do their best for post-war reconstruction and the welfare of the Chinese people.

Mainland Operations Are Intensifying

Now, the major points in Henan and Hunan are all in the hands of the Japanese army. This operation is actually a decisive battle between Japan and the United States on the Chinese mainland. It is said that the United States is manipulating the Chongqing army in the ranks. At the same time, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the US mechanized troops are also quite active. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing originally expanded the response to the MacArthur offensive. The bases in the southeast of the mainland launched air strikes on the Japanese mainland. Now, this attempt has become a bubble due to the fall of Hengyang and the inability of the Dongguan forward base. Now, the only thing is to respond to the Nimitz offensive, using B29 aircraft to bomb Japan from the Chengdu base in the northwest. At the same time, regardless of day and night, they blindly bomb the mainland war zone and peaceful areas. The US military's guidance on the mainland operations is quite large.

According to front-line news, Chongqing has a unified US-Chongqing command headquarters for operations against Japan, with Chiang Kai-shek as the commander-in-chief and Stilwell as the chief of staff. Stilwell is actually in command of the Chongqing army's operations. The US 14th Air Force and the Chongqing-US Flying Wing are directly under the command of Chet Bredell. The US 20th Air Force's P29 aircraft are directly under the command of US Army Air Force Commander Arnold. The Chongqing army has no power to intervene in its guidance. The US Air Force's assistance to the Chongqing army's actions is also freely decided by the US. During the Henan operation, the number of sorties was only 300. It was not active in the Changsha defense battle. This time, the US Air Force saw that a major forward base of its own, Chongyang, was in danger. Only a total of more than 10 aircraft were sent to transport military food and supplies and resupply the Chongqing army in the city. The cumulative number of sorties was only 500. The ground Chongqing army used poison gas under the war of more than 60 American generals and colonels in an attempt to stubbornly resist.

According to recent intelligence, the US mechanized troops previously transported a force by plane from the Yunnan-Burma border to Hengyang, where they concentrated in the Shiqiao and Linglu areas. Attempting to recapture Nanyang, the US-Japan war on the mainland is intensifying.

Two Different Modes of Operation

The Japanese army launched this war in the spirit of morality. It is completely different from the Anglo-American war of aggression to satisfy the ambition of controlling East Asia. These two different modes of warfare have given the people a profound lesson. The highest commander of the Japanese army has issued the iron law of "no burning, no killing, no death" in the "Declaration to the Soldiers," trying to avoid causing the Chinese people to suffer, the fields to be barren, and cultural relics to be destroyed. He must make the greatest effort for reconstruction. After the Henan campaign, cities and villages such as Luoyang have embarked on the road to revival and achieved good results. This shows that the Japanese army's "strict military regulations" and "practice of morality" operate from the root of righteousness, and even if it encounters difficulties, it can be solved easily. The characteristics of the Japanese army's operations are also the firm belief of the Japanese soldiers on the front line. The area of operation must establish public security and quickly restore military and political institutions in order to quell the war and restore peace. We must also follow local customs, respect public opinion, and encourage the influential people among the people to advocate local autonomy. In Hunan, the slogan is "Hunanese for Hunan," so that they can revive their homeland. In the future, in the war zone, the overall will and strength of the people should be used to revive their own homeland and achieve national liberation, establish autonomous independence, eliminate all fetters, and complete the people's long-cherished wish. In order to build the homeland and society, the established plans in peaceful areas should be followed, the price policy should be reviewed, and efforts should be made to ensure the free circulation of materials, the close economic connection between urban and rural areas, the adjustment of the circulation of materials in the war zone, and the promotion of the increase of materials.

The Inhuman Acts of US Soldiers

In this operation, the inhumane behavior of the Americans has been fully exposed. For example, the US planes that flew over Hengyang on the day of the 8th indiscriminately bombed the Chongqing army. This kind of fact was witnessed by the reconnaissance aircraft of the Japanese army. The US planes also blindly bombed the civilians who were returning to the land. For example, Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan, was captured by the Japanese army on June 18. The residents returned one after another. As of the middle of July, it was only 35,000 less than the pre-war population of 230,000. Now they are all living in peace, and their recovery is increasing day by day. The US planes saw the crowds of people returning, and they still came to bomb every day. The famous historical sites in the past prosperous areas were all bombed, and thousands of people were victimized. The US army was not satisfied, and dropped 3,000 bombs in the city on the 15th, implementing a thorough scorched earth tactic. Since the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, the violence and cruelty of the Anglo-Americans have been fully exposed. Now the Japanese army has demonstrated the true spirit of morality and achieved great results. We have fully understood the statement of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army this time and will certainly assist the Japanese army with all our strength to destroy the enemy Anglo-Americans.

### German Troops in Southern France Fighting Valiantly, Harbor Facilities All Destroyed

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)

A dispatch from the Führer's Headquarters on the 16th announced: German troops on the northern coast of Southern France, although repelling the attempt by counter-Axis forces to land between Toulon and Cannes, the counter-Axis forces have gained footholds in several coastal locations. Counter-Axis paratroopers have landed behind German defense zones, and German reserve units are currently launching fierce attacks against them.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)

According to frontline German sources, the counter-Axis forces on the Southern France front continued to reinforce their troops by sea and air on the evening of the 15th. The current fighting extends westward from the vicinity of the Port of Hyères to the area of Mont Coudon, east of the Bay of Toulon.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)

A German news agency reports: Under the cover of naval artillery fire, British and American forces are continuously reinforcing troops within the enemy bridgehead in southern France day and night, but so far have only made slight progress in the Saint-Raphaël area, and have invaded the Argens River basin. The enemy made new landing attempts on both sides of the Toulon fortress, but were repelled. The enemy gained a foothold in the Cannes area, and German troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy at other landing sites.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)

The counter-Axis forces have begun new landing operations on the southern coast of France. The German troops under the command of General Manfred Rommel, responsible for the defense of that area, should be able to exert their strength. The German authorities are silent, which is different from the Normandy front. The decisive battle will be launched after the counter-Axis forces are in a favorable position in the rear, and then the counter-Axis forces will be wiped out in one fell swoop. Therefore, based on the above policy, the German army has destroyed the harbor facilities of Nice, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez. From the landing site to the land area of ​​the hills of the Provence region, the German army is currently fighting bravely everywhere, engaging in fierce battles with the counter-Axis forces. The strongholds of the counter-Axis forces are located in a wide coastal area from the Bay of Nice to the Bay of Hyères, but the counter-Axis forces themselves have not yet established contact, and therefore have not formed a single battle line. The counter-Axis supply bases are the islands east of Hyères, Saint-Raphaël, and Cap d'Antibes. German bomber squadrons and mine-laying squadrons have strongly attacked the counter-Axis warships in that area, inflicting heavy damage.

German Troops Withdraw from Dinard, Brittany

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)

### Water and Electricity Company to Halve Water Supply Starting Tomorrow, Every Morning from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM

In order to adapt to the wartime system and conserve tap water consumption, the China Water and Electricity Company will reduce the water supply by about one-half from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, starting tomorrow (the 19th). During this period, the water pressure above the second floor will be lower than usual, and it is even possible that there will be no water flowing out of the end of the water pipes. Fearing that users may misunderstand, a prior notice is hereby given. As for the above-mentioned time period, it is hoped that users will pay attention and provide assistance to achieve the following two points: When not using water, please be sure to close the faucet tightly to prevent the water pipe from sucking in air and causing obstacles. It is best not to extend the rubber hose directly into the wooden basin, ceramic basin, or lead bucket when washing clothes, so as to prevent the water pipe from sucking in sewage when the wooden pressure is applied.

### National Savings to be Fully Promoted

At this moment when the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, in order to win the war and build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the allied country of Japan is dedicating all its resources, voluntarily donating funds, and promoting national savings. The results are remarkable, and the contribution to Greater East Asia is significant. It is learned that the Fuguo Weibing Insurance Company, in order to expand the promotion of national savings, has been designated by the Japanese Embassy and recognized by the National Government to establish branches in various parts of our country, and to organize a Chinese department to promote national savings throughout the country in order to achieve total participation in the war.

### Transferring Manuscript Fees to Donate to Scholarships, Poor Writers Sympathize with Poor Students

Yesterday, we received about 50,000 yuan in scholarship donations from about 30 donors, ranging from 10 yuan to 10,000 yuan per person. It can be said that it is a collection of small efforts. We are extremely hopeful for large numbers, but we also welcome small numbers. A donation of 2,000 yuan can save an elementary school student from dropping out of school. This elementary school student, because of my kind thought, is spared from dropping out of school. In the future, he may learn to use his knowledge to serve the country and establish achievements. Then today's donor has invisibly accumulated blessings, which is so glorious.

Among yesterday's donors, it is worth noting that four of them "transferred manuscript fees". Among them, Mr. Zhang Sumin wrote in a letter: "The manuscript fee of 2,1200 yuan obtained from my book "Fifty Years" is transferred to your newspaper's scholarship fund." Writing and submitting articles is the work of poor writers, most of whom are only qualified to be helped. Now, in order to sympathize with poor students who have dropped out of school, they give up their qualifications to be helped and help others, which is really admirable. We also hope that those with more financial resources will also show their sympathy for those who have dropped out of school and donate more so that we can achieve the goal of fully subsidizing the applying students.

Yesterday's Receipt of Scholarship Funds: Tongren of the Yifeng Yarn Factory, a person from Keqiao, Zhang Wanyuan, the owner of the Haitang Bookstore, Bao Jingshi (football lottery ticket fund), 5,000 yuan each, a reader 4,000 yuan, Zhang Sumin 3,200 yuan, Gu Xu's family (transferred compensation for medical expenses) 3,000 yuan, Zhang Meisheng, a person with a name, 1,000 yuan each, Qian Jun, Deji, Junji, Bi Keqing, 500 yuan each, Yu Jun (manuscript fee) 375 yuan, Zhu Yuchang, Jiang Lianhua, Wei Hongzhang, Zhang Yijiu, Guo Rongfu, Tong Jingzhi, Zhang Shouzhi, Sun Rongchun, Zheng Yulin, Zhu Ruigeng, Ren Xinle, 300 yuan each, Zhang Jiukun (manuscript fee) 225 yuan, Wang Yuanan, Hong Jianyun, Zhu Zuyao, Shi Baiquan, 200 yuan each, Cheng Hanming, Shi Zui (manuscript fee) 120 yuan each, Zhang Minglun, Bin Jun, 100 yuan each, Ting Jun (postage) 20 yuan, picked up ten yuan, totaling 49,370 yuan in reserve coupons, with a balance of 13,841,076 yuan.
