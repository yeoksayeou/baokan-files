### Fierce Three-Dimensional Battles Around Leyte Island: 46 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Two Locations in the Philippines

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - It has been a month since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island. The three-dimensional battles by land, sea, and air around the island are becoming increasingly fierce and are now reaching their climax. The most important area on the island is Wa-xu, which is protected by two lines of defense: one from Ormoc to Binamopoan, and the other from Carigara via Haro and Dakami to Ningloing. Around this highland, Japanese and enemy forces are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in the ancient virgin forests. Since landing, the enemy's 1st Cavalry Division has advanced from Tacloban towards Carigara, while the main force, the 24th Division, has advanced further west from Carigara, crossed Singapore-kan, passed through the treacherous mountain ranges of the coastal area, and reached the vicinity of Dobinamopoan and Manakasenas. From this direction, they are in a position to determine the fate of Leyte Island. However, new Japanese troops have completed their defensive posture in the Limon area and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's vanguard, annihilating them. Subsequently, the Japanese forces in that area increasingly pressured the enemy and continued to advance north. On the 11th, they launched a fierce attack from the highlands south of Manakasenas. On the other hand, powerful Japanese forces are advancing from a certain highland towards the Carigara Plain and Singapore-kan. As a result, the enemy's 24th Corps, which had advanced to the vicinity of Binamopoan, had its retreat completely cut off. Helpless, it could only use two or three 3,000-ton ships to resupply a small amount of necessary supplies from the Beligala area, and even concentrate the heavy artillery positions in the Haro area to bombard Limon in an effort to rescue the 24th Division. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the eastern slope area of the central highlands, from Carolo via Dakami to Ningloing, are holding firm and completely repelling the enemy's attacks from the mountain positions, continuously launching fierce attacks on the enemy positions in the Dakami and Ningloing areas. This has forced the enemy to concentrate a large force on the highlands of Leyte Island, which are completely under Japanese control. Therefore, the enemy's 24th Division is now on the verge of collapse.

Manila, 16th (Central News Agency) - Enemy planes attacked Manila on the 14th. According to a subsequent investigation of the results of the battle, ground artillery shot down 24 enemy planes and destroyed 13, while six were shot down in air combat. Furthermore, the results achieved at Clark Airfield on the same day included two shot down and one destroyed, bringing the total results for both locations to as many as 46.

### The Center of the Philippine Battle: Contending for Air Supremacy, Both Army Offense and Defense are Key Points

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battle between Japan and the United States around the Philippine Islands is intensifying. On the Leyte Island front, five enemy divisions have landed, and since the 12th, they have further reinforced their forces by about two divisions. New Japanese troops have also gradually joined the battle lines, and the largest decisive battle since the start of the war has now begun. Elsewhere, enemy forces are consolidating the surviving mobile units in the waters near the Philippines and making threatening moves. In response, Japanese army air special attack units are launching fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage. The land, sea, and air battles between the two sides are becoming increasingly fierce. The battle situation in the Philippine Islands is truly at a crucial juncture for Japan's national destiny. The current center of the Philippine Islands battle situation is the offensive and defensive battle on Leyte Island. The outcome of this battle will determine the future course of the war. The enemy has poured its main force into Leyte, a small island in the central Philippines. Their intention is to quickly seize Leyte Island and build a strong military base in the central Philippines. From this base, the enemy can advance the air force under Mac沃塞 in New Guinea and bring the entire Philippines within the sphere of US air power in one fell swoop, combining it with the maritime air power of the surviving mobile units to seize air supremacy over the Philippines, in order to favor the war situation. Therefore, the enemy is first plotting to gain air supremacy over the entire Philippines and Leyte Island, and under the cover of air power, they are planning to reinforce their forces and advance their land forces. The central issue is the battle for air supremacy. The offensive and defensive battle on Leyte Island focuses on the battle for air supremacy and the land army's offensive and defensive battles. Japan and the United States are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

### Commander of Japanese Ground Forces Instructs All Officers and Soldiers

Manila, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army positions on Leyte Island are engaged in hand-to-hand combat day and night, launching attacks on enemy positions and posing a major threat to the enemy. Their morale is extremely high. This not only thwarts all enemy offensive attempts but also allows the Japanese army to gradually prepare for a major counterattack. As for how the Japanese ground forces on Leyte Island are striving and what their determination is for the battle, we can get a glimpse from the instructions given to his subordinates by a certain commander. The instructions are as follows: (1) We are decisive warriors shouldering the fate of the Japanese Empire. (2) The divine opportunity to launch an offensive has now arrived. We will advance and surely achieve victory. (3) Without victory on land, there can be no talk of victory at sea or in the air. (4) If we cannot retake Leyte Island, we will not return even in death. (5) We are resolved to engage in desperate hand-to-hand combat.

### Command of the Yunnan-Burma Area Divided into Two Parts

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - After Stilwell's departure, the US military command area in the Yunnan-Burma region has been divided into two parts: China and India-Burma. Therefore, the command authority and scope of the Chongqing military authorities have become a topic for the anti-Axis powers. Chongqing spokesman Zhang Pingqun claimed when meeting with a group of reporters on the 15th that Chiang Kai-shek is the supreme commander of the anti-Axis forces in the war zones of China, Vietnam, and Thailand. When asked by a group of reporters whether French Togo had agreed to place Vietnam within this command area, Chongqing Deputy Foreign Minister Wu Guozhen vigorously stated that "this command is entirely consistent with the anti-Axis forces." However, Wedemeyer, who took office as the US military commander in the China theater, stated on the 7th that "Vietnam is incorporated into the China theater, and Thailand is incorporated into the area of responsibility of the Southeast Asia Command," which is completely different from what Chongqing has said.

### Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry Talks About Suppressing Prices

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The recent rampant inflation is shocking. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are striving to find effective ways to ensure the people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and the Beijing Economic Bureau have recently sent personnel to Shanghai to contact and consult with various relevant parties in Shanghai, and it is reported that they have obtained quite concrete measures. In order to understand the authorities' rational measures for prices, this reporter specifically visited the person in charge of price management at the Ministry of Industry. According to him, the result of this trip to Shanghai to discuss with the Shanghai Economic Bureau and various relevant parties is that the various materials control committees will conduct a thorough investigation of the production prices of agricultural products for daily necessities and the actual figures for industrial products from factories. The various control committees will provide as much reference material as possible to the Ministry of Industry, which will then review it and forward it to the local price review authorities as a reference for price evaluation, in order to achieve the effect of suppressing prices. It is reported that the authorities are actively promoting this measure and preparing to implement it in the near future, in order to make price evaluation more rational and to stop the rampant inflation as soon as possible and ensure the people's livelihood.

### Japanese General Suetsugu Talks About the Pacific War Situation: Kamikaze Corps Demonstrates the Spirit of Bushido

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu recently issued a statement, the gist of which is: The so-called "Kamikaze" is not without reason. Recently, it has often been called "shock attack," which is the highest spirit of Japanese Bushido. However, the fact that the Kamikaze Corps has leaped from a suicide squad to a certain-death squad is unprecedented in history. Although there are many examples of suicide squads throughout history, both ancient and modern, the speaker's certain-death squad is truly a manifestation of the Japanese spirit, which foreigners cannot understand. At present, the nation's belief in certain victory is becoming increasingly solid. The war situation is extremely important. At the same time, the war situation, with the Philippines operation as its center, will soon be transformed into the offensive and defensive battle of the First Pacific Islands and the offensive and defensive battle of the Philippine Islands. The two are completely different in terms of the ease of supply, the difference in terrain, and the presence or absence of room for maneuver. In past Pacific offensive and defensive operations, the enemy's supply was extremely difficult. On the contrary, the Philippine Islands are large islands with heavily defended installations, making them easiest to supply and allowing mobile units to operate fully. Therefore, the supply lines for land and sea are becoming increasingly long, and the consumption of combat power is also increasing day by day. Therefore, the further the enemy advances, the more this difficulty increases. Therefore, from now on, the enemy will never be able to continue to resist. No matter how the enemy publicizes this fact, it will be of no avail.

### Two News Associations Encourage Each Other to Work Hard

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - On November 17th of last year, the Greater East Asia Journalists Association held a meeting in Tokyo, Japan. More than 80 news representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and Java, Celebes, and other places attended the meeting, which lasted for three days and achieved great results. At that time, it was also decided to organize the Greater East Asia News Council as the central hub for the great unity and solidarity of the Greater East Asia news community. Today marks the anniversary of this decision. The Chinese News Association of our country received a commemorative congratulatory telegram from Mr. Tanaka Tokichi, chairman of the association, and immediately replied to express its gratitude and encourage each other to work hard. The original text of the two telegrams is as follows: (Congratulatory Telegram from the Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Council) To Mr. Li Sihao, President of the Chinese News Association, and Vice Presidents Guo Xiufeng, Guan Yixian, and Chen Binhe: At this time, when the enemy Americans' counterattack is extremely stubborn, but the Japanese soldiers are still fighting bravely and repeatedly establishing unprecedented great achievements, we who bear the heavy responsibility of ideological warfare feel even more the necessity of strengthening the power of the Greater East Asia news community, so as to hone our pens to strike down the British and Americans, in order to achieve the liberation and prosperity of Asia. On the occasion of the anniversary of the conference, I, on behalf of the Greater East Asia News Association, respectfully wish all comrades efforts and struggles, and hope that the day of our reunion will be near. Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Association, Tanaka Tokichi. (Reply Telegram from the President of the Chinese News Association) To His Excellency Tanaka Tokichi, Chairman of the Greater East Asia News Council: Loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines of our allied countries are liberating the Greater East Asia peoples and have dealt a heavy blow to the stubborn counterattack of the enemy Americans on the Southwest Pacific, reaping glorious victories. On the occasion of the anniversary of the establishment of the Greater East Asia News Council today, the establishment of the Fourth War Front in our entire East Asia, which bears the heavy responsibility of ideological warfare, should further strengthen unity and exert total force to break through the enemy's absurd propaganda and achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I have read your telegram and deeply agree. I would like to express my utmost respect to the efforts and struggles of the comrades in our allied countries. I still hope that you will not hesitate to instruct us and provide guidance to the Chinese new opening community. This is my reply and I wish you good health.

Editorial

### The Fate of Chongqing

Chiang Kai-shek wrote a book entitled "China's Destiny," in which he beautifully described his fantasies. After its publication, it did not receive the reaction he had hoped for. On the contrary, it was criticized by American public opinion and ridiculed by the Communists. Now, Chongqing, the city on which Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" is pinned, is directly and severely threatened by the Allied forces' occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou. In the near future, it will face a final decision. Its fate is a matter of deep concern to every Chinese person, isn't it?

The Sino-Japanese War has dragged on for eight years. Some people have placed great expectations on Chongqing, and even firmly believe in Chiang's statement: "Before the fall of Wuhan, it was the defensive stage, and after the retreat from Wuhan, it entered the counter-offensive stage." Chongqing's dragging-on power would become stronger day by day. The actual answer is too cruel. Because the rulers of Chongqing did not see clearly the situation in the five years from the retreat from Wuhan to the eve of the Central Plains War in April of this year, that is, after occupying Wuhan, the Japanese government's policy towards China did not take military force as the solution to the Sino-Japanese War in terms of strategy. In terms of politics, it hoped that Chongqing would come to its senses and move towards comprehensive peace. It only carried out local military operations in unavoidable circumstances. Its main role was to protect the peace zone and repel the intrusions of the Chongqing Communists, so it either stopped at the right time or retreated to its original defense after completing its mission, such as occupying Changsha several times and withdrawing several times. The rulers of Chongqing actually ignored this point and created a misconception in an inglorious victory, truly believing that Japan no longer had the military strength to advance further, which sowed the seeds of Chongqing's tragic fate.

Therefore, the rulers of Chongqing, who were infatuated with the fantasies of "victory in the War of Resistance" and "national heroes," did not hesitate to sacrifice the human and material resources of China to serve the enemy Americans and allowed their land to be trampled upon. Using the Chinese mainland as a base, they disturbed the peace zone and the Japanese mainland. Under this situation, the Japanese army could not sit idly by and watch the expansion of the enemy American forces in China. It could only use military force to destroy the British and Americans on the Chinese mainland and destroy Chongqing's dream of dragging on the war. The Japanese government issued a special statement, explaining the purpose of this operation and urging Chongqing to come to its senses. However, Chongqing insisted on dragging on the war. In the past seven months, it has lost most of Henan Province, the entire city of Hunan Province, and the important stronghold of Guilin, Liuzhou in Guangxi. The air fortress in the southwest region, which took two years and the blood and sweat of hundreds of thousands of people to build, was destroyed in a short period of time. Half of the million-strong Chongqing army was lost on the north and south battlefields. Hengyang was abandoned after 40 days of hard fighting. Now, Guilin, the gateway to the defense of Chongqing, has been ordered to be defended to the death, with every soldier fighting to the last, but the soldiers did not follow orders and surrendered after only 40 hours of resistance. The people have no will to fight and the soldiers have no patriotism. The defeat six years ago is even worse today.

After the occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou, the ruling power of the Chongqing regime is very weak. Ninety-four percent of the country's railways are in the hands of the Allied forces, and there are almost no railway lines left. The southeast half and several southwest provinces are completely cut off from Chongqing. Although the unoccupied areas are nominally under the jurisdiction of Chongqing, in fact, they are fragmented and each goes its own way. The most resource-rich Hunan and Jiangxi provinces can no longer be used. Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan may become battlefields at any moment. The relatively safe and intact provinces are only Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, but these provinces are either barren and remote or occupied by the Communist Party. In the defeat six years ago, there was still Chongqing to retreat to. If the Chongqing Chiang regime does not consider the current situation and make smart plans, but continues to drag on the war, then the Japanese army may target Chongqing and completely destroy the British and American forces on the Chinese mainland. At that time, where will Chongqing retreat to?

The failure of the war not only caused the shaking of the political status but also lost international prestige. At the Cairo Conference last year, Chiang Kai-shek was invited to attend as one of the leaders of the four great powers. How long ago was that? The American public opinion community actually compared him to Mihailović in Yugoslavia. Using the failure of the war as an excuse, they even interfered in internal affairs. Now, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the CCP, has arrived in Chongqing escorted by a US military plane to conduct negotiations on a "united democratic government" with American support. We believe that there will be no results, but we believe even more that the Chongqing Chiang regime's dragging on the war is not hoping to turn "one government" into a "united democratic government," to add a "communist ideology" to "one ideology," or to have a "Mao Zedong" in addition to "one leader."

The people who used to support and praise them now harbor hostility and are waiting for an opportunity to deal a fatal blow to Chongqing. Only Japan has long stated that it does not regard Chongqing as an enemy, is full of Asian friendship, and welcomes Chongqing back to the embrace of the Asian people. The fate of Chongqing has reached the time when Chongqing's people must make a brave and decisive decision.

### Japanese Army Advances Westward from Liuzhou on Guangxi Front: Fierce Fighting Currently Underway Near Yishan

By dusk on the 14th, they had reached Nanxiang, about 60 kilometers west of Liuzhou, completely cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. On the other hand, a unit of the Japanese army that advanced southward from the western area of Liuzhou and a unit of the Japanese army that crossed the Wu River northward on the 14th made contact near Riken Village, about 40 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou.

At this time, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army in that area, in addition to compressing the encirclement of the Chongqing army, the Japanese army also quickly pursued the Chongqing 64th Army and a part of the 46th Army that were fleeing to the southwestern area of Liuzhou, arriving in the vicinity of Liushan Market (about 40 kilometers west of Liuzhou) and Ligao Market on the 13th, inflicting a crushing blow on the Chongqing army.

### Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits Rumors from Misleading the Public

It has been found that since the American enemy planes attacked the Shanghai area on the 11th of this month, and the shocking news of the passing of Chairman Wang of the National Government on the 13th, various absurd and unfounded rumors have emerged in the streets and alleys of this city. The reason for this lies in the fact that a large number of ignorant people have been incited by the conspiracies of the British, Americans, and Chongqing, and that a segment of the intelligentsia has also failed to distinguish right from wrong, using the current situation as an opportunity to fabricate rumors without end, thereby creating panic among the people. Now, the City Police Bureau, in order to reassure and protect the people, has resolved to eradicate the source of rumors. Anyone found to be spreading rumors or disrupting public order will be severely punished without leniency. It is hoped that all citizens will understand the intentions of the authorities, not be misled by rumors, and refrain from rash actions.

### Nanjing Miscellanea

— By Lü Zhen

I recently made a trip to Nanjing. Because the period was short and the matters were pressing, I only retained some superficial impressions. I will now briefly record what I saw and heard:

A Glimpse of the City

Today's Nanjing, although the mountains and rivers remain the same, the desolation of the city is already visible. In terms of urban transportation, only one bus route remains, running from Xiaguan to the Confucius Temple area, and the frequency of service has decreased, so passengers must wait a long time. In addition to rickshaws, the most common mode of transportation is public horse-drawn carriages. These carriages have fixed routes, for example, those stationed at the Confucius Temple wait until they have seven or eight passengers before departing. Passengers can board and disembark anywhere along the route, with Xinjiekou as the final destination. The fare is 20 yuan per person, regardless of distance. The municipal government originally stipulated that each carriage should only carry seven passengers, but in fact, it is not uncommon to see carriages carrying eleven or twelve passengers. I once rode in such a carriage, driven by two children aged only fifteen or sixteen. Because the horse was moving very slowly, they repeatedly whipped it, but as a result, the horse simply stood still. The other child had to get out of the carriage and pull the horse along. This was probably because the horse was old or lacked sufficient food, so it was unable to run. And in order to make a living, children of school age are busy taking on the work of adults.

Before the incident, Nanjing had been undergoing construction by the government and the public, and the city was gradually prospering, with a modern appearance. However, after the incident, it suffered a great catastrophe, with extensive destruction. After the return of the National Government, the residents gathered, and there was a temporary revival. But today, it has returned to a state of decline. There are still many broken walls and ruins interspersed throughout the city, which have not been repaired. The Confucius Temple area was originally a lively area, but the destroyed Confucius Temple, and the mat-covered wooden sheds that were built during the return of the capital, have mostly been demolished, leaving only a few small stalls doing small business. The nearby streets have been in disrepair for a long time, and are uneven, with piles of bricks and stones along the sides of the road, which no one clears. The Qinhuai River has just been released, so the river water is still high, but it is still a dirty green. The citizens in this area wash clothes and rice in this dirty green water. The so-called pleasure boats are dilapidated, like the remains of ships abandoned on the shore. The most prosperous market in the city is only slightly better than the Paramount shopping mall at the Jing'an Temple and Fanhwangdu Road intersection in Shanghai. The famous Nanjing brocade is, in fact, mostly transported from Hangzhou, and there are no weaving factories in Nanjing. Under the pressure of high living costs, it is rare to see pedestrians with neat clothing on the streets, so the extravagance is not as prevalent as in Shanghai. The lack of supplies is even more severe than in Shanghai, for example, pork, despite high prices, is sold out early in the morning. One of my friends lives far from the city center. His maid often goes to the market in the morning, but the meat is already sold out, so he only dared to invite me to dinner after he had already bought the meat. Many shops are already small and poorly equipped, but today they are even worse. Nanjing is a Chinese city, unlike Shanghai, which is a world city, so the general public in Nanjing does not show a keen interest in the international situation. And these days, it happened to coincide with the passing of the chairman, so the general public, especially civil servants, are paying more attention to the news of future personnel adjustments in the National Government.

The Lives of Civil Servants

Because Nanjing is the capital, it has become a political center, and there are many civil servants. Although their salaries have also increased intermittently, even doubled, following the rise in the price index, it seems that the tortoise is chasing the rabbit, and is falling further and further behind.

Currently, the salary of an average civil servant, such as a section chief or clerk, is only about 5,000 or 6,000 yuan. Although the government has stipulated that six dou of rice should be issued as salary, it is already November, and they are still eating the unhusked rice from July. Moreover, starting in October, it will be converted into cash, reportedly calculated at only 3,000 yuan per dan, while the black market price of rice in Nanjing is 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per stone (the rice in Nanjing is of lower quality, and the price is lower than in Shanghai). Isn't this calculation causing civil servants to suffer another loss?

Most civil servants have families. Assuming that a civil servant supports a family of three, then his expenses must be at least 15,000 yuan. But can a salary of 5,000 or 6,000 yuan, plus 1,800 yuan for the rice conversion, make ends meet? And does the stomach need to be filled, or does the body need to be kept warm? The legs can endure labor, but can worn-out shoes and socks not be replaced?

However, although civil servants are not eating enough or wearing enough, although some civil servants have changed careers, there are still many people vying for positions, so there is still inevitable infighting in the agencies.

The income of senior civil servants is relatively higher. The income of a department director, including the rice allowance, is about 30,000 yuan; a vice minister, about 50,000 yuan; and a minister, about 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. But their expenses are also relatively high, and it is difficult to support the family. One of my friends is a department director, and another is a vice minister. They both said they were preparing to retire, or go back to their hometown to live off their savings, or find another way to make a living. Because not only is their life unstable, but it is also difficult to do things and govern, and it is not easy to command lower-level civil servants. Most of those lower-level civil servants are struggling on the brink of starvation, so they naturally have no interest in working. If there is a temporary official matter to be handled, they must find a way to get some benefits, otherwise they will not be very enthusiastic about doing things.

However, the organizers of the Writers' Conference held in Nanjing this time have done their best. Especially Mr. Zhang Ke and Mr. Gong Chiping, they are busy all day long. This spirit of hard work and dedication is very rare in today's Chinese political circles; probably because they are both from a cultural background, so they are so willing to take responsibility.

The Highest Institution of Learning

The National Central University, which is called the highest institution of learning, has changed its president three times in one year since the resignation of former president Fan Zhongyun. During the time when Minister of Education Li Shengwu concurrently served as president, he delegated the authority to handle school affairs to the heads of general affairs and academic affairs. In student management, he seemed to adopt a laissez-faire approach similar to that of the United States and the United Kingdom, which had no practical effect, so he resigned halfway. Chen Zhuzun, a famous figure in the academic world, took over the presidency, but unfortunately lacked the power to run the school, and a group of students, after having caused a student strike, were not easily restrained, so the faculty and staff became discouraged, and the number of those who resigned and left the school increased. This spring, the government appointed Chen Changzu as the new president of Central University. He intended to run the school with the spirit of managing the army, so within a week, the students bowed their heads and the faculty and staff were submissive. However, schools and armies are different in nature after all. Treating students like soldiers, attempting to force them into submission with authority, and not seeking to make them obey with virtue, the educational effect is questionable. And there is no lack of professors who have resigned and left the school one after another. Furthermore, it is rumored that during this semester, there have been incidents such as the selling of entrance examination questions and the theft and sale of valuable books. If this is true, then it is a stain on the lofty educational world. Recently, due to the deterioration of the rice, it is said that the students smashed bowls in the dining hall and displayed the "hygienic rice" with half rice and half grain in the auditorium, inviting the president to have a "simple meal." As a result of this dining hall turmoil, the school authorities dismissed the person in charge of the general affairs department and promised to provide pure white rice in the future, which was finally resolved. According to a member of the youth group, the school fees last year were about 3,000 yuan per student per semester, while this semester they have risen to about 13,000 yuan. Some poor students have dropped out of school because they cannot afford it, or have even been encouraged to go elsewhere. The current students, like soldiers, are feared by the theaters, because they often go in groups, watch free shows without buying tickets, and cause disputes if interfered with.
