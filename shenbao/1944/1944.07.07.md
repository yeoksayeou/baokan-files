### Another Grave Lesson

Regarding the import of rice into this city, the requisition system was implemented on July 1st. According to a report published yesterday by the Rice Control Association, in the three days from July 1st to the 3rd, the amount requisitioned was only 30 shi. Eleven shi were requisitioned on each of the first and second days, and this was reduced to six shi on the third day. However, the quantity transported in actually increased on the third day compared to the first two days. The black market price of rice rose day by day. We have listed the figures from the Associationâ€™s report in the table below for comparison, to give a glimpse of the situation:

Date   Quantity Transported In   Quantity Requisitioned   Rice Price
July 1st   4154 shi   12 shi   10,600 yuan
July 2nd   4530 shi   12 shi   11,200 yuan
July 3rd   5263 shi   6 shi   11,200 yuan
July 4th   5683 shi   Unclear   12,300 yuan

From the figures in the table above, the following are noteworthy: The quantity transported in increased daily, while the quantity requisitioned decreased, forming an inverse proportion. The quantity requisitioned accounts for only one or two per thousand of the quantity transported in. Compared to the stipulated 30 percent, it is pitifully small. The price of rice rose day by day (On June 30th, the price of rice was 9,700 yuan; according to the actual black market price, it was even higher than this). Even calculating the requisition price at the highest price of 3,200 yuan, it is four times lower than the black market price and twice lower than the price at the place of origin (6,500 yuan in Qingpu and Songjiang).

First, why did the quantity transported in increase daily while the quantity requisitioned decrease? Because the requisition price is too low, not even covering costs, let alone a reasonable profit. Therefore, people are trying to avoid requisition as much as possible, breaking up large quantities into smaller ones.

Second, why did the price of rice rise day by day? Because the requisition price is too low, not even covering costs. As a result, losses incurred in the requisitioned portion are recouped in the freely traded portion, to offset the losses.

Therefore, we can say that the current requisition methods and prices are still unreasonable, only serving to stimulate price increases and further exacerbate the rice problem. Those responsible for rice control should deeply reflect on these facts and not turn a blind eye.

An editorial in the News Report on the 5th of July pointed out that, according to the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice Consumption in Beijing and Shanghai" and the "Administrative Measures for Rice Consumption Management in Shanghai," the main purpose of rice requisition was to correct the unreasonableness of past low-price purchases and should be based on cost plus a reasonable profit, thereby increasing the quantity purchased, replenishing supplies, and suppressing the black market. We also believe that this is indeed the intent of the government's legislation. However, why does the requisition price currently being implemented disregard costs and reasonable profits, resulting in a reduction in the quantity requisitioned and a sharp rise in black market rice prices, a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly difficult to control? We cannot help but feel completely perplexed by such measures taken by the Rice Control Association.

Moreover, the original intention was to increase purchases to replenish supplies, but the opposite is now happening. In three days, only 30 shi were requisitioned. May we ask, can these 30 shi of rice "replenish supplies"? If we calculate based on a population of five million in Shanghai, with 300,000 grains of rice per dou (some have counted approximately 3,000 grains per he. The "Qi Min Yao Shu" states that there are over 51,000 grains per dou of unhusked grain), then 30 shi of rice contains 90 million grains. In three days, each person can be allocated 18 grains of rice. May we ask, does such a requisition help the people's food supply? Does it help public grain reserves? Even a three-year-old child knows it is completely useless. However, in order to requisition these 30 shi of rice, the price of rice has increased by 1,500 yuan per shi in three days (based on the figures in the published report; the actual increase is even higher). Assuming each person consumes 1.5 dou of rice per month, that's 1.5 sheng in three days, resulting in an increased burden of 22.5 yuan. In other words, the citizens have already paid a price of 22.5 yuan to obtain 18 grains of rice that have not yet been allocated. Is this measure beneficial to the people or harmful to them?

We do not wish to quote out of context or criticize harshly, but we genuinely feel the seriousness of the people's food problem, which absolutely cannot withstand further stimulation. Moreover, the decision to implement the requisition method by the Rice Control Association is a major measure. Has it been approved by the government? Has it been discussed in a full committee meeting? If it is merely based on the subjective opinions of a few people, rashly decided, it is inevitably suspected of being taken lightly.

We argued in our editorial on July 4th that, after the recent reorganization of the Commerce Control Association, the Rice Control Association is one of its five subordinate committees, with the authority and responsibility to guide and supervise. Therefore, the Commerce Control Association should be jointly responsible for the measures of the Rice Control Association. Requisition is no longer appropriate given the current timing and actual situation. The current Rice Control Association should be reorganized as soon as possible to carry out its closing work, while focusing all efforts on preparing for the rice control work during the autumn harvest. How to learn from past failures, how to consider the current environment, and how to formulate a reasonable plan to avoid digging a well only when thirsty and taking measures that are completely misguided, causing hardship to the people. Of particular importance is that the Commerce Control Association should carefully select suitable personnel with experience, credibility, historical connections in the rice industry, and integrity to take charge. Now, we further propose that the Commerce Control Association should immediately assume its guidance and supervision responsibilities and abolish the current untimely requisition method. The problem is serious, and the timing is urgent, leaving no room for hesitation, to alleviate the suffering of the people.

### Enemy Aircraft Mobile Unit Fled After Failing to Attack Iwo Jima and Other Islands; Japanese Forces Shot Down Over 74 Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 6th that the enemy mobile unit that attacked Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands was driven away by the defending Japanese forces on the afternoon of July 4th. In this battle, over 74 enemy aircraft were shot down, while the Japanese forces lost 30 aircraft and five ships.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese base in the central Pacific reported that enemy mobile units and carrier-based aircraft attacked Iwo Jima on the 3rd and 4th and Chichi-jima on the 4th. The Japanese forces stationed on Chichi-jima shot down 20 of the hundreds of enemy aircraft that repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, the report that enemy cruisers and destroyers bombarded Chichi-jima on the 4th was a false report. The enemy forces only bombarded Iwo Jima with naval guns on the 4th.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese base in the central Pacific reported that enemy aircraft attacked Miyakojima on the 4th. The Japanese forces stationed there engaged them and shot down 19 aircraft. The Japanese side suffered very light damage. Furthermore, 15 enemy aircraft attacked Yap Island on the 5th. The Japanese forces stationed there destroyed five aircraft and repelled the attack. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft crashed, but the pilot landed safely.

### Saipan Island Enters Decisive Battle Stage

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 5th that the battle of Saipan Island has now entered an extremely critical stage. The announcement reads as follows: Since the 15th of last month, the enemy, under the cover of intense artillery and aerial bombardment, attempted to land with amphibious tanks. Both attempts were annihilated by Japanese forces on the coast. During the enemy's third landing attempt, Japanese forces destroyed over ten enemy tanks. Because the enemy consolidated their positions in the streets of Garapan, on the southern slopes of Mount Tapochau, and in the northwest area, the enemy concentrated artillery fire and attacked Mount Tapochau starting on the 23rd. At the same time, they gradually advanced a strong tank force from the east coast. Although the Japanese forces fought bravely, they were forced to abandon the summit of Mount Tapochau (474 meters above sea level), the highest peak on Saipan Island, on the 26th. After being subjected to concentrated artillery and aerial bombardment by the enemy, the mountain's appearance has changed drastically in just ten days, which shows how fierce the fighting was. After capturing the summit of Mount Tapochau, the enemy immediately used it as a spearhead and attacked the strategic point of Tanapag on the east coast with a strong force. The fighting became even more fierce on the 28th. At that time, Japanese forces seized the opportunity to launch counterattacks, or charged into enemy positions as scouts, or used a small amount of artillery fire to attack the Aslito airfield that the enemy had begun to use, continuing the bloody battle. As such, the battle line gradually shifted to the northeastern end of the island. Although the Japanese forces have now been forced to the foothills of Mount Achugao, located six kilometers from the north coast of the island, the army and navy soldiers and the remaining residents are still fighting to the death. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. Although the enemy headquarters has not yet announced the figures, it is estimated that the enemy's losses since landing until the 30th have reached over 10,000. The enemy's landing force was approximately two or three divisions, and half of them have been annihilated. However, Japanese losses have also gradually increased. They are currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a superior enemy force. The Japanese soldiers' fierce struggle will continue to resist with the great spirit of sacrificing themselves, even if only one soldier remains. The battle line is currently in a chaotic state, and the battle has reached a critical period.

### Japanese Forces South of Conghua Form Encirclement; Fierce Fighting Continues

Japanese Forces Somewhere, 6th (Central News Agency) - Japanese units advancing north along the Yuehan Railway have now eliminated the resistance of Chongqing forces on both sides of the railway and are continuing to advance. Meanwhile, a Japanese unit pursuing the defeated remnant forces west of the Yuehan Railway broke through the strong positions of the Chongqing forces and captured Bijia Mountain (1.5 kilometers east of Qingyuan) and Guanyin Ridge (2 kilometers northwest of Qingyuan). They are currently pursuing the Chongqing forces attempting to retreat north of the Beijiang River. In addition, another unit, in order to coordinate with them, also captured Baishikou (1 kilometer west of Qingyuan) on the evening of the 4th. A unit of Japanese forces advancing north east along the Yuehan Line formed an encirclement in the mountainous area south of Conghua on the 3rd. On the 4th, they placed the county town of Conghua within the encirclement. Operations in that area are currently continuing fiercely.

Residents of Shaoguan and Yingde Evacuate

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press dispatch from a special correspondent in Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts is as follows: The progress of the war in China is increasingly favorable to the Japanese forces. Hengyang is currently surrounded by Japanese forces on all sides. The Chongqing forces' route of retreat to the southwest has been cut off, but they are still holding the city to the death. Japanese heavy artillery bypassed Leiyang, located 60 kilometers south of Hengyang, and advanced to the southern outskirts of the city, about 80 kilometers south of Hengyang on the Yuehan Line. As for the Japanese forces advancing north from the Guangzhou area, they are currently divided into three routes, advancing towards Qingyuan (70 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou), Conghua (40 kilometers northeast), and Longmen (40 kilometers northeast). The Japanese forces advancing along a wide front of over 100 kilometers on both sides of the Yuehan Line are simultaneously advancing. The vanguard units of the Japanese forces advancing south from Hunan and the vanguard units of the Japanese forces advancing north from northern Guangdong Province are only about 300 kilometers apart. Most of the 1,100-kilometer Yuehan Line from Guangzhou to Hankou is in the hands of the Japanese forces. The only areas not yet occupied are Shaoguan and Yingde to its south. The Chongqing forces are currently planning to use these two key locations to prevent the Japanese forces from advancing north. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the Hengyang area are likely to attack to the southwest. The Chongqing authorities are forcing the residents of important cities such as Guilin, Shaoguan, and Yingde to evacuate in preparation for a Japanese attack. Large-scale evacuations have begun along the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways in Henan and Hunan provinces. The movement of the population is reminiscent of the mass movement of residents from the coastal provinces to the interior during the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Guilin has recently become a transit point for refugees from Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. Now, even the people of Guilin are busy evacuating. Because the evacuating citizens are abandoning their homes and possessions, carrying only cash with them, merchandise cannot be sold, and prices have plummeted. It is reported that the Chongqing forces are currently dismantling a section of the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang to Guilin.

Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack on the Hunan Front

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing government released a war report on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts late on the 5th, stating that fierce fighting continues in various locations on the Hunan front around Hengyang. On the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese forces continued their fierce attacks along the entire line under the cover of heavy artillery fire. The Chongqing forces also used air force and artillery fire for cover and defense. A bitter battle is currently unfolding along the entire line. The Chongqing forces on both sides of the Xiang River launched counterattacks against the advancing Japanese forces. Japanese forces south of Leiyang advanced to Feijiang, 20 kilometers from the city. The Chongqing forces engaged them. The Chongqing forces are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces along the entire front line. On the Guangdong front, after the Japanese forces occupied Longjiang on the 3rd, the Chongqing forces counterattacked that night and are engaged in fighting on the east and west outskirts of Qingyuan.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Chongqing and American forces are making low-altitude flights with B-25 bombers to drop weapons and ammunition to the garrison troops in Hengyang, which is completely surrounded by Japanese forces, in an attempt to prevent the city from falling.

Chongqing-U.S. Air Force Adopts Defensive Posture

Japanese Forces Frontline Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - The main operational goal of the Japanese Air Force stationed in China is to attempt to achieve results. Today, the Japanese militaryâ€™s operations in China are achieving significant results, and this shift signifies that the Japanese military will initiate a major offensive. Because the Japanese land forces are entering the perimeter of the Chongqing-U.S. air bases from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, they first plan to seize the Hengyang airfield. The Japanese air fleet will then advance its base to sever the connections between Suichuan, Jian'ou, Ganzhou, and Ji'an, thereby abandoning its past posture and completing a large-scale offensive. It is reported that the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, facing a reversal of the situation, is adopting a defensive posture and attempting to temporarily retreat to Guilin, reorganize its forces, and then attempt to make a move. However, the power of the Japanese land forces can still threaten Guilin, so the commander of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, General Chennault, has decided to abandon Guilin and retreat further to Kunming. This proves that Chennault's plan for air raids against Japan has been completely thwarted. As the war progresses, Hengyang and Guilin will soon be captured. The Japanese Air Force will advance to Kunming, the base of the Chongqing Air Force, annihilate the 14th Air Force, which is invading Asia, and shatter its ambitions. The Japanese military's grand strategic plan is currently underway.

### Foreign Minister Chu Speaks on the Sino-Japanese Statement: Cooperation and Co-prosperity with Allies

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the 5th of this month, the Japanese government issued a statement to proclaim its confidence in victory. Our government also issued a statement on the same day to express the purpose of returning to the capital. As a result, deeper cooperation between China and Japan to jointly complete the war, defeat Britain and the United States, and protect East Asia is of profound significance. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government issued the following statement on this matter: The Japanese government issued a statement on the 5th of this month to proclaim its confidence in victory and strongly stated that the purpose of this operation is only to destroy the aggression and hegemonic ambitions of Britain and the United States. If the Chongqing troops refuse to collude with Britain, they will not be treated as enemies. Furthermore, Japan's hopes for the Republic of China are to respect China's independence and autonomy based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, in order to achieve an eternal relationship of good neighborliness and friendship between China and Japan. From this, we can more clearly understand the true intentions of our ally Japan towards China. Therefore, our government also issued a statement expressing the purpose of returning to the capital, which is to promote peace and national unity, complete the East Asian War, so that China's freedom and independence can be established as soon as possible, and further develop the strength of an independent country to stabilize East Asia. After this statement by China and Japan, all our countrymen should understand the goodwill of our ally Japan towards our country and its hope that our country, as a member of East Asia, will share the responsibility of protecting East Asia, so that Japan can devote all its efforts to completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Since Japan is so sincere, how should our country be brave and progressive to cooperate with our ally Japan, and with the determination to live and die together, to achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity? It is deeply hoped that Chongqing can understand the greater righteousness, return to the fold as soon as possible, turn hostility into friendship, and jointly overthrow Britain and the United States, who are invading East Asia, and move forward together on the path of reviving China and protecting East Asia. This is not only the expectation of the people of the whole country, but also the sympathy of our ally Japan.

### Manchukuo Foreign Minister Issues Statement

Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Foreign Minister Li of Manchukuo issued a statement on the current situation and the Chongqing's erroneous continuation of the war, as follows: The Sino-Japanese Incident, amid the fierce progress of the Greater East Asia War, coincides with the 7th anniversary. Thanks to the brave and tenacious fighting of the Japanese army, enemy bases of the US and Britain have now been lost, and the construction of a new order and the establishment of a co-prosperity sphere are progressing step by step. The countries of Greater East Asia are all shouldering the heavy responsibility of building a co-prosperity sphere and moving towards the path of completing the war. Under the assistance of Japan, all construction in our country is progressing rapidly. Our ally, the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, is developing its national strength and expanding the peaceful areas. At the same time, it is working hard on construction and improving the lives of the people, and the economy is becoming more prosperous. The economic new system under the National Government's decisive battle has been as solid as a rock. In the military field, it is also becoming increasingly stronger, and it has a number of elite land and naval forces, standing on the front line of peaceful nation-building. At the same time, it is cooperating with the Japanese army to destroy the enemy US and Britain and establish a glorious cause. The people in the resistance areas have mostly awakened to peaceful nation-building and are returning to the peaceful areas one after another. Today, the resistance camp is gradually collapsing. And places such as Luoyang and Changsha, which were boasted as resistance bases, have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. At this time, if the resistance camp continues to fight without regard for the friendship of a common culture and race, it is extremely foolish.

### Japanese Science and Technology Groups Hold Joint Conference to Study New Weapons and Enhance Production

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to gather the essence of national science and technology and jointly devote efforts to the research of combat technology to enhance combat power, specially established the Technology Institute last November. In addition, the Japan Science and Technology Group Federation has also mobilized hundreds of thousands of scientists to engage in the invention and creation of new weapons. Therefore, Japan's national movement to promote decisive battle science and technology has been launched throughout the country. Furthermore, the Technology Institute, the National Science and Technology League, the Science Society, the Science Association, and other organizations held a joint conference of Japanese science and technology groups at the Marunouchi Hotel here on the 5th to discuss various specific matters. According to the Creative Division of the Technology Institute, since its establishment on November 1st last year, it has received 7,356 invention proposals from the public until June this year. Among these cases, those related to decisive battle weapons account for 60% of the total. The majority of these are new researches on aircraft. This point also shows the public's concern for aviation weapons. The remaining 40% are new inventions related to enhancing production. In addition, the most outstanding 535 cases out of all the cases have been awarded commendations to the inventors by the Technology Institute in March and June respectively. At the same time, trial production has begun, and many of them have been completed, making great contributions to strengthening combat power. However, as the war situation becomes more severe, the emergency mobilization of the scientific community is even more urgent. Therefore, the Technology Institute is the main body, gathering 150 academic societies and associations across the country to thoroughly mobilize all scientists in the country, with a view to further promoting the invention and creation of all the people. It is also planned that by the end of October, these cases will be collected, categorized, and forwarded by the Technology Institute to the military authorities and relevant government agencies, as well as various production factories. In addition to specialists engaging in specialized research, it is also expected that ordinary people can also conduct research, so as to achieve the practical effect of mobilizing all scientists in the country, and contribute to new weapons and the necessary technology for enhancing production.

### Volleyball League Opens This Weekend - A Discussion of the Men's and Women's Division A Teams

This year's volleyball league has five teams in Division A, twenty-two teams in Division B, and six teams in Division A for women. It will begin on the 9th of this month. It is expected that this volleyball competition, following football and basketball, will once again cause a sensation. Taking advantage of this opening, we will introduce the strengths of the Division A and women's teams to promote it, which will surely increase interest and be welcomed by fans.

Heroines

Sansheng - This team is more dedicated to volleyball than basketball. Looking at its strength, it is indeed extraordinary. There are many strong players under its command, who are capable and experienced. Their strong and healthy posture does not give way to men. Players such as Shi Ruijuan, who is experienced, Li Bo, who supports the team, Chen Meizhen, who makes sudden attacks, and Chen Liuzhen, who strikes fiercely, are famous in the volleyball scene and have enjoyed fame for a long time. Moreover, this team practices very hard and is willing to put in hard work. The front, middle, and rear rows are well connected. This team has great ambitions for the championship in this session. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." We hope that Captain Shi and others will work hard and be able to achieve their wishes.

Zhiqian - Combines veteran players and newcomers into one team. Zhang Jiazhen, Shao Tiao, and Zhu Shifang are veterans in the volleyball world. Zhang Minyu, Xu Wei, and Zhu Ruiying are promising newcomers. It is now heard that Tan Yongqi has been invited to guide them. They are working hard at the Shanghai Girls' High School volleyball court and have great ambitions. In the future, when they compete for the top spot, this team of women should not be underestimated.

Huayan - Organized by the Huayanli Association in Zhangjia Garden, it has a history of six years. This team initially did not focus on trophies, and did not care about gains and losses. They play sports for the sake of sports, so they are highly regarded by the general public. However, in recent years, they have participated in more battles, gained experience, and their results have been improving day by day. People like Zhu Zhipei and Peng Guoying can indeed be squeezed into the first-class talents. Moreover, with Xu Lingxian commanding from the middle, their reputation is increasing day by day. On the day of the end of this league, this team will surely be able to...

Green Team - After winning the basketball and round gateball championships, this time they also have the intention to try their hand at volleyball. According to reporters, their lineup includes Huang Xingfen and Zhu Yinlan in the front row, Huang Mingyuan, Wang Weizhen, and Liu Zhenshi in the middle row, and Xiang Yulin, Yang Wenjuan, and Rong Shujian in the back row. They are all known for their agility and are worthy of being all-rounders. Moreover, newcomers such as Zhu Chengran, Yan Weiwen, Zhang Minzhi, and Li Yunzhi have achieved excellent results under good guidance. Therefore, this team does not seem to have the ambition of Sansheng and Zhiqian. At the very least, they threaten all teams and have good results. It is uncertain whether they will win unexpectedly. It is not hopeless to win the silver shield again! Strive for it!

The remaining two teams are Western teams, the Western Youth and the Soviet Union. Among them, the Western Youth has strong overall strength, but because they are accustomed to American rules, the Chinese Youth court may not have much development. In short, the four Chinese women's teams in this session are all known to be strong and will surely be among the best in the future. I hope that good people will think that they can all show their strengths and shine.

Male Athletes

Huaying - Since receiving the influence of Tan Yongzhan, the former Far East representative, and the return of Li Baozhong and other generals from the north, as well as the assistance of basketball master Li Zhenzhong, its momentum has greatly increased, and it is no longer the Wu Xia Amon of the past. Tan and the two Lis all have unique skills, which are the key to the team's scoring. It is a pity that Tan Yongzhan was once a figure who dominated the scene and was invincible. His agility is still lingering. Although he is now older, he is still sharp and his charm is enough to compete with young women. It is especially gratifying that he is willing to patiently teach other team members, so Huaying may have a satisfactory performance.

Yuehua - Has the most complete talent, such as Guo Bingkun, Mai Bingyao, Zheng Jichang, Han Ruoyu, Yu Zouzi, Ma Canxi, and Chen Xuechong, each with their own specialties. Among them, Guo Bingkun's fierce hammering, Mai Bingyao's blocking and counter-æ‰£, and Yu Zouzi's good use of wit are beyond the reach of other teams. If there are no unexpected changes in this team, then winning the championship is likely to be the case today, who else but me!

White Team - Although it has a long history, it has not been able to achieve special results. This team has always focused on connecting emotions and has never had any intention of wooing players. In the end, with the return of Wang Deyuan and his brothers, Cheng Dui, Zhang Xianlun, Qu Xineng, Chen Zuoliang, and other strong players, the talent is relatively complete. They will surely have better skills to show us.

There are also two teams, the Soviet Union and the Russian Overseas Chinese, which are organized by Russians. They are strong and have a considerable foundation in volleyball. In the future, there may be upsets. Our Chinese teams should not underestimate them.

### Football Season Ends; Small Ball League Produced

The Small Football Federation of this city has initiated and hosted the first small ball league. There are as many as 180 teams registered to participate, setting a rare record for the number of teams in the opening game. They are divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D. Because there are too many teams joining, each group is further divided into several divisions. After the championships of each division are produced in the future, the overall championship will be determined. A competition committee has been specially established to preside over the matter. The list is as follows:

Tan Xi (Chairman), Zhang Baokui, Shen Huichun, Deng Xiaoliang, Qian Weilie, Chen Jixiang, Huang Renyi.

The competition venues will also be held in five places to facilitate the rapid progress of the competition.

Shanghai Youth Friendship Association - Xingguo Road (Leishangda Road). 72 Huashan Road (Haige Road).

Xuhui School Iron Field - Xujiahui Xuhui Middle School.

Tongle Ball Field - Yongjia Road (West Aihans Road) Yeyang Road (Qiqi Road).

Aurora University Ball Field - Lingshi Road. (LÃ¼ban Road)

Yangtze Iron Field - Inside the Central Market on North Xizang Road.

The competition is scheduled to open tomorrow (Saturday) at 4:20 pm at the Shanghai Youth Friendship Association Ball Field. There are three programs. The transcription is added below.

Jingwu - Russian Physical Education A (A2) 4:20 Li Guoyi

India - Ronghua (D4) 5:30 Jin Jiabiao

Sansheng - German Chamber of Commerce (A3) 6:40 Chen Jixiang

In Group A2, Jingwu vs. Russian Physical Education A, both sides have famous football players, and there will be many exciting moments. Jingwu was newly established last month and openly recruited players. Many people joined, including Dong Qun, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Chen Mingzhe, and Han Longgen. Tao Ziming, Tao Tingfu, Shen Jind, Zhao Yongfang, and others are all veterans of the arena, so the lineup is solid and the combat power is strong.

Russian Physical Education A is organized by Russian athletes, just like a police force. Players such as Savin, En Bifev, Shang, and Zhuoluntev are all brave and good at fighting. Their strength is no less than that of Jingwu. When the two heroes meet for the first time, a battle of dragons and tigers will be difficult to predict who will win.

Sansheng is a rising star. It won the overall championship of Group C of the Shanghai League Football this year. This time, it is participating in Group A of the small ball league. With its tacit cooperation and enthusiasm for football, it will surely achieve excellent results. All the young players are like dragons and tigers, and Jin Lusheng's agility is even more rare. The team's defensive skills are impeccable.

The German Chamber of Commerce is the German team, with famous Northern European players Xu Erzhu, Fu En, and the Pantuosun brothers assisting in the battle, which is not ordinary. When they meet Sansheng tomorrow, there will be a fierce competition, and the fiery battle situation can be expected.

Attached is the lineup of the four teams in Group A tomorrow:

(Jingwu Association) Chen Ziming, Huang Fengjia, Tao Tingfu, Xu Guofu, Han Longgen, Shen Jind, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Luo Choufu, Chen Mingzhe, Zhao Yongfang, Lin Dianyi.

(Russian Physical Education A) Shadiguf, Savin, En Bifev, Li Weisiji, Zhuoluntev, Mai Qidang, Kaluoliequ, Nuoxueweisiji, Apuliguf, Fafutuofu, Gaoerkuai.

(Sansheng Association) Huang Shijie, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Fengfu, Zhang Renyi, Pei Guilin, Ye Jingqi, Lu Linggui, Jin Lusheng, Wang Hesheng, Zhu Yinfu, Chen Yunhou, Chen Renã€€.

(German Chamber of Commerce) Shibaike, Niubaoer, Fu En, Xu Erqi, W Pantuosun, H Pantuosun, Qisiman, Duxi, Lin Nagelun.

### Sports Anecdotes

The tennis season has already begun, but the news in this city is still unknown. This is because this aristocratic sport is not easy to handle.

The Shaoxing Cup basketball game is scheduled to open this weekend (9th) at Qingnian Middle School. The program is quite exciting. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion, which is also a stimulus to the long-standing basketball loneliness.

Yan Shixin, a new football player from Hong Kong, has arrived in Shanghai. According to him, he does not intend to join any football team for the time being and will take a break.

Zhang Lingen was appointed as the volunteer coach of the Jinlong Small Ball Team.

Miss Wang Weizhen of the Green Team works at the Asian Bank and has a team leader title. Therefore, the work is exceptionally heavy, but Miss Wang is still able to use her spare time to be active in the sports world, which is commendable.

Dai Linjing is accustomed to playing football on Xialing Road. Because he often went to Java (returning to his wife's hometown) before the war to practice in the hot summer. Therefore, Ah Dai's recent performances have been particularly good, not without reason. (Skinny reporter)

Zhou Wenji, the general manager of Mingxing Perfume Factory, enthusiastically advocates sports, organizes the Mingxing Basketball Team to participate in the league, and serves as the team leader. He is very interested in the game. It is heard that he will organize other iron teams (Ren).

### Simple Fitness Training Method (II) (X)

- Written by Tom, translated by De

Gradually, the knuckles can touch the ground when the hands are clenched into fists, and finally the palms can also touch the ground. But it must be remembered that the knees must not be bent when the body is leaning forward.

If you have not practiced this exercise, it is enough to bend down and back five times each day in the first week. After that, increase five times each week until you bend down and back fifty times each day.

For many years, the author has practiced fifty times every morning, no matter what the environment is. Sometimes in a sleeping car, sometimes because he wants to catch a train, he practices at two or three o'clock in the morning. Sometimes on a ship when the sea is rough; sometimes in a retired room, even if the cold signature drops to minus sixteen degrees, he must practice fifty times, never interrupting or reducing it once.

Bend down and backã€€Bend forward, lean back, (five times each).

Noteã€€Individual practice 50 timesã€€ã€€34. Bend left and right

Stand straight, the center of gravity is on both feet. Hands on the ribs. The left hand hangs down, and the body slowly bends to the left, and the left hand and right leg stretch as far as possible past the knee, but the right foot must not leave the ground.

Slowly raise the body and return to its original position. Put your left hand on your ribs, hang your right hand down, bend your body to the right, and stretch your right hand along your right leg as far as possible past your knee, but your left foot must not leave the ground. Body faces (waist muscle exercise) When driving forward, left and right, both feet must be firmly on the ground.

Bendã€€Left, Right, (five times each.)

Noteã€€Because the action of bending forward and back is a complete exercise of the waist muscles, a special practice of bending left and right only needs ten times left and right.

35. Rotate Left and Right

Stand upright. Hands on the ribs. The body's center of gravity is on both feet. Turn the body as far as possible to the left without moving the feet. The head must maintain its relative position, that is, facing forward, so as not to turn before the body.

Turn the body as far as possible to the left, then slowly return to its original position, and then turn as far as possible to the right, with both feet firmly on the ground, do not turn with the body. Bend back

### The Battle for Bases on the Pacific Front

Southwest Pacific

In any war, it is impossible to conduct operations without gaining control. This characteristic of warfare is particularly evident today. As seen in the battles in the Southwest Pacific, land and sea warfare seem to play little role. Instead, the fighting is primarily aerial, progressing from one small island to another as bases are advanced. It is difficult to seize even small, scattered islands in the vast ocean. Looking back at the enemy's counter-offensive operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea over the past two years, this becomes clear. Even with the expenditure of immense manpower and vast quantities of iron, the speed of recapture is as slow as a snail's pace.

New Guinea, the world's second-largest island, is mostly unexplored, with treacherous terrain, boundless forests, and wetlands, making land attacks impossible. In other words, the battleground is unique, with only thirty to forty scattered islands serving as bases for both sides.

Consumption and Replenishment

The main method of fighting for bases in the Southwest Pacific is an almost limitless war of attrition and replenishment. The absolute necessity of stable replenishment, and the strengthening of forces for a surprisingly powerful offensive, led the Japanese to temporarily shorten their lines. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Americans launched counter-offensives, relying on their inexhaustible production capacity to intensify the conflict.

The enemy's air force attacks use the Rotte tactic (single-column formation attack). If our planes engage the first aircraft, the second and third aircraft will follow closely without letting up. In aerial combat, one against three is more advantageous than two against six. If the Japanese can maintain this ratio against the Americans, they will surely achieve final victory.

On the other hand, no matter how superior the quality, without quantity, the chance of victory will vanish. The current approach in the entire Southwest Pacific is to rapidly replenish aircraft and pilots. Recently, the enemy has focused its main battlefield on the Central Pacific, pouring in large numbers of troops to strengthen its counter-offensive. At the same time, it is not relaxing its westward and northward advance from the Southwest Pacific. Currently, in Hollandia, New Guinea, a large enemy force has landed and is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Understanding this, one must not forget that the Southwest Pacific remains a major battlefield that will determine Japan's survival. (Translated from the May 31st edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)

Central Pacific

The enemy's attempt to lay hands on Japan's inner South Pacific sphere has been ongoing for some time. The previous invasion of the Marshall Islands was an initial manifestation of their ambition. This time, they boldly made a long-distance leap, launching a landing operation on Saipan Island, demonstrating an even greater ambition.

Earlier, on May 27th, the forces of MacArthur, commander of the enemy's Southwest Pacific Command, landed on Biak, and fierce fighting has continued for more than twenty days. The enemy's invasion of Biak Island is intended to use it as a springboard for invading the Philippines. At the same time, the enemy, ambitious to break through the Japanese defense line in the Central Pacific, has poured all its efforts into a bold landing on Saipan Island by Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet. MacArthur and Nimitz are working together to launch a two-front war in the Pacific, revealing their ambition.

Saipan Island Defense Battle

The mobile units responsible for the landing on Saipan Island moved out from the sea east of the Mariana Islands. Since June 11th, they have repeatedly bombed the strong Japanese bases in Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam. On the 13th, they dispatched fleets of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, approaching Saipan Island and bombarding the land with naval guns. Under the cover of this bombardment, enemy troops boarded powerful transport groups and attempted to land early on the 15th.

The Japanese garrison fought bravely, repelling the enemy twice at the water's edge. The enemy, coming for the third time, included a certain number of troops, and fierce fighting has continued on land for several days. The Japanese garrison launched a fierce counter-offensive. Meanwhile, powerful enemy mobile units remained in the vicinity of the island, fiercely bombarding Japanese positions day and night to facilitate the land battle, with shells raining down like a flood.

On the other hand, enemy detachments heavily bombed intermediate bases connecting the Mariana Islands with the mainland, such as Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, on the 15th and 16th, to facilitate the Saipan Island battle. To counter this, Japanese air units attacked the enemy fleet on the night of the 11th, first sinking one enemy ship, followed by further attacks. At the same time, the Tinian battery destroyed one enemy battleship early on the 15th, posing a significant threat to the rear of the enemy landing force.

Significance of the Battle

The Saipan Island battle has three significant meanings:

First, Saipan Island is the core of the Pacific defense line, connecting the mainland to islands such as Truk and Palau, forming the core of Japan's strong inner South Pacific fortress line, namely the Mariana Islands.

Second, the enemy covets Saipan Island, intending to use it as an airbase for repeated bombing of the Japanese mainland with long-range bombers. Saipan Island is only about 2,200 kilometers from Japan. The enemy's B-29 Superfortress bombers can easily reach Northern Kyushu. This is why the enemy is so eager to acquire Saipan Island.

Third, the enemy has deployed a large mobile unit from the Nimitz fleet in a desperate attack to secure a strategic position.

Regarding the enemy's deployed fleet, which was previously described as an "unprecedented large formation" during the Marshall Islands invasion, it is imaginable that the current deployment of a large naval force is at least no worse than the previous mobile unit. The enemy's direct entry with a large fleet between the Japanese mainland and the inner South Pacific is tantamount to directly approaching Japanese waters. The enemy's only tactic is to advance the base air control zone, and under this air control zone, conduct landing operations, with aircraft carriers securing absolute air superiority and carrying out daring air battles. However, those who rely solely on quantity are bound to fail, and the enemy's mobile unit will eventually suffer significant losses.

Current Status of Enemy Fleet

The fleet under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, has suffered considerable damage since launching its counter-offensive in the Central Pacific, making the question of the U.S. fleet's strength worthy of attention. Reports from Admiral King or the Secretary of the Navy, recently, boast of how much the U.S. naval power has increased in the three years since the start of the war, showing a great deal of self-satisfaction.

It is said that the United States currently has 65 aircraft carriers, 20 battleships, 50 to 60 cruisers, 300 destroyers, and 165 submarines. According to recent foreign reports, when the land battle in Western Europe unfolded, the U.S. battleships "Arkansas," "Texas," and "Nevada" cooperated with British battleships to bombard and cover the landings. "Texas" and "Arkansas" were old battleships in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet before the war, indicating that the U.S. Navy has concentrated its main force in the Pacific, especially deploying a large portion of new ships in the Pacific as the focus of its counter-offensive.

The construction status of U.S. battleships since the start of the war is as follows: Four sister ships of the 35,000-ton "North Carolina" and "Washington," namely the "South Dakota," "Massachusetts," "Indiana," and "Alabama," and six 45,000-ton giant battleships, "Iowa" and "New Jersey," are said to have been launched and incorporated into the fleet.

Regarding aircraft carriers, 13 "Essex" class and control aircraft carriers, with a planned displacement of 7,000 to 25,000 tons, are being built, of which six have been commissioned. Nine small aircraft carriers converted from 10,000-ton cruisers have been launched, and about 50 specially equipped escort aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships have been built.

Under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Spruance is the commander for operations in the Central Pacific, Hurlburt is the commander of the Southeast Pacific Fleet, and Fletcher is the naval commander in the North Pacific waters. Halsey's South Pacific Fleet, which was dissolved at the end of March, has had its operational area incorporated into MacArthur's operational area, dividing the fleet strength between Nimitz and MacArthur equally. Halsey has been transferred to Nimitz as the commander of the Third Fleet. After the personnel adjustments in the Pacific Fleet, a portion of the mobile units was used to conduct westward operations in New Guinea, and a powerful mobile unit was dispatched to break into the inner South Pacific sphere, attempting to gain an advantage by sheer numbers, but ultimately suffering a major setback.

### Chatting in German Trenches on the Caen Front

Caen, an important town on the Normandy front in northern France, is currently the scene of fierce fighting. German troops are resisting bravely, vowing to coexist with their positions. German war correspondent Schumacher has recently sent a dispatch from the front line entitled "Conversations in the Trenches near Caen," vividly depicting the vigorous morale of the German troops at the front. What follows is the dispatch:

We dug a deep hole along a country road and slipped into it. This country road does not connect to streets or village roads, but it leads to the city of Caen. Beside me are two Panzergrenadiers, buried in the hole, setting up a machine gun, cutting grass, and piling it around the hole, just up to their chests. Half an hour ago, the four of us were still together, when suddenly a barrage of shells came flying here. One of them exploded beside us. A comrade shouted, "Damn it!" Extending his left thigh, his pants were torn, and blood was flowing. He went to the bandage station by himself to bandage it. Before leaving, I shook hands with him and said:

"Don't be discouraged, wait for me, I'll be right back..." He said, full of spirit, and left on his own.

We all wear helmets, not only to protect against shell fragments, but also because in the early summer countryside, flying insects are everywhere, and helmets can block small insects. The shells at this moment must have been fired from enemy warships, because there are small hills behind us, making it difficult to observe from here. The shells even drill straight into the ground, and our trenches are shaking, with mud clods jumping as high as the roof ridge. The shells must be of a large caliber. But we are still holding on to the trenches. We are ordered "not to let the enemy pass an inch, and to monitor them closely."

The enemy dispatched a tank unit to attack, but the enemy's tanks are no match for ours. Our famous Tiger tanks, with their shining armor, revolve their long barrels, and unleash a deafening roar upon seeing their prey. An ammunition carrier, who had previously been transporting bullets, brought a new belt of ammunition. Our bullets had already run out. As long as the grass in front moved slightly strangely, we would pull the trigger, so no matter how many bullets there were, it was not enough. A comrade shouted to the ammunition carrier:

"Hey! William, why are you limping like that!"

The ammunition carrier stood up, revealing an embarrassed look and said:

"Those Tommy bastards are always targeting my truck, ugh!"

He said, expressing his disgust.

The truck drivers never make mistakes. Their trucks are often discovered by enemy aircraft, and they have to hide in roadside holes to avoid being strafed by machine guns from low altitudes. But they are well aware of how eagerly the ammunition and gasoline they transport are awaited by the soldiers on the front line. They continue to advance day and night, crossing country roads scarred by shell bursts or French towns reduced to ruins.

The ammunition carrier, called William, continued from what he said earlier:

"After being bombed, I was reduced to rags. I happened to have a furlough, and when I returned to my hometown, my house was hit by enemy bombs. My hand became crippled, so now there is no trace of it. But that's all over. It's good that those bastards are back here now. The only thing I can't bear is that my wife's letter is gone. To prevent the truck from catching fire, I didn't have time to read it after receiving it and hurried to transport the ammunition boxes here."

"Ah--ha, what's that, what's moving over there?"

A comrade suddenly shouted, and five or six bullets flew from the muzzle, like a string of beads, towards the grass, but the grass had no reaction. It was probably the wind playing tricks.

"That little girl is already dead..." A comrade suddenly interjected. The conversations in the trenches are not organized; they are just fragments.

"What are you saying, that little girl?"

"That lost French girl, so pitiful."

"What is she doing staying on the battlefield at this time?"

"About an hour or two ago, there was a beautiful girl, sixteen years old, wandering around nearby, exhausted. She timidly asked me, 'Where am I going?' The French civilians all fled from the forest over there to the forest over here. She got separated in the middle, so she was crying. I said to her, 'Little girl, the German army has already warned the residents to evacuate the war zone immediately. Why didn't you escape earlier?' She replied, 'The British and American soldiers said they were coming to liberate us, so we thought it was better to stay at home.' Are the British and American soldiers really liberators? They only slaughter the innocent, liberators who tear families apart, destroying the little girl's family and home. The little girl probably didn't know yet. While she was still talking, an enemy fighter suddenly appeared at low altitude, bathed in machine gun fire. The little girl fell down and could no longer move..." (Translated from the June 19th edition of the Asahi Shimbun Berlin Dispatch)

### Anecdotes from the Northern France Battlefield

Here are a few anecdotes I have gleaned from Berlin about the fierce battles in northern France, presented below:

One

...Reactionary war correspondents and German reporting teams are describing the fighting in Normandy as "hellish." From this, one can imagine how fierce the battle is. The scene of the Allied fleet and a large number of landing craft breaking through the densely laid minefields was already quite a sight. As for the Allied paratroopers, Marshal Rommel once said: "Under the surface of this flower garden, there are 80,000 landmines buried. Where are they? I'm afraid even the gods wouldn't know." Landing in this flower garden is no different from falling into the purgatory of hell. In reality, most of the Allied paratroopers went straight to paradise after jumping out of the plane.

Two

...In this landing operation, there have been no reports of the Allies using new weapons. Although they landed a large number of amphibious tanks near Harfleur, these are not new weapons. As for new tactics, they are nothing more than dropping life-size mannequins by parachute. The German side had already anticipated and prepared for such tactics. These fake paratroopers either explode upon landing or detonate when German soldiers approach. In short, they are both "disguise" weapons to confuse the German army and offensive weapons.

But according to a captured British pilotâ€”who had flown a plane full of fake paratroopersâ€”he recalled: "I flew with the fake paratroopers to the target area. When dropping the fake paratroopers, I had to first pull the fuse of the detonation device. While I was working, one of the fake paratroopers suddenly exploded, and the rest of them all caught fire. My plane also spewed out flames, and I had no choice but to quickly jump out with a parachute. I'm afraid there's nothing more terrifying than this."

Three

...From the first day of the landing, many balloons rose into the sky over the English Channel, floating high in the clouds. These were released by the Allies to observe whether the shells hit the target and other situations. Around them, British and American fighters were constantly circling and soaring, guarding against attacks by German fighters. The Allies used all kinds of war tools to launch a desperate offensive. What is gratifying is that in this modern war, the German army has volunteer Cossack cavalry units. Riding on tall steeds, they gallop across the plains of Normandy, annihilating Allied paratroopers who have already landed, wielding their famous Cossack sabers, and displaying their ancient spirit of bravery.

Four

...During the landing operation, the German side was most worried that the military communication system would become ineffective under the heavy Allied bombing. In reality, although the Allied large bombs hit the fortresses along the Atlantic coast, the interior was not damaged at all. The entire communication system worked as usual, without any malfunctions. This shows that Germany's fortress construction technology is very excellent.

### Small Kindness

â€” Qinglu

The children's ward is filled with unfortunate children.

Rickets, pneumonia, bronchitis, empyema, typhoid fever, abscesses... Some have had their legs crushed by vehicles on the road, while others have been scalded by spilled kettles of boiling water in the alleysâ€¦ The weak and mournful children are constantly being sent from every corner of the city to this ward.

However, their time in the ward is generally not very long. Except for those who arrive too late or are destined to die due to accidents, most of them leave the hospital, giggling and laughing, in just two or three months. Only Xiaohui on bed number four has been there for over a year.

Xiaohui was admitted last spring after his leg bone was broken by a cargo truck. He was truly in danger due to excessive blood loss. Fortunately, Dr. Liu's surgery was excellent, and he saved him from the brink of death. More than a month ago, his splint was removed, and he could walk freely like a normal child. This child is truly lucky.

When he first came to the hospital, he was accompanied by a father who looked like a worker, who prepaid two hundred yuan for medical expenses. After that, he never came to see his child. After three months, in order to collect the outstanding fees, the hospital repeatedly wrote letters and sent people to find his family. However, the address left by the family may not have been correct, so it was impossible to find them. When asked, Xiaohui only knew "Fourth Road" and that his father was called "Arong." He couldn't say anything else. He's just a six-year-old child!

Everyone guessed that no one would come to pick up the child, so he was allowed to stay.

The child is well-mannered and quite smart, but his past life on the streets has given him many bad habits. However, because of his misfortune, the nurses in each ward love him very much. They often talk to him, use scrap paper to teach him Chinese characters, and in two months, he has learned more than three hundred characters. He has also made significant progress in general knowledge.

Based on the child's incomplete conversations, it is known that Xiaohui must have come from a poor, often starving family of laborers. His father is a manual laborer without a fixed job who is also addicted to alcohol. The whole family lives in a whirlpool of misfortune.

Once I asked Xiaohui:

"What kind of business does your father do?"

"Dad goes out to do odd jobs for two days, and doesn't go out for two days."

"Does he like you?"

"He doesn't like me," the child said with a melancholy look in his eyes. "He drinks all day long and hits people, and wants to send me out to be a little beggar. Only on days when he doesn't drink does he take me to the road to play."

"What about Mom? She must like you."

"Mom is troubled. Dad asks her for money every day, and if she doesn't give it, he hits her. Mom didn't go to spin yarn when my little sister was born, and there was no money for Dad to drink, so he hit her again, and Mom cried."

Tears of sympathy filled the child's eyes, so I couldn't bear to ask any further.

After Xiaohui could walk freely, he no longer wanted to lie quietly in bed during the day. Even for a nap, he had to be coaxed and tricked into going to bed. Sometimes, if his little companions gave him a piece of biscuit or a candy, he would save it to coax other crying sick children. Sometimes he would hold a stack of Chinese characters on a small chair and read them earnestly, or he would teach other children. When the recovered children were discharged from the hospital, he would follow us to see them off, innocently saying polite things like "Goodbye! Come play again!" Some mothers who knew his background, seeing the child was clever, would often leave food and toys for him.

This was a good encouragement for Xiaohui, making him more willing to learn and be good.

Soon, a twelve-year-old boy with a broken left arm came to bed number eleven. He was probably the naughtiest of the sick children admitted in the past six months. He not only made a fuss, but also often quarreled with the children nearby, saying vulgar and obscene things. His mother was a woman who doted on her son. She brought dishes and snacks to her child every day, and sometimes even brought toys, which made the child seem very proud in the ward.

Which child doesn't have curiosity? The children's attention was focused on number eleven (we habitually called sick children by their assigned number). Xiaohui could not help but cast envious glances, or even walk over to touch his toy train and exchange a few words with him.

But number eleven became increasingly unruly. Sometimes he would generously give things to others, but then he would soon clamor to get them back. Sometimes, because he couldn't get back the candy or biscuits that other children had already eaten, he would make a big fuss and cry. One day, he even violently raised a pillow and threw a teacup at people, which caused us a lot of trouble.

So we secretly forbade other children to approach him. But with more than twenty children in a large room, it was sometimes really impossible to stop them. Moreover, curiosity is a child's nature, and they could not resist the lure of new toys, so they still went over, which only increased the arrogance of number eleven.

Sure enough, something worse happened.

That afternoon, number eleven's mother brought several more toys. Xiaohui watched from afar for a while, and finally went over to see what was happening. Who knew that number eleven would point at Xiaohui and say to his mother:

"Number four is a little refugee without parents or guardians. When he leaves the hospital, he can only be a little bum."

Xiaohui was so angry that his face turned green, and he raised his hand to hit him.

But he didn't hit him. His own hand was grabbed and bitten hard.

By the time we heard the crying and rushed over to pull them apart, Xiaohui's hand was already bleeding.

Afterwards, that woman even went to the director's office to complain, which caused us to be scolded.

From that day on, Xiaohui became dull. The lively smile disappeared from his round little face, and he always seemed to be thinking about something silently. No matter how we teased or coaxed him, we couldn't remove his indifference. His young soul had been deeply hurt. Even after the wound on his hand had healed, he could not regain his lovely innocence.

He was disgusted with this environment:

"Auntie (the children's general term for us), is my mom coming to take me back soon?"

In helpless embarrassment, I couldn't help but lie to him:

"Your mom is coming to pick you up in a couple of days. She's even buying you a foreign doll!"

I lovingly stroked the child's hair, sadly looking at his watery eyes.

The child was certainly not satisfied. Only other people's mothers came every day. In order to stubbornly think about his own mother, he became unwilling to recognize characters or eat. Giving him something only made him cry. He no longer taught the characters he had learned to others, and when mothers came to take recovered children out of the hospital, he no longer saw them off warmly, but only hid in the corner and stared blankly.

In the past half month, the child has become very haggard. Xiaohui's melancholy worries us. I thought, if I could find his family, let me send him back to his mother!

On Saturday afternoon, during my break, I secretly took Xiaohui to look for his home (this was against hospital rules). But after walking from Yuqiaqing Road all over "Fourth Road" to the Bund, the child couldn't point out where his home was, and we didn't run into his father "Arong."

On the way back, I bought the child a pair of gloves and two oranges. Xiaohui seemed a little happier, but as soon as we got back, he stuffed them under his pillow, because, unfortunately, another child was being discharged from the hospital.

He hid in the corner again, staring blankly at other people's mothers.

The next day, the child suddenly fell ill, with a high fever, and he was delirious:

"Mom! Please come and take me back!"

"Dad, don't hit me, I won't do it again next time!"

The child's soul was disturbed by a major blow. I stood by the bed, watching with pity the motherless Xiaohui who was suffering in his dreams, and involuntarily kissed his forehead, which was burning with a high fever.

In this tragic world, Xiaohui brought me a heavy sense of the melancholy of the times.

### Go Learn to Hate

â€” Jiangshui

I once saw with my own eyes

That rough giant palm

On your

Small face

Imprinted

Dark red marks;

I once heard with my own ears

The clapping

Wooden â€”

Impact of flesh against flesh!

I also saw

You, poor child!

Silently

Got up from the ground

Silently walked away.

Crying must have filled

Your small heart,

And people might say

This is retribution.

Who told you

To secretly touch things in someone else's basket?

Dad?

Mom?

Or someone else?

Eight years old, right? Child

Looking at you

You don't seem any older.

The tram is gone

Hitting you, who knows where you've gone

What are you still standing here for?

No one here will

Cast a sympathetic glance at you again.

Don't wipe away your tears

Don't curse

Go back! Child

â€” Go learn to be hated!

Hate those who hit you.

Go tell Dad

Go tell Mom

And tell others.

Let Dad curse violently

Let Mom secretly wipe away her tears

Child!

Go learn to hate!

Hate those who hit you

### Friendship

â€” Keshi

If you want to gain friends, then you must be generous. A generous giver can often win people's hearts. (Marton)

The best way to gain a friend is to be a friend to people yourself. (Emerson)

Those who talk about using others everywhere cannot be friends, and those who do not connect utility with friendship cannot be friends. (Epicurus)

All the intimate consideration in friendship is far better than any large and expensive gift. (Goethe)

May your friendship be like a mouth and a hand. When the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow on it; when the mouth hurts, use the hand to stroke it. (Madagascar Proverb)

True friendship is like health. You only realize its value when you lose it. (Colton)

The friendship of gentlemen is as light as water, while the friendship of petty people is as sweet as honey. (Ancient Proverb)

Do not rely on gifts to gain a friend. You must offer your sincere love and learn how to win a person's heart in the right way. (Socrates)

### Troubles and Desires

â€” Zhang Shizhou

For tens of thousands of years, the myriad of intelligent human beings have used their unique, world-surpassing intellect to gradually create a brilliant and dazzling new world for themselvesâ€”a modern society filled with extreme civilization and splendor.

But what great power drives them to complete this great task? It is the endless desires that never cease to grow from the sea of human desires! Countless people will answer wholeheartedly that this is the only reason. Because without desire, humanity would not progress! However, the most uncomfortable "troubles" ever felt by all of humanity (including wars and all man-made disasters, as well as all the unhappiness and misfortunes in the human world caused by human beings) arise from here! In other words, although they enjoy the blessings of civilization through their own efforts, they also suffer the pain of being entangled by an equal degree of troubles at the same time.

In order to satisfy their different desires, countless unavoidable conflicts of interest arise. These conflicts gradually escalate to white-hot heat, and finally they argue with each other, scold each other, and fight. As a result, both sides feel acute unhappiness because their beautiful ideals are unexpectedly hindered, and troubles arise in that instant. The above is the origin of troubles.

Based on the above theory, modern clear-headed philosophers have opened up a new "law."

The rise and fall of troubles and desires are directly proportional â€” the new "law" of temporary scholars.

If we annotate this new law with simple mathematical theory, we can get the following conclusion.

If desire can be made equal to zero, then trouble must also be equal to zero. The lower the desire, the more the trouble will definitely be reduced to the same degree. Conversely, the higher the desire of human beings, the troubles that occur afterwards will definitely not be exempted from increasing.

We people of the twentieth century live in this civilized world, and we enjoy enough of all kinds of blessings. However, the hateful troubles still come to his cruelty at any time and place, always hurting our innocent hearts, which is really unfortunate. In order to reduce unnecessary mental pain, we should definitely restrain our own unnecessary desires, so that we can offset the troubles that are about to occur to the highest level. When improper and excessive desires arise in our self-aware hearts, we can act decisively like this, because this often makes us become happy and self-controlled people!

Friends! Do you envy other people's suits and leather shoes? Do you envy other people's foreign buildings and mansions? Do you also envy other people's luxurious lives? In fact, they don't have anything overly noteworthy about them. Because of this, they are suffering from troubles that are no lighter than yours!

"Contentment brings happiness" should become a belief in our century-old lives!

### Air Defense Headquarters Clarifies Determination to Strengthen Air Defense Violations of Air Defense Regulations Will Be Punished by Military Law

Since the implementation of air defense training in Shanghai, the city's air defense situation has gradually improved, but it is still far from ideal. For example, during the training implemented on the 3rd of this month, there were still a considerable number of violators. At present, the war on the mainland is becoming more intense. In particular, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, since the recent Japanese army carried out a magnificent offensive operation, the forward bases have been destroyed one after another, so they have to avoid direct conflicts with the Japanese Air Force and are intent on engaging in air guerrilla tactics in order to disrupt the hearts of the people in peaceful areas. In view of this, the Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters has decided to greatly enhance the air defense posture of the city of Shanghai.

Authorities' Remarks

Investigations have revealed that various air defense rules, especially light control, have been repeatedly announced and warned to call attention, but there are still a large number of people who are ignorant and unconcerned, especially during air raid warnings, there are still light leaks, and even direct rays of light are emitted outdoors, which is truly regrettable. This kind of behavior is actually hindering military operations, so from now on, in addition to continuing to impose power outages on those who violate the rules, they will also be severely punished in accordance with military law. All residents of the city, in addition to strictly complying with the regulations themselves, should also encourage each other and supervise each other in the neighborhood. All guidance agencies and self-defense corps members should also actively call attention, so that no one will be subjected to military law. This is greatly hoped for. A notice was issued on the 6th, and a statement was released clarifying the authorities' determination to strengthen air defense. From now on, anyone who violates air defense regulations will be severely punished in accordance with military law, especially those who violate light control, in addition to being subjected to power outages, will also be punished in the same way.

Important Notice

Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters Notice: For the purpose of announcement, it is now decided that anyone who violates various air defense rules in the future, especially those who leak lights during air raid warnings, will be punished for obstructing the military operations of the Great Japanese Army. In addition to stopping the power supply according to the notice of September 20, Showa 18, they will also be severely punished in accordance with military law. This notice is hereby issued for general information.

### Yesterday's Industrial and Commercial Association Held a Symposium on the Current Situation: Minister Matsushima Elucidates the Pacific War Situation

In order to allow the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to have a deeper understanding of the current situation, the Industrial and Commercial Association of this city held a tea party at the Huaæ‡‹ Hotel at 5:30 pm yesterday (the 6th), inviting leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to hold a symposium on the current situation and immediately asking Minister Matsushima, the reporting officer of the fleet, to explain the current situation of the Pacific War. In addition, this newspaper distributed a copy of the "New Situation Map of Greater East Asia" and a copy of "The Battle of the Mariana Islands" to the attendees. The details are recorded as follows:

Tea Party Situation

Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department arrived at the meeting on time with Captain Shiota. Leaders from the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors included Tatsujiro Funatsu, Toraji Kurimoto, Hikoji Ichihashi, and Kenjo Kawaguchi from the Japanese side, and Wenlanting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Jiang Shangda, Xu Liqiu, Chen Shaoyan, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Pei Yunqing, Shen Siliang, Gu Nanqun, Wang Boyuan, Chen Riping, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Binhui, and Ren Yunpeng from the Chinese side. Miss Ri Koran (Li Xianglan), a star from Manchukuo Film Association, also attended. There were more than 200 people in total. After a speech by Chairman Wen Lanting, Minister Matsushima was invited to elaborate on the current situation of the Pacific War. Subsequently, various representatives raised several questions, which were answered by the Minister one by one. Then, current affairs films were shown: "The United Fleet in All Its Glory," "The Situation in Henan," and "The Battle of Rabaul on the Front Lines." Finally, Miss Ri Koran, a star from Manchukuo Film Association, sang two famous Chinese and Japanese songs. The event ended happily at 7:30 pm.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Wen Lanting said: "Although we in the industrial and commercial sectors often interact with each other in our businesses, we rarely have the opportunity to meet as a group. At the same time, although we are all busy handling our respective businesses all day long, we are also very concerned about the current tense situation. Today, we have specially invited Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department to report on the recent situation of the naval battle in the Mariana Islands, which I believe is most welcome to everyone."

Matsushima's Speech

"I am extremely grateful for everyone taking the time out of their busy schedules to attend today, despite the summer heat. The trends of the world war situation in both Europe and the Pacific are becoming increasingly clear. In the future war situation, the people of China and Japan must unite more closely to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve final victory.

It is most necessary for the people of China and Japan to be familiar with the actual situation of the war and to understand where they should cooperate. The meaning of today's meeting lies in this.

I would like to express my gratitude to the Industrial and Commercial Association for their efforts in assisting with today's gathering.

Today is a symposium, and I hope that everyone present will freely exchange ideas in order to increase their understanding of the current situation.

First, there is a lot of counter-propaganda circulating regarding the war. The prevalence of this counter-propaganda is a characteristic of Shanghai, and it is also somewhat humorous. However, it has a very negative impact on the economy and on people's thinking, and may confuse the general public. Much of it is propaganda from the enemy, the United States, and at this critical moment, special attention should be paid to exposing this counter-propaganda.

Second, it seems that many people have been influenced by enemy propaganda. Enemy propaganda is very inaccurate, as can be seen from the damages they claim to have inflicted. But some people only listen to the enemy's propaganda and believe it to be true. In the future, if we have the opportunity, we hope to hold symposiums often so that everyone can understand the truth about the war.

Third, the current Pacific operations are closely related to the operations on the Chinese mainland, and both aim to destroy Britain and the United States. Especially regarding the operations on the mainland, as stated in the recent statement by the Japanese government, there is no war behavior whatsoever against the Chinese people. We understand very well that it is foolish for the East Asian peoples to continue to fight each other for so long. I believe the Chongqing authorities also know this. What we should pay attention to is that Britain and the United States are taking advantage of this opportunity to reap the benefits.

Fourth, the current war in the Pacific is increasingly becoming a general counter-offensive posture by the enemy, and the fighting is extremely fierce. In order to achieve final victory, we are using various means to destroy the enemy's war power. The results achieved in Saipan are extremely significant. More than half of the aircraft carriers have been sunk or destroyed. The brave fighting of the frontline soldiers has greatly troubled the enemy, and the objective has been fully achieved in terms of naval strategy. U.S. Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal told newly appointed reporters on the 5th that the losses in Saipan were unexpected, which is clear proof of this. The enemy's operational goal is to gain a foothold on the Chinese mainland and make a final decisive battle. In order to fulfill our mission of protecting East Asia, we will not hesitate to fight to the end. Please identify the enemy's counter-propaganda and do your best to assist in solidifying the belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War."

Answering Questions

Subsequently, Minister Matsushima answered the questions raised by the attendees one by one as follows:

Question: If Saipan cannot be defended, what will be the prospects for the war?

Answer: The Japanese military's strategy on Saipan is to lure the enemy deep and annihilate them. Even if Saipan falls, it will not have a significant impact on the mainland war. Furthermore, Saipan is a very small island and does not have a naval base. As long as the Japanese military prevents the enemy's air base on Saipan from being used and does its best to destroy it, the objective will have been achieved. Moreover, the Japanese military has bases in New Guinea, the Philippines, and other places, so there is nothing to worry about.

Question: After gaining a foothold, will the enemy be able to continue to advance?

Answer: The enemy intends to use Saipan as a base for its air raids against Japan, but the Japanese military has done its best to destroy it to prevent it from succeeding. Saipan is only 24 li long and 12 li wide. Even if the enemy uses it completely, its scope will be very narrow and not as important as the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the naval fleet is operating with extreme caution to prevent the enemy's British fleet from a second front, and therefore is being particularly vigilant. The enemy has widely publicized that the Japanese navy has been defeated. Whether this is reliable will soon be proven by the facts.

Question: What is the importance of the Mariana Islands in the Greater East Asia War?

Answer: There are many small islands in that sea area, and the Japanese military had long anticipated that the enemy would launch a full-scale attack. We made thorough preparations and, upon the enemy's arrival, launched a devastating blow. Currently, there are not many enemy forces in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands, only a few aircraft carriers and cruisers protecting the aircraft carriers, and no regular fleet.

Not long ago, the enemy attacked Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands with a part of their mobile force. However, the headquarters announced at 17:30 today: The enemy mobile force that launched this attack has been repelled by the Japanese military and fled on the afternoon of the 4th. In this battle, more than 74 enemy aircraft and 5 ships were shot down, and we lost 30 aircraft.

Regarding the Japanese navy's tactics, its strategy is to lure the enemy to the vicinity of the mainland and destroy them. This is the most ingenious tactic. Whether the enemy attacks the Ogasawara Islands or Iwo Jima, there is nothing to fear.

Now, let's talk about the fundamental principles of naval warfare. Regardless of the method of operation, there are only two principles: what Sun Tzu's Art of War calls "preemptive strike" and "concentration." Preemptive strike means striking first, and concentration means concentrating all forces. Before the start of the war, the Japanese military occupied almost all the islands in the entire sea area, with the aim of expelling the enemy from the Greater East Asia region, securing resources in the south, and establishing contact with the Chinese mainland to enhance Japan's war power. What is the current objective? It is to wait for the enemy to come and destroy them. Strategically speaking, this is the only option.

The Japanese military's forward bases in the South Pacific knew that the enemy would definitely launch a counterattack, so they prepared early, waited for the opportunity to defeat the enemy, and then lured the enemy deeper to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Japanese military is not only not worried about the enemy approaching the Japanese mainland, but welcomes it. For example, the sinking of two aircraft carriers (over 27,000 tons) and two cruisers near Iwo Jima last time was the result of using this ingenious tactic.

What Japan is most concerned about now is the enemy's attempt to use the Chinese mainland. Japan will not allow the enemy to land on Chinese soil under any circumstances.

Question: What is the situation in the Ogasawara Islands?

Answer: The Ogasawara Islands are the Japanese military's air base and defense base. If the enemy attacks, they will be severely attacked by the Japanese military. Because the flight time from the islands to Japan is only one hour, there is nothing to fear even if the enemy attacks.

Answer: In the future, the enemy will definitely do everything possible to seize Saipan. If Saipan falls, they will then attempt to invade the Japanese mainland, the Chinese mainland, or the Philippines. However, the enemy's supply lines will be extended accordingly, which is extremely beneficial to the Japanese side.

### Indian Residents in Shanghai Hold a Celebration Meeting: Anniversary of the Establishment of the Independence League

This month, the 4th to the 10th is "Leader's Week," the anniversary of the establishment of the Indian Independence League. Yesterday (the 6th) was the third day of the week. More than 2,000 Indian residents in Shanghai gathered at the Indian National Army training camp on Doushan Road at 1:30 pm. At 2:00 pm, they set off on a parade, passing through Beisichuan Road from Doushan Road, crossing the Baidu Bridge, and converging at the end of the bridge. The First Police Bureau band led the way, to the Bund, turned into Nanjing Road, and entered the racecourse from Jing'an Temple Road. The mood was enthusiastic. The celebration meeting began at 4:00 pm, with formal ceremonies. A minute of silence was observed to commemorate comrades who sacrificed for Indian independence. Then, speeches began. First, the chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, Mr. Chot, delivered a speech, saying that in the past year, the Indian residents in Shanghai have done their best, but now is a time of life and death. He said that they would rather die than be unfree, and hoped that all residents would do their best. Next, Captain Bonglund, the commander of the Indian National Army training camp in this city, delivered a speech with much encouragement, reiterating that the Indian National Army was fighting to liberate India's independence and freedom from the hands of British and American aggressors, and would rather die in battle. In order to obtain freedom, it is necessary to destroy British and American imperialism. Then, Lieutenant Shu Xin of the Indian National Army said that no matter what difficulties or obstacles, the Indian army would fight hard to defeat the evil forces of Britain and the United States, and march straight to Delhi to achieve final victory. Finally, Mr. Gao Li, the propaganda minister of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech with many pertinent and important points, strongly stating that in the past year, under the leadership of leader Jiang Tela Bose, we have made more progress than we expected. We will repay the false propaganda of Britain and the United States with facts. The Indian army has crossed the Indo-Burmese border to attack the enemy. Today, we have stepped into Indian territory. The bravery and strength of the Indian National Army have made Britain and the United States fear and rush to release Gandhi. If we launch a further attack on the remaining enemies, there will be even greater losses. Defeating Britain and the United States is the only way to achieve Indian independence and freedom. Our tricolor flag has been flying high in our homeland, marching straight towards Delhi. Finally, accountant Ha Nanxin gave a speech, urging Indian residents to donate generously to the Indian National Army. In an instant, enthusiastic Indian residents donated enthusiastically, exceeding 300,000 yuan, which, combined with the previous monthly donation of more than 50,000 yuan, has exceeded 4 million yuan. Other Indian representatives also gave speeches one after another. Until 6:00 pm, everyone stood up and shouted "Revolution Wan Ji," "Long Live Free India," and "Long Live the Leader."
