### Victory Life

— Chen Bin

Yesterday, upon the invitation of the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, I delivered a speech titled "Victory Life," briefly expressing my views. Here is the text of the speech, for the reader's perusal.

Recently, a guest from Tokyo spoke of the increasingly austere wartime life within Japan, an ally, which is highly worthy of our emulation. For example:

First-class train carriages have been abolished, and dining cars and sleeping cars have been eliminated. Even high-ranking officials, such as ministers and generals, travel in second- or third-class carriages like ordinary people. For long-distance travel requiring overnight stays, food rations are reduced, and people eat as little as possible, ensuring that not a single grain of rice is wasted, and there are no messy leftovers. Alcoholic beverages are rationed. Although drinking was a widespread habit among the Japanese, consumption has now decreased.

In the evenings, aside from factory workers on the move, few citizens are seen wandering about aimlessly. By ten o'clock, most citizens have turned off their lights and gone to bed, rising at dawn to engage in work, thoroughly practicing the excellent habit of early to bed and early to rise.

Not only within Japan is an austere wartime life rigorously enforced, but also in the Hongkou district of Shanghai, high-end Japanese bars have been closed. The Japanese government, starting from March 1st of this year, implemented the "Essential Guidelines for Decisive Battle Emergency Measures," which included provisions for "stopping high-end entertainment." The contents included the complete closure of high-end restaurants, the complete closure of brothels and geisha houses, and the complete closure of coffee shops and bars. At the same time, assistance measures were taken for those who were shut down, such as reducing or exempting taxes, or, depending on their skills, employing them in areas necessary for the current situation, or providing living assistance funds when necessary. These facts fully illustrate that Japan recognizes the necessary reforms in wartime life, and once the reform methods are decided, they are immediately and earnestly implemented, thoroughly carried out, never procrastinating, and never going through the motions. This kind of life can be called "Victory Life."

On the other hand, what is the phenomenon of our urban life? Focusing solely on "high-end entertainment," dance halls are filled with dancing to the rhythm of war songs; restaurants are packed with esteemed guests; hotels are brightly lit throughout the night. Mahjong games and gambling are commonplace. It seems that the joy of life lies only in this, and the purpose of life is only achieved in this. In reality, this is the epitome of a life of dissipation and decadence.

Speaking of thrift, it is a virtue that should be observed even in peacetime, let alone during wartime, when it is a divinely ordained duty. The opposite of thrift is waste. The lifestyle phenomena mentioned above are the extremes of waste, the enemies of thrift. To promote thrift, we must first eliminate waste. Currently, the lives of the majority of salaried people in the city are already frugal to the point of being unsustainable, and they are certainly not the target of our call for thrift. The target of our call for thrift is those who lead the wasteful lives described above. Most of these people are pursuing profiteering, and because they have succeeded in their opportunistic pursuit of profit, they feel that it comes easily, and therefore spend it easily, indulging in waste, seeking only to satisfy their pleasures. Therefore, all phenomena of wasteful living are caused by profiteers. To promote thrift and realize wartime life, we must first eliminate profiteering. We suggest several things to the authorities:

For banquets in restaurants where each table exceeds four or five thousand yuan, the excess should be subject to heavier taxes to limit them.

Do not think that having money allows you to enjoy freely and waste freely. Not at all. Only by completing the task of thrift can we achieve a victory life; and completing a victory life begins with ending a wasteful life.

### Japanese Army Cleverly Operates in Burma, Enemy Counterattacks Heavily Damaged; Annihilation Battle on the West Bank of the Nu River Still in Progress

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The second counteroffensive operation by the enemy's 26th Division and the West African 81st Division in the Buthidaung area was met with a clever operation by the Japanese army. Attacking from four directions, the Japanese army has, in just two days, driven the enemy's 10th Brigade of the 26th Division to the area east of Letwedaung. The enemy's 9th Brigade of the West African 81st Division is currently disintegrating near Taung Bazar. On the 18th, the Japanese army cut off the enemy's main force's retreat at three points and is expanding its gains. The Japanese army has also occupied the high ground north of the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road junction, cooperating with the Japanese forces occupying Hill 143 to crush the enemy's attempt to open the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road. At 9 PM on the 16th, the Japanese army completely occupied the Mayu mountain range and the enemy's important stronghold, Hill 1301, and is further planning to occupy the northern high ground, forming an encirclement around the enemy's main force. Furthermore, the enemy's 9th Brigade of the West African 81st Division, which is stirring on the left bank of the Mayu River, has now had its air supply cut off and is facing preemptive attacks by the Japanese army.

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces on the Kohima-Ukhrul road, in response to the counteroffensive launched north of Kohima, have been stubbornly counterattacking for a month from the road and the Imphal River, Chindwin River, and Manipur River. The elite units of the Japanese army north of Imphal are holding the high ground at 512, 5417, 4955, Kanglatongbi, Koupruim, and Donzai, destroying the enemy's attempt to escape and allowing reinforcements to participate in the second attack. Now that all preparations are complete, the Japanese army, using its elite troops, took the opportunity to seize Hills 5704 and 619 and commenced a fierce assault along the Ukhrul road on the 20th.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news received here, the Southeast Asia Command believes that the British and Indian troops on the Manipur front are under severe threat from the Japanese army and has urgently dispatched aircraft to transfer the British and Indian 5th Infantry Division from the Arakan front to reinforce Manipur.

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in Palel, waiting for the 31st Brigade to come to their aid from Tengnoupal, are continuing their desperate resistance, but they are being subjected to intense shelling by the Japanese army, and their combat strength is declining daily.

Outnumbered on the West Bank of the Nu River

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since late April, the morale of the Chinese troops advancing on the west bank of the Nu River has been extremely low, and they are also very anxious because the rainy season is approaching. They have therefore launched frequent and stubborn counterattacks, with a force of about six or seven divisions, which is quite powerful in terms of numbers. In response, the Japanese army, in addition to inflicting annihilation blows east of the Gaoligong Mountain road, has also cut off the retreat route of the Yunnan Army in the Dulong River area, using the tactic of luring the enemy in deep to defeat them individually. Furthermore, in the Lengshui area, they annihilated two large units of the Chinese army. Other Japanese army units have also defeated the Chinese troops attacking the Pingmanqian front, 100 kilometers southeast of Yingjiang.

Subhas Chandra Bose Determined to Fight to the End for the Liberation of the Motherland

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - As the general offensive on Imphal is about to enter its final stage, Subhas Chandra Bose, the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, has also personally gone to the front to supervise the battle. This battle is undoubtedly the final reckoning for Bose's twenty years of fighting for liberation. Shouldering the great mission of liberating 400 million citizens, this reporter had the honor of meeting with Bose at a front-line encampment. He shares the hardships of the soldiers, sleeping only three hours a day. His face shows a determined expression, filled with confidence in victory. Besides discussing offensive operation plans with his generals and officers, he often encourages the morale of the National Army and comforts the wounded and sick soldiers. Here are the questions asked by the reporter to Bose: "Chairman, since leaving Calcutta on January 26, 1941, you are now personally leading the National Army on the road home. What are your feelings?" He replied, "I do not fear any obstruction from Britain. Four years ago, when I left India, the British authorities offered a reward of one million rupees, but they ultimately failed to capture me. Today, the British have built strong fortresses along the Indian border to prevent the Japanese army from advancing and me from returning home, but fate has been decided. The imperialist forces of Britain are powerless to stop our righteous army from advancing." Question: "Gandhi has now been released. It is said that when you and Gandhi parted ways in 1939, he invited you to a separate room and said that if you (referring to Bose) succeeded in your armed struggle, he would be the first to send a telegram of congratulations. Is this true?" He replied, "Gandhi's release is a performance. If he hears the news of my return home, he will celebrate with us. Therefore, the timing of his congratulatory telegram will be after I return to Calcutta, when the people of India truly recognize the Provisional Government. I hold a lofty and consistent belief, persevering in my fight for freedom for many years, only knowing to fight for India's independence until the goal is achieved."

### North China Political Affairs Commission Holds Third Advisory Conference to Discuss Various Policies Under the Decisive Battle

### Mr. Ogura Visits Various Agencies in Beiping

Beiping, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, arrived in Beiping on the 19th to inspect the situation in North China and hold discussions with the economic sector. On the 20th, he visited the Beiping Office of the Japanese Embassy, meeting with Minister Sawada. He then visited the North China Japanese Army Headquarters, the Naval Attaché Office, and the Military Police Headquarters.

### Zhenjiang Allied Military Police to Regularly Return Enemy Property

Zhenjiang, 21st (Central News Agency) - To assist the National Government in achieving autonomy and independence, Allied Japan is gradually transferring the enemy property of the Chongqing faction, which was previously under military administration. All enemy property in Zhenjiang City, Section C, which was previously scheduled to be returned in northern Jiangsu on March 15th, has now been announced by the Zhenjiang Allied Military Police that those with claims to enemy property should quickly go to the team within one week to exchange their permits for vouchers in order to receive the property. If they are overdue, the property will be forfeited.

### Chongqing-Communist Line Conference Seems to Have Reached a Compromise

Shanghai (Central News Agency) - The Xi'an talks on the Chongqing-Communist Party's reorganization negotiations, which began on the 5th of this month, seem to have reached a compromise by the 16th. Communist Party representative Lin Zuhan arrived in Chongqing on the 17th, and Chongqing representative Wang Shijie returned to Chongqing on the 18th. According to Chongqing news received here, Zhang Zhizhong, the political director of the Military Affairs Commission, a right-wing figure within Chongqing, also participated in the Xi'an talks, which is noteworthy. The content of the Chongqing-Communist Party conference is unknown, as both the Nationalists and the Communists are prohibited from making announcements, but local sources speculate that the topics discussed were: Reorganizing the Chongqing government to allow Communist Party members to participate in the Chongqing government; Agreements on Communist Party military and base areas; Aid to Communist Party military forces; Recognition of the special status of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; and the cessation of attacks on the Chongqing army by the Communist Party. In short, this conference is not the final compromise between Chongqing and the Communist Party, but only a temporary reconciliation. It is believed that considerable time is still needed to reach a final decision. Furthermore, the objective conditions for holding this conference were: Unifying the national war front; Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have criticized Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship as an anti-democratic act and have expressed goodwill towards the Communist Party's democracy. Moreover, the situation within the country is such that, due to the loss of Henan in the recent operation, Chongqing is in a precarious situation both internally and externally. Therefore, if the Communist Party's Xi'an talks can achieve a compromise, it will bring temporary relief to Chongqing's predicament.

Chen Xiaoqiang Answers Reporter's Questions

Nanjing (Central News Agency) - This reporter visited General Chen Xiaoqiang, commander of the Third Guard Division, yesterday and asked about everything regarding the Japanese army's operations in Luoyang. He replied that the northwest region has always been an area where the Communist Party and Chongqing are in contact. The Japanese army's sudden attack on Luoyang is a major blow to the Chongqing-Communist Party relationship. Now, in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, our country should fight alongside its allies as scheduled, and military reorganization is an urgent task. Armed comrades should naturally return to the fold, he said.

### Wallace Departs for Chongqing

Lisbon, 21st (Reuters) - Washington (Reuters): President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that Vice President Wallace had departed for Chongqing and would return to the United States in mid-July. He will collect important information in the war zone related to future prosperity and peace.

### Germany Officially Announces Withdrawal from Iterny; British Vessels Discovered in the Northern Italian Sea

Berlin, 21st (Reuters) - German forces withdrew from the town of Iterny on the coastal road north of Ermia on the evening of the 19th. The German forces defending the town resisted the attacks by General Clark's forces until the afternoon of that day. British and American forces repeatedly launched flanking attacks to cut off the German retreat, but were repelled after fierce fighting. The German forces withdrew in good order, taking all of their heavy weapons and hundreds of prisoners to new positions in the mountains behind. Before withdrawing, the German forces completely mined the entire area and built numerous obstacles, so the American forces encountered great difficulties in pursuing the retreating German forces. The German forces also thoroughly destroyed all important military facilities and port equipment in Geeta before withdrawing.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German military headquarters announced on the 20th: German naval patrol boat units engaged six British torpedo boats in the Ligurian Sea off Livorno in northern Italy from the night of the 18th to the morning of the 19th. The enemy was unable to resist and escaped under a smokescreen. German naval vessels escorting convoys encountered two small enemy gunboats in the waters near the island of Brazza off the coast of Dalmatia at midnight on the 18th. After an engagement, both enemy vessels were hit, one of which was heavily damaged. The German side suffered no losses.

### Truth About the Yunnan Army's Crossing of the River in Chongqing

— Hermit of Jiangnan

In recent days, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force's crossing of the Salween River has agitated the nerves of people around the world. In particular, the Chongqing authorities themselves have mobilized the radio to publicize it greatly, and the anti-Axis front has also felt unexpected relief, like a sweet rain after a long drought. However, the Axis side, especially Japan, was shocked and alarmed, but that was for a completely different reason, namely, shock at their own stupidity.

Why should the crossing of the river by the Chongqing army's small units cause such a global stir? Let us examine the reasons:

First, in the past eight years of war, it was more common to hear of the Chongqing army crossing rivers to flee than to attack. There has been almost no instance of an offensive across a river. Therefore, for the Chongqing army, this is indeed a sensational event, allowing everyone to see that their own army now also has this ability. Foreign correspondents also exaggeratedly said, "This shows that China's determination to fight is still continuing."

Second, the American-Chinese Allied forces building the Ledo Road in northern Burma are only a hundred miles away. That figure of a hundred miles on the map gives Chongqing a kind of illusion, thinking that it will be easy to open the most desired land international transportation line. They have glossed over the geographical conditions and allowed the people to indulge in their fantasies, hoping to advance the anti-Axis front. As pointed out in a broadcast from San Francisco, "These hundred miles are actually the most difficult terrain in the world that the Allied forces have never crossed before. Although the straight-line distance on the map is only a hundred miles, the actual journey requires crossing many peaks of the Himalayas that are more than ten thousand feet high and traversing many valleys, and the journey is no less than several hundred or several thousand miles. For the Chongqing army to be able to overcome the resistance of the Japanese army and accomplish the arduous task of crossing many mountains would be a miracle."

Third, this river-crossing operation is said to be based on the decision of the Cairo Conference. If Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek had anticipated this river-crossing operation in Cairo, then they would also have foreseen the Japanese army's and the Indian National Army's advance into India, the annihilation battle in Imphal, and the collapse of Tang Enbo's army on the Henan Plain. Are these three giants not all intelligent people? When the Japanese army attacked India, the news dispatches on the anti-Axis side blamed the Chongqing authorities for not launching a corresponding operation from Yunnan after so many days, and the Chongqing government's official newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, hysterically cried out, "What is the Yunnan Expeditionary Force doing?" Is this also related to the Cairo Conference? Every time something like this happens, they say that it is related to a certain conference, which is a common trick of the British and Americans. Moreover, the American side has already demanded to share the credit for this river-crossing operation, saying that it was achieved thanks to the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the US engineering corps, and the Americanization of the Chongqing army. In short, the purpose of this river-crossing operation:

One, is to cover up the defeat on the Henan front;

Two, is based on the urgent need for Chongqing to prolong its existence due to the lack of foreign aid.

These two points are easy to see. As the Chongqing military authorities said, "Although the Henan and Yunnan battlefields are far apart, they are interconnected." Therefore, the propaganda effect of this operation is greater than the actual effect. If it were for the effect of the operation, it should have been launched when the Japanese army attacked India. And the number of troops crossing the river is only a few thousand, there is no need to publicize "20,000 troops." The fact that foreign correspondents were sent to the front line and the chief of staff gave a speech shows the intention behind it. The defeat in Henan completely exposed Chongqing's strength, and Chongqing also understands the voices of disbelief and doubt coming from the anti-Axis front. To restore its reputation, it has to do something. This is the truth about this "good show of crossing the river." The Japanese side reported, "The Chongqing army's crossing of the Nu River was completely crushed and is currently being mopped up." Chongqing and the British and Americans are making such a big fuss, which makes the Japanese side dumbfounded. In short, this battle is just a good show that is not worth a dime but makes people laugh.

### From Discussion to Practice: Railway Line Between Tokyo and Singapore

Tokyo, 21st – Central News Agency: Mr. Kiyono Kentaro, Advisor to the Japan Mechanization Defense Association, stated in a meeting with our reporter on the 20th regarding the railway transportation issue between Japan's mainland and the occupied southern territories: If only 400 to 500 kilometers of new railway were constructed, the railway between Tokyo and Singapore could be completely connected. In essence, the plan to connect the Tokyo-Singapore railway has moved beyond the discussion phase and entered the implementation phase. Upon closer examination, its execution is not difficult. Currently, the railway between Singapore and Bangkok is open and connected. The section between Bangkok and Aranyaprathet is also open, along with the two railway lines between Bangkok and Siem Reap. Furthermore, the railway from Dong Phu Xai has been completed for approximately 300 kilometers, with its terminus, Meng Kaborei, only 60 kilometers from the terminus of the Thai railway. During the previous conflict between Thailand and Vietnam, the Thai army constructed about 30 kilometers of railway in Vietnam. Therefore, only 30 kilometers remain. The designated route between Vientiane and the Yixi area is approximately 200 kilometers. If this can be connected, quick access between Hanoi and Singapore can be achieved. Additionally, another route includes the planned line from Nong Khai to Nakhon Phanom in the Mekong River basin, and from Thakhek in front of Nakhon Phanom in Vietnam to the planned north-south line of Tanap. These two lines are approximately 200 kilometers and 160 kilometers, respectively. If these two routes can be quickly connected, the preliminary line can be bypassed, and connection to Hanoi can be achieved. From Hanoi, a railway already extends purely from Lang Son to Longzhou in China. From there to Nanning, there's about 100 kilometers of a branch line of the Guangdong-Guangxi line to Guilin. Since the Chongqing side has also implemented some extension, the distance between its endpoint and Nanning is less than 100 kilometers. If this 100 kilometers is completed, goods can be directly transported to Tokyo and Beijing, and access to Shanghai is also possible. Japan is the only one who can implement this plan regarding manpower, resources, expenses, and technology.

### Citizens Stockpiling Daily Necessities: Mandatory Registration and Reporting to Ascertain Stock Levels and Plan for Increased Production

The Economic Division of the First District Public Office of this city, to understand the existing stock levels of materials in this city, is conducting a registration of daily necessities. Items such as matches, candles, laundry soap, and coal are all essential for people's livelihoods. However, due to electricity limitations and material source issues, their production volume is not as abundant as before. In order to calculate existing quantities so as to plan for increased production or unclog supply sources, this registration of the above-mentioned materials is being carried out. Regardless of whether citizens are stockpiling for personal use or merchants are using them for trade, all must follow the amount regulations stipulated by the office, honestly filling in reports on the designated dates. Citizens should cooperate with the authorities and not evade the registration. If anyone conceals information in an attempt to avoid registration, once verified, the Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau will be responsible for confiscating the goods. Citizens are urged not to be wait-and-see, so as not to violate regulations. Furthermore, citizens and merchants are urged not to engage in excessive stockpiling or hoarding behavior. Also, the office has made it clear that this inventory registration has absolutely no intention of compulsory purchase. Citizens should pay attention to this announcement.

Enthusiastic Business and Industry Registration

The City Economic Bureau issued a circular to all trade associations in the city, instructing their members to apply for business and industry registration at the Second Section of the bureau before the 31st of this month. Failure to comply will result in expulsion from the association and a fine of up to 1,000 yuan. If registration is further delayed, business suspension will be imposed as punishment. Various industrial and commercial firms are flocking to the bureau to register, and the registration process is very enthusiastic. Once the city-wide business and industry registration is completed, a comprehensive statistical analysis will be conducted.

### Rationing of Cotton Cloth in Nanshi: Preparations Completed, Application Forms Issued, and Cloth Purchase Certificates Distributed

The rationing of cotton cloth based on population count in the Nanshi district is being handled by the Nanshi District Public Office. Preparations have been largely completed since commencement. It has been decided to proceed according to the census figures from February of this year. The application form for cotton cloth rationing based on household registration will be issued by the street office chiefs (坊公所) and neighborhood heads (保甲長) to the respective households. Each registered householder is to complete the form in detail, according to the items listed on the form, in order to receive the cloth purchase certificate. Therefore, households that have moved in after February, deceased individuals, or households that have moved out but have not been reported are not allowed to complete the application form. Any false information will be severely punished according to the law upon discovery. The neighborhood heads must also bear joint responsibility to ensure thoroughness. To prevent multiple acquisitions, organizations and groups in the district that have registered as group households but are not registered internally must apply for verification from the neighborhood head in charge, based on the address listed on their residence permits. Citizens over 20 years of age and underage children without residence permits can fill out the certificate by cross-referencing the ages on the neighborhood's five-part registration form and the number of people on the household registration plate from the police bureau, ensuring that the two match. Householders are urged to pay special attention to this. In addition, the district office will ensure that all personnel involved in the completion of the application certificate, including neighborhood heads and householders, act with impartiality. They must not exploit the opportunity to deliberately create difficulties or fail to issue certificates based on accurate information. Citizens may appeal directly to the district public office during the distribution period of cloth certificates to ensure thorough investigation throughout the Nanshi district.

### Yesterday's Terrorist Drill Throughout Nanshi

Yesterday (the 21st), a terrorist incident drill was conducted in the Nanshi district around Xiangyuan Road after 4 PM. During the exercise, fake perpetrators fired blank rounds in the area and fled immediately. Nearby patrol officers and members of the volunteer police force immediately announced that a terrorist incident had occurred. Traffic throughout the district, including all iron gates in the Kunlian District, were immediately blocked, and pedestrian passage was prohibited. The police chief of the district police bureau, Li Wenqian, and other officers led the effort to search for the perpetrators. The drill concluded at around 6 PM after the perpetrators were apprehended, and traffic was restored. A general amnesty was issued to prevent recurrence.

One-Month Deadline for Completion

The Ministry of Justice had previously announced the promulgation and implementation of the Amnesty Regulations and the Recidivism Prevention Regulations, and had issued a circular to all subordinate judicial organs, requiring them to complete all matters within three months of the document's arrival. However, it has been found that while many judicial organs have reported compliance within the deadline, a significant number have delayed reporting. Therefore, the ministry has issued another circular extending the deadline by one month, requiring all judicial organs to report along with the judgment orders, and no further delays will be tolerated.

### Naval Memorial Day Special of Japan's Allied Nations, Part 2: A Record of the Victory in the Battle of Tsushima, Introduction from the North-China Daily News, 39 Years Ago

Introduction: On May 27, 1905, the day the Battle of Tsushima Strait began, the Shanghai-based North-China Daily News published the first report of the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet in the most prominent position: "Russian fleet sighted, attack commenced." Most noteworthy, the newspaper wrote: "Naval experts have always believed that it is absolutely impossible to sink steel warships with torpedoes and shells, but Japan has completely overturned this belief in this battle, actually sinking steel ships with shells, which is truly amazing." This is identical to how the Japanese Navy used aircraft to sink battleships in the Great East Asia War. The following is the newspaper's account of the battle:

First report of the Combined Fleet: Urgent telegram from Tokyo, May 29 – On the morning of May 27, the first report of the Combined Fleet was received:

"Our Combined Fleet began the attack immediately after receiving a report of the sighting of the Russian fleet. The weather was clear on that day, but the waves were quite high." Public announcement of the Battle of Tsushima: Urgent telegram from the North China Daily News correspondent in Tokyo, May 29 – The general staff headquarters announced today the outline of the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan as follows:

"The Japanese Imperial Navy's Combined Fleet, led by Admiral Togo, encountered the Baltic Fleet in the waters off Tsushima on the morning of May 27 and began artillery battles from the afternoon of the same day. In the fierce battle until dusk, the Japanese naval destroyer flotilla began to operate, inflicting a fatal blow to the enemy. On the 28th, the battle continued, and the Japanese Navy pursued the Russian fleet fleeing towards Korea. The Russian Navy's heavy cruiser Izumrud used its speed to flee north, but the battleship Nicholas I, the Oryol, the coastal defense ship Admiral Senyavin, and the Apraxin came to surrender. On that day, the Japanese Navy suffered minimal losses in this battle. Russian prisoners witnessed the sinking of two battleships, cruisers, and three other ships. There are currently two thousand Russian prisoners. The report stated that the Japanese Navy sank a total of thirteen Russian ships of all sizes. The Russian Navy is therefore completely unable to fight, and the aforementioned surrendered enemy ships are not included in that count. The number of prisoners has increased by one thousand."

Japanese government announcement (Tokyo, May 30, afternoon, second report from Admiral Togo):

The main force of the Japanese Combined Fleet accepted the surrender application of the Imperial Russian Fleet in the waters off Okinoshima on the afternoon of May 28 and immediately ceased pursuit. However, all enemy ships applying to surrender were arrayed southwest of the coastal defense cruiser Admiral Ushakov. The Japanese naval battleships Iwate and Yakumo advanced towards the ship and demanded that the enemy ships come under our command. The enemy ships refused, reneging on their previous statement, and were immediately bombarded. At 6 p.m., the Admiral Ushakov was sunk. About three hundred enemy officers and soldiers were rescued from the sea. Also, at 5 p.m., the Russian naval cruiser Dmitri Donskoi was fleeing northwest. It was immediately pursued, and our Second and Fourth Destroyer Squadrons bombarded it. The ship attempted to escape under the cover of darkness, but our Second Destroyer Squadron continued the relentless pursuit, and the next morning, it ran aground on a small island off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. All the crew members were taken prisoner. Also, in the evening of May 27, our destroyer Sazanami captured the Russian destroyer Bedovy off the coast of a small island south of Korea. The ship carried the commander of the Baltic Fleet, Admiral Rozhestvensky, who was severely wounded, as well as two other naval admirals. Together with about eighty officers from the Russian Navy's flagship Suvorov, which was sunk on May 27, they were all captured by our side. On the morning of May 28, a Russian destroyer sailing north was spotted and immediately bombarded and sunk. Also, our cruiser Niitaka and destroyer Murakumo pursued a Russian destroyer on the afternoon of May 28, causing it to run aground.

### Birthplace of the Japanese Navy: A Pilgrimage to Southern Iyo

— Yoneyama Tamotsu

The navigation and combat techniques cultivated during the Hachiman ship era were deployed without reservation during the seven years of foreign expeditions around the Keicho and Bunroku eras. The Iyo navy was often the backbone of the expeditionary navy, achieving special merits each time. As such, the Iyo navy, revered as the progenitor of the Japanese Navy, developed its refined tactics into the Mishima-style or Iyo-style naval tactics. These tactics were further honed by strategists during the Edo period and were finally applied by General Akiyama Saneyuki (born in Iyo), a senior staff officer of the Togo Fleet, in the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, defeating the Russian expeditionary force and earning great fame. Captain Kan Gensaburo, who committed seppuku to remain with the sinking ship during the recent sinking of the Nagasaki Maru, was also from Iyo. This can be said to demonstrate the ardent naval spirit of the Iyo navy's tradition.

Japanese-Made Black Ship

The seventh lord of Uwajima in 1889, Date Muneki, who lived to be 100 years old and was known by the pseudonym Shunsan, was a person with considerable new knowledge. The eighth lord, Munenari, was also a famous lord. With the support of his adoptive father, Muneki, he dared to proclaim the great cause of loyalty to the emperor despite being a small clan. Under the patronage of these two enlightened lords and the great talent of Maebara Isamu, Japan's first black ship (Note 4) was built in Uwajima.

Kazo (later renamed Isamu) was the son of a merchant who loaded goods on small boats and sold them in various villages, born in Yawatahama City. He once worked in Osaka, and at the age of 25, his employer's business failed, so he returned to Uwajima, making a living by producing lanterns, kites, dolls, etc., living a poor life. But deep down, he secretly studied books on physics, chemistry, etc., or turned spoiled sake into good sake. People in the neighborhood called his work "the beggar of inventions." During this period, the great achievement of building a black ship that he would later create on his own was already budding.

In 1854, Lords Muneki and Munenari believed that establishing national defense and expanding national power lay in controlling the sea, so they resolved to build a steamship with the power of the Japanese alone. Therefore, they ordered Kazo, who was known locally as the "invention maniac," to research a fire-powered vehicle. After much hard work, he finally created a model, which was a box about one shaku wide, two shaku five sun long, and seven or eight sun high. Four wheels were installed on both ends, and when the central axis rotated, the wheels turned three times with each rotation. The four wheels were not only able to move forward but also backward. Lord Munenari was overjoyed and ordered him to quickly build a machine. Soon, the day arrived for the launching of Japan's first steamship made by Japanese hands. That was March 2, 1854. Many people, including the lord, relied on seeing Kazo's work, and the deck was crowded with people, with hardly any room to stand. Because it was too crowded, the ship's draft was unexpectedly deep, and the propellers (paddle wheels) installed on both sides experienced more resistance from the water than expected, so it ran very slowly, and the engine stopped after about two cho (over 200 meters). This was, of course, a great failure.

Lord Munenari had high expectations for his genius scientific spirit and immediately sent him to study in Nagasaki with Omura Masujiro, who was then in Kurishima. After enduring hard work, he returned to Iyo and began to build a steamship. During this period, the great cause of the Meiji Restoration had been achieved, and the era name was changed to Meiji. Coinciding with the departure of the new Japan, he held the launching ceremony of the steamship that was the crystallization of his efforts. This time it was a great success, and his ship sailed the Bungo Channel. This was the first launching and first voyage of a black ship made by the Japanese themselves. Kazo was thus granted samurai status by the public, and he received the name Isamu Maebara, which was recorded in history. From this, one can also see the joy of Lord Munenari.

Omura Masujiro returned to Uwajima with Isamu after studying together in Nagasaki, and they worked side by side with Isamu to build a steamship, creating the prototype of Japan's first warship. This, from the ancient Iyo navy to the advance into the ocean, is also a matter worthy of record for Iyo, which has many connections. Isamu returned to farming after the abolition of the han system and spent his remaining years in Nogawa, Uwajima City, dying in 1892 at the age of 82. He made rifles, invented Japan's first detonator, and created spinning and sewing machines using waterwheels. A man of many talents, he also became a doctor and created "gun dolls," which became a local folk art and spread widely. This is the originator of the head-shaped dolls that are synonymous with Uwajima. In short, Maebara Isamu, who had demonstrated great enthusiasm for building a scientific Japan before and after the Meiji Restoration, deserves to have his immortal achievements recognized today.

Note 4: Japan used to call ships from European and American countries black ships because their hulls were all painted black.

Note 5: "Doll" is a doll similar to a clay doll or a foreign doll. (End) (Translated from the weekly Asahi)
