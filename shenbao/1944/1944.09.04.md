### After Reading "My View of the Chongqing Regime"

â€” Chen Binhe

Question: Mr. Yoshida's article "My View of the Chongqing Regime," published in your newspaper for several days, has attracted much attention from various parties. Everyone feels that Japan's understanding of China to this extent is a blessing for the future of both countries. I wonder what your opinion is on this?

Answer: Mr. Yoshida's article is voluminous, running to tens of thousands of words, but its central theme is still how to promote the most appropriate resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem, and how to truly realize the lasting cooperation between China and Japan during and after the war. The fundamental starting point and conclusion of this article lie here, and cannot be overlooked.

Question: What different views do you have regarding the situation of the Southern University faction within the Chongqing regime? In particular, concerning the "National Essence Faction," is its essence as Mr. Yoshida described?

Answer: Generally speaking, Mr. Yoshida's description is quite accurate, and our understanding is limited to this as well. However, what we should add is that the so-called National Essence Faction is itself a mixed bag. There isn't really such a political faction, they only share similar views on Japan and the Communists. However, their interests are not consistent. Therefore, while it is not true to consider the National Essence Faction as a solid political group and thus treat it as an object of political work, it is also inaccurate to think that their views and strategies towards Japan and the Communists are consistently upheld. Because there are many contradictions among them, and each influential figure has their own set of speculative tricks, they have never insisted on their own claims to the end.

Question: What is the real situation of the Anglo-American faction?

Answer: Mr. Yoshida's analysis of the Anglo-American faction is very incisive. Within the Chongqing regime, the so-called "anti-communist trinity" of the Whampoa clique, the political science clique, and the CC clique, may not seem to control all power on the surface, but in reality, they control real power from the central to local levels. Except for diplomacy and a portion of military sovereignty, these three factions can fully represent the Chongqing regime (but it should be noted that they are not unified among themselves). As for the so-called Anglo-American faction, they have not grasped the real power of the Chongqing regime except in diplomacy. However, internally, they are undoubtedly the representatives of the interests of the comprador capitalists, while also being followed by most of the national capitalists. In the current stage of political activities in China, they play a leading role, especially with the support of British and American politicians, diplomats, and even military leaders. Therefore, among the National Essence Faction, there are also individual members, whose political views and actions maintain some connection with the Anglo-American faction at the same time.

Question: Isn't the assessment of Chiang Kai-shek a bit too high?

Answer: Essentially, Chiang may regard himself as the representative of the interests of the national capitalists, but more realistically, he is a proponent of his own heroism and superhuman rights. Therefore, he also stands on the side of the feudal remnants, saying a few words for the interests of the large landowners. He will never just follow one faction or one thing, or only use one faction to satisfy himself. He is not only often the supreme controller of the various factions under the Chongqing regime, but also often places himself in a detached position regarding the opposition between the National Essence Faction and the Anglo-American Faction, the conflict between the Chongqing Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the divergence of foreign policy on being pro-Soviet, pro-British-American, or pro-Europe, changing his attitude according to the situation and timing. If we must say that he has the characteristics of perseverance and excellence, it is his insistence on this opportunism and the application of this opportunism. Therefore, his status is shaped by the times. And will today's status be broken by the current situation? He probably wouldn't dare to dream of that! As for the evolution of the Chiang family's relationship that people love to talk about, I don't think it has much significance and doesn't play a big role in politics.

Question: Your meaning seems to be that the internal affairs of the Chongqing regime are dominated by opportunism? Can such an opportunistic regime break the current situation and maintain its existence or realize its ideals?

Answer: Frankly speaking, if opportunism were to succeed, the World War would not have broken out. If Chongqing's opportunistic policies could succeed, then where has their success been in the more than seven years of the "War of Resistance"? In military affairs? In politics? In economics? Or in the "reputation" of a few individuals? Let alone opportunism, since the Greater East Asia War, the period of quiet on the Chinese battlefield for two years and eight months has been quite long. May I ask what Chongqing has done during this period? What preparations have they made? When the Japanese army wanted Luoyang, Luoyang fell easily; when the Japanese army wanted Changsha and Hengyang, Changsha and Hengyang fell soon after. In the future, if the Japanese army wants Guilin and Chongqing, who can guarantee that Guilin and Chongqing will not be a sequel to Changsha and Hengyang?

Question: Mr. believes that the Chongqing regime, whether in terms of opportunism or strength, is unable to break the status quo! Then, isn't it too early to talk about the so-called appropriate path to peace?

Answer: In order to revive China and build a new East Asia, we must first seek the early realization of China's unification, that is, the early realization of overall peace. Mr. Yoshida has already clearly pointed out in his article "My View of the Chongqing Regime": although this path exists, the Japanese side must first have a true understanding of Chongqing and the entire Chinese people. This is an unbreakable truth. But I have a feeling here, like a bone spur in my throat. I must speak it out: First, it is that some Japanese people may still think that the knot of the Sino-Japanese problem lies in the "War of Resistance," and that the "War of Resistance" is directed by the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, they believe that the issue of overall peace or Chinese unification should first focus on the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek. But as Mr. Yoshida pointed out, the center of the problem is not here, but only in the "national psychology"! Therefore, I hope that everyone's attention will shift, and rather than focusing on the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek, it is better to focus on winning over the people under the Chongqing regime; and more realistically speaking: rather than winning over the people under the Chongqing regime in vain, it is better to realistically win over the people in the peace zone. We have always believed that as long as the people in the peace zone have a centripetal effect on the national policy and Japan's policy towards China, then the people all over the country will sincerely return. This is the only great road to overall peace or national unification. Second, at present, the general people in the peace zone are unwilling to actively work hard on various construction undertakings due to incorrect views on the current situation, and hold a vain wait-and-see attitude. However, illusions are ultimately illusions, and the result is only self-deception and harm to the country. Even today, we still feel acutely that there are countless hidden reefs in the political, economic, social, and even cultural construction in the peace zone, and there will be no achievements under the public's wait-and-see attitude! Therefore, we sincerely hope that regardless of whether they are in or out of office, or high or low, they will actively rise up, cheer up, and first solve the problems of innovation, construction, and revival in the peace zone, and concentrate their efforts to eliminate hidden reefs and overcome difficulties. As long as, and only if, our practical work in the peace zone is successful, then no matter what the trend of the Chongqing regime is, we will not be afraid that the people's hearts will not converge, we will not be afraid that the country will not be unified, and we will not be afraid that the country's construction and revival will not be successful. Nor will we fear that the cooperation between China and Japan will not be practical and thorough. This is the most profound feeling I have after reading Mr. Yoshida's great work.

### Manchukuo Actively Promotes Policies to Strengthen the Total War Posture, Prime Minister Zhang Announces National Policy Outline

Xinjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) The State of Manchuria held the 12th Plenary Council of the Concordia Association. On the first day, Prime Minister Zhang announced the outline of national policies, the main points of which are as follows: The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage for the rise and fall of East Asia. The glorious construction and management of our Manchuria over the past twelve years is precisely the pioneer in winning the war and building Greater East Asia today and manifesting its true meaning. Now, our 43 million people should rise up in unison and not end until the goal of destroying Britain and the United States is achieved, and rapidly complete the total war decisive battle posture. In order to strengthen the defense posture, we should also actively promote the enhancement of combat power in order to realize the obvious hope of the restoration of East Asia. The government believes that it is necessary to vigorously seek all kinds of measures to absolutely ensure domestic security. Regarding air defense matters, based on past experience of enemy air raids on Anshan, we should strengthen the conviction that air raids are not terrible, and officials and civilians should thoroughly strengthen the air defense posture and prepare thoroughly. Regarding the enhancement of combat power, the greatest responsibility borne by our Manchukuo, such as increasing the production of morning products, light metals, coal, and other military supplies, is more buoyant this year than last year. The government is now concentrating its total efforts to thoroughly implement policies. Regarding the increase in production in the mining and industrial sectors, due to the urgency of the war situation, we should rapidly concentrate our total efforts, thoroughly implement policies, and strive to achieve it.

### Japanese Army Reinforcements in Northern Burma, Fierce Fighting Southwest of Longling, Japanese Army Recaptures Two Heights Near Mangshi

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 2nd, regarding the war situation on the Nu River front, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the night of the 1st that after the arrival of reinforcements, the Japanese army surrounded the Chongqing army's positions ten kilometers southwest of Longling, and fierce fighting is underway. Although the Chongqing army had made some forward progress south and southwest of Longling, it has lost the two heights about eleven kilometers northwest of Mangshi on the Burma Road again. The Chongqing army is now using American-made flamethrowers to attack the Japanese army's special fire points on Songshan, near the Nu River crossing point.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to Chongqing, the war correspondent of the Chongqing Business Daily in Northern Burma recently exposed the inside story of the Ledo Road campaign, and declared that the fishermen's army is currently holding resentment towards Stilwell and even the British army. The general idea is that, according to Stilwell's original battle plan, the 77th Brigade of the British Indian Army, which belonged to the Second Army, was responsible for the offensive against the Moungaung area in Northern Burma. The 111th Brigade and 74th Brigade of the Third Division were responsible for opening a 29-kilometer section of the road between Moungaung and Kamaing. However, the 77th Brigade failed to advance towards Moungaung, and the aforementioned two brigades were trapped on the high ground by the Japanese army. The three brigades of the British Indian Army were unsuccessful. Now Stilwell is asking the Chongqing New Burma Eighth Division to take on more tasks.

### Enemy Planes Attack Celebes, Five Shot Down

Southwest Pacific Japanese Military Headquarters, 2nd (Central News Agency) An enemy air squadron attacked the Minado area of Celebes Island, twice, first with two large aircraft on the 1st, and then with seventeen fighter-bombers on the morning of the 2nd. The pure Japanese air squadron and Japanese army artillery fire engaged the enemy separately, and shot down five planes. In addition, the enemy also attacked Kaimana in southwestern New Guinea with about forty small aircraft on the 1st, and attacked Ternate on Halmahera Island with more than ten fighter-bombers on the afternoon of the 1st.

### American Reporter Reports on the Hunan War Situation

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 2nd, the Hunan war situation is as follows: The Japanese army is now changing its method of pressing against the Chongqing army in the Hengyang area, advancing west along the Xiang-Gui Railway from a point less than thirty kilometers away from Hengyang instead of attacking towards the Xiang River from the north. A large Japanese force has advanced from Laiyang to a point eighteen kilometers southwest of the city, and then turned towards Changning, south of Hengyang, and is now only nine kilometers away from the city, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chongqing army. If the Japanese army occupies Changning, it can cooperate with the southward troops and use Changning as a base for attacking the Xiang-Gui Railway, and concentrate its efforts to encircle and suppress the Chongqing army fighting southwest of Hengyang. The Chongqing military authorities believe that the target of the Japanese army's offensive is limited to this and is not a real start to a large-scale southward operation. However, the Japanese army is actively transporting supplies to the vicinity of Hengyang, implying that the current offensive will develop into an offensive towards Guilin. If this becomes a reality, it will have many impacts. Also, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 1st that fighting occurred east of Yongfeng, and confirmed that the air base and water of Zhejiang Province have been lost.

### General Li Yulin's Message to Chongqing Soldiers

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Li Yulin published a message to the armed groups in Chongqing on the 1st. The general idea is that the anti-resistance compatriots should understand that the time for overall peace has matured, embrace the belief of peace and construction, and jointly build Greater East Asia.

### The Current Situation in Guilin is Extremely Chaotic

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) Since the fall of Hengyang, Guilin has become increasingly shaken. On the 30th, Chongqing Broadcasting also admitted that the Japanese army will inevitably attack, so Guilin has fallen into a state of extreme chaos. The current situation in Guilin, according to Chongqing Broadcasting, is as follows: Guilin is taking all possible defensive measures in preparation for the Japanese army's new actions from Hengyang. Almost all citizens have been organized into volunteer corps, and a "wounded soldier care circle" has also been formed. In addition, military supplies and military warehouses are being rapidly equipped. From September 1st, all vehicles in the city have been requisitioned, and the Guangxi Provincial Government has also actively begun to restrict the removal of food from the city. On the other hand, due to the Japanese army's offensive against Hengyang, ordinary people or general residents have come here to seek refuge, causing the commercial situation to become more chaotic. And unscrupulous merchants who profiteer from the war are even more rampant and cannot be contained.

### Hong Kong Establishes the Exchange Cooperative

Hong Kong, 3rd (Central News Agency) In order to enrich the required war and civilian food resources and promote wartime production activities, the Hong Kong Japanese Governor-General's Office abolished the Hong Kong Trade Association and established the Hong Kong Exchange Cooperative on the 1st, which is engaged in the entire work of trading materials. The constituent members of the exchange cooperative have been designated as ten influential companies in the local area, with a total capital of one billion one hundred million yuan. According to the governor's order, the following business will be handled: purchasing, transporting, and storing military supplies; assisting in establishing a plan for transporting, storing, and distributing general materials; and pricing the import and export of various materials.

### The 85th Japanese Parliament to be Convened on the 6th, Prime Minister to Deliver Policy Speech

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Koiso Cabinet, in view of the fact that the war situation is gradually entering a decisive stage, previously decided to convene the 85th extraordinary session of the parliament on the 6th of this month. The purpose of the convocation is nothing more than to enable the people to thoroughly understand the important policy guidelines of the Koiso Cabinet, and to unite officials and people from top to bottom to complete the war. The proposals to be discussed in the parliament are supplementary budget for temporary military expenses and general accounting budget for increasing agricultural production, etc. It is expected that legal cases will not be discussed. The most noteworthy aspect of this parliament is the policy speech by Prime Minister Koiso at 4:00 pm on the 7th, and the war situation reports by the Army and Navy Ministers. As for the speech on diplomacy by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, it may be suspended, but in answering questions at the budget general meeting, the Foreign Minister will reveal his beliefs regarding the current international political situation.

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Chongqing's recent removal of the former "Xinjiang Province Chairman" Sheng Shicai to serve as the Minister of Agriculture has been regarded by the Associated Press Washington telegram and the New York Times as a kind of flattery to the Soviet Union by Chongqing. It is said that this is the most important adjustment of the provincial chairman since the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in 1927. However, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, said that this is only a domestic adjustment, and cited the previous examples of Zhang Qun serving in Sichuan Province and Wu Dingchang serving in Guizhou Province to argue strongly. However, Sheng Shicai's transfer of his border territory built over more than ten years and his 40,000 subordinates to the control of Chongqing in exchange for a seat as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is not merely a regular adjustment.

According to reliable opinions from Chongqing, in order to strengthen Xinjiang's right to speak and its stance, it is of course necessary to remove Sheng Shicai, who is pro-Soviet. However, he has contributed greatly to Chongqing's development of the northwest since 1942. Especially since the conflict between Chongqing and the Outer Mongolian army at the end of last year, what Britain and the United States have felt indignant about is not Chongqing's expansion to Xinjiang, but their hatred of Xinjiang's advance towards Chongqing.

The United States has paid special attention to Sheng Shicai's transfer this time. The reason why they care about this is that they have deeply realized the danger of the Soviet Union wanting to contain the United States. The United States previously sent Wallace to Chongqing, and now sent Johnson to visit Chongqing, which seems to be the same. This can be considered the sincerity of the United States to aid Chongqing.

It is said that the mobilization of materials in the United States has reached its highest limit. However, their efforts to win over Chongqing are also revealing their ambition to develop the northwest. The wise Chongqing should avoid being unaware of their treachery!

### Chongqing Replaces Sheng Shicai, Britain and the United States Reveal More Ambition

Since the United States specially sent Wallace to visit Chongqing, it has been promoting that the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union has improved. If this is considered that Wallace is trying to mediate between Chongqing and the Soviet Union, it is better to say that this is due to Wallace's visit to Chongqing and the United States' ambition. Chongqing is in a dilemma. Sheng Shicai is also very sad because he has only completed the task of a puppet. However, Sheng Shicai should not complain about Chongqing's situation, because Chongqing has no other way. Therefore, making Sheng Shicai leave Xinjiang is a temporary victory for the United States' ambition to invade. Secondly, with Nelson's visit to Chongqing, Chongqing has to deal with its invasion with wise measures.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) The New York Post commented on the 1st on the Chongqing government's dismissal of the Xinjiang Province Chairman Sheng Shicai, saying that Sheng Shicai's dismissal has strayed far from the future world peace concerns held by the United States. However, according to a telegram from Chongqing, it can be known that Sheng Shicai's forced resignation is to improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Sheng's resignation this time will make the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union more cordial in the future, which may be the biggest event in the Far East in the future.

### The War in Northern France is Approaching, the Maginot Line, Canadian Army Breaks into Le Havre

Nancy, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News: In the villages near the Maginot Line in the Lorraine region, a large number of refugees have moved east. British and American aircraft have repeatedly flown low and fired at these refugees, causing many innocent deaths. It is still difficult to predict whether the Maginot Line will soon become a war zone. However, the German High Command can certainly use the Maginot Line's tank traps and other facilities to block the advance of the anti-Axis forces.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News military commentator Antolius said: The German army's operational policy in the western theater is to set up new battle lines and withdraw the operational forces in the forefront of France. Although the German army has been cut off in many places by the superior enemy forces, it can still retreat while fighting. The enemy's operational policy is still to break into the Belgian area from the north of Compiegne and advance towards the Strait and the Flanders coast. Therefore, the US Third Army is advancing with heavy troops from the Verdun area towards the Lorraine basin and Longwy and Thionville, seemingly wanting to enter the area where the German army has set up new battle lines. The German counterattack the day before yesterday has blocked the enemy's advance towards the Lorraine basin. At the same time, the US army is advancing towards Mezieres, Charleville, and Vervins, and part of it wants to turn west towards Saint Quentin, with the aim of opening the way for the left wing of the US First Army to advance north. The British army is advancing east from the Amiens area, with the same effect. The British outposts have advanced north from the Amiens area towards Arras and Scarpe, and are advancing west along the Sensee River. Fierce fighting is currently underway. In addition, Canadian troops have now broken into the slopes of Le Havre and are advancing towards Dieppe. The fierce fighting in that area has reached its climax.

### Toulon and Marseille Cease Resistance

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) The German authorities announced on the 2nd that the German garrison forces in the fortresses of Marseille and Toulon have fought alone for several weeks, and have now had to cease resistance. However, due to the fierce fighting of the German forces in the two ports, the main force of the German army was able to escape from southern France.

### Montgomery's Promotion to Field Marshal Causes Dissatisfaction in the United States

Madrid, 3rd (Central News Agency) German News Agency, according to Washington news: British General Montgomery, commander of the British forces in northern France, has been promoted to field marshal, and in terms of rank, he is now above General Eisenhower, the commander of the anti-Axis Allied forces. The United States is deeply dissatisfied with this move. The US Senate has now begun to initiate the creation of the rank of field marshal in the US military as well, so that British and American officers have equal status.

### Finland Announces Severance of Relations with Germany

Helsinki, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News, The local official announcement: The Finnish government has decided to sever relations with Germany and accept the Soviet Union's few conditions. It also acknowledged that Finland's submission to the Soviet Union was due to British and American pressure, but the details of the conditions are not yet known.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Helsinki: Finnish Prime Minister Hackzell gave a broadcast speech on the 2nd, saying that the speech contained some important significance.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Finnish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee listened to the government's report on the diplomatic situation on the 1st, and then suddenly convened the parliament on the 2nd, several days earlier than the scheduled convocation period. The Finnish government ordered the Finnish ships in the Baltic Sea to go to the nearest Finnish Gulf or neutral seabed for avoidance.

### New Cabinet Formed in Bulgaria

Sofia, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News, it is announced here that Stefanov has been appointed as the Bulgarian Foreign Minister. The previous rumor that Prime Minister Muraviev also served as Foreign Minister has now been proven incorrect. The list of other cabinet members of the new cabinet is as follows: Minister without Portfolio Yan Sasov, Teqin Da Puylov, Minister of Interior Health Railways and Postal Services Dimav, Minister of Finance Commerce and Labor Zhikinov, Minister of Justice and Education Barov, Minister of Defense Major General Marinov, Minister of Agriculture Bobov, Minister of Engineering Skarlos.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News: A German External Affairs spokesman said: The lifespan of the Bulgarian new government depends on the negotiations between Bulgaria and the anti-Axis countries. The purpose of the new government is no different from the previous Bagrianov Cabinet, that is, hoping to get out of the war. However, whether the new government can get out of the war is still a question.

### Hungarian Prime Minister Expresses Determination to Fight to the End, and Strives to Consolidate the Domestic Front

Budapest, 3rd (Central News Agency) Hungarian Prime Minister Lakatos issued a message to the people on the 1st, expounding the policy guidelines, saying that the new Hungarian government should consolidate the domestic front with the greatest effort in response to the demands of the war. In order to support the heroic fighting of Hungarian front-line officers and soldiers and ensure the survival of the people, the new government will use all means to fight for the defense of the motherland. With the assistance of the German army, our country's strength will be further strengthened. Although we have temporarily encountered setbacks in the war situation, resulting in the retreat of some areas, but in order to defend the motherland, we should spare no sacrifice and fight to the end.

Budapest, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News: Hungarian Minister of Supply Rosengyir died on the 1st. In addition, the rumor that former Prime Minister SztÃ³jay has passed away is completely inaccurate.

### German Meteor Bombs First Attack Paris

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to an Associated Press dispatch from Paris: German meteor bombs were dropped on the Paris area for the first time on the night of the 1st, causing some damage to the area. However, the location of the drop has not yet been determined.

### The Ministry of Health to Universally Establish Smoking Cessation Hospitals

Nanjing, 3rd - Central News Agency: Since the central government promulgated the smoking ban decree, it has been actively promoting it, hoping to completely eliminate the century-old scourge of opium within the prescribed three-year plan. The administrative issues are mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, while the technical issues of smoking cessation are the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. Therefore, after being entrusted by the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Health immediately opened a smoking cessation hospital in both Nanjing and Shanghai to provide smokers with the opportunity to quit. It is now learned that the Ministry of Health, in order to ensure that smokers in various places have the opportunity to quit, is also planning to establish 30 large-scale smoking cessation hospitals in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui smoking ban zones, divided into three grades: A, B, and C. The entire detailed plan is currently being finalized and will be implemented soon.

### Weekly Industrial and Commercial City Conditions

The financial and industrial conditions in Shanghai last week shifted from chaos to normal stability. The rumors that the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen and North China Joint Reserve notes would change, coupled with the continuous flow of funds from North China to Shanghai, caused public panic. The black market soared, and Chinese stocks were consistently high, which particularly stimulated the continuous rise in various commodity prices. Subsequently, after Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance signed a 400 million yen credit loan agreement in Japan, and Minister Zhou returned from Japan and clarified the significance of the 400 million yen loan, stating that the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen would maintain the established policy, the public was greatly relieved, and the unfounded rumors in the market disappeared invisibly. The financial situation became more stable, the black market price of gold fell, the market price of Chinese stocks remained unchanged, and the prices of various daily necessities also stabilized.

### Principals of Private Schools Welcome Director Dai

More than 300 principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city held a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to welcome the new Director of the Education Bureau, Dai Yingfu. During the meeting, Director Dai gave detailed instructions on the education policy, stating: "After taking office, I am determined to simultaneously improve education in Shanghai in terms of both quality and quantity. I hope that all principals will pay special attention to the following points: Grasp the Chinese-based education and ensure that the education sector moves forward in unison. Emphasize cultural exchange, absorb foreign culture, and supplement our own shortcomings. Provide practical education to the first generation of citizens of the country to prevent them from becoming decadent and impetuous." Finally, Dai praised and encouraged the principals of various private schools for their hard work in running their schools. Subsequently, the principals raised some pressing issues in the education sector, but they did not mention the serious fact that the number of students dropping out of school in Shanghai is increasing daily. According to what reporters have learned, the tuition fees for kindergartens in private schools are already over 3,000 yuan, which is generally inaccessible. It is hoped that the government can provide as much assistance as possible to various schools, and that schools can also reduce expenses as much as possible and automatically lower tuition fees, so that all students can receive education. The future of the country truly depends on this.

### Queueing for Trolleys - Order Not Improved - Hope the Company Corrects

The Huazhong Metropolitan Transportation Company, in view of the fact that trolley passengers in this city often scramble to board, crowding and causing chaotic order, has repeatedly declared that trolley passengers must queue in order to board the trolley. At the same time, it has also assigned staff at each station to maintain order. This measure has contributed greatly to the safety of passengers and traffic order. However, recently, the company staff responsible for maintaining order at the stations often leave their posts when the trolley arrives, and allow those in uniform and their relatives and friends to scramble to board, causing passengers who abide by the order to often wait for half an hour and still be unable to board. This is especially true at the trolleybus stations from Jing'an Temple Road to Zhongshan Park. It is hoped that the company authorities will strictly correct the staff sent to maintain order to prevent the order from becoming chaotic.

### Youth Middle School Rescues Out-of-School Students

In view of rising living costs and soaring tuition fees, the Youth Association Middle School has set up an afternoon class to rescue out-of-school students. Both male and female students are accepted. There are equivalent classes from the first year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school. The fees are extremely low. Junior and senior high school tuition fees are 1,000 yuan each, miscellaneous fees are 200 yuan, and elective subjects are 300 yuan each. Due to the complete facilities and the concentration of talents, the curriculum standards are exactly the same as ordinary middle schools. However, since this measure is to rescue out-of-school students, it is necessary for students to have poor family backgrounds, excellent character and academics, and fill out an application form to be reviewed and approved before they can register for the entrance examination. It is heard that the examination is scheduled to be held at the school (address: 599 Sichuan Road) at 2:00 PM on September 8th.
