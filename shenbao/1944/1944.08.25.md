### Editorial: Municipal Administration and Personnel

"Everyone has nothing to do, and everything has no one to do." This is what Mayor Chen said in his address to municipal government employees on the Restoration Day this year, referring to the unsound personnel situation in central and local politics. We believe this is a deeply felt experience for Mayor Chen after many years. The fundamental reason why politics cannot be rectified and the country cannot be rich and strong lies precisely in this.

In the recently published "Local Administration" Nos. 10 and 11, Mayor Chen published an article "The Future of Shanghai's Municipal Administration - People," (reprinted on the front page of today's newspaper), mainly pointing out that the future of Shanghai is only an administrative issue, especially a people issue, not a regional issue. Therefore, he said: "Whether Shanghai's municipal administration can establish good rules in the future depends entirely on people. The region and the rules and regulations being revised are almost complete. Don't let the difference in 'personnel appointment' ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration." Mayor Chen's expectation for the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration rests on personnel appointment, which is exactly the same as what we have always advocated.

We greatly admire Mayor Chen's article, which frankly points out that the current personnel appointment methods of the municipal government's affiliated units often exclusively use fellow villagers or relatives, and not only exclusively use their personal connections and relatives but also favor them. Although Mayor Chen is worried about this phenomenon in general agencies, he does not agree with it in his heart. However, because he respects the authority of each unit, he does not interfere, but hopes that the person in charge of each unit will at least imitate the mayor's style of not using personal connections. On this, we offer two humble opinions:

First, the rise and fall of municipal administration are, of course, the ultimate responsibility of the mayor. Since personnel is the main factor related to the rise and fall of municipal administration, and since the improper personnel appointment methods of various municipal units have already been seen, then we believe that one cannot fail to interfere because of respecting authority. If one only hopes that the persons in charge of each unit will imitate the mayor's style of personnel appointment without strict interference and correction, we fear that it will be difficult to achieve practical results. Then, "a difference in personnel appointment will ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration," will probably come as no surprise!

Second, the reason why personnel cannot be sound is that the appointers do not adopt the principle of talent, cannot match people to tasks, and cannot clearly reward and punish. As for those who are appointed, one is due to inherent inferiority, and the other is due to environmental pressure. Inherent inferiority means weak ability and bad character. If one obtains a position due to fellow villager or relative relationships or through connections, then the former will be enough to delay things, and the latter will be enough to ruin things. When their superiors favor them due to fellow villager or new factory relationships, then the tasks they undertake will inevitably become worse and worse. On a small scale, the efficiency of handling affairs is not obvious, and on a large scale, various undertakings of the agency are damaged. Environmental pressure means that the salary received is not enough for the minimum living standard. However, life cannot stop because of this. Therefore, one seeks satisfaction outside of salary, resulting in rampant corruption and bribery. Secondly, colleagues with wavering wills are easily tempted by the environment to act impulsively, gradually leading to assimilation. It is undeniable that these two phenomena are common in the current Shanghai municipal agencies. It is even more imperative to start with qualification examinations and adjust salaries. As for fundamentally re-training, it is a worthwhile consideration.

Therefore, we advocate the establishment of a personnel committee within the municipal government, specializing in personnel management of the units affiliated with the municipal government, so that the mayor's style of personnel appointment can be gradually implemented from hoping that those in charge will imitate it. The personnel committee serves as an advisor to the mayor on personnel appointment and as an implementing unit for personnel management. Its authority is equal to that of various bureaus and departments. Recruit fair and incorruptible talents to preside over it and hire personnel management experts to assist it.

### The Japanese Government Continued to Hold Local Administrative Conferences Yesterday to Enhance Administrative Efficiency and Strengthen Combat Power

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Local Governors' Conference was held on the 23rd and closed on the same day. The conference was extremely successful because the government had expressed its determination, and local governors had enthusiastically put forward their opinions. The Japanese government continued to hold a meeting of the heads of local administrative conferences at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 24th. On the side of the heads of administrative conferences, Governor Nishio of Tokyo and the heads of various conferences attended. On the side of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Minister of Home Affairs Odata, Vice Minister Yamazaki, and other relevant officials attended. This meeting was based on the results of the local governors' conference held the previous day and focused on rapidly strengthening combat power, conducting various consultations on the exertion of administrative efficiency. Therefore, the outcome of the meeting is quite noteworthy.

### The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Held a Meeting of Branch Chiefs

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the closing of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association's local governors' conference on the 23rd, a meeting of branch chiefs of all prefectures and prefectures was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. On the side of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, President Koiso, Vice President Ogata, and other heads of various departments attended. After the meeting, President Koiso and Vice President Ogata delivered speeches, requesting that the national movement make the greatest contribution to the completion of the war. In his speech, President Koiso also emphasized the relationship between the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the government, saying that the unification of the two is most appropriate, but it has been decided to maintain the current structure for a considerable period. Vice President Ogata also emphasized the mission of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, saying that the purpose of the national movement is to express public opinion so that it can actively serve the country and cultivate public sentiment.

### Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam's New Authority Includes Full Power to Command the Army, Navy, and Air Force

Saigon, 24th (Central News Agency) - Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam was granted full dictatorial power over all administrative matters in Vietnam during wartime by the French Decree No. 90 on the 20th of the month, as previously reported. The contents of his authority are listed as follows:

Legislative Power: The legislative power of Vietnam was originally in the hands of the French head of state. Governor-General Decoux was initially ordered by the head of state to exercise it on his behalf and could have legislative power within a certain scope. The governor-general had the right to consider and delay the development of whether the laws and decrees promulgated in France applied to Vietnam for one month. However, after July 11, 1940, the governor-general's legislative power was far less powerful than that of the head of state. Even the decrees promulgated in the country did not allow Vietnam to have a period of consideration. However, after Governor-General Decoux obtained special powers from the Free Government this time, he has all legislative power over Vietnam and can enact and implement any laws when necessary.

Diplomatic Power: In the past, the governor-general had no permanent authority in diplomacy. Without the permission of the home government, he could not have any contact with foreign countries. However, when necessary, he had the right to establish agreements with foreign governments based on the instructions of the government. At the same time, he has the executive authority to maintain diplomatic relations with the envoys of various countries stationed in Vietnam. However, since obtaining special powers this time, he has all diplomatic powers, including signing treaties.

Military Authority: In the past, the governor-general only had the power to handle the army, navy, and air force of Vietnam. That is, when foreign countries invaded Vietnam, they could not be dispatched without the governor-general's permission. However, the command was in the hands of the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. In addition, the governor-general had the authority to declare martial law when major incidents occurred at home and abroad. However, since this new authority was granted, the governor-general has become the supreme commander of the army, navy, and air force, with full power to command all troops.

Financial Authority: In the past, the governor-general had almost full power over the preparation of the Vietnamese budget. However, the management power of the tax system was still retained by the French government. In addition, the restrictions on the handling of official and public land have been completely lifted this time. That is, Governor-General Decoux also has the same full power to exercise in finance. Moreover, Governor-General Decoux is not only the supreme leader of Vietnam's diplomacy, military affairs, politics, and judiciary, but also has the same authority over the French-held islands in the Pacific Ocean and New Caledonia and other territories. All unresolved issues between the Japanese and French governments can also be directly negotiated on the spot. In addition, close cooperation between the two countries is expected.

### Both Sides Tend to Extremes, Compromise Between Chongqing and the Communists is Hopeless, Neither Trusts the Other

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since July, reconciliation negotiations have been conducted for a long time between Chongqing and Yan'an. However, due to the fundamental opposition of the claims of both, the negotiation process has encountered major difficulties. Yan'an recently issued a statement in the name of Zhou Enlai, "China has not yet shed the crisis of civil war." Due to its attack on Chongqing, it has exposed the entire picture of its negotiations. A special correspondent of the New York Times in Chongqing once described the problem on the 22nd: Due to this negotiation, the political discord between the two has become increasingly worse. Lin Zuhan, chairman of the border region government, stayed in Chongqing for two months and met with Chiang Kai-shek once, and with Chiang's representatives Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong many times. However, the gap between Chongqing and Yan'an's positions remains the same. The main obstacle to its resolution is that neither trusts the other. Chongqing argues that there cannot be two regimes in China and that all troops must be placed under Chongqing's control. However, Yan'an believes that the basis of reconciliation lies in the immediate democratization of China, but Chongqing still insists on establishing a constitutional democracy after the war. Lin Zuhan stated that Yan'an currently has 470,000 troops, so regarding Chongqing's request for the equipment of ten divisions, Chongqing only allows the equipment of ten divisions. Moreover, Chongqing seems to have asserted the right to order the Communist army to leave the border region and fight in any area. Yan'an argues that local regimes should be recognized to legalize them, but Chongqing has refused. The main political discord between the two is that Yan'an hopes to participate in China's democratic politics as one of the legal parties. The Kuomintang insists that China cannot establish a constitutional democratic politics during the period when the Japanese army occupies a large area of Chinese territory. Recently, foreign reporters and the US military mission have stated that the opposition between the border region and the Chongqing region has eased slightly, but the political discord between Chongqing and Yan'an is still very obvious.

I firmly believe that this person is the most suitable to bear the heavy responsibility of building a new Thailand. I firmly believe that Japan's Greater East Asia policy is to consistently implement the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, liberate Greater East Asia, promote the prosperity of various countries in East Asia, and establish it as its goal. To achieve this goal, we must first win the Greater East Asia War, and under deep sympathy and mutual understanding, cooperate with various countries in Greater East Asia, and move forward bravely to achieve success.

### Korea to Implement Responsibility System for Increased Production of Iron Ore

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Keijo, the Korean Governor-General's Office has decided to implement a production responsibility system from this year to increase iron production, as increased iron ore production is an urgent task at present. Currently, Japan is in urgent need of iron ore. It is expected that the output of Korean iron ore next year will be several times higher than this year. Therefore, the Governor-General's Office is currently studying various countermeasures to complete this year's iron ore production and prepare for next year's increased production. In addition, in view of the various situations of the iron ore mountains, it will not be easy to complete Korea's planned increase in production next year. Therefore, preparations have begun for the technical and other matters related to the increased production of iron plating mountains such as Bukcheong Pungsan Wen Liao.

### Southern Wooden Boat Arrives Safely in Osaka

The heads of propaganda offices and propaganda directors of the four provinces, three cities, and two directly-administered regions all came to Peiping to attend.

### Strengthening of the Ministry of Industry's Petition Review Committee

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that the handling of economic cases by competent authorities in various places is inevitably prone to errors, the Ministry of Industry has strengthened its original Petition Review Committee. In the future, for petition cases accepted from the people or organizations, in accordance with the provisions of the Petition Law, the principles of utmost speed and fairness will be followed, and they will be handled and concluded as soon as they arrive. If it is believed that the ruling of the original punishing authority is indeed improper, it can be corrected to relieve the suffering of the people. According to the Petition Law, if people's organizations are dissatisfied with the administrative punishment of local authorities in the past, they may state their reasons and file a petition with the central competent authority. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry's strengthening of the Petition Review Committee this time is actually a reasonable and effective measure for handling economic cases in the future.

### The Future of Shanghai's Municipal Administration—People

— Chen Gongbo

It has been exactly one year since Shanghai recovered the French Concession and the International Settlement on July 30th and August 1st of last year, respectively. Initially, the Second District (formerly the International Settlement) and the Eighth District (formerly the French Concession) were merged. Then, on August 1st of this year, the First District was abolished, and the city area of Shanghai was re-divided. This measure is reasonable and necessary for administration. I believe the delineation of the city area is now satisfactory, and all that remains is to see how we progress in administration.

I was dissatisfied with the areas occupied by the former concessions, and I am also dissatisfied with the temporary areas that existed after the recovery of the concessions. I think I am not alone in this, and the general public probably feels the same way. There is no need to discuss other theories. We only need to open a map and see that when the concessions existed, the city area of Shanghai was like a person with a heart removed. When the concessions were recovered, the city area of Shanghai was like a person with a particularly enlarged heart. Removing the heart means a person cannot survive. A particularly enlarged heart, especially one that is strangely protruding, means a person is still morbid and heavy. Therefore, my approach over the past year has been that, in order for Shanghai's administration to get on the right track, it must begin with re-dividing the area. Now, things are better. The effort of the past year has not been in vain. Today, with the area delineated, I dare say that it can be applied for at least 50 years.

I ask everyone to note that the future of Shanghai is only an administrative issue, especially a people issue, not an area issue. I do not expect everyone to make unnecessary changes to the area, but only hope that everyone will pay special attention to administration. Speaking of Shanghai's future administration, there are still many things that should be promoted and reformed. Today, I will only present a few key points.

First, there are two schools of thought in Shanghai now. Some are government employees, and some are ordinary citizens. One school of thought still misses the past systems of the Municipal Council, believing that all systems should be preserved, especially the treatment of employees, which should not be changed in the slightest. The other school of thought believes that since China has recovered the concessions, all regulations should immediately follow Chinese laws, and not only laws, but even the habits of clerks drafting, section chiefs revising, and secretaries reviewing should be maintained. I think that although these two schools of thought are extreme, they can be summarized in one sentence: they are both conservatives, but their methods and opinions of conservatism are different. The former school not only misses the Municipal Council, but also has many misunderstandings. At the very least, it can be said that they mistakenly believe that the treatment of the Municipal Council's employees was a good civil service system. Little do they know that many of the Municipal Council's regulations were methods for dealing with colonies, and the treatment was a combination of civil service system and company employee treatment. Today, we have recovered the concessions, and we must fully implement domestic laws. I am the first to agree to implement a civil service system. However, we must remove the treatment of company employees to make it a pure system before it can be considered reasonable. The latter school is completely confined to habits and ignores many facts. What are the facts? Take Chinese official documents, for example. There are many questionable things: backlog is one, delay is two, cumbersome is three, and slowness is four. If we were to count them, there would be many more drawbacks. If it were perfect, the Executive Yuan would not have established an Administrative Efficiency Committee there to study it. In fact, China adopts a principle of balanced power regarding the administration of local governments. Whether it is a province or a city, they all have the power to formulate individual regulations. Even the tax rate allows local areas to have a great deal of flexibility. In this way, we have ample room for maneuver in local administration. Why should we be rigid and stick to past habits? I hope that the authorities of all units will pay attention to both laws and facts, and not be stubborn or selfish. Shanghai's municipal administration will surely progress.

Second, I am most worried about personnel appointments in general institutions. I have been in Shanghai for more than two years. I have no so-called "private individuals" or "inner circle," as everyone knows. However, I often see many units that either exclusively use people from their hometown or exclusively use relatives. Although I respect the powers of each unit and do not interfere, I ultimately disagree in my heart. I am not saying that private individuals are necessarily bad, or that relatives are necessarily bad. However, I often see that each unit not only exclusively uses their private individuals and relatives, but also tends to favor them. I also know that this bad habit is not unique to the municipal government. Even the old district offices and the First Police Bureau also had factions of private individuals. However, even though there were factions, the advancement and retreat of employees still had set rules, unlike Chinese officialdom, which is like singing Peking opera, where every time a new group comes in, even the extras are thoroughly changed. I hope that those in charge of each unit will at least imitate my style. Otherwise, they criticize the old bureaucrats every day, but repeat the mistakes of the old bureaucrats every day. Whether Shanghai's municipal administration can establish a good model in the future depends entirely on people. Now, the area and the regulations being revised are almost ready. Do not let a mistake in personnel appointments ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration.

Third, Shanghai has a lot of revenue, and also has many unique projects. Projects require funding. I am very afraid that we will first undermine the unity of finance, and second, fall into waste of funds. For example, many units have revenue, but meetings are held to openly embezzle, and even repeated orders are issued. Has the total revenue and expenditure of the finance been done correctly? Now that there is more revenue after unification, it is still being leaked as before, and the unity of finance is being undermined. Also, for example, each unit is not responsible for each project. A project that requires one million can be done with one hundred thousand after review. I do not understand why each unit cannot verify it itself, and why the municipal government needs to review it again? Each unit is an important department of the municipal government. In theory, it can be responsible and can be rewarded or punished. However, the fact is that the municipal government's secretariat and accounting office are opposed to the units. If this is the case, I think it would be better to abolish the units and have the secretariat handle everything quickly, or abolish the secretariat and have the units handle it properly. In short, according to my experience over the years, the municipal government's agencies cannot fulfill their functions and instead restrict their responsibilities. Is it because the system is not good? I think it is entirely a matter of people.

If I continue, I am afraid it will still be a matter of people. Since ancient times, there has never been a system with only benefits and no drawbacks. I deeply hope that everyone will thoroughly examine the issue of personnel, and themselves, and more thoroughly reflect on it. Are we going to have another fundamental training in the future? I am seriously considering it. (Reprinted from the Tenth and Eleventh Issues of the Local Administration Monthly)

### Restrictions on Household Flour Movement Will Be Amended; Flour Allocation Office Considers Improvements

Regarding the movement of flour within the Shanghai area, the Shanghai Flour Allocation Office was ordered to draft the "Shanghai Area Flour Restriction and Movement Handling Rules." Recently, the Flour Control Committee convened a meeting with the Municipal Government's Commodity Allocation Office and Economic Security Office to discuss and finalize the implementation. However, the second article of the movement handling rules stipulates that a Class A movement certificate is required for ten or more catties (applicable to household flour), meaning that anyone purchasing ten or more catties of household flour must apply for a movement certificate. As many households in this city have more than five people, it would be cumbersome to apply for certificates according to the handling rules, and it would be inconvenient for citizens to purchase household flour, causing widespread discussion. A reporter visited the Shanghai Flour Allocation Office yesterday, and it was stated that the office is handling this flour movement processing rule under orders, serving the community and citizens, and taking the stability of people's livelihood as its duty. Regarding the flour movement, if there are any omissions or inadequacies, citizens and various commentators are welcome to contribute opinions, and improvements will be accepted at any time. The issue of household movement certificates for more than ten catties is being reconsidered for improvement.

### Oil and Grain Control Committee Strengthens Edible Oil Management

— Measures to be Announced and Implemented Soon

The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, concerned about the soaring price of oil, immediately formulated the "Temporary Registration Rules for Edible Oil Inventory in the Shanghai Area," ordering members of both Chinese and Japanese guilds in the edible oil industry in the Shanghai area to register their inventory and sales on schedule, so as to understand the circulation routes and actual inventory, and seek comprehensive planning for reasonable regulation. Since the announcement of the rules, most oil merchants have complied with the regulations and registered with the guild, and the price of oil has dropped sharply. However, it has been found that there are still unscrupulous members and large-scale hoarding households outside the industry who are waiting and seeing and stirring up trouble, in an attempt to achieve their ambitions of monopolizing oil prices. In response to this phenomenon, the Oil and Grain Control Committee has further cracked down and, for the sake of comprehensive countermeasures, has consulted with relevant parties and formulated comprehensive measures to strengthen the management of edible oil in the Shanghai area, which will be announced and implemented soon.

### Contents of the Measures

According to reporters, the registration rules previously formulated by the Oil and Grain Control Committee may be misunderstood by those who do not understand the legal system as putting pressure on members of the industry. In fact, the law stipulates that non-members of the industry guild are not allowed to engage in the sale of edible oil at all. Even if they are members of the industry guild, if they intend to profit from criminal acts that are strictly prohibited by special laws, the new management measures of the association include strict management of Shanghai oil merchants, as well as effective measures for warehouse receipts of manufacturers and factories. Oil storage for households, in addition to an appropriate amount, will also be subject to considerable restrictions, especially for oil storage for business purposes, the scope will be absolutely reduced. It is heard that the association has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Economic Security Office for assistance, and it is expected that the price of oil can be suppressed soon, and unscrupulous oil merchants and off-industry hoarding households will suffer the consequences.

### No Cases of True Cholera Found This Year

Preventive Committee Holds Meeting

The fifth meeting of the Standing Committee on Epidemic Prevention was held the day before yesterday (23rd). In addition to Deputy Chairman Yuan Junchang and standing committee members Yongjing Yong, Chen Yidao, Major General Shibata, and Chen Yeqin, Director Lu Runzhi was also invited to attend. First, Deputy Chairman Yuan Junchang reported on the number of people injected, with a total of 3,179,370 people injected in the first phase. The First District Health Office had the highest number of injections, with 908,112 people, followed by the Municipal Health Bureau's Central Team, with 882,275 people. The results are not bad. The second phase of injections began on August 1st, and to date, about 900,000 people have been injected. No one has been found to have true cholera. The Health Bureau is actively carrying out the second phase of injections and is taking measures to strengthen injections. Several mobile inspection and injection teams have been organized, and the police bureau has been requested to assign police officers to assist in the process. Next, Director Lu gave a speech: The gist of which was that he was quite satisfied with Shanghai's epidemic prevention work this year, but the cholera danger period has not yet passed. He asked everyone to work harder to achieve even better results than in the first phase.

### Well Water Should Be Disinfected

He also said that opening artesian wells for drinking water among the people is quite dangerous and should be closely watched. Deputy Chairman Yuan said that the Health Bureau is paying close attention to the well water issue, and will strengthen guidance in the future. Regarding how to disinfect, it is planned to use newspapers or electricity to publicize the public's self-interest so that the public with lower health knowledge can understand and be alert. Encephalitis, which was quite rampant a few weeks ago, has disappeared since the end of last week. However, the recent bacterial dysentery is quite rampant. The reason is that most citizens with poor hygiene knowledge are not careful in their diet. Therefore, the Health Bureau has recently been strictly cracking down on vendors selling cold drinks and watermelons to eliminate all sources of disease.

### Gas Consumption Will Be Strictly Limited

The city's gas company will soon strictly limit gas consumption. Except for military institutions and household cooking, other unnecessary institutions and large consumers will be strictly limited. Dance halls and other places have already stopped supplying gas, and hotels and restaurants will also stop supplying gas in the future. In the past few months, commercial institutions exceeded the limit by 44%, medical institutions exceeded the limit by 20% to 30%, and Chinese and Japanese government agencies exceeded the limit by 66%. On average, more than a dozen users were fined and stopped supplying gas every day for exceeding the limit.

### Reader's Scholarship News: Generous Donations Continue Unabated

Yesterday, Mr. Anonymous sent in a scholarship of 30,000 yuan. The gentleman is not anonymous, because his purpose is only for a good cause. He only wants to help poor and out-of-school children, and only wants to help the country and society educate talents, to the best of his conscience. Therefore, he takes helping education as his purpose, and thinks that the purpose has been achieved by donating funds, and whether to leave a name or not is irrelevant.

### Minister of Justice Chen Discusses the Revitalization of Judicial Affairs and the Enhancement of Judicial Personnel's Treatment

Minister of Justice Chen Enpu, in view of the fact that all civil and criminal cases must be resolved quickly in order to prevent the people from suffering innocent pain, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago to convene the heads of the four courts and offices in Shanghai to discuss effective ways to quickly resolve civil and criminal cases. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chen and was pleased to hear his remarks on the revitalization of judicial affairs in the future: "There are many things that should be promoted and reformed in judicial affairs today. It is difficult to do both talent and money at the same time. In fact, it is not possible. I believe that the most needed things at present are to improve the treatment of judicial personnel and improve the current situation of prisons. The treatment of judicial personnel has always been extremely poor, and it is even worse now. The monthly salary of a prosecutor in Shanghai is not enough to buy a stone of rice. Although there is a slight allocation of daily necessities, it is still far from meeting the needs of life. As the saying goes, people will know etiquette when they have enough food and clothing. Therefore, improving the treatment of judicial personnel is an urgent matter. When former Minister Zhang was in office, he requested and approved funds for fostering integrity, but the procedures have not yet been resolved. Once the consultation is properly arranged, it will be implemented as soon as possible. As for the prisons in various places, most of them lack better sanitation facilities, or there is no doctor when there is illness, or there is no medicine when there is a doctor. Therefore, the health of prisoners is extremely important. Although summer is over, if infectious diseases occur in autumn and winter, it will be even more worrying. I will follow the will of the late Minister Zhang and try my best to increase the medical equipment in various prisons, and the daily disinfection and epidemic prevention matters in prisons, in order to be effective in case of emergency. As for my visit to Shanghai this time, it is to discuss with the heads of the four courts on effective ways to quickly resolve civil and criminal cases, and to urge them to actively carry out the above-mentioned relevant matters."

### Daily Necessities Control Committee to Handle Distribution

Since its establishment, the Daily Necessities Control Committee has been actively carrying out collection and distribution work. The distribution of matches, candles, and soap in various regions will be implemented soon, and the local industry guilds will be responsible for handling it. Since the committee was first established, all affairs have been concentrated in the committee. There is currently no intention to establish offices in various places. Recent reports in various newspapers that the committee has established offices in Ning, Su, and Hangzhou are not true.

(Another report) The management of soap and candle distribution by the National General Chamber of Commerce's department for the control of soap and candle distribution has been handled by the association's soap and candle professional department. Now that the Daily Necessities Control Committee has been established, it should be merged. Yesterday (24th), a letter was sent to the association and the soap and candle professional department to implement the merger in accordance with regulations. It is heard that the Daily Necessities Control Committee will send personnel to take over within days.
