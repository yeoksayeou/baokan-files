### Enemy Air Force Sortied Yesterday Morning, Fiercely Bombing Saipan and Tinian, Fires Erupted After Giant Bombs Landed on Enemy Airfields

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 3rd: Japanese air force units fiercely bombed enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Island at dawn on the 3rd. Fifteen locations on the ground were shattered by bombs, and raging fires erupted. The entire airfield area turned into a sea of fire. Three Japanese planes did not return from this operation.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – From 1:30 AM to 3:30 AM on the 3rd, Japanese air force units conducted a surprise attack on enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Island, launching a preemptive strike against enemy B-29 bombers that were beginning to become active. The enemy airfields were completely destroyed. In this operation, Japanese planes dropped huge bombs on an enemy airfield north of Tinian Island, causing its facilities to burst into flames. In addition, a large number of bombs were dropped, causing major fires at various facilities. Another air force unit simultaneously launched a rapid attack on Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island, dropping large bombs and causing fires at six locations. They also fiercely bombed Orah Airfield, turning it into a sea of fire. Furthermore, Japanese attack units also achieved some combat results, and the enemy suffered a very severe blow this time.

### Japanese Kamikaze Squadrons Attack Enemy Convoys in Leyte Gulf, Enemy Ships in Surigao Strait Also Bombed

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 3rd: (1) Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack squadrons attacked enemy convoys intruding into Leyte on the 1st, sinking one cruiser, destroying one battleship, one battleship or cruiser, one cruiser, and one destroyer belonging to the escort force. (2) From the 1st to dawn on the 2nd, Japanese air force units fiercely attacked enemy convoys in Leyte Gulf and the Surigao Strait, sinking one transport ship, one cruiser, and three destroyers.

Central Pacific Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 1st, Japanese air force units attacked enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, sinking a total of one cruiser and three destroyers. Another team of Japanese planes sank an enemy transport ship in Leyte Gulf that same night.

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – At dawn on the 1st, Japanese air force units continued to attack enemy airfields on Leyte Island. Five locations at Zero Klusu Airfield, three locations at Tacloban Airfield, and multiple locations at Sababro Airfield were set on fire, and one ground anti-aircraft machine gun installation was destroyed. On the 1st, about forty enemy B-24 aircraft that attacked from the direction of Barrot Island on Leyte Island were engaged in aerial combat by Japanese forces, resulting in nine being shot down. About twenty P-38 aircraft were shot down three by ground fire, and five were destroyed.

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the evening of the 1st, the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines has continuously attacked the Tacloban and Tarac Airfields of the U.S. military day and night, shattering runways and ground facilities. On the same day, twenty U.S. P-38 aircraft were intercepted over western Leyte Island, nine were shot down, and one was destroyed.

### Overall Combat Results of Japanese Army Air Force Units

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the U.S. military began its counteroffensive in the Philippines, the Japanese Army Air Force has launched daily attacks on enemy warships and attacking enemy aircraft, achieving remarkable combat results. According to a statement by the local Japanese military authorities: From October 25th to 31st, one hundred and twenty-three enemy warships were sunk or destroyed (not including unconfirmed combat results). The details are as follows: (1) Sunk: 1 seaplane tender, 1 cruiser, 1 destroyer, 1 cruiser or destroyer, 6 transport ships, 152 landing craft. Destroyed: 1 aircraft carrier, 3 battleships, 3 battleships or cruisers, 2 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 15 transport ships, several landing craft, 2 unidentified ship types. Burned: 52 transport ships, several landing craft, 1 unidentified ship type. Other: 1 battleship and 1 cruiser each sustained four bullet hits, and the confirmed number of enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed was 94 (mainly shot down over Lamon Bay), 69 unconfirmed, and 177 aircraft destroyed on the ground.

### "Living Meteor Bombs" German Newspaper Discusses Kamikaze Squadrons

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack squadrons' major operations in the Philippine naval battles have deeply impressed the people of allied Germany. On the 2nd, various newspapers commented on this as "living meteor bombs," with discussions as follows: The Japanese military's use of bomber attack aircraft in operations in the Philippines can be aptly compared to the German army's meteor bombs. The aircraft, piloted by living humans, carries enough gasoline for the attack, with no fuel allocated for the return journey. All the death-defying pilots are specially trained youth, and now countless "living bombs" are waiting for the opportunity to offer their lives for victory.

### No Warships or Aircraft in the Interior of the Philippines

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – On the 1st, no enemy warships or aircraft appeared in the interior of the Philippines the entire day. This phenomenon is likely a sign that the enemy's remaining aircraft carriers are running out of ammunition and preparing to flee the Philippines. The fact that the enemy air force and naval forces invading from the Philippine Sea have been severely depleted due to the fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and naval forces is very clear. The enemy is now extremely flustered, desperately seeking to mobilize land forces from rear bases and attempting to regain air control over Leyte. However, due to the continuous day and night attacks by the Japanese Air Force, they have been completely unable to use them effectively. In addition, Peleliu and Morotai Islands, which have become the largest bases for attacking the Philippines, are facing a crisis due to the Japanese soldiers' brave and fierce attacks, leaving them no time to expand or repair their airfields. Moreover, with many transport ships sunk, most of the military supplies being transported have sunk to the bottom of the sea. With no aircraft carriers to protect the convoys, future supplies will inevitably become increasingly difficult. The situation on Leyte Island will also continue to deteriorate, becoming like an abandoned orphan.

### Japanese Aircraft Units Reconnoiter Admirality Islands

Rabaul, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese base reconnaissance aircraft units are currently focusing on the ports of Lorengau in the Admiralty Islands, which are a crucial intermediate base for the enemy in the Philippines operation, closely monitoring the movements of enemy warships. At 3:00 PM on the 1st, the enemy warships anchored in that port consisted of four battleships (one of which was heavily listing, with the stern deck submerged in the water), one destroyer, and approximately twenty transport ships. In addition, the enemy aircraft parked at the Manus Island airfield consisted of only about twenty medium-sized aircraft. The situation at this important enemy base in the Central Pacific is very relaxed, and the enemy's supply route for the war in the Philippines is gradually shrinking.

### Indian Chairman Bose Gave a Speech in Japan Yesterday

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Asia General Headquarters welcomed Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India. A large lecture meeting was held at Hibiya Public Hall at 1:30 PM on the 3rd. First, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, advisor to the Imperial Rule Assistance Headquarters, delivered a speech on behalf of the organizers. Then, the Indian student association sang the "Free India" national anthem. Afterwards, Mr. Bose stood up and gave a speech entitled "India's Mission in the Decisive Stage," speaking in Japanese and filled with a conviction of victory and determination. The audience responded with thunderous applause. Afterwards, a commemorative gift presentation ceremony was held, and the meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM.

### Japanese Forces on Leyte Island Launch Courageous Attacks, Part of Enemy Force on Samar Island Makes Provocative Moves

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The operational situation of the Japanese Army on Leyte Island: The fighting on Leyte Island is becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese naval and ground forces in that area are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy day and night, and the situation is extremely heroic. The enemy landing forces on Leyte Island have gradually advanced from the south toward the Frontin to Tacloban line, expanding their foothold. At the same time, they are preparing the airfields in Tacloban and Tarac, attempting to use them as bases for launching air force operations. Therefore, Japanese aircraft units are constantly bombing them day and night, and are diligently searching for and attacking enemy aircraft arriving at those two airfields. The factor that will ultimately determine the war situation in that area is the presence or absence of air superiority. Recognizing this, Japanese aircraft are continuing to operate actively in order to secure air superiority in that area. In ground battles, Japanese forces are also pressing the enemy lines and launching courageous attacks. Especially in the Tacloban area, Japanese forces have formed commando units for hand-to-hand combat, waiting for opportunities to counterattack. On the other hand, the enemy has also dispatched a force of approximately one division, landing in the southern part of Leyte Island. Now the enemy on Leyte Island, including the two divisions at Tacloban and the two divisions at Tarac, has increased to a total of five divisions. In addition, part of the enemy force has landed on Samar Island and is also making provocative moves. In the Tacloban area, Japanese aircraft units also raided enemy airfields on the 31st, causing fires at five locations. On November 1st, they intercepted enemy B-24 aircraft, ultimately achieving the victory of shooting down eight enemy aircraft, thereby seizing air superiority on the battlefield. Although the enemy forces have suffered courageous attacks by Japanese forces, they are continuing to forcefully launch landing operations by virtue of their material strength, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Since the enemy forces have been using the Tacloban and Tarac airfields, the resistance of enemy aircraft has become increasingly fierce.

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces securing the strategic Leyte Island valley have been fiercely attacking enemy forces attacking from the Tagami area for days, inflicting heavy losses and destroying more than ten tanks. At the same time, they have captured two tanks in hand-to-hand combat and destroyed two 15cm mortars. The enemy forces have suffered heavy casualties but are still stubbornly attacking, disregarding their sacrifices. According to U.S. sources, the U.S. 7th Division attacking the Tagami area was trapped in a difficult battle in muddy trenches on the 27th and 28th, and the 96th Division also participated in the attack. The fighting in that area has been extremely intense since the landing. According to a U.S. broadcast on the 30th, the U.S. forces advanced along mountain roads under the cover of machine guns and artillery fire in the Harogato-Leyte Valley line on the 29th. At that time, Japanese forces suddenly emerged from the trenches and launched a daring charge. After six hours of fierce fighting, the U.S. forces were forced to retreat from the mountainous area.

Japanese Forces Fight Bravely on Morotai and Peleliu Islands

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – In the Morotai Island area of the Moluccas Islands, after an enemy force of approximately one division landed, the Japanese ground forces on the island immediately launched an interception attack. For the past five weeks, they have been appearing and disappearing unpredictably, using courageous hand-to-hand combat tactics to contain the enemy forces from expanding their territory, and constantly hindering the enemy forces' preparations, airfields, and aircraft formations, engaging in active and brave operations every day, causing the enemy to shiver with fear. However, the enemy is still actively establishing forward bases on Morotai and Peleliu Islands, using them as bases for attacking the Philippines, and advancing the air force and mobile air power of their bases in an attempt to seize air superiority in the Philippine theater of operations. However, the Japanese garrisons on both islands are currently displaying their spirit of resourcefulness and daring to fight, making every effort to contain the enemy's plans in that area, making considerable contributions to the operations in the Philippines. From the time of the enemy's landing until October 25th, the verified total combat results achieved by the Japanese garrison on Morotai Island were as follows: (1) Japanese forces killed or wounded approximately 1,500 enemy soldiers. (2) Enemy weapons destroyed or captured by Japanese forces included two 15cm cannons, one mortar, countless machine guns, artillery vehicles, communication equipment, ammunition, and medical supplies. In addition, 17 enemy headquarters barracks and several concealed fortifications were destroyed.

### East and West Lines of the East Asia Defense are Consolidated

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy U.S. forces gradually invaded westward in the Greater East Asia War, a rather serious situation temporarily emerged, but in the past three weeks, the allied Japanese forces' victory on Taiwan and the sweeping operations in Guangxi have not only completely swept away the sense of unease, but also strengthened our conviction of victory due to the great power displayed by the Japanese forces. Since the enemy U.S. forces successively invaded Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippines last month, attempting to directly attack the coast of mainland China and sever the connection between Japan and the South, the enemy forces have been given a fatal blow through the brave interception by the Japanese forces. Their 58th Mobile Task Force has almost been completely wiped out. Another reason for this adventurous westward invasion by the enemy U.S. forces was that Roosevelt wanted to use it as an election tool, and the Japanese forces were following the plan of luring the enemy deep and launching an offensive to thoroughly destroy the enemy. The terrain of the Philippines is complex, and the Japanese defenses are strong. It is not difficult to imagine that the enemy forces are venturing deep into the Japanese forces' hinterland, throwing themselves into a trap. Although they may try to send reinforcements in the future to relieve the siege, they have fallen into a dilemma due to the difficulty of replenishment. At the same time, the smooth progress of the Japanese operations on the mainland is sufficient to echo the naval battles in the Pacific. As for the mainland front, the Japanese forces have recently swept through key areas in Henan and Hunan, and have even broken into Guangxi. Guilin, its key strategic point, has been heavily surrounded and its fall is imminent. In this way, the Pinghan Line has been opened up, becoming a Great Wall for the defense of the mainland. The U.S. and Chongqing forces are completely powerless in the bases east of the Pingyuehan Line. Thus, looking at the overall situation on both the sea and land fronts, the inner line of defense in Greater East Asia has become extremely strong. Once Guilin falls today, the U.S. air force's power in mainland China will completely collapse. The recent resignation of Stilwell, the U.S. air force commander stationed in Chongqing, due to disagreements with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, further shows the anxiety within the enemy. Because the U.S. has suffered losses in both the Pacific and the mainland, it is trying to Americanize the Chongqing army, using the manpower and material resources of the Chongqing side in an attempt to reverse the decline. The viciousness of its conspiracy can be imagined. At this point, we should both grasp the current situation of the war with a calm and collected mind and strive in our respective positions with enthusiastic and excited emotions to win the final victory of the war.

### West African Forces Flee in Burma Border Forest Operations, Japanese Planes Bomb Myitkyina Airfield

Burma Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The enemy's 81st West African Division from the Arakan and Bonseba areas suddenly appeared on the 16th in the Mendo Mountain area between the Kaladan River and the Pi River, attempting to cut off the Japanese forces' rear. On the 22nd and 23rd, Japanese forces launched a preemptive attack, engaging in forest warfare with enemy forces several times their number. The enemy finally fled in disarray towards the Burma-India border, leaving behind 300 bodies and countless mortars and automatic rifles.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press correspondent stationed at the U.S. military headquarters in Chongqing, India, on the 2nd, Japanese planes conducted a night bombing raid on the Myitkyina airfield in northern Burma a few days ago, destroying several U.S. aircraft. Subsequently, several Japanese planes attacked for two consecutive nights, causing U.S. forces to take shelter in air raid bunkers at night.

### Use the Total Strength of East Asian Nations to Win the Final Victory, Broadcast by President Zhou and Minister Lin

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Executive Yuan President Zhou gave a broadcast speech yesterday (the 2nd) at 9:30 PM to commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. The main points are as follows:

The friendly relations between China and Japan have indeed been improving at all times in the past four years, but the solid foundation of mutual respect and mutual cooperation has been strengthened by the conclusion of the alliance treaty. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is a concrete manifestation of the determination of China and Japan to fight side by side and unite to defeat Britain and the United States, and it is also a guarantee of China's independence and freedom.

The Greater East Asia War has now entered the final decisive stage. China and Japan, in their allied position, should naturally have further cooperation and further assistance. In the current international situation, the two countries' relationship of shared interests, shared future, and shared destiny is particularly evident. Only by achieving the final victory in the Greater East Asia War can China's rejuvenation, Japan's prosperity, and the liberation of the entire Greater East Asia be achieved. Britain and the United States have not yet abandoned their aggressive designs on East Asia, and their remaining forces are still struggling. The Greater East Asia War cannot be resolved in the short term. We must, of course, continue to fight hard and continue to work hard, using the total strength of all East Asian nations to destroy the remaining power of Britain and the United States.

The Greater East Asia War has now begun the prelude to the decisive battle. The recent brilliant victories of allied Japan have laid the foundation for victory. The future of East Asian liberation is shining brightly. We believe that by this time next year, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely be achieved.

Minister Lin Broadcasts

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Minister of Propaganda Lin gave a broadcast speech on the 3rd on the theme of the efforts that should be made to commemorate the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, saying that the most important thing to strive for in the current war is to complete the war and ensure victory. The three key points instructed by the Chairman on New Year's Day last year: rectifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production, are all essential elements for winning the war, and are also the obligations that allied China should fulfill in participating in the war. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has already opened up an equal and free beginning, and we must maintain this beginning and make it progress day by day. Currently, we must strive to achieve the above three points in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Finally, for the sake of survival and independence, we are engaged in a desperate struggle. First, we must unite the people of the whole country and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from using China as a battlefield and scorching China. Second, we must unite all East Asian nations and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from having East Asians kill each other. Third, we must awaken all oppressed nations in the world and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from dividing the world again.

### Lieutenant General Kusunoki Issues a Statement

Beiping, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Beiping, Lieutenant General Kusunoki Takataka, met with the press corps for the first time at the ambassador's residence at 4:30 PM on the 2nd and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: Currently, the Japanese military has achieved great combat results in defeating Britain and the United States in China and the South Pacific. At the same time, all allied countries in Greater East Asia are contributing their total strength and sincerely cooperating to complete the war. Now, the entire Republic of China is making progress and helping to enhance its combat power, for which Japan is very grateful both officially and privately. This time, I am honored to be appointed as ambassador, and I deeply feel the importance of my mission and am determined to do my best. At the same time, I also firmly believe that the Chinese people will support me in order to meet the expectations of strengthening combat power in North China. No matter how the war situation changes, our determination will never change, and we will not allow any slackening for even a moment. Regarding various policies, the authorities have already made thorough plans, seeking opinions from all aspects in the locality, and officials and civilians will work together to complete the supreme mission entrusted to North China and complete the Greater East Asia War.

### General Mobilization of Youth, Promulgation of Movement Outline

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The General Headquarters of the China Youth Corps, based on the Second Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Conference held in our nation's capital last month, decided to launch a General Mobilization Movement for East Asian Youth to Practice Prosperity from December 8th of this year to January 9th, and has specially formulated the "Outline of the China Youth Practical Prosperity General Mobilization Movement Plan" and promulgated it to the corps headquarters of all provinces and cities nationwide for compliance.

### Chongqing Inside Story

Recently, the American magazine "Life" published a most interesting report on Chongqing. The author was a special correspondent for "Life" magazine, Serode Whyte, who previously served for five years on Far Eastern issues. We are excerpting this below (1) to understand the inside story of Chongqing, and (2) to recognize the collusion between the enemy Americans and Chongqing, for our readers' reference. Recently, inside the United States, this type of Chongqing criticism, with different approaches but similar themes, has become a trend, but this is one of the most pointed articles.

Local miscellaneous warlords, the traditionalist faction within the Chongqing regime, and the Chinese Communist Party have combined with each other for a common purpose, which in the past must be said to have failed. The constant friction within the Chongqing "War of Resistance" camp also meant that the United States could not avoid a considerable degree of responsibility. Many of the promises made by the United States to the Chongqing regime were not fully realized. The general situation in Chongqing today can be briefly described as blockade, inflation, and political impasse.

The blockade that Chongqing is suffering today is truly rare in modern history. Since the滇緬 Burma Road was blocked by Japan in the spring of 1942, the people of the "War of Resistance Zone" have been completely reliant on their own efforts, self-sufficient and self-sustaining. Before the blockade of the滇緬 Burma Road, China had more than 15,000 trucks, but currently only 5,000 remain, the rest having all become useless objects. The difference between these two figures represents the tragedy of Chongqing. The famines in Henan and Guangdong provinces meant that, without trucks, food relief from various places could not be transported. Starving corpses are everywhere, left for wild dogs to devour, and villagers have no choice but to take risks. As a result, factories are unable to obtain raw materials, which leads to the weakening of the central government's control over the provinces, and the gradual paralysis of domestic trade organizations.

The Chongqing Army looks malnourished

The Chongqing army can only rely on marching on foot. Sometimes, several divisions of troops have to march 2,500 kilometers. Seeing barefooted and malnourished soldiers marching around mountains on rocky and rugged roads, one cannot help but feel miserable. On the front lines, food supplies are completely absent, and soldiers often go without food all day. To obtain food from the people, soldiers sell their military blankets and huddle together at night in the mountains to defend against the cold. I know that one unit lost three-tenths of its entire troop strength during an 800-kilometer march. Among the remaining living soldiers, after examination by American doctors, 15 percent were found to be suffering from lung disease.

In addition, the economic blockade has almost made military production in Chongqing impossible. Even a look at the meager production of bullets will discourage British and American military experts.

Paper Money is Worthless

Chongqing's second major problem is inflation, and taxation has reached saturation. There are no industrial profits to replenish the national treasury. Therefore, Chongqing can only print paper money to support the war. Last year, Chongqing issued four billion yuan in paper money. Perhaps the same amount will have to be issued this year. This unlimited inflation has affected national morality. Corruption among Chinese officials and civilians under the Chongqing regime can be seen everywhere. Paper money has almost completely lost its value, so people no longer value money, nor do they want to save it.

The work of collecting taxes and conscripting young men from farmers is also fraught with darkness. If the relevant authorities can be bribed, young men can avoid conscription. Due to this inflationary situation, a peculiar phenomenon is indeed emerging in the war zone. In other words, strange transactions are taking place in the relatively stable areas of the war zone. These transactions, which involve importing medicines, clothing, and other necessities to Chongqing, are certainly a good thing, but Chongqing soldiers collude with unscrupulous merchants and profiteers to engage in smuggling for profit.

Inflation and economic blockade are all products of war. But the biggest political obstacle within Chongqing is not the issue of war responsibility. It is a true marvel, both ancient and modern, that no one is ever held responsible for Chongqing's defeats. The Kuomintang's implementation of high-pressure tactics within Chongqing is also difficult for those who have not been to Chongqing to imagine. In short, the general public hates the Kuomintang to the bone. Due to the severity of the Kuomintang's censorship system, magazines and newspapers can only publish after-dinner chats and the "official articles" handed down by the government. Major issues such as famine, political arrests, inflation, economic blockade, diplomacy, and important government figures are not allowed to be discussed by the people.

Popular Grievances are Rampant

Chiang Kai-shek himself certainly has many shortcomings, but he is still the leader of the Chongqing regime, and he is still surrounded by a group of flattering officials. The armies under Chiang Kai-shek's command are often reprimanded by the Allied powers (especially Britain and the United States), and the problem of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as the problem of famine, are all the most heartbreaking things. Chiang himself does a great deal. Even so, people still have countless grievances against him. The reason why he does not win the hearts of the people is very simple, whether it is due to the issue of in-kind taxation or the issue of farmer conscription. But this extreme dissatisfaction and anger is not dared to be expressed outwardly. Because the Chongqing regime is not a democratic country, they can only dare to be angry but not dare to speak.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Politics of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces

On the second of this month, the National Government ordered that Chen Qun, the governor of Jiangsu Province, be transferred to the position of President of the Examination Yuan, and that Ren Yuandao succeed him. Not long ago, Fu Shishuo, the governor of Zhejiang Province, was transferred to head the Ministry of Construction, and Xiang Zhengzhuang succeeded him. The sole reason and purpose for the changes of governors in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the Central District is, naturally, the expectation of a renewal and progress in the politics of the two provinces, which is beyond doubt.

When Chen Qun succeeded the late Governor Shi Qun of Jiangsu Province in September of last year, we repeatedly discussed the importance of the politics of Jiangsu Province on September 11, 12, and October 4, and offered our humble opinions. Upon re-examining them today, we deeply feel that what we said last year is still needed today, and in reviewing the progress and losses of Jiangsu Province's politics over the past year, we dare not hastily offer words of praise.

The opinions we offered to Jiangsu Province's politics last year were: (1) Central politics and local politics both have a need for innovation. The innovation of local politics should begin with Jiangsu, because Jiangsu Province, in all aspects, whether from a regional, political, economic, educational, or cultural perspective, occupies the most important position among all provinces in the country. From a regional perspective, it is where the capital is located, and the famous Eastern commercial port of Shanghai is also located in this province. From an economic perspective, the Jiangnan region has always been known as a prosperous area. From an educational and cultural perspective, this province is the most culturally rich and educationally developed area. Therefore, the political measures of Jiangsu Province have a model role among all provinces in the country, and also have a mutually supportive relationship with the central government's politics. (2) From now on, Jiangsu Province's politics absolutely needs expert politics and the elimination of bureaucratic politics. The content of modern politics, from decision-making to the execution process, requires the use and handling of scientific thinking at all times and in all places, emphasizing time and striving for efficiency, which is by no means something that bureaucracy, perfunctory handling, can cope with. (3) Start local self-government work as soon as possible, establish public opinion organs, raise the people's awareness of participation in politics, and promote the integration of the government and the people. (4) Abolish local exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and reduce the burden on farmers.

From the principle that political status quo either advances or retreats, maintaining the status quo is failure. The absence of achievements means that the people's suffering has not been eliminated. The past provincial administration, at most, merely maintained the status quo, and there was no talk of achievements. Now that the governor has been changed, there should naturally be a new spirit. In addition to providing the above opinions, we offer the following views on personnel issues:

(1) The employment of personnel must absolutely adopt the principle of talent. We believe that anyone who cannot employ talent is definitely not a talented person himself; anyone who is a talented person himself will definitely be able to employ talent.

(2) For recommendations and solicitations from all aspects, it is necessary to have the courage to eliminate personal feelings, and completely select people based on merit, not to establish positions based on people.

(3) The county is the basic level of local politics, and the selection of county heads is extremely important. Raise their authority, increase their treatment, and carefully weigh their qualifications and performance.

(4) The first step for local troops must be to avoid disturbing the people, and only then can they maintain law and order. Troops that disturb the people will definitely not be able to protect the people; troops that protect the people will definitely not disturb the people, which is an unchanging principle.

Ren Yuandao is a native of Jiangsu, and Xiang Zhizhuang is a native of Zhejiang. We do not hold regional views and advocate that Jiangsu people govern Jiangsu and Zhejiang people govern Zhejiang, but from the perspective of serving their hometowns and being more familiar with local conditions, we express our earnest expectations for Ren and Xiang. Especially in the current tense decisive battle stage of the Greater East Asia War, we most need to contribute our combat power. At the same time, with the Communist bandits lurking in the peaceful areas, plotting to launch attacks at any time and in any place, it is the most urgent time for local officials to exhaust their efforts and dedicate their lives to the country. We hope that Ren and Xiang, who bear the heavy responsibility of military and political affairs, will seize this good opportunity to serve the country.

### The Japanese Army Encircles Guilin City in a Semi-Circle, Fierce Fighting Unfolds at Both North and South Railway Stations

Central News Agency, Guangxi Front, 3rd Dispatch: The Japanese army is pressing directly on Guilin City and, as of the evening of the 1st, has encircled Guilin City in a semi-circle from the rocky mountain area northwest of the city to the area of General Jiang's Islet (on the right bank of Guilin) (this area is 3 kilometers from Guilin). At this moment, they are actively tightening the encirclement, and have dispatched powerful units to Yanshan Market. Another contingent of the Japanese army, after defeating the 38th Army of the Chongqing forces, has arrived at Ertang Market via the northwest of Gongcheng (location of the 26th Army Headquarters of the Chongqing forces, 18 kilometers east of Pingle). Consequently, the 131st Division, the 170th Division, and a portion of the 79th Army of the 31st Army of the Chongqing forces, which are desperately defending Guilin, are now in a situation akin to being rats in a bag.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities announced that the Chongqing troops garrisoning Guilin are currently engaged in fierce fighting at both the north and south railway stations. In the northwestern suburbs, it has been impossible to stop the advance of the Japanese army.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission issued a war report on the 1st, acknowledging that the Japanese army has advanced on Guilin from the east, west, and northeast. The original dispatch is as follows: 1. The Japanese army has advanced to the Chongqing defensive positions on the outer edges of Guilin. A portion of the Japanese army forcibly crossed the Guijiang River on the 30th and arrived at the North Railway Station north of Guilin City on the 31st. Fierce fighting has now broken out at the North Railway Station. Another unit of the Japanese army crossed the Xiangjiang River at Daxu Town and launched an attack. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Yet another unit is approaching the eastern side of Guilin from Lingshuitang and has arrived near Weibei Village in the suburbs of Guilin (1.5 kilometers from the suburbs of Guilin).

### Deep Expectations for Ren Yuandao as Governor of Jiangsu

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 3rd Dispatch: At the 141st meeting of the Central Consultative Council, Chen Qun of Jiangsu Province was approved as President of the Examination Yuan. All sectors of the province expressed deep regret because Governor Chen had been in charge of Jiangsu for more than a year and had achieved a good political reputation. At the same time, Ren Yuandao taking over as governor of Jiangsu was universally welcomed. It is generally believed that the new Governor Ren has long served as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Front Army, and the units under his command are mostly stationed in various key locations in Jiangsu Province, shouldering the responsibility of defending the local area. This time, Ren concurrently serves as the Pacification Commissioner while being the governor, so in the future, the operation of both the military and political sides will certainly be able to exert its effectiveness even more. Therefore, in Jiangsu Province, the birthplace of the countryside clearing, the countryside clearing work will also have a more rapid progress. Moreover, with the guarantee of security, the work of increasing production can also be smoothly promoted. Therefore, the people of Jiangsu Province have deep expectations for the promotion of the unification of military and political policies after the new Governor Ren takes office.

### Nelson to Visit Chongqing Again

### Chiang Kai-shek Actively Prepares to Deal with the Communists

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: Since Stilwell's return to the country, the conflict between Chongqing and the United States has intensified. British and American news agencies have seized the opportunity to launch a major attack on the Chongqing side. A Reuters New Delhi correspondent reported on the 31st that the US government is not satisfied with its cooperation with Chongqing. Therefore, Roosevelt has specially dispatched Nelson and Hurley to Chongqing to discuss the issue of Chongqing's cooperation in the fight against the Axis forces. Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly accepted the US demands, but for the sake of appearances, he asked Roosevelt to recall General Stilwell, and gave many reasons for the blame. The US side said that Stilwell's return to the country this time, and the reasons listed by Chiang, could not be announced due to military secrets. However, in view of the facts, the internal division of the Chongqing regime in the past few years has been very large. The United States did not announce it, believing that there were two reasons: first, Chongqing adopted a censorship system, and second, it believed that the chaos in Chongqing would soon return to its original state. However, this kind of chaos increased day by day, and finally led to Stilwell's recall. According to those who came to New Delhi from Chongqing last spring, the weapons and lend-lease goods imported from the United States to Chongqing were not used for the war against Japan. Chongqing prepared to engage in a civil war, so all of them were collected. Now, a million Chongqing troops are deployed in northern China to guard against the Communist Party. Therefore, the Chongqing army only nominally resists the Japanese army in various battlefields, while the powerful figures in the Chongqing regime manipulate the financial foreign exchange market and enrich their own pockets. We reporters know this situation very well, but in the past, we could not report this kind of news at will. As for the Kuomintang regime led by Chiang Kai-shek, it believes that the inevitable civil war in the future is more important than the war against Japan, and is always prepared to prevent 800,000 Chinese Communists. I have served in the China-Burma-India front for about two years, and I know very well that Chiang's current task is to fight against the Chinese Communist Party. There is no democracy in Chongqing, and there is still no perfect dictatorship. If the Kuomintang regime says that there is no freedom of speech in Chongqing, it is not an exaggeration.

### President Roosevelt's Campaign Speech

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: President Roosevelt delivered a campaign broadcast speech from the White House. The content did not strictly refute Dewey's attacks on him, but focused on military and political issues. He said that the progress of the war and the organization of peace are still proceeding along the original path. Only in this way can the war be ended quickly and the sacrifice of manpower and materials be reduced. The United States should take the leading position in the work of peace building. If we allow the Republican Party to turn peace into a partisan dispute, then both large and small countries will be disappointed.

### Battle for the Hungarian Capital Unfolds with Tank Warfare, Soviet Offensive Intensifies on the Slovak Border

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd Dispatch: Between the rivers south of Budapest, the German and Soviet armies have concentrated their main forces in the 特勃萊森 Tebleissen area and are engaged in a major tank battle. Furthermore, the highway between the Nagykoros district Cegled and 開赤開美特 Kecskemet seems to have been cut off, and the battle to capture Budapest has entered a critical situation that is not optimistic.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch: The battle of 奥资 Aozi and 普莱斯柯林—伐诺特 Plesscolin-Fanot on the Eastern Front reached its peak on the 6th. The enemy's reinforcements in the entire area from 杜柯姆 Dukum to 里巴 Riba continued to attack fiercely, but they still failed to break through. The battle on the Slovak border revealed the enemy's ambition to seize eastern Slovakia. The enemy's flanking actions west of the Dukla Pass and around Ingvar have become increasingly apparent. The German army continued to disengage in the central part of the 蓝河 Blue River, unhindered by the enemy, and occupied favorable positions south of the Slovak border. There was fierce fighting between the Danube and the Tisa rivers. The enemy launched a fierce attack from the索尔诺克—巴雅 Solnok-Baja area, aiming at Budapest, which caused a tank war to break out.

German Troops in Greece Retreating North

German troops in Greece continued to retreat, abandoning Salonica in order to assist in the battle in Hungary. The Red Army and guerrillas in Croatia attempted to obstruct them.

### Molotov Will Be Stalin's Successor

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, Moscow news from the Associated Press: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has recently undergone major changes. He used to dislike alcohol, but now he likes it. He is particularly cautious and respectful in front of Stalin. Whenever Stalin gives instructions, Molotov must rush to carry them out. Molotov's political position has recently become very stable. People in Moscow believe that if Stalin dies, the person appointed as leader will definitely be Molotov.

### German Troops Fight Hard to Block the Enemy in the Lower Reaches of the Meuse River, Isolated Troops on Walcheren Island Continue to Resist

Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch: In northwestern Brabant, the anti-Axis forces continue to exert strong pressure on the last defensive positions of the German army south of 荷兰许狄普 Netherlands' Xidipp and in the lower reaches of the Meuse River. However, General Montgomery could not quickly occupy the bridges of 摩尔狄杰克 Moerdijk, 莱姆唐克维尔 Leim Tonkville and 凯士维尔 Kersville, and had the ability to prevent the German 15th Army from retreating between the Meuse and Waal rivers. Therefore, he had to concentrate his troops to cross the river. However, there is still a German bridgehead south of the river. The defense of the Meuse River bridgehead by the German army is quite active. Therefore, the future of the British and Canadian forces' frontal attack on 荷兰许狄普及 Netherlands' Xidipp and the lower reaches of the Meuse River is still not bright. Therefore, General Montgomery can only break through westward from the Nijmegen bridgehead, or use a large number of airborne troops to fight in the rear. Although the current situation is relatively unimportant, the number of anti-Axis forces restrained is very large. At present, the enemy army has entered the弗勒欣 Floshin River and its port, but the port has been completely destroyed. The German defenders of Walcheren Island, although subjected to the pressure of superior enemy forces, continue to resist with the fighting spirit of the German defenders in Saint-Malo, Calais, and other places.

### Germany's Belief in Victory Will Never Waver

Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the latest issue of the German Weekly that so far, the war has not been won or lost. Only the last battle can determine the outcome. The leaders of the countries that surrendered to Bolshevism all came from the bourgeoisie and did not gain the trust and support of their people. Therefore, they were unable to stop the spiritual collapse of their people. The most determined country can win because it is willing to sacrifice everything for the doctrine it is fighting for. Germany is this kind of country. Therefore, victory and defeat are both in its hands, and it is free to choose.

### Soviet Union Accuses Romanian Government of Violating Armistice Agreement

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet government issued a statement through TASS, strongly criticizing the Romanian government for violating the terms of the armistice agreement. The gist of the statement is that during the war, Romanian troops transported a large number of machines from Okerland and Bessarabia. The armistice conditions stipulated the return of these looted machines, but the Romanian government concealed the facts and refused to return them. The armistice conditions also stipulated the purging of state organs, which the Romanian government also delayed implementing. Although Romania has arrested 500 Fascist party members responsible for the war, members of the Iron Guard faction still occupy important positions in state organs, engaging in anti-Soviet activities.

It is expected that a truly peace-guaranteeing organization cannot be created in the foreseeable future.

### Police Bureau Cracks Down on Flammable and Explosive Hazardous Materials to Maintain Order and Prevent Unfortunate Incidents

Regarding the implementation of the crackdown on flammable and explosive hazardous materials, the police authorities issued the following statement:

As per the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau's announcement today, starting from November 6th (Monday), a crackdown on flammable and explosive hazardous materials will be implemented. Regarding hazardous materials, it is normally necessary to seriously crack down on them to maintain public order, and especially during wartime, they should be thoroughly cracked down on. Now that enemy planes are repeatedly attacking the Shanghai area, in order to complete the air defense work and prevent unfortunate incidents caused by explosive and flammable hazardous materials, it is a natural countermeasure to implement this crackdown measure. The purpose of the crackdown, as mentioned earlier, is to ensure the security of the city, not to carry out compulsory purchase. However, based on the results of the investigation, depending on the storage location, the structure of the storage place, and the amount of storage, the dangerous items may be ordered to be moved or dispersed in order to prevent dangerous incidents from occurring in emergencies. We hope that all sectors will understand this point.

Furthermore, those who own or are entrusted with the care of the hazardous materials specified in the announcement should, regardless of the quantity or their occupation, obtain an application form from the nearest economic police team under the Economic Security Office within the specified period and complete the registration. The registration procedure is the same as in the past.

This crackdown is different from general commodity registration. Those who fail to register will be severely punished according to the law, and the stored hazardous materials will be confiscated. Please refer to the announcement and do not violate it.

### Director Gu of the Baojia Office Talks About Improving Baojia Administration at Yesterday's Regular Press Conference

Gu Jiwu, director of the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, attended the 26th regular press conference of the Municipal Government Propaganda Office at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 3rd), met with reporters from various newspapers in the city. Liang Xiuyu, director of the Propaganda Office, also arrived on time with Secretary Pan Bide. Director Liang delivered a speech, followed by Director Gu answering the questions raised by reporters in detail until 12:00 noon.

Obtaining Forms is Free (1) The Baojia shares of various branches in the city sometimes claim that the superiors have not yet issued them when citizens go to purchase movement certificates, and temporarily refuse to sell them, resulting in delays of several weeks. Has the Baojia Office heard anything about this matter, and what remedies are available if it is discovered again in the future? (Answer) Regarding the issue of requesting movement certificates, before June of this year, the request for movement certificates and reports had already been subject to a fee, which was directly submitted by the branches to the Baojia Office and then transferred to the Accounting Office of the First District Office. Since the merger of police administration in the city after June, the fee for various forms in the branches has been collected by the General Affairs Office and then transferred to the Municipal Government General Accounting Office. As for the situation of lack of application forms two weeks ago, the matter has passed. Initially, due to budget reasons, there were some delays in printing, which caused a lot of rumors. Later, this office immediately sought remedial measures to meet the urgent needs, and first raised funds for printing, which were successively allocated to various district branches to meet the needs of citizens. Therefore, in terms of supply, there should be no problems. Originally, the regulations for charging fees for applications for movement, birth, death, etc., require residents to pay the prescribed handling fee and issue a receipt after completing the procedures. It is not necessary to pay when requesting the form in the first place. If there are any corrupt practices in various places, this office will definitely issue a notice to investigate and ensure that they are eradicated.

Plans to Improve the Organization of Self-Defense (2) The Winter Defense issue is more important than before. Does the Baojia Office have any predetermined plans on how to assist the Baojia Self-Defense Corps in Winter Defense work? (Answer) As the beginning of winter approaches, measures for winter defense are extremely important. The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters also feels deeply about this. Since its establishment on September 9th of this year, the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters has been actively investigating the work of Self-Defense Corps members who are serving or exempt from service. All men aged 18 to 45 must be investigated one by one. This work has not yet been completed. After it is completed, those who are exempt from service will be sorted out separately. The past Self-Defense Corps was based on each branch as a unit, and there was a lack of joint defense. In order to establish a concrete plan for the people's self-defense, it is necessary to conduct a widespread investigation to avoid the drawbacks of each serving in the same post, and to correct the appearance. After the investigation of the Self-Defense Corps members in each district is completed, the Headquarters will give them a concrete organization, which includes three types: (1) Establishing model members, targeting knowledgeable youths, to cultivate self-defense and air defense instructors, and serving in each district. The selection of model members is borne by the knowledgeable youths in each district. (2) Establishing basic members, planning to select strong and healthy people for training in major stores, factories, schools, and families with large populations in the city, with the principle of more service, and providing them with living benefits. Unemployed youths and youths who have not yet been employed should also be organized into basic members. In short, basic members who have basic knowledge can participate to strengthen the basic lineup. (3) The establishment of reserve members is to consider the convenience of the general managers of major companies, banks, money shops, and shopkeepers. Because of their position and business, they feel inconvenienced in fact, and they are responsible for internal affairs and economics, with the principle of assisting the locality. Therefore, the organization of reserve members is carefully reviewed. The general ordinary corps members are the self-defense corps members who serve and patrol at ordinary times. In the future, the organization of members and the expenditure of various expenses have been greatly improved compared to July and August, which is more convenient.

Supervise Branches to Improve Services (3) Citizens apply for residence permits. Although the Baojia authorities have repeatedly ordered police station staff to provide citizens with various conveniences, in fact it is still very troublesome, especially for illiterate people. They often ask people to fill in their names, ages, and continuations, which are often inconsistent, and they often have to go back and forth again and again, and still cannot get them. It is hoped that the Baojia Office will seek to improve this as soon as possible, or order the police station staff to provide detailed guidance.

(Answer) This office specializes in Baojia work, with the principle of serving the people, which is the work between the people and the police. All levels of Baojia organizations are folk organizations, while the Baojia shares of various branches are police station organizations. When this office is implementing Baojia administration, the police station distributes orders to the various shares, and the personnel of the various shares are selected by the General Affairs Office of the police station. As for the corrupt practices, the Inspectorate is responsible for them, while this office provides instructions and commands on the matters in charge. Recently, Director Chen has stipulated that the various shares of the various branches should be closely linked in terms of affairs by the competent offices. Therefore, this office will closely supervise the contact and command of the Baojia shares of the various branches in the future, and its work will be improved, and the responsibility of this office will definitely be worthy of the expectations of you and the residents of the districts under your jurisdiction.

### Central Reserve Bank Inspection of Gold Begins to Strengthen Financial Institutions and Increase the Review of Loans

The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Business Inspection Office, entrusted with strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai, has drafted implementation guidelines in accordance with the provisions of the strengthening outline promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and notified the various financial institutions to comply with them. Financial institutions whose daily deposit amount is less than the prescribed amount must go through the procedures for increasing capital or merging and reorganizing before March 21, 1945, otherwise they will be ordered to suspend business according to law if they exceed the time limit. As for loan business, it must be applied for and approved before it can be undertaken. In order to strictly handle the review of applications for loans from financial institutions, an audit section has been added under the review team, which is responsible for handling the application for approval of loan business from various financial institutions, and carefully inspecting the 30% deposit payment reserve. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry, more than 70% of the financial institutions in the city need to go through the procedures for increasing capital. Because the Ministry of Finance stipulates a five-month time limit for increasing capital, the various financial institutions can prepare to enrich their organization.

### Overtime Business Will Be Permanently Suspended from Electricity Supply and Several Stores Have Been Fined

In order to control electricity consumption, the municipal authorities limit the business hours of various industries. Ordinary stores and various stalls must close at 7:00 PM, entertainment venues must close at 10:00 PM every night, and all lights must be turned off at 11:00 PM. Residents must turn off all lights after 12:00 PM. However, it has been found that there are still those who despise the law and do not comply with the specified time, especially in the Old Zhabei and Taishan districts of Huangpu, where entertainment venues are concentrated. The various branches have been strictly supervised and managed, ordering various stores and entertainment venues and other special businesses to strictly comply. Those who violate it for the first time will be warned, and those who violate it again will have their electricity supply suspended according to the regulations and will never be restored. A number of stores and entertainment venues have been subjected to this power outage penalty.

### Business Directory Extends Its Publication Announcement

The "Shanghai Business Directory" compiled and printed by this newspaper was originally scheduled to be published at the end of October. Due to slight delays in printing and binding, the publication date will inevitably be slightly delayed. We hope that those who have pre-ordered will understand. - Shen Bao Newspaper Office

### Major Shioda Expresses the Japanese Army's Conviction of Victory and Determination to Annihilate the British and American Fleets

The Allied land, sea, and air news authorities jointly met with the Shanghai Chinese Newspaper Reporters' Association at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 3rd). Major Shioda of the Fleet News Department expressed the Japanese fleet's determination to annihilate the British and American fleets in the Pacific. The record of his speech is as follows:

Painfully Strike the Remaining Enemy Fleet Since October 12th to November 2nd, an average of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters war report has been released every day, and every time it is released, the Japanese army has achieved major war results. Therefore, the enemy's Pacific Fleet has been almost completely wiped out. However, we are still not satisfied with this great war result. We must completely destroy the enemy's Pacific Fleet and the British Fleet in the Indian Ocean, because their existence is an obstacle to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Combined Fleet is now waiting for an opportunity to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop. Another part of the Combined Fleet is pursuing the remaining enemy forces in the seas east of Leyte and the Philippines. This first operation has ended, and we are preparing for the second operation. If the remaining enemy American and British fleets can exist, it will prolong the Greater East Asia War. At present, we predict that the enemy still has several battleships and three or four aircraft carriers remaining.

Enemy Troops on Leyte Are Besieged on All Sides The enemy intends to establish an air base on Leyte, using New Guinea, Hawaii, and other places as a supply of air power, but the remaining one or two aircraft carriers are likely to be annihilated in one or two days. Although the enemy has increased a division of troops on Leyte (the enemy now has five divisions of troops on Leyte), all sides are blocked and besieged on all sides, and they are extremely uneasy. On the contrary, the right to control the sea and the air is now in the hands of Japan, and the enemy has no way to reverse the decline.

Strengthen Unity and Protect East Asia Together At present, the center will shift from the Philippines to Morotai and Peleliu, because the Japanese forces are not attacking the Philippines alone, but attacking Morotai and Peleliu separately, which indicates that the Japanese offensive has changed. The US presidential election period is approaching day by day, and Roosevelt is extremely anxious about this. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably carry out air raids on Japan using the air force in the Saipan and mainland China areas, which is really expected. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, we should work harder together and allow to strengthen the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, so that any difficulties can be overcome.

### Conversation with Japanese Christian Leader Kagawa

Kagawa Toyohiko, a well-known national Japanese Christian leader, stated when he met with reporters yesterday: Only through international cooperation in the economic, social, scientific, political, and educational spheres can permanent peace be maintained. Japan has a cooperative system in all aspects of life, so even if it lasts for 30 centuries, the United States will not be able to conquer Japan. This also proves that world cooperation can maintain permanent peace. It is foolish for the United States to want to restore the League of Nations after the war. The first League of Nations failed because it completely omitted the factor of economic cooperation, and the second League of Nations will also fail for the same reason, which is very obvious. Japan's resources are not as good as those of the United States, but because of its economic cooperation system, it has been able to fight for three years, making it impossible for the United States to conquer Japan. It is also wrong for the United States to think that Japan is backward in science. Japan has made great achievements in heavy industry. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, many people did not understand Japan's heart to fight for the liberation of East Asia, but since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, it has evolved into a war to liberate the nations of East Asia. Even if the European War ends, Japan will continue to fight to liberate East Asia. Roosevelt and Churchill have failed to practice Christian doctrine, and Japanese Christians are deeply ashamed of this.

### Police Bureau Strictly Cracks Down on "Black Hat Racket" at Train Station, Sends Plainclothes Officers to Station for Investigation

The Xihongkou Branch of the City Police Bureau, which is in charge of the police affairs of the North Railway Station, has recently received confidential reports that "black hats" often cause trouble for passengers, or fraudulently demand money under the pretext of checking whether tickets were purchased from the black market, or even refuse ticket-holding passengers to board the train under the pretext that the train is full. The police authorities are very indignant about this situation. Director Sun of the branch ordered his subordinates to go to the station in plain clothes to investigate. If there are any of the above-mentioned illegal acts, they will be cracked down on. If passengers encounter extortion or fraud, they can report to the patrolling police, or note the name on the left chest of the "black hat" and report it to the branch.

### Reply Again

Regarding the matter of the living subsidies for teachers and staff collected by this newspaper on behalf of Mr. Xu Chengqing and others on August 13, we have received another letter from Mr. Xu and others. We will reply again as follows: After the original collection of subsidies by this newspaper ended, we repeatedly requested that it be transferred to the authorities. The authorities then asked us to keep it temporarily. At that time, the Police Consumers' Cooperative went to Wuhu to buy rice, so we entrusted them to buy it. Later, because some people in the cooperative could not agree to it, the matter was abandoned. This newspaper then repeatedly sent letters to the Education Bureau to transfer the funds. On September 29, the Education Bureau sent someone to pick up the funds, totaling 1,032,500 yuan. After that, sporadic donations were transferred as soon as they arrived. Please supervise. - Shen Bao Newspaper Office

### Opinions on Rectifying Abuses at Four Stations

— Han Ruo

Because of the reduction in train schedules and carriages, the average traveler sees train travel as a path of thorns. The difficulty in purchasing tickets, the arbitrary and overbearing behavior of station and train staff, and extortion are unprecedented even during wartime. These past occurrences are frequently seen. The highest authorities of China Railway (Hua Tie) are determined to rectify the situation, and the general public eagerly awaits reforms. However, concrete and effective methods of rectification and reform have yet to be implemented, and travelers continue to be exploited as before. Indeed, this is intensifying. A crucial national transportation system is controlled by a few unscrupulous individuals who use it as a tool for personal gain, while the responsible authorities are unable to rectify or eliminate this, allowing these bad practices to spread. I believe China Railway and the Ministry of Construction are hardly blameless.

Currently, travelers find three issues most troublesome: (1) difficulty in purchasing tickets, (2) difficulty in entering the station and boarding the train even with a ticket, and (3) being harassed by train staff even if one manages to board. If we calmly examine the three sufferings endured by travelers, the railway authorities have more difficulty handling the first issue. The other two issues are personnel management problems for the railway bureau, and outsiders can hardly intervene. Regarding the first issue, the difficulty in buying tickets is due to the current wartime conditions, which has reduced the supply of railway materials and made the manufacture of carriages and locomotives difficult. Simultaneously, military transport and the shipment of goods take precedence over passenger transport. As a result, carriages and schedules have decreased, while the number of travelers has not decreased but increased. This leads to a state of supply falling short of demand. With many needing it and few supplying it, the value naturally increases. This is an irrefutable economic principle that can be attributed to environmental circumstances, and neither the travelers nor the railway authorities are at fault. However, for the second and third issues, the railway bureau seems to bear full responsibility for the unreasonable oppression suffered by travelers. A traveler who has purchased a ticket has already acquired the right to board the train. If the ticket is not a forgery, even if purchased on the black market, the passenger should be allowed to board. However, ticket examiners at the entrance deliberately make things difficult for passengers and extort money. Station staff maintaining order abuse passengers, forcibly check identification, and extort money on various pretexts, and so on. After managing to pass through the entrance, boarding the train also requires enduring abuse from train staff, who block the door, push, obstruct, scold, and demand bribes in every possible way, preying on the weak. One cannot board unless one satisfies their desires.

We believe that the railway authorities should bear full responsibility for all disturbances from the entrance to the destination, except for matters related to police affairs. This is due to the poor personnel management and inadequate service education of the railway bureau. Only by introspecting, restraining oneself, strengthening personnel management, and vigorously implementing service education can travelers be spared unnecessary suffering. Therefore, we would like to offer the following points to the railway authorities for reference:

(1) Rationalize the living conditions and treatment of employees: The authorities should first pay attention to whether the provision of living expenses for employees is reasonable. The railway bureau should first understand the living conditions of its employees and then adjust them to be rational.

(2) Strengthen personnel management: Pay special attention to strict performance evaluations and the implementation of rewards and punishments. In addition, revise and refine service regulations, and continuously promote service education to improve the service ethics of railway employees.

(3) Supervisory system: The supervisory system occupies an important position in police administration. Diligent and devoted supervisors who prevent collusion are very effective. If the railway administration has such an organization, it should be strengthened. If it has not been established, it may as well be established to rigorously supervise and inspect service employees so that those who neglect their duties have something to fear.

(4) Reward the reporting of misconduct: The railway bureau should post notices prominently in stations and on trains, indicating not only the procedures that passengers should follow, but also specifying where those who have been harassed can report and be rewarded so that passengers are happy to report any illegal mistreatment they receive.

We believe that the above four points address both the symptoms and the root causes. If the railway authorities resolutely implement them with a spirit of introspection and self-discipline, the benefits to travelers will be significant.
