### Establishment of the New Japanese Cabinet

— Chen Bin

Q: There are many rumors circulating about the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan. What is the truth?

A: There are mainly three kinds of rumors circulating about the Japanese cabinet reshuffle:

The first is the mistaken belief that the current cabinet reshuffle in Japan is due to the recent fall of Saipan. In fact, this is just a coincidence in timing, because the loss of Saipan is not of great military significance. It would be an exaggeration to reshuffle the cabinet because of a small island.

The second rumor is the mistaken belief that internal conflicts have arisen within Japan. This is even more inconsistent with the facts. Because of the recent success of the army's operations on the mainland, the naval operations in the Pacific have been greatly strengthened. At the same time, the heroic defense of Saipan is a crystallization of the loyalty and patriotism of the Japanese army and navy. Today, the formation of a cooperative cabinet by General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy is enough to shatter this kind of rumor.

The third rumor is the mistaken belief that the current cabinet reshuffle in Japan will bring about changes in military, political, and diplomatic policies. However, please listen to the inaugural broadcast of the Japanese behind-the-scenes cabinet, and you can fully understand the absurdity of this rumor.

Q: Then, what is the real significance of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle?

A: Simply put, it is just to meet the needs of the decisive stage of the international and East Asian war situation.

It has been two and a half years since the Greater East Asia War began. Under the leadership of the Tojo cabinet, the unprecedented military victories have been known to the world. The gains are particularly evident in the implementation of the new policy toward China, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which are undeniable achievements in uniting the 1 billion people of East Asia and establishing a new order in Greater East Asia.

Recently, the enemy America is trying to salvage its lost popular support. Roosevelt is also preparing for his fourth presidential election. In order to win popular support, they are sparing no effort to take risks and invade the Japanese mainland, from the sneak attack on the Marshall Islands to the landing on Saipan, which shows the enemy's anxiety. Therefore, the war has now entered a decisive stage. In order to refresh people's minds and adapt to the situation, the Tojo cabinet resolutely resigned from the position of Prime Minister and made way for capable people. Therefore, a cooperative cabinet of the army, navy, and people was formed to shoulder the historical mission of determining the fate of all people in Greater East Asia.

Q: Will the new Japanese cabinet revise the policy platform of the Tojo cabinet in order to shoulder this historical mission?

A: We must recognize that the Greater East Asia War, which was launched based on the spirit of Japan's basic national policy of "Hakko Ichiu," will certainly be insisted upon until complete victory. Therefore, the new cabinet will also combine the strength of the military and the people to expand the achievements of the Tojo cabinet. The most important thing, of course, will be the closer cooperation between the army and the navy, especially the cooperation between the financial community and outstanding talents from the private sector, which is the biggest feature of the new cabinet. At the same time, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's concurrent position as Minister of Greater East Asia will certainly continue to promote the diplomatic policy of the Tojo cabinet, and there will be an expectation to thoroughly realize the "Greater East Asia Joint Declaration."

Q: What is the prospect of the relationship between the new Japanese cabinet and China?

A: The most encouraging thing for our country, both in the government and among the public, about the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet is that the new cabinet members are figures expected by our country, both in the government and among the public, and many of them are celebrities in the military, political, economic, and cultural circles who are familiar with China and understand China and have shown extraordinary enthusiasm for China in the past.

We have always believed that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for all East Asian nations. We must use the power of unity of all East Asian nations to carry out the war in order to ensure victory. In particular, the unity of the two major nations of China and Japan is even more important. In short, without Japan's success in its policy toward China, there will be no final victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we firmly believe that the new Japanese cabinet will make greater efforts to implement the policy toward China during the Tojo cabinet era and help us fully realize freedom, independence, and reconstruction. However, the most important thing for this great cause is our independent efforts, which depend on the thorough reform of our government.

Therefore, in addition to feeling particularly that our country should assume the mission that a participating country should bear at this decisive stage, we sincerely hope that the National Government will have further and more thorough reforms, and like Japan, have a more sound personnel system and close cooperation between the military, government, officials, and people to become a strong national government, working together to achieve the overall goal of winning the Greater East Asia War and liberating the East Asian nations.

### Thoroughly Strengthen Military and Political Affairs to Complete the Greater East Asia War: New Japanese Cabinet Members Express Important Beliefs

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – New Prime Minister Koiso met with the cabinet press corps for the first time at the Prime Minister's official residence at 7:30 p.m. on the 22nd, and answered the reporters' questions in detail. He elaborated on the following two points in particular, indicating the new cabinet's future policy in handling various government affairs. In order to win the final victory of the war, it is most important to make the spirit of the whole nation clear and broad-minded. Therefore, the "Great Harmony and Unity" of the Yamato race is absolutely necessary. Only in this way can we achieve the most and increase our will to fight. It is necessary for the commander and the government to cooperate closely during wartime. Without the commander, there is no government. Therefore, when carrying out government affairs, we should clarify the direction of the commander and grasp the national policy.

### Prime Minister Explains Key Points of Administration

The following is a record of the Q&A with reporters: (Q) What is the fundamental policy for national administration in this decisive stage? (A) Enhancing the will to fight and increasing production are the conclusions of this discussion, which means combining both the spiritual and material aspects. We, the Japanese people, all deeply understand the will of God. Therefore, whenever the country is in trouble, we can all abandon our personal grievances and unite strongly. This is truly a good point of us Japanese people. However, when uniting strongly, we must first enhance the nation's clear and broad-minded spirit and increase our combat power in an atmosphere of harmony. This is the basis of the spirit. In terms of material aspects, we must ensure the minimum level of national life. At the same time, government officials and the people must cooperate to enhance the nation's spirit of harmony and eliminate the inertia of the past, so that we can thoroughly understand the foundation of the nation. This should not only be done in education, but also in social organizations such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which is the best organization to achieve this goal. The concrete policy to ensure the national life is the production of goods. After the goal of increasing production is achieved, the harvest should be distributed appropriately. (Q) What is the specific method of command and national administration for the new cabinet? (A) Japan is now in a harsh state of war, so government affairs cannot but belong to the command. In other words, the command includes the form of national administration and the Bank of Japan. To promote government affairs, we must recognize this point. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the existing Government-Command Liaison Conference and make it more substantial, so that the leadership of the war and the war and national administration are united. (Q) In order to cope with the world war situation, how will you promote diplomacy with the Soviet Union? (A) We will be good at diplomacy with Germany and the Soviet Union, and insist on the close and friendly alliance relationship as always, observe the war situation, and promote the completion of the war. This does not need to be said by me. We will be good at diplomacy, maintain the friendly relationship that has been maintained so far, and continue to eliminate all unpleasantness between the two sides, to prevent it from happening. As for neutral countries, we will also maintain friendly relations in both material and spiritual aspects from beginning to end. Especially for the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, we want to have a close relationship without any regrets.

### Promoting Good Neighborly Diplomacy, Realizing the Joint Declaration: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Expresses His Aspirations

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu met with reporters at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the 23rd and made a statement on the new cabinet's foreign policy. The gist of his statement was: The new cabinet's foreign policy has been explained by the Prime Minister, and it will continue the past policy without any change. My continued appointment as Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia will move towards the direction. First, we will work closely with the Allied countries to complete the war, especially focusing on the cooperative relationship between Japan and Germany. Second, we will thoroughly implement the Empire's Greater East Asia policy, the Greater East Asia Declaration, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty to seek the liberation and reconstruction of East Asia. This is the international justice and the purpose of Japan's war. Third, Japan will promote good neighborly and friendly relations with neutral countries and neighboring countries. Therefore, this war is an unavoidable war for self-preservation and self-defense, and it was caused by the enemy's provocation, which led to the conflict. The purpose of the Japanese Empire is to distribute international justice to the world and establish good neighborly and friendly relations with all countries. The above points have been approved by the Diet and have been repeatedly declared to the world as our country's basic foreign policy. The new cabinet will continue to strongly promote it, and I am determined to work together with my colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Greater East Asia, both at home and abroad, to strictly implement it. The most important thing to do well in the Greater East Asia policy is to unite the hearts of the nations of Greater East Asia so that they can all exert their full strength to cooperate in the war. The collection of materials is also indispensable to the completion of the war. If the nations are united, the collection of materials must be carried out under the mutual interests and overall interests of the countries of Greater East Asia. As for foreign affairs, the Prime Minister and the Army and Navy Ministers have consulted thoroughly, and their opinions have been consistent. In the future, foreign policy will be integrated with the military and will be strongly promoted.

### Promoting the Traditional Spirit, Striving for the Final Victory: Sincere Instructions from the Army and Navy Ministers

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Army Minister and General Sugiyama visited the Ministry of the Army for the first time on the morning of the 23rd. At 2:20 p.m., he gathered all the officers in the main hall of the Ministry and gave sincere instructions, expressing his determination to fight the decisive battle. After meeting with former Army Minister Tojo to hand over his duties at 11:00 a.m., he met with the press corps and made a statement as follows: The war situation has entered a critical stage. As the Army Minister, I feel a deep sense of responsibility. In addition to gratitude, I am also filled with fear. To overcome the current difficult situation, the military must be more strongly united, promote fighting spirit, and bravely advance. We must closely cooperate with the Navy to crush the enemy. Therefore, it is most important that 100 million people be united as one and move towards the path of certain victory. To achieve the belief of certain victory, I will not hesitate to sacrifice myself. In the future, I will only strive to overcome all obstacles to achieve the final victory.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Navy Minister and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai met with the Navy press corps for the first time at the Navy Minister's official residence at 10:00 p.m. on the 22nd, expressing the Japanese government's determination to complete the war. The gist of his statement was as follows: I firmly believe that the essence of war lies in victory. There is no other way but victory. The essence of war lies in resolutely doing what you believe in. I feel that the urgent task is to meet the needs of the soldiers on the front lines. If the front lines need 1,000 aircraft, they should be supplied accordingly. For example, in contracting work, you can withdraw if there is a shortage of materials, but this is not the case in war. Modern war is a total war, and total strength must be exerted by all. Those who are in charge of guidance should also lead by example and direct the work separately. Also, if you want to win a war, the key lies in people. Therefore, the whole nation must cooperate closely to exert the total strength war. Cooperation does not mean that one opinion blindly follows other opinions, but that the two sides should learn from each other in a certain process and each exert their firm beliefs. The fact that General Koiso and I were ordered to form a cabinet is the meaning of cooperation. In the future, I hope that both the government and the public will not hesitate to give advice to make up for the shortcomings. In order to complete the mission, we will always cooperate and do our best to serve the Emperor's wishes.

### Various Measures to Enhance Combat Power

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The new Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, and Minister of Finance Ishiwatari all met with the press corps after the appointment ceremony and made statements. The following is a separate record: Shimada said, "In this era, all plans and affairs must be centered on the war. If the people's food is really insufficient, I will definitely take various measures to procure it. Otherwise, there is no way to win the people's trust. It is a mistake to say that farmers lack patriotism because they are often dissatisfied due to compensation or delays in receiving grain payments. The officials in charge must be fully aware of their responsibilities and be vigilant. Therefore, in the future, we must start from the actual situation to review various policies on food and other matters." Minister of Munitions Fujiwara said, "This time, I am shouldering the important task of munitions production. I will only devote myself to my duties with my usual beliefs, without being extravagant, and strive to make munitions production reach the level of winning the war." Ishiwatari said, "With the new progress of the cabinet's policies, many things have to be re-created, but fiscal and financial matters will still follow their basic policies and will not change. The key point of financial issues is to avoid inflation, and we will definitely make more efforts in this regard in the future. In addition, it is also essential to enhance the strength of the material aspects to seek the smooth financing of munitions. In terms of funds, we must remove the obstacles to production and, on the one hand, seek the effectiveness of funds, but we must not be too demanding. Also, we must change the past policies on savings and promote new plans."

### Intelligence Work Becomes More Important

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The new Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Kakuji Takeo, met with the cabinet press corps after the first cabinet meeting of the new cabinet at 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd and expressed his aspirations as follows: "Under the current state of the war situation, ideological warfare is also becoming more important. Therefore, the cabinet will also decide on fundamental policies on policy theories. Based on this fundamental policy, we will use the functions of the Information Bureau to establish a system of officials. In the future, we will report the truth to the people as much as possible about the war situation and other matters in order to promote the rise of the whole nation."

In the southern part of China, the elite troops of the Japanese army are now launching annihilation operations against the enemy everywhere.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Stable Last Week

Financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week remained stable. After a sharp rise, prices leveled off, and the spot silver market remained unchanged. The official market prices did not fluctuate. The money market tightened due to the urgent need for funds to purchase agricultural products locally. Interbank lending rates rose by 4.3%, but then eased as the Central Bank of China supplied funds for legitimate needs as much as possible, and the interbank lending rate returned to 4%. The stock market situation improved slightly as the authorities strictly monitored speculation and short selling disappeared. People are generally optimistic, and the prospects for enterprise development are promising. The prices of various food items have fallen due to the strictness of finance, especially the price of rice. The source of transportation is smooth, the limit for rice purchases has been relaxed to over ten dan, and there is news of restoring household rice, so people's food is becoming more stable, and the black market price of rice has fallen below the big mark. The panic is gradually diminishing.

### Examination of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions

The price of rice in the interior has always been controlled by the price of rice in Shanghai. The situation after the publication of the new measures has only caused the prices of rice in Shanghai and the interior to rise sharply together. However, before the publication of the new measures, the price of rice in the interior was already rising sharply. For example, in Songjiang, the price increased by 90% in the ten days from the end of April to the beginning of May. Someone once told the reporter the truth as follows:

The Rice Control Association buys from farmers and rice merchants until the end of April. After that, they can buy freely at market prices. Therefore, everyone believes that as long as they have rice, they can sell it at a high price. Rice merchants also predict that market prices will rise sharply, so they will not release the rice they have hoarded and wait and see the situation. Therefore, since the end of April, the price has risen extremely sharply. In this sharp rise, there must be agitation from corrupt national capital in Shanghai.

The price of rice in the interior, which started to rise in this way, was stimulated by the disputes and unrest in Shanghai caused by the publication of new rice and grain measures. The price rose higher and higher, and also tended to stabilize as the rice situation in Shanghai gradually stabilized.

The difference between the price of rice in Shanghai and various regions is difficult to believe. The four regions that reporters visited are all within one or two hours by train from Shanghai, but the difference in rice price is as high as 4,000 yuan per dan. The abnormal situation of price differences in various regions due to different regions is originally a cancer in the system and is worrying. However, the difference of 4,000 yuan per dan between Shanghai and Songjiang, and between Shanghai and Suzhou, as mentioned above, is truly a spectacle under the decisive battle. Moreover, recently, the price of rationed rice in Shanghai is cheaper than the market price in rural areas. In comparison, the future of the rice and grain problem feels increasingly difficult.

How is the existence of the unbelievable price difference mentioned above created? The insufficient absolute amount of rice entering Shanghai is also one of the important reasons. However, the price fluctuations of one or two thousand yuan in Shanghai overnight cannot be said to be caused by the absolute amount. The amount of imports now is not reduced at all compared to before, and has even increased somewhat, but there is a phenomenon of soaring rice prices. The hoarding and speculation in cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gold, and stocks in the past is now concentrated in rice and grain, especially during this severe lean season?

Key Points of Anti-Hoarding Measures

Since April last year, we have loudly called for reducing speculation and hoarding. Although various measures have been adopted to achieve this, they are still rampant. Moreover, the people's hearts also believe that it is impossible to eliminate hoarding and speculation because there are no strong measures after the forced purchase of yarn and the shooting of corrupt elements. Among some enlightened people, there are also those who believe that measures to suppress hoarding violate economic laws. However, can a national war system really be established if all powerful means are not launched against such an abnormal situation rampant in front of 450 million people, not to mention the eyes of 1 billion East Asian people? For those who despise anti-hoarding measures, the reporter wants to tell them the reactions heard in Suzhou and Wuxi after the execution of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng:

The handling of the execution of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng gave the people of Jiangsu Province an unprecedented good impression. Even those who had never expressed goodwill towards the national government began to believe that the national government would improve in the future. The shock of the people seeing the photographs of the execution of the two was comparable to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese naturally cannot agree that the execution of Hou and Hu was more shocking than the Greater East Asia War, but because the latter is directly related to the lives of the Chinese people, the people's cheers are extremely profound. Prices also stabilized for a considerable period of time as a result of this incident. The key to grasping the people's hearts is not complex and distant theories and policies, but simple and decisive words that workers and farmers will raise their hands to support. Now, there are few who can see the purely economic reasons for the fact that the price of rice in the lean season fluctuates by two or three thousand yuan every day, and the execution of hoarders and corrupt elements is precisely one of the simplest and most decisive ones. In this new stage, it goes without saying that only this form is the only way to open up. However, no matter what measures or policies are implemented, they must be handled with unprecedented determination. (Translated from the June 28th Continental New Daily)
