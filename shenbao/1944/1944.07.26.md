### Save the Poor Students

Yesterday and today, this newspaper held the selection examination for primary and secondary school student scholarships, with a total of more than 5,000 new and old applicants. Their families are poor, with certificates from the principals of various schools and spot checks by colleagues of this newspaper. (If there are any oversights, we hope readers will report them in the future.) Their academic performance is better than that of ordinary students, and there are also transcripts issued by various schools to prove it. The standard for scholarships is the four characters "poor and excellent." Since the applicants are all poor and excellent, why do they still have to take the exam? The only reason is the lack of funding. We want to fully cultivate the most outstanding talents with the donations from our readers, so we have to sacrifice some students with slightly lower grades. However, this group of students who failed the exam are already above average in school. If they continue their studies, they will definitely be more outstanding than ordinary people. Therefore, the fact that this group of students will drop out of school next semester is something that compatriots across the country do not want to see. Now, are we just going to watch these excellent young compatriots lose their education and sit idly by without helping?

Finding ways to secure educational opportunities for the next generation of compatriots is the work that the colleagues of this newspaper are most willing to do. We believe that since the Republic of China has been established for thirty-three years, China's problems remain unresolved, causing many young people who should be in school to not have the opportunity to attend school. At least those who are working in society now should take some responsibility. Not being able to improve China in thirty-three years is our fault. We must repent of the past and strive for the future, and the scholarship movement to educate the next generation is the most practical and effective thing to do. This belief is not only held by the colleagues of this newspaper but also, we believe, by every compatriot.

Yesterday, we saw thousands of poor students accompanied by their parents, siblings, coming to take the exam. Although their clothes were not very neat, they were clean and simple. Although their physique was not very strong due to nutrition, they were all full of energy. Entering the examination hall, they took their seats according to their numbers, and the order was orderly, which shows that they were well-trained. The students were focused on the test questions in the examination hall, and the parents were waiting anxiously outside the school. These "exam-taking picture" and "sending-off picture" reminded us of our impressions when we were studying in the past. The cost of studying was cheaper one or two decades ago, but what were our feelings when we took the exam at that time? What were the feelings of the parents who accompanied us at that time? At that time, if you were not accepted by one school, there were other schools to go to. Now, these young people are not like that. If they are not accepted today, they will at least drop out of school next semester. Dear readers! Please close your eyes and imagine, putting yourself in the shoes of a student seeking help, if I were the parent of a student seeking help, how anxious would I be? Dear readers! Please think again about how I finished my studies. If I have received help from others in the past, I should immediately help others now. How did my career succeed? It was thanks to the assistance of many like-minded comrades. Then, I should immediately cultivate many knowledgeable comrades for the next generation so that my career can continue to develop.

Every time we face exams, we are always worried about the lack of funds. However, every time we appeal to our readers, we always receive unexpected results. Because we have the readers as our support and the readers encouraging us, we are even more confident in the success of the scholarship movement. Tuition has increased, and the number of students seeking help has increased. We are even more confident in asserting that the readers' help will definitely continue to increase. Therefore, we are even more willing to plead again and again for these poor and excellent students.

### Nisshinkan's Concrete Measures to Strengthen Liaison between Military and Government, Completing the War with the Traditional Spirit of Yamato

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” The new cabinet of Prime Minister Koiso, assuming the great mission of renewing the spirit of the people and completing the war, has not yet clarified the specific policies for guiding operations under the new cabinet. However, the statements made by Prime Minister Koiso immediately after the formation of the cabinet, the statements made to the press corps, and the thoughts of the central figures of the new cabinet, such as Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai, all fully demonstrate the determination to continue the operational policies of the previous cabinet, to revitalize the traditional Japanese spirit of Yamato unity, and to advance towards the completion of the war. From this, it can be known that the concrete measures of the new cabinet will be roughly as follows:

The guiding principle of operations, the purpose of Japan's operations, has been clarified in the Great East Asian War, and of course, it cannot be changed due to the change of cabinet. On the 23rd, when Prime Minister Koiso took over the handover procedures from former Prime Minister Tojo, they talked for about an hour and a half. It is speculated that former Prime Minister Tojo explained in detail to Prime Minister Koiso the full scope of the previous guidance of the Great War, and made every effort to ensure the continued guidance of operations. It is thought that the new cabinet, following the detailed items of the previous operational outline, will have the best strategy for dealing with the decisive battle.

The concrete realization of Yamato unity, Prime Minister Koiso asserted in his initial statement that the only way to overcome unprecedented national difficulties is through the great unity of the people, using all their strength to destroy the Anglo-American counteroffensive. He reaffirmed the solid concept of Yamato unity and expressed his determination to implement policies in the future. However, this spirit has already been realized in the personnel combination of the new cabinet. Prime Minister Koiso and General Yonai not only jointly received the imperial order to form a cabinet, but also have been close friends since their days as lieutenants. Prime Minister Koiso and Army Minister Sugiyama also have the friendship of classmates, and other cabinet members also have the relationship of jointly planning government affairs in the Hiruma cabinet and the Yonai cabinet. This kind of harmony in the cabinet, further enhanced by the full cooperation of the political parties, is not limited to the total war system.

The intensification of cooperation between the Army and Navy, the inseparability of military affairs and state affairs, is an absolutely necessary situation for Japan under the wartime system. Regarding how to adjust the two, Prime Minister Koiso has stated that he will further strengthen the liaison between the Imperial Headquarters and the government. Especially having a great influence on the close cooperation between the Army and Navy in operations is the fact that Prime Minister Koiso and Army Elder Sugiyama were appointed as Army Minister and Navy Elder Yonai returned to active service and was appointed as Navy Minister. Due to the coordination of personnel, the relationship between the Army and Navy has become closer, and under this kind of situation, the greatest combat power can be exerted.

The boosting of morale, Prime Minister Koiso said that the boosting of morale also lies in Yamato unity. Furthermore, Director-General Ogata of the new Information Bureau said that in order to increase mutual trust between superiors and subordinates, it is necessary to frankly clarify the true state of the situation, avoid giving the people a false sense of security, and promote national self-awareness. This measure is really necessary. Therefore, regarding this point, the frank measures of the generals of the new cabinet are truly worth looking forward to.

Diplomatic policy, the retention of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and his concurrent appointment as Minister of Greater East Asia is evidence that Japan's consistent wartime diplomatic policy and the Greater East Asia diplomatic policy have not changed at all. Prime Minister Koiso said that regarding the allied country of Germany, he is determined to further strengthen the close relationship that has existed and move towards the goal of common achievement. Furthermore, he is determined to continue to maintain the current cordial relationship with the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to ensure that there is no unpleasant feeling between them. He clarified that Japan's wartime diplomacy will not change at all due to the establishment of the new cabinet. He also said that regarding the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, he hopes to win their hearts without regret. The resignation of the Tojo cabinet is just as he said in his letter of resignation, the purpose of which is to further strengthen the state of preparedness for the completion of the war, and the policy of liberating Greater East Asia and building a common labor group will not change in any way. Under this major war situation, of course, the Yamato unity policy also expects the entire Greater East Asia region to establish policies to win hearts and minds, which will be concretely realized gradually in the future.

### Japanese Planes Attack Lingling

A Certain Place on the Japanese Front Line, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” On the night of the 2nd, the Japanese air force in China carried out a surprise attack on Lingling, burning twelve enemy small planes and destroying six more. In addition, they destroyed underground facilities, causing seven fires, achieving fruitful results. The enemy air force, which retreated to Guilin and Yanjiang, hoped to regain their losses by cooperating with the Chongqing army. The Japanese air force units launched a surprise attack, destroying most of them. However, the enemy's underground artillery fire was extremely fierce and fired at the Japanese planes, but all the elite Japanese planes returned safely.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” The Chongqing authorities issued a public statement on the 24th, admitting that the Japanese troops attacking Hengyang had entered the city of Hengyang, and also announced that new battles had broken out in the northern area of the city.

### Japanese Naval Expert Discusses Fleet Operation Policy: Japanese Navy Prepares to Counterattack and Annihilate the Enemy

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” Renowned naval military expert Ito Masanori recently discussed the movements of the Japanese fleet, stating that in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands, there are several enemy mobile units with a large number of aircraft carriers as their main force, currently engaged in operations. It is expected that the general public is wondering why the Japanese fleet has not deployed to repel them. After the Combined Fleet launched its attack on June 19th and 20th, it has not deployed again. What is the reason? All Japanese citizens must have this question in their minds. This question can only be explained by understanding. I believe that this is because the timing is not yet ripe. In terms of military theory, the so-called probability has not yet been established. By probability, I mean (1) the current strength of both sides, (2) the replenishment force for the second battle, and (3) the battlefield terrain. In addition to these, combat techniques must also be considered. Otherwise, the main fleet should not be deployed. It must have a planned backup. A general who deploys without considering these factors, even if he is a brave general, is not a famous general. If he ignores probability and rushes forward, his foolishness will be obvious. The reason why our Combined Fleet has not deployed is based on the principle of probability. However, from now on, our fleet will never wait passively based on the principle of probability. It is actually accumulating strength and waiting for deployment. To reduce the force difference mentioned in the first point as much as possible to make engagement reasonable, air power is the most important. The tactical thinking of "fleet decisive battle under air supremacy" originated in 1938 during the U.S. military's study in Panama and the Japanese Combined Fleet's maritime study in Taiwan. After confirming this point, the Japanese air force's strength increased year by year. This can be clearly seen in the Japanese navy's battles during the Great East Asian War. Today, air force is absolutely necessary. If the fleet fails to gain air supremacy, it has no choice but to retreat. Therefore, our fleet is waiting for air force strength to gather on today's battlefield and is eagerly anticipating it. The second point mentioned above, that there must be a certain number of battles in a battlefield before it becomes a decisive battle. Here, the force required for the decisive battle must be considered. The main fleet must not be annihilated. Also, the third point mentioned above is that the battlefield must have the basic conditions for other forces to cooperate in operations. The Japanese fleet is making repeated local attacks, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles, and the high command is eagerly awaiting the opportunity to be active. I am afraid that our fleet itself is more eagerly awaiting the arrival of this opportunity than the people. Currently, our fleet is adopting the "fleet preservation policy," that is, avoiding the so-called "probability" decisive battle and preserving the main force of the fleet. However, this kind of policy has no great significance if it stops there. It must have a "counterattack spirit" to be meaningful. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to grasp the probability and go out to fight the enemy. It is necessary to have the will to win. If it is possible to restore the concentration of forces to a certain extent, review the second battle, return to an advantageous battle voice, and establish a plan to defeat the enemy, then enduring for a considerable period and preserving the fleet is also a comprehensive strategy.

### Executive Yuan Meeting Approves Merger of Shanghai Police Bureaus, Appropriates Funds to Strengthen Capital Air Defense and Rescue

### Significance of the Japanese Cabinet Reshuffle

â€” Yin Gong

After the Japanese Tojo cabinet resigned en masse on the 18th, General Koiso Kuniaki, an army heavy weight known as the "Tiger of Korea," and Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, a naval elder and national statesman, were ordered to form a cabinet. The new cabinet was established on the 22nd. After coordinating various aspects, the lineup was further strengthened. The emergence of this powerful new cabinet will surely "renew the spirit of the people and enable the nations to move towards the completion of the war." This can be asserted.

This cabinet reshuffle in Japan certainly has great significance in strengthening its combat posture and determination to achieve victory. However, this event occurred soon after the fall of Saipan. The Anglo-American propaganda agencies will surely exaggerate and believe that Japan has fallen into a "difficult situation" in the war, and consider this political offensive a success. It is their habitual trick to distort the truth, create rumors, and shake people's hearts. However, such propaganda that does not conform to the facts, using it to deceive oneself and the world, is just a waste of time and effort and is extremely boring.

This reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is merely a personnel strengthening. The war system is not affected in the slightest, and the fundamental national policy during wartime will not be changed as a result. This can be seen from Prime Minister Koiso's talks and broadcasts, as well as from the new cabinet members. In this cabinet reshuffle, the Tojo cabinet, since the beginning of the war, has done its utmost for more than two years and has established remarkable achievements. Currently, as the decisive battle is about to begin, it feels that its responsibilities are heavy and that a more powerful cabinet is needed to lead the nation and complete the war, so it resigned. In the new cabinet, Generals Koiso and Yonai were ordered to form a strong lineup united by all nations under the current military and political situation, and to move towards the path of completing the war and achieving victory. From this, it can be seen that Japan's system of national mobilization for the decisive battle is not only unaffected by the cabinet reshuffle but is also strengthened by the cabinet reshuffle. Japan's fundamental national policy during wartime will not only not be changed due to the cabinet reshuffle but will also be implemented by the new cabinet. This war is not only for the rise and fall of Japan but also for the beginning of the reproduction of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. In this anti-British and anti-American war of aggression, Japan took the leadership position of the East Asian nations. On the one hand, it signed an alliance treaty with our country, and on the other hand, it united the East Asian countries to issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Under the Greater East Asia Declaration, the East Asian ethnic groups have formed a relationship of shared destiny and inseparable interdependence. This is also Japan's fundamental national policy. This cabinet reshuffle in Japan also requires the realization of fundamental national policies. As Prime Minister Koiso said: "Externally, we can always adhere to the previous diplomatic methods and achieve the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, so as to complete the Greater East Asian War." It can be seen that although the Japanese cabinet has undergone changes, its fundamental policy has not changed. It is just making more efforts to implement it effectively. The British and American authorities cannot fail to see this. As U.S. Secretary of State Hull said: "After Japan's cabinet change, we must be fully aware that Japan has re-established a revised operational plan." Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew also issued a statement saying, "Although the Japanese cabinet has changed, Japan's war policy of fighting to the end has not changed. The Japanese people's tradition of not fearing life and death is deeply rooted. If the American people think that the future is bright because of the Japanese cabinet change and make a rash judgment, it is really dangerous." Since the United States has this accurate understanding, yet its propaganda agencies still declare that the Japanese cabinet reshuffle is the collapse of Japan's wartime system and create false propaganda to deceive people, how contradictory and ridiculous!

In addition to the unchanged policy of this new cabinet in Japan, there are also three points worth noting: (1) A stronger lineup; (2) A closer connection between the army and the navy; (3) The realization of national unity. This time, Army General Koiso and Navy Admiral Yonai received the imperial order at the same time and cooperated to form a coalition cabinet. This is only the second coalition cabinet in Japanese political history after the coalition cabinet formed by Okuma Shigenobu and Itagaki Taisuke of the Liberal Party in June of the 31st year of Meiji. Now, General Koiso holds the top position, with Marshal Sugiyama as the Army Minister and Navy General Yonai as the Navy Minister. The close connection between the army and navy can further promote the strengthening of the wartime system. Second, the realization of national unity. The members of the Koiso-Yonai cabinet include the political elder Nagata Chuji, the aristocrat Hachisuka Masaaki, and the executive director of the Yokusan Seijikai, Maeda Yonezo. They all share weal and woe and are truly worthy of being a cabinet united by all nations. Third, all administrative departments are staffed by those with rich experience. Among the fifteen cabinet members of the new cabinet, eleven have experience as ministers for two or even four terms. They can all draw on their experience, easily handle their jobs, promote wartime administration, and improve the efficiency of wartime administration. The above three points are the qualities of the Koiso cabinet. Based on these three qualities, a strong and unparalleled lineup is formed to realize the strengthening of the wartime system. Although the situation is serious and the difficulties are numerous, this Koiso-Yonai cabinet, appearing in a new wartime posture, will surely be able to bear the burden, defeat Britain and the United States, and win independence for the East Asian nations. At this time, the one billion people of East Asia should strengthen their belief in victory, give full play to the spirit of unity, and jointly move towards the final decisive battle for victory against Britain and the United States and complete the great cause of the Greater East Asian War.

### General Observation: Astonishing Developments Expected in the European Situation

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” According to a Geneva special dispatch of the 15th from the New York Daily Mail, the diplomatic envoys of various countries who recently met with FÃ¼hrer Hitler stated that Hitler has unwavering confidence in the development of the war situation. Although the war situation is extremely pressing for Germany, those around Hitler believe that the German army has the strength along the line, or is preparing to use new weapons or new tactics in experimental enterprises, or is planning changes in political motives. Regardless of the reasons, FÃ¼hrer Hitler, Marshal Goering, Dr. Goebbels, and other Nazi leaders have expressed their determination in the past few days. Some diplomatic circles also expect important events to happen. Among the various speculations, the absolutely certain one is that FÃ¼hrer Hitler has fully realized the serious situation, maintains a calm attitude, and is preparing some kind of event that will shock the world.

### Claim of Changes in German Diplomatic Policy is Untrue

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” Huitong News Agency reports: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated that German diplomatic policy has not been affected by the assassination attempt on FÃ¼hrer Hitler. English reports about the activities of German Ambassador to the Vatican WeizsÃ¤cker and the German reshuffling of diplomatic personnel are all unfounded. The British Exchange Telegraph Service also said that according to the Berlin correspondent of the Turkish Anatolian News Agency, Berlin has suddenly implemented a curfew, which is also completely untrue.

### Hitler Issues Letter Thanking the Nation

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” German News Agency reports: The German FÃ¼hrer's headquarters issued a statement: The German FÃ¼hrer expressed his gratitude to all the people of Germany for their congratulations and loyalty after his assassination attempt failed.

### General Kortan Dies of Severe Injuries

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” Huitong News Agency reports that last night's official gazette stated that General Kortan, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Major General Brandt have died of their injuries after being wounded in the assassination attempt on the German FÃ¼hrer.

### King George VI of England Arrives in Italy for Inspection

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” Huitong News Agency reports that the British government announced that the British King arrived in Naples, Italy, by plane on Sunday. The purpose of this trip is to inspect the reactionary army in Italy. The British King will also go to Egypt today.

### Enemy Troops Attacking Tinian Are Heavily Damaged and Retreat

Central Pacific Base, 25th (Central News Agency) â€” On the 24th, the enemy attempted to land on the coast of Tinian's first airfield with about a hundred landing ships and about thirty tanks. The Japanese troops waiting for the enemy immediately launched a fierce artillery bombardment, and machine guns and other heavy weapons also began firing at the same time, causing more than a dozen enemy ships to sink immediately, and the tanks caught fire. As a result, by 11 o'clock, the enemy could not withstand the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army and attempted to escape.

### Grand Opening Ceremony of the Central Naval Merchant Marine Academy â€“ Distinguished Guests from China and Japan Gave Political Training Speeches

The grand opening ceremony for the sixth class of officer cadets of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy was held yesterday (the 25th) at 10:30 AM at the Central Naval Academy on Longhua Road in the Southern District of the city. Details are as follows:

Distinguished Guests and Officials

Officials and guests from relevant agencies gathered, a distinguished assembly. On the Chinese side, there were Naval Minister Ren Yuandao, Cheng Haiwei Garrison Headquarters Commander Bao Yimin, Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters Staff Officer Liang Daye, City Security Chief Neng Jiandong, Central Seamen Training Institute Director Huang Dong, Hydrographic Survey Bureau Director Ye Kesong, etc. On the side of allied nation Japan, there were Naval Department Chief Military Advisor former Lieutenant General Tanaka, Military AttachÃ© Kondo, Central Naval Academy Chief Instructor Major General Mori, Paymaster Major General Oka, Captain Watanabe from the first Kurogane Maru, Cheng Haiwei Garrison Headquarters Instructor Captain Hamaya, Captain Asahina, Military AttachÃ© Lieutenant Colonel Takayama, Lieutenant Colonel Kikuchi, as well as all the faculty and students of the two schools, totaling no less than 300 people, gathered in one place.

Grand Ceremony

At 10:00 AM sharp, the ceremony began in a solemn atmosphere. First, Academy President Jiang Xiyuan appointed the students of each class of the two schools. All the students then bowed to Minister Ren, the guests, and senior classmates. Subsequently, Minister Ren and President Jiang gave speeches to the students of the two schools successively, filled with words of encouragement. Then, former Lieutenant General Tanaka and Major General Mori gave congratulatory speeches one after another. After the speeches, the students of the two schools took an oath. Finally, the national anthem was sung loudly, and photographs were taken before the meeting adjourned.

Speech by Naval Minister Ren

The following is a transcript of Naval Minister Ren's speech: "Today, the sixth class of naval students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy are holding a solemn and grand opening ceremony here. I am grateful for the presence of the esteemed guests and officials from our allied nation, which adds great honor to the students. I hope the students will deeply remember today's impressions. Today, you are formally appointed as naval students and advanced merchant marine students. Although the two schools are nominally different, they are actually under the guidance of the same president, and can be said to be two but one. Naval students are responsible for serving our country's navy, and merchant marine students, of course, should focus on developing commerce in essence. However, at this critical juncture, the navy and maritime transport are equally important. Although the two schools have some different subjects, they are the same in spirit. The government's reason for establishing the Advanced Merchant Marine Academy in one place is also this. I would like to clarify this meaning, and I hope that everyone will have a deep understanding of it and always have this concept. The establishment of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy this time is due to the cooperation of our allied nations and the merchant marine industry. Not only does the school itself express its gratitude, but the government also expresses its deep gratitude. It is not easy for you to be admitted today with the assistance of all parties. I hope that you will all act as students with the spirit of the navy. The past graduates of the Central Naval Academy have all served in the naval industry and have achieved good results, which can be a good example for you. In the future, you should work hard in school, prepare to serve the navy, devote yourselves to your studies, and fulfill your ambitions. You have all been selected from many outstanding young people, and your grades must be very good. At the same time, the foundation of the school is now better than before. I hope you can use the good foundation and the spirit of the senior classmates to sincerely accept the president's guidance, cultivate a good school spirit, establish the navy's reputation, and prepare to contribute to the Greater East Asia War."

Speech by President Jiang

Today is the opening day for the sixth class of students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy. At the same time, it can also be said to be the opening day of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy. I am extremely honored that Minister Ren, Chief Advisor former Lieutenant General Tanaka, and all the officials and guests have come to provide guidance and instruction. Especially the Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, which is established within the Naval Academy, is a perfect combination and complements each other, which can be said to be a new undertaking of epoch-making construction under the Greater East Asia War system. The painstaking efforts and great planning to promote this new undertaking are truly immortal achievements. I would like to express my sincere gratitude and admiration.

From today onwards, the new navy and the new maritime transport have accepted the contributions of a hundred and dozens of young men. You glorious and promising new students resolutely bid farewell to your families and parents, left your lovely hometowns, traveled through mountains and rivers, and passed the preliminary and follow-up tests. For the sake of the nation and for the victory of East Asia, you have dedicated yourselves to the vast ocean. In order to realize the new navy and the new maritime transport you have envisioned, you must first accept the will of the ocean, which is solemn and vast, and follow the spirit of the ocean, which is bright and lively. In the school, you must be single-minded and uphold the training of soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, as well as the school motto of wisdom, depth, courage, and determination. Strengthen your beliefs, be indomitable, and be sure to gain thorough knowledge, never content with superficial understanding. Seek pearls in the abyss and obtain the child by entering the cave. If your studies are not completed, do not turn back. You must also study hard and practice diligently step by step, cultivating the five virtues of wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness, and becoming capable generals and cadres with unified aspirations and physique. In the future, you will be able to shoulder the responsibilities you should bear, do what you should do, and promote the maritime spirit of the continental nation. The two major undertakings of the navy and maritime transport should be integrated, promoted hand in hand, and developed together. This is the success of the new navy, and it is also the success of the new maritime transport. The president first blesses this group of lucky children of the ocean, and at the same time blesses the future of the Republic of China and the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Congratulatory Speech by Maeda

Congratulatory speech by Maeda, Chief Military Advisor of the Navy: On the occasion of the entrance ceremony of the sixth class of students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, I am very happy to be able to participate and meet with all of you who are full of vigor.

Students of the Central Naval Academy, you will surely become the backbone of China's future navy. Your predecessors have worked tirelessly, day and night, and moved forward bravely on the path of rebuilding China's weak navy. Therefore, they were able to lay the foundation for the unified national navy, and they were able to fully protect the stability of the country and cooperate in the war. This is your task. You have been selected as the best among the many, and you have been able to enter the school. In the future, you should abide by the school rules, cultivate your character, and study diligently in order to develop a sound military spirit, and look forward to becoming promising young officers in the future.

Students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, you should shoulder the great responsibility of rebuilding China's shipping industry. The country's expectations for you are heavy and great. Moreover, you are the first class of this school. You must strive to be self-conscious and create a good school spirit in order to create useful senior sailors in the future and realize the reality of serving the country through shipping.

Furthermore, today the students of the two schools are entering the school on the same day, and in the future, they will live and take classes together, and live together. After graduation, they will be active in the rivers and oceans of Shanghai, so you must be friendly and friendly.

Thinking about the autumn when the world war situation is becoming more and more tense, you should use a clear head, observe widely and deeply, understand the great significance of the Greater East Asia War, and complete your own tasks. Always keep today's determination firmly in your mind, be vigilant day and night, strive for self-improvement, and move forward bravely on the path of your own hopes. This is what I expect. Today, on the occasion of the entrance ceremony, I will briefly describe what I have in mind to promote your struggle.

Speech by the Chief Instructor

Congratulatory speech by Chief Instructor Rear Admiral Mori of the Navy, roughly saying: "You have been selected from among the volunteers who are about ten times the number of this year's Central Naval Academy and Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, and I am honored to be able to enter the school today. I would like to express a few words from the bottom of my heart as a congratulatory speech.

The naval and shipping circles are like the two wings of a bird, with a close relationship. Students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, you have won the honor of being the first to enter the school, and you should be aware of the importance of your mission. Moreover, the students of the two schools should each move forward vigorously on the path to achieving their own aspirations. At the same time, you should embrace the concept of mutual dependence and helping each other in the same boat, and cultivate a good school spirit.
