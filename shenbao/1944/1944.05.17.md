### Requesting the Government to Swiftly Reorganize the Rice Control Commission

We have had particularly numerous commentaries on food issues in the past, and the criticism of the Rice Control Commission has been particularly severe, precisely because the food problem is so serious. We have always felt that if people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, there is no guarantee that all policies and decrees can be smoothly implemented, and if the food problem cannot be solved, there is no guarantee that people's livelihood can be stabilized to a minimum extent. The more seriously we view it, the more earnestly we speak about it. Of course, our strict criticisms are aimed at the entire institution and all personnel, and are by no means directed at any particular individual. In other words, the object of our criticism is the public interest, not personal likes or dislikes. We attach importance to food administration agencies and personnel, believing that they cannot be relaxed. However, it is very regrettable that strict criticisms have not been valued and adopted by the authorities of the Rice Control Commission.

Regarding rice control, in terms of system, method, and personnel, its importance is no less than increasing rice production. If the control methods are poor and the personnel are unsound, even if there are increased production effects, they will be useless. Moreover, increased production is the active goal of control. If control fails, there will be no possibility of increased production at all!

The work process after the establishment of the Rice Control Commission has undeniably been a failure. However, the crisis of saving the rice and food problem is already imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Learning from painful experiences and recognizing the pain, the opportunity to immediately and thoroughly reorganize and present a new image must be seized by the responsible authorities today.

In terms of personnel of the Rice Control Commission, it was originally a committee system. However, some committee members only have nominal titles in form without bearing actual responsibility, and even do not have a thorough understanding of the content of the commission. Therefore, if important measures have not been agreed upon by all committee members, strictly speaking, it is either the committee members are holding positions without real ability, or the authorities are handling things arbitrarily. The chairman of the Rice Control Commission is not only required to have qualifications and good character, but also to be active, astute, and capable, with firm advocacy and decisive judgment. Secondly, the Secretary-General of the Rice Control Commission, who assists the chairman, holds a very important position and responsibility. The selection criteria require not only qualifications and character, but also talent and spirit. It is by no means that someone can be competent simply by speaking a few words of Japanese. At least half of the remaining senior executives and staff are experts in rice and food affairs. It is said that some people around the age of thirty with shallow experience have taken on inspection work with special connections, receiving a monthly salary of around ten thousand gold. The practical and energetic new agency has formed a bureaucratic organ with an air of stagnation. As for the Allied personnel who participate in the work, their diligence and enthusiasm are commendable, but most of them are also laymen, and they cannot deeply understand or adapt to China's national conditions and public sentiments, and they insist on their own prejudices.

Regarding the purchase price of the Rice Control Commission, the initial regulation was 700 to 800 yuan per stone, which was still possible at the market price at the time, but it forgot the fluctuations in prices. How much difference is there between the seeds, fertilizers, and labor costs of last year and now? Therefore, the purchase price naturally cannot remain unchanged. Therefore, it is impossible to make farmers willing to sell, and many disputes and malpractices occur. Many unscrupulous people in general places take the opportunity to disturb the people.

The policies and methods of the former Ministry of Food were not necessarily bad, but they failed due to personnel issues. Therefore, the Rice Control Commission was planned to replace the Ministry of Food, but it also failed due to personnel issues. However, the time is now pressing, and there is no need to find a third replacement. Therefore, we advocate thoroughly reforming the Rice Control Commission.

Refreshing the personnel and making it sound is the first priority, employing talented people with qualifications, character, astute and capable, decisive, experienced, and courageous to take responsibility. Strict supervision of the work of subordinates is necessary, and rewards and punishments must be clear. If the current authorities and senior officials of the Rice Control Commission ask themselves whether they have achieved any results in the past and are not confident in doing a good job in the future, then they should retire early and make way for the capable. If they cannot do it well themselves but insist on occupying the position, what could be more unwise? Those who hold a title must be responsible, and those who are nominal committee members without actual responsibility should also resign. All other superfluous staff members should be dismissed.

The importance of military rice should be valued even more during wartime. The quantity cannot be reduced, and the timing cannot be missed. The central government should be responsible for making the Rice Control Commission specialize in the purchase of military rice. At the same time, it is hoped that the Allied authorities will trust the Chinese government to handle it independently, so that the authority to purchase is unified, and responsibility is centralized. The purchase price and methods should take into account the interests of farmers, so that they are willing to sell.

The existing offices and most purchasing merchants of the Rice Control Commission in various places have been ineffective and wasteful of public funds based on past experience, and should be completely abolished immediately. To implement the purchase work, the local government of the county should determine the purchase quantity based on the actual local output and obtain the full cooperation of the local government and legitimate rice merchants. The Rice Control Commission occupies the position of a central and local control mechanism for purchasing military rice, and to prevent malpractices, the central government should appoint cadres and incorruptible officials to go to various places for inspection, combining overt investigation and covert visits. Those who have achieved results in their work should be rewarded, and those who commit fraud should be punished according to wartime regulations.

The purchase, control, and allocation of major rice and food supplies in various provinces and cities should be handled independently by each province and city, and contact should be maintained with the Rice Control Commission to ensure consistent purchase prices and reasonable purchase quantities.

The purchase price should be based on the farmer's cost plus a reasonable profit, and it must fluctuate with the market price. It must not be divorced from reality and remain unchanged, making farmers regard selling rice as a daunting task.

Finally, we sincerely urge the responsible authorities of various agencies to know that their own work has failed, and if they do not have the courage to reform, they should know to retreat bravely and preserve their reputation. If they are helpless and sit back and delay, it is not a good solution for the agency or for themselves. This is true for the Rice Control Commission, and it is also true for other agencies.

### Plan for the Reform of Provincial Administrative Institutions

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) After the return to the capital, the provincial government institutions originally adopted a committee system. Later, in view of the fact that the committee system could not fully exert administrative efficiency, it was changed to a provincial governor system last year in order to concentrate power and strengthen administrative efficiency. Under each province, in addition to the four departments of political affairs, finance, construction, and education, police affairs, security, propaganda, health, and blockade management offices, as well as economic, food, and social welfare bureaus, and Qingxiang affairs bureaus, are set up according to environmental needs to be specifically responsible for promoting various affairs. However, now that we are in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, in order to adapt to the environment and strengthen administrative efficiency, we must strive for simplification. The government authorities, in view of this, have a battle to adjust the provincial government institutions, which was passed by resolution at the 209th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th. The health and propaganda offices and the economic, food, and social welfare bureaus of various provinces will be abolished, and all affairs will be merged into the political affairs and construction departments. After this reform of the local administrative institutions, the past problems of divisions and conflicts in the administration of departments and bureaus can be avoided. The provincial governor's powers can therefore be fully concentrated, and high administrative efficiency can be exerted. The reform plan for provincial administrative institutions is attached below.

Provincial governments shall implement joint offices. A. The power of the provincial governor shall be completely concentrated in the provincial governor. The documents sent by the province to the central ministries and to the counties shall be issued in the name of the provincial governor. B. The various departments and bureaus of the provincial government shall be regarded as the various divisions of the central ministries. The heads of the departments and bureaus are purely the staff of the provincial governor. The central ministries shall not send documents to the departments and bureaus under their jurisdiction (such as the Ministry of the Interior to the Police Affairs Department), and the departments and bureaus shall not send documents to the county bureaus under their jurisdiction (such as the Police Affairs Department to the county police bureau). The seals of the departments and bureaus shall be confiscated by the provincial government. C. The offices of the various departments and bureaus shall be gathered in the provincial government. Even if they cannot be gathered for office at one time, the implementation of the above two items A and B shall not be delayed.

The merger of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government: A. Abolish the Economic Bureau and the Food Bureau, and merge their affairs into the Construction Department. B. Abolish the Social Welfare Bureau, the Propaganda Office, and the Health Office, and merge their affairs into the Political Affairs Department. C. The rules for dividing the departments and bureaus merged into the Political Affairs Department and the Construction Department shall be separately approved by the Provincial Governor. D. The Provincial Governor may consider the situation and merge as much as possible other relatively idle affiliated institutions. (Note) When implementing the above two principles, there is no need to modify the Provincial Government Organization Law and other related laws for the time being. After half a year of implementation, the related laws will be adjusted at the same time.

The central government's supervision and guidance of provincial administration: A. Matters handled by the provincial government that have been approved by the central government in accordance with the law must be consulted with the competent department for handling. B. The provincial government's policy guidelines and revenue and expenditure estimates for each half year must be submitted to the Executive Yuan two months before implementation. For the second half of the 33rd year, they must be submitted to the Executive Yuan before June 15, and the Yuan will submit them to the competent departments for joint review and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. C. The provincial government must compile detailed work reports on various administrative situations every month and submit them to the Executive Yuan before the 15th of the following month, and the Yuan will submit them to the competent department for review. If the competent department considers it inappropriate, it may correct it in accordance with the law. D. The provincial government's revenue and expenditure situation must be reported to the Ministry of Finance every three months for reference.

Adjustment of the system of administrative supervisors: A. Administrative supervisors should be universally set up, with each administrative supervisory area based on three to seven counties as a principle. B. Administrative supervisors shall not concurrently serve as county magistrates. C. Administrative supervisors shall be directly appointed and removed by the central government. D. The expenses of the administrative supervisor's office shall be paid by the provincial treasury. E. Administrative supervisors, under the order of the central government, inspect local administration, and under the order of the government, supervise and correct the implementation of county administration, but shall not directly handle various undertakings on their own. This shall not apply to those who have been specially entrusted by the provincial government. F. Documents between the province and the county shall not be transferred through the administrative supervisor's office, but when the province issues orders to the county, it must simultaneously inform the administrative supervisor. When the county magistrate reports or requests instructions to the province, he must also simultaneously report to the administrative supervisor. The detailed method shall be determined separately. G. Administrative supervisors must inspect each county at least once a month, and must report the administrative conditions and inspection situations of each county under their jurisdiction to the provincial government, the Ministry of the Interior, and other competent ministries every month. H. The administrative supervisor's office and the Ministry of the Interior and other ministries may communicate directly

### Failure in the Henan Operation: Chongqing Increasingly Trapped in a Difficult Situation

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The rapid progress of the current Henan operation has suddenly caused various difficult problems for Chongqing, and at the same time, Chongqing's internal and external positions have become more and more untenable. Although the disastrous defeat of Tang Enbo's army can be said to be a local defeat, from the perspective of Chongqing's military resistance capability today, it is necessary to fundamentally re-examine whether it can become a wing of the anti-Axis camp. The victory of the Japanese army in the Henan operation has actually made Britain's attitude towards Chongqing increasingly indifferent. Although Chongqing is now using the excuse of insufficient weapon assistance to try to shirk its responsibility, Britain and the United States sacrifice other countries to engage in war, more thoroughly adjust their relationship with the country, and use all their propaganda strategies. Due to this defeat, Chongqing has been unable to form a so-called democratic resistance system. On the other hand, what Britain and the United States are trying to do is to adjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After the start of this operation, this kind of action seems to be more active, and Britain's ultimate goal is to make the colonial army, which has received considerable training, deployed on the Chinese front. According to recent intelligence reports, the trend of readjusting the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party seems to be an independent activity of Chongqing on the surface, but in fact Chongqing has been forced by Britain and the United States and cannot move. Then this trend is only a confused strategy that comes with the progress of the war. Although we have not been able to make a definite judgment on the essence of this trend, the right of Britain and the United States to speak to Chongqing will increase due to the defeat of the Chongqing army. This trend has a complex and subtle relationship with the political opposition and resistance within Chongqing. Today, the impact of this relationship on Chongqing's position will inevitably be difficult to avoid. Recently, there has been a claim that there are discussions that express doubts about whether Chongqing's Three Principles of the People is democracy. This kind of discussion has given Britain and the United States extremely strong stimuli. At the same time, this kind of protection is more than enough to reflect that there are two opposing political trends within Chongqing today, namely the opposition between liberalism and anti-democratic nationalism. Britain and the United States recognize this as an opposition of doctrines, but this is actually a kind of reflection on the fate of the East that has been manifested in the seven years of the War of Resistance, and gradually shows suspicion of the Anglo-American style of empire. From this point of view, the day when Chongqing succumbs to adjusting the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the day when Chongqing has no way to clean up the situation. In this kind of chaotic state, the path taken by Chongqing can only make Greater East Asia a colony of Britain and the United States. The development of the Sino-Japanese Incident into the Greater East Asia War loses its name in this, and at the same time adds a new kind of distress to Chongqing. From this point of view, the progress of this operation has actually made Chongqing give up its policy of distant friendship and near attack, and has fallen into an extremely difficult situation.

### Japanese Elite Takes Preemptive Action and Achieves Results on the West Bank of the Nujiang River. Japanese Troops Continue to Make Progress in Bukiton

Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The elite troops of the Japanese army on the Nujiang River took preemptive action and counterattacked the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which was attempting to cross the Nujiang River and advance westward, and annihilated them everywhere. They are currently continuing their offensive. On the 27th of last month, the Japanese army completely defeated the main force of the enemy army, which was attempting to stir up trouble, 33 kilometers north of Tengyue. Also, on the 12th of this month, a certain unit completely repelled the enemy army crossing the river in five places between a certain place and a certain place, and also shouted with the elite troops in a certain place, and suddenly attacked the enemy army everywhere, causing them to flee.

Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The progress of the war situation in Bukiton is quite favorable to the Japanese army. The Japanese army advanced to the north of Sinobin, broke through the smoke screen in defiance of enemy artillery fire, destroyed dozens of enemy tanks, and defeated the main force of the attacking enemy army. On the night of the 10th, they occupied Nagurakian, 2 kilometers north of Sinobin, and the 94th highland, 2 kilometers northwest of Sinobin. Also, another main force of the Japanese army advanced to the highland (5 kilometers west of Bukiton) on the Bukiton-Mengdo Highway on the evening of the 9th, and at the same time, a unit of the Japanese army continued to mop up the remnants of the enemy from the 305th highland, 2 kilometers northwest of the highland, at dawn on the 10th. By 7:30, they occupied the highland on the north side of the highway (8 kilometers west of Bukiton) and the 551st highland, and mopped up the remnants of the enemy they encountered. Also, the enemy artillery position on the 161st highland southwest of Sinobin, under the strong pressure of the Japanese army from the right bank of the Mayu River on the north of Sinobin and the fierce attack of the Japanese army from the front of the above-mentioned highway, has begun to retreat to the highlands east of Xingai Deku.

### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat on the Bishnupur Front

Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese army's offensive operation launched in Bishnupur (about 20 kilometers southwest of Imphal) has now reached its climax. The elite troops of the Japanese army have launched fierce attacks on a part of the enemy's 23rd Division and the remnants of the 17th Division from the west, south, and northwest for days, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy army. The Japanese army also cut off the Bishnupur-Silk Road and attacked Bishnupur, breaking through about 1,000 enemy troops on the 584th highland, 6 kilometers west of Bishnupur, and arrived at a location 3 kilometers outside Bishnupur. Under the barrage of enemy aircraft and enemy artillery teams, they launched hand-to-hand combat, gradually capturing the enemy's positions, and there is a tendency to break into the enemy's positions in Bishnupur in one fell swoop.

### The Enemy's Vehicle Base in Zupusa Was Fiercely Attacked by Japanese Aircraft

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) A certain base in Myanmar reported: The Japanese army's air force's diving bomber squadron in Myanmar launched a large-scale bombing raid on the enemy artillery positions near Zupsa, 10 kilometers west of Kohima, on the 14th, and dropped consecutive direct hits, inflicting great damage. They also discovered enemy vehicles on the Dimapur-Kohima Highway and immediately bombed them and machine-gunned them, shattering the enemy's attempt to reinforce the combat power on the Zupsa front. Also, on the morning of the same day, dozens of enemy P51 fighter planes attacked a certain place in northern Myanmar. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately pursued them and shot down eight of them in an instant (one of which was unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacked the Northern Kuril Islands and One Was Shot Down

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency report) Several enemy twin-engine bombers attacked the northern Kuril Islands region late on the 12th and were attacked and shot down by the Japanese Navy. No Japanese planes were lost.

### German Domestic Affairs Observations: The European Offensive Plan Has Begun to Act. The Major War in Southern Italy Has a Restraining Effect.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters military correspondent Volpe said: The people of the world are all asking when the European offensive will be carried out, and newspapers of all countries are also expecting "this day." In fact, the allies are already encountering the offensive. The current anti-Axis air offensive against Western Europe cannot be described as preparation for the offensive, but is part of its actions. The offensive cannot be achieved at once, and must be planned in detail to be effective. For example, the major war in southern Italy has a restraining effect, and its plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain can only be regarded as a part of the major offensive. This time the enemy's landing plan will be completely different from Dieppe and must be carried out on a large scale, or several divisions of paratroopers will be sent to land behind the German army, and at the same time, or crowds of troops will be sent to harass Norway, the Bay of Biscay, Thessaloniki, Heligoland and other places to achieve the effect of attacking the east and west. The German command knows that its offensive will never be launched in a day or a week, or it will be extended for several months, in order to the most likely to give a decisive blow to the location, so its offensive will never be limited to one place, otherwise the major war in Italy should have won Stalin's satisfaction. Therefore, the German army expects that it will be launched in many ways, but whether in front or behind, the German army is fully prepared to deal with it.

### Fierce Fighting in the Casino Area: German Troops Move West

Poland, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) German Happiness Agency News, according to German official announcement: The enemy army in southern Italy is still using new infantry and tank divisions to attack the German defense line. The south of Casino is the focus of the war. After the fierce battle, the German army withdrew from several mountainous areas. The German army counterattacked with other battlefields, straightened the line or blocked the gaps. Yesterday evening, German planes carried out effective bombing raids on the enemy's strongholds in Casino.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters News: The Italian war has become more and more intense since last week, but it has not yet reached its peak. The Anglo-American offensive center is in the coastal mountain area and the middle area of the Liri River basin. This is where the US Fifth Army is operating, while the British Eighth Army is operating in the area north of Casino. The German army counterattacked several times in Sant'Angelo, Monte Maiolo, and Castelforte south of Casino, heavily slashing the enemy army, and has now moved west several kilometers to guard the new position. The US army's attempt to break into the German defense with a large number of tanks in the Liri River basin has been defeated. It is expected that there will be a major war here.

### Prime Minister of the American Autonomous Territory Temporarily Stays in London to Advise the Emergency

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch: Soviet Ambassador to Chongqing, Barneyuskin, and his family took a British plane on the 15th to return to the country.

### The French National Liberation Committee Changes Its Name

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters News: The French Consultative Committee yesterday passed a resolution to revoke the name of the "French National Liberation Committee" and change it to the "Provisional Government of the French Republic". The meeting also passed a motion trusting the government to establish an agreement with the anti-Axis countries to administer the "liberated areas" and promote armistice conditions favorable to France.

### Tsurumi Writes an Article Discussing the Internal Affairs of the United States

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Tsurumi Yusuke, a Japanese expert on the United States, recently wrote an article in the Pacific Magazine discussing American domestic politics and the Pacific counteroffensive, especially the rise of anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States. The main points are recorded as follows: There is no need for Britain and the United States to need the Soviet Union in the current European war situation more than today, but Britain and the United States are more terrified of the power of the Soviet Union than the post-war world reconstruction issue. Therefore, how to use the Soviet Union today and how to contain the Soviet Union in the future is a source of distress for Britain and the United States. The anxiety to expedite the decision of the war situation in the Pacific and the timing of forming a second front in Western Europe are of great importance.

To increase farmers' interest in silkworm breeding and mulberry planting in the future, costs will be taken into consideration. Silk production can have a shrinking nature. If the price is fixed at this time, and farmers use this income as other capital, they will inevitably be affected. After the report, representatives from various parties expressed their opinions, and then the meeting adjourned.

### Air Defense Headquarters Revises Blackout Regulations - Adopting Light Shielding Methods in the Hot Summer Season

The authorities of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement regarding the revision of blackout regulations:

Regarding the matter of blackout regulations, the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued Notice No. 22 on the 16th of this month, modifying a portion of the previously established blackout regulations. The purpose is to allow peacetime operations to continue while enabling rapid preparation at any time upon hearing an alert or air raid warning, in order to prevent any eventuality, and also to prevent light from scattering upwards, so as to prevent enemy attempts before they occur. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention to the revised measures and comply with them in full.

Increased Streetlight Brightness with Light Shielding

In terms of the revised measures, the previous regulation limited streetlights to only three units of light per ten square meters of road surface. Now, according to the new regulations, this can be changed to five units of light, increasing the brightness by about 70% compared to before, so that the streets can also be slightly brighter. Secondly, regarding indoor lighting, according to the new regulations, it is only necessary to shield the light source (i.e., light bulbs, etc.) with a black cover to prevent indoor light from leaking outwards through the windows. Shielding the light source means hanging a black curtain to block direct light from leaking out. Concealing the light source means hanging a black curtain to prevent direct light from leaking out through any gaps. If the light cannot be seen directly from outside, it is not necessary to lower the curtains, and the windows may be left open. What needs special attention is that skylights and other places should be properly shielded to prevent light from leaking upwards. The Air Defense Headquarters is constantly concerned about this matter. In addition, light reflected from mirrors is also regarded as direct light emission, so if mirrors are not properly shielded, it will be considered a violation of the blackout regulations.

Permitted Number of Indoor Lights

For every area of approximately six feet long and four feet wide indoors, ten units of light are permitted. For indoor areas that are eighteen feet long and wide, about fifty units of light can be used. The maximum brightness of one lamp is limited to seventy-five units of light, that is, for a spacious house, calculated at ten units of light per three square meters, several light bulbs of seventy-five units of light can be lit. The brightness level should be no different from normal, but for air defense reasons and to save electricity, citizens must switch to smaller light bulbs.

Blackout Regulations Divided into Three Stages

As the weather turns hot, hanging air defense dark curtains on windows is particularly stuffy. Many citizens momentarily lifted the dark curtains, causing indoor light to leak outwards, resulting in numerous violations. Now, if citizens can take measures to prevent light from shining directly outwards as described above, they do not need to lower the curtains to avoid the summer heat. However, this method is only applicable during normal air defense periods. When a warning or air raid alarm is issued, they must still strictly comply with the various measures stipulated in Blackout Regulation No. 1 previously announced and handle them carefully. During the air defense warning blackout training held on the afternoon of the 9th of this month from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM, many citizens mistakenly believed that the blackout regulations they had to comply with at that time were no different from the normal blackout regulations implemented since March 3 of this year. It must be known that blackout regulations are divided into three stages: normal blackout, warning blackout, and air raid blackout. The current normal blackout regulations have been revised, but warning alerts and air raid alerts are still handled as usual. Citizens must understand this distinction, comply with the regulations, and become familiar with the regulations. In the event of a medical alert or air raid alert, they must immediately take appropriate measures and not be negligent in the slightest. If there are deliberate violations, severe penalties will be imposed. If there are any unclear aspects of the regulations, inquiries can be made to the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, which will provide full guidance.

### Municipal Advisory Committee Holds Second Meeting Yesterday Morning - Approves Twelve Articles of the Committee's Regulations

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee has been actively promoting its work and repeatedly discussing the current problems of people's livelihood. Yesterday (the 16th) at 9:00 AM, the second plenary meeting of the committee was held in the conference room of the First District Public Office. More than 20 people attended, including Yan Siqing, Li Sihao, Feng Bingnan, Wu Zhenxiu, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou. Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, Advisor Funatsu, and the heads of the relevant bureaus and departments of the municipal government all personally participated. First, Mayor Chen delivered a speech, followed by Chairman Li Sihao, who revised and approved twelve articles of the committee's regulations. Then, the list of members of the five subcommittees of the committee was approved: Education (Convenor: Shen Siliang), Finance (Chen Riping), Public Security (Lin Kanghou), Daily Necessities (Li Sihao), and Rural Areas (Zhao Zhengping), and the convenors of each subcommittee were designated.

### Food Authorities Are Negotiating Household Rice Issues - Answers from the 14th Regular Press Conference

The Municipal Propaganda Office held the 14th regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than 10 reporters from various newspapers and representatives from various agencies attended. The questions raised by the newspapers and the answers from the various agencies are recorded as follows:

Household Rice Issues

Shen Bao asks: The allocation of household rice has been repeatedly postponed, and rice prices have been rising sharply again. Does the government have any remedial measures to stabilize the people's livelihood?

Grain Bureau answers: Regarding this issue, this bureau and relevant agencies are properly planning various methods to dredge sources, and strive to properly improve procurement and transportation, so the allocation of household rice should not be postponed again.

Inferior Quality No. 3 Flour

Hua Ri Bao asks: Most of the No. 3 household flour allocated in the latest two periods is bran, with poor quality and inedible. Was it like this during allocation, or was it resold?

Grain Bureau answers: The flour allocated by this bureau is all received from the Shanghai District Flour Bran Unified Allocation Office and then distributed. The No. 3 flour allocated this time was like this when it was received.

Cloth Purchase Certificates Issued Regularly

Zhonghua Ri Bao asks: The temporary allocation of cotton cloth in this city has been delayed repeatedly. Please tell me when it will be allocated. If a specific date cannot be determined, what is the reason?

Economic Bureau answers: The National Commercial Control General Association has handed over the cloth purchase certificates for temporary allocation of cotton cloth to this bureau for distribution to the district public offices for collection. This bureau has now ordered each district public office to set the certificate issuance date from the 20th to the 31st of this month. Once all citizens have received the cloth purchase certificates, a public sale will be announced.

Police Illegality Requires Solutions

Zhonghua Ri Bao asks: At a time when all parties are trying to improve police treatment, at the Suzhou River bridge, whenever the lights are dim at night, police officers often take the opportunity to inspect luggage from travelers coming from the station, and there are illegal extortion situations. I hope the police authorities will pay attention to this in order to benefit merchants and travelers and rectify the atmosphere.

First Police Bureau answers: The poor quality of Shanghai police today is an undeniable fact, but this bureau is actively rectifying it. The police extortion situation on the Suzhou River bridge mentioned by Zhonghua Ri Bao may exist. The police department of this bureau is in charge of this matter and is trying to eliminate it. All illegal acts of police officers that are found are severely punished. Therefore, in addition to expressing gratitude to the press for their concern on this issue, we will pay extra attention to it. We also hope that in the future, if there are any illegal acts by police officers, the detailed situation will be reported to us immediately to promote the rectification of police discipline.

### Impressions of Attending the Second Advisory Committee Meeting

— Bin

Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee held its first plenary meeting. Having participated in it, I would like to express my feelings as follows:

The plenary meeting was originally scheduled to be held once a month. The first meeting was held on the 1st of this month. This time, it was convened temporarily. In addition to passing the constitution, the most important thing was to discuss the food problem of the citizens of this city. The municipal authorities attach great importance to and are concerned about the food problem, and have now formulated stabilizing strategies to gradually implement them. At the same time, they have obtained the full cooperation of the Allied authorities, and hope to obtain the understanding and cooperation of the advisory committee members and citizens. I believe that the food problem is indeed serious, but since the authorities have already formulated handling strategies, they will be realized soon. Therefore, I hope that citizens can rest assured.

At this meeting, I was very happy to see Mr. Yan Huiqing, who has a great reputation in the local area, attending. In fact, local affairs are the responsibility of every citizen living in Shanghai, especially local leaders with resources and reputation, who cannot avoid their responsibilities. What is regrettable is that at this time of social crisis, many leaders with resources and power are still enthusiastic about profiteering or only seek the development of their own careers. They are still not interested in the sense of responsibility for local public affairs. I hope they can deeply reflect on this. It would be a great blessing for the local area and for the public welfare of the citizens.

In the advisory committee constitution passed this time, there is a clause on setting up citizen opinion boxes. Of course, this is a place for citizens to express their opinions. I hope that citizens will make full use of it and fully contribute their opinions on all reforms in municipal affairs and personnel matters. When it is considered insufficient, they can also communicate or talk face-to-face with the advisory committee members individually. It is hoped that good municipal affairs will be immediately implemented and bad ones will be immediately reformed. I believe that this is what the municipal authorities most hope for and are most willing to promote. However, the most important thing is that citizens must express their opinions in good faith, with impartiality and without selfishness. If they are anonymous attacks, it is a boring act and will not be effective.
