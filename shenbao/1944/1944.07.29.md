### Rural Construction

During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the Qing dynasty, Zeng Guofan quelled the Taiping Rebellion as a scholar-general, fighting across several southeastern provinces. He deeply understood the suffering of the people due to war. In a letter to a friend, he wrote: "In recent years, I have been engaged in military affairs, and wherever I have been stationed, I have traveled through cities and villages. Everywhere I see houses destroyed, trees felled, wealthy families ruined, and poor people oppressed. In general, seven or eight out of ten suffer from the rebels, and two or three suffer from the soldiers. I secretly lament that the harm of military operations to the people has reached such a point!" This shows how devastating the destruction of rural areas was at that time, partly due to the burning and looting by the Taiping army, but also because the discipline of the official armies like the Xiang Army, Huai Army, and Ever Victorious Army was non-existent. Zeng Guofan never shied away from speaking about this. Therefore, the elders who pass down stories of the Hong-Yang era still cannot help but feel fear!

In recent years, the suffering of the people in the villages and rural areas after the chaos is comparable to what Zeng Guofan described. The destruction of the villages during the Hong-Yang era eighty years ago seems to be happening right now. Today, many towns and villages in the war zones are occupied by bandit armies, acting recklessly and lawlessly. Although there are occasional suppression efforts by the National Army, due to their poor quality and inadequate training, they are more likely to do more harm than good. Sometimes, the power of the National Army and the bandit armies rise and fall, often in a tug-of-war. In this environment, the most unfortunate are the local people, who please neither side and are often implicated. Even remote villages are in turmoil, and the suffering of the villages is unimaginable to those living in modern cities.

According to people from northern Jiangsu, even considering the current situation in northern Jiangsu alone, apart from the Communist army and a few remnant bandits of the Yu army, only the seven counties of the former Yangzhou prefecture – Gaoyou, Rugao, Xinghua, Taizhou, Dongtai, Jiangdu, and Yizheng – and parts of Rugao and Taixing counties are stationed with a regular Peace Preservation Army of eight divisions. Local security and self-defense teams and land reclamation corps are not included. In addition to the salaries paid monthly by the central government according to regulations, the counties where they are stationed also provide several tens of thousands of yuan monthly as military subsidies. However, because the history of these troops is complicated and their quality is uneven, unscrupulous elements often use the village chiefs and heads of household to levy donations based on the acreage of land, extorting money with threats, more ferocious than tigers and wolves. It is rumored that a certain town in the second district of Dongtai County levied 17 million yuan in donations in July. Landowners had to pay 300 yuan per mu of land. Even self-cultivating farmers with only two or three mu could not escape. The entire income from rent and grain was not enough to cover the donations! How could they possibly provide for their families? This is even worse than the pre-collection of land taxes during the defense zone era in Sichuan in the past! No wonder there is a folk rhyme that says: "The team leader slams his gun, the village chief buys land and builds houses, the neighborhood chief feasts on big fish and meat, and the head of household wails loudly." These few words are a true reflection of the destruction in the villages.

Given the current state of destruction in the villages, we believe that discussing rural construction at this time is premature. First, we must find ways to eliminate the various factors that destroy the villages and strive to stabilize the lives of the villagers. Only then can we engage in rural construction. If the villages remain unstable, if law and order cannot be established, and if the lives and property of the people are not protected, then the grand plans will become mere words on paper and will be difficult to implement. It can be said with certainty that they will not contribute to the actual construction of the villages.

### Ambassador Lu Returns to Xinjing and Speaks to Reporters

Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The ambassador of Manchukuo to China, Lu, returned to the country on official business and arrived in Xinjing on the 26th. On the 27th, he paid his respects to the imperial palace and visited relevant agencies. At 5:00 PM that evening, he met with a group of reporters at his official residence and said: The Chinese government and people are extremely concerned about the current state of the war. Because of the emergence of the new Japanese cabinet, they are increasingly convinced that Japan's victory is not far off, and the people's hearts are very stable. When reporters asked about the impact of the frequent reports of Japanese victories in central and southern China on the people, the ambassador replied that the Japanese government would issue a statement saying that Japan's enemies were the British and Americans who invaded East Asia, and certainly not the good Chinese people. He also instructed the soldiers to strictly observe military discipline and not to violate the slightest thing when the Japanese army passed by, which was welcomed by the people. What the Chinese people were even more grateful for was that when they built roads and transported military supplies, the people were very happy to help.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Fengshui on Both Banks of the Lianjiang River, and American Aircraft Drop Bombs on Chongqing Positions

A certain Japanese base on the front lines, 28th (Central News Agency) – The encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army against the Chongqing army's 156th and 159th divisions on both banks of the Lianjiang River has become increasingly fierce. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing dropped many bombs on the Chongqing army's positions during this battle, causing many casualties to the Chongqing army. When the Japanese army opened fire on the Chongqing army near Fengshui and Huanshan on the 13th of this month, several squadrons of British Air Force P51 aircraft stationed in Chongqing flew in from the northwest and dropped bombs like rain from high altitude. However, the bombs all exploded within the Chongqing army's positions, causing the Chongqing army's newly equipped bunkers to be filled with black smoke, and their officers and soldiers shared the same fate as the bunkers. Seeing this situation, the Japanese army thought the opportunity had come and immediately broke into the Chongqing positions, and Fengshui and Huanshan were occupied by the Japanese army.

The Japanese Army Uses Proper Tactics

A certain Japanese front line in Hunan, 28th (Central News Agency) – The fall of Hengyang, the forward base of the Chongqing and American Air Force, is only a matter of time. The Chongqing side falsely claims that the Japanese army is using poison gas to cover up its defeat. According to Chongqing prisoners, American poison gas experts came to Guilin at the beginning of this year to train the Chongqing army to use poison gas. It was used in Liling on May 24 this year. The 54th Division of the Chongqing army and other units that attempted to defend Hengyang Airport also used it. The Japanese army suffered considerable damage due to the use of poison gas by the American and Chongqing armies, but in order to protect humanity, they have always adopted proper combat tactics and will never engage in chemical warfare.

### Talking About Life During Air Raids

Battles without airplanes have become a thing of the past. On the Imphal front, both sides are repeatedly staging air raids. When I witnessed the heroic air combat, I felt that the power of airplanes was even greater today. Air raids do not distinguish between the front and the rear. Now I plan to report several air raid experiences on the Indian front line to the rear, so that it can help the people in the rear to cope with the decisive battle. The following is a record of air defense from the Indian front line.

Air Raid Nerves

"Heart-shaking bombing, nerve-wracking heavy machine gun fire." This is how the captive white soldiers describe the power of the new Japanese planes that pound the enemy lines with terror and shuddering. But any large-scale air raid causes very little damage from direct bombs. The power of an air raid is directed at human nerves, at the sense of terror. A reporter who has experienced many air raids has heard the sound of bombs exploding nearby, and seen the raging fire outside, but after the air raid is over, he runs out and finds almost no casualties. If you find a way to avoid them, you can avoid them. This confidence is absolutely necessary. The soldiers on the front line no longer take air raids seriously. If you are calm, you can avoid even the densest barrage of fire. A unit that is bombed several times a day does not have a single casualty. Sharpening your air raid nerves, honed by the sound of bombs, is the only way to reduce damage. The belief in victory is a silent anti-aircraft gun that prevents enemy planes from exerting their power. No country has ever perished because of air raids alone. Just sharpen your air raid nerves.

Air Raid Senses

The more you are bombed, the deeper you think, the more sensitive you become. Sometimes your nerves are especially sharp. When you hear the sound of bombs every five minutes, day and night, you take bird calls and fly buzzing as the sound of bombs, and the shadow of flying birds as the shadow of planes. There is a sense of air raid in your body at all times. But at certain times, this becomes a sixth sense and comes into play. You can know the type and number of enemy planes, and their purpose, fairly clearly. You already know the sound of the bomber squadron before it dives. When large four-engine bombers are conducting horizontal bombing, you are already hiding in a trench. You only need to look at the direction and turning height of the fighter plane to know its direction and intention, and you do not have to worry about the location. This air raid sense is cultivated by usually studying the type of enemy planes and the types of bombs. Because air raid countermeasures are well-trained air defense training.

Air Raid Life

Air raid life is an absolutely indispensable part of air raid duty. Living in the air raid and making complete preparations cannot be accomplished in a day or two. The air raid life experienced by the soldiers on the front line can be used as a reference for the people in the rear. The following is a record:

Regarding Air Raid Shelters

Air raid shelters are absolutely necessary, but they do not need to be beautiful and formal.

The depth of an air raid shelter only needs to be enough to cover your head.

Use a dispersed configuration, preferably individual trenches.

Use shelters and substitutes for protection, and be careful not to rupture your eardrums.

The trenches must be dug by yourself, because they are where you entrust your life.

Once you enter an air raid shelter, you don't have to be afraid of air raids.

Actions During an Air Raid

Absolutely do not move, because even a fallen leaf can be seen very clearly by the plane.

Do not expose conspicuous colors such as white, red, blue, and yellow. Pay attention to the color of your clothing.

Be silent, and focus all your attention on the sound of the bomb.

Daily Life During an Air Raid

Cook early.

Pay attention to water and fire.

Prepare a change of clothes.

Practice moving in the dark.

Develop the habit of taking measures on moonlit nights. Moonlight is very important.

Enter the shelter calmly and correctly when not urgently needed (do not come out before the enemy plane is really gone).

Pay attention to the surrounding situation. Enemy planes often go and return.

Be familiar with the location of the trenches and do shelter training often. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, July 5)

### Fierce Fighting is Taking Place Around Honda on Omiya Island, and Seventeen Enemy Planes are Shot Down While Attacking Palau Island

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Central Pacific base: The battle situation on Omiya Island is gradually becoming fierce. The center of the battle is around Honda. Japanese troops in the Showamachi area are also moving towards Honda. On the night of the 25th, the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the enemy's main force from Honda. The enemy also resisted with its main force, and the battle lines were mixed and chaotic, and the fighting was extremely fierce. In this battle, the enemy forces lost 2,100 men. On the 24th, the enemy's losses were approximately 1,200 men. As of the evening of the 25th, the Japanese army on the Olrot Peninsula had killed 600 enemy soldiers. Since landing, the enemy has lost a total of 9,900 men as of the 25th.

A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, 28th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft attacks on Palau Island are becoming more intense. On the 26th, a total of 300 enemy fighters and bombers repeatedly bombed the island violently. The local Japanese troops bravely fought back, shooting down eleven enemy aircraft and destroying six.

The Number of American Casualties Exceeds That of the Last World War

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the US Department of the Army revealed last night that the number of American casualties in this war has exceeded that of the war from 1917 to 1918. The number of American casualties in this war is approximately 313,000, including 207,000 in the army, 50,000 in the navy, 16,000 on Saipan, 3,000 on Guam, 24,000 in Normandy, and 11,000 in the air force.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Pearl Harbor, the US Southwest Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 27th that the losses suffered by the US military since the start of the landing operation in Tinian until the 25th are as follows: 159 killed in action, 441 wounded, and 32 missing, for a total of 632.

### The Situation on the Northeast Pacific Line is Becoming Increasingly Tense, and the Japanese Army Has Established a Decisive Battle Posture

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from the northeastern Pacific front, there have been dozens of battles on the northeastern Pacific line. However, as of April, night attacks have ceased, and daytime air raids are conducted using heavy fog. At the same time, the enemy seems to be steadily advancing south, abandoning reconnaissance and even psychological warfare air raids, and switching to large-scale bombing air raids. This is particularly noteworthy. In addition, enemy cruisers and destroyers have also shelled Nakachishima and Kitachishima on the morning of June 14 and the midnight of the 26th, respectively. This action by the enemy can be seen as a diversionary tactic against operations in the central Pacific, and at the same time, it can be said that the enemy is trying to destroy the Japanese base. The enemy has been emphasizing the strategic value of Nakachishima, and its actions in May and June are consistent with its propaganda. In May, the enemy frequently conducted daytime air raids using heavy fog. On June 15, the enemy air force launched repeated attacks day and night, and in the Nakachi area, they even flew low to strafe with machine guns. At the same time, enemy submarines lurking in the waters in that area are trying to cut off the Japanese supply route. Recently, they have been using heavy fog to surface and navigate during the day, or use periscopes to scout Japanese positions from 1,000 to 2,000 meters offshore. They are also actively and fiercely trying to induce aircraft to fight. All of these actions can be seen as evidence that the enemy is seeking an active offensive. It is expected that the enemy ships that shelled the northern and central Kuril Islands in June were part of the fleet based in Hawaii, and the enemy forces on the Aleutian Islands seem to have completed their gathering in May. Thus, the battle situation in the northeast is gradually becoming tense during the foggy season, but the Japanese garrison has established a firm decisive battle posture to fully cope with the current situation.

### The Manchukuo Forestry Corporation Will Be Established in Mid-August

Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Manchukuo passed the Outline of Special Measures for Urgent Increase in Forestry Products on the 27th.

Therefore, in addition to formulating the Forestry Products Control Law, the Manchukuo Forestry Corporation will be newly established to specialize in the control of production, processing, and distribution of forest products under its jurisdiction. This Forestry Corporation will be established in mid-August, and the Wang Forestry Products Control Law is also planned to be promulgated soon.

### Actively Mining Underground Resources in Mengjiang; Production Results Will Become Even Better

Zhangjiakou, 20th - Central News Agency - To comply with the urgent demands of the war situation, the Mengjiang authorities have decided to actively increase the production of underground resources. It is planned to launch a major production increase campaign at the Longyan Iron Mine in early August. At the same time, the old Huayuan Coal Mine will be closed and its materials, facilities, and labor will be transferred to the Datong Coal Mine. The installation of all facilities is expected to be completed by the end of August. After the Huayuan Coal Mine's facilities are moved to the Datong Coal Mine, the increased output this year is expected to increase by about 50%. In the future, when necessary, small and medium-sized enterprises will also be reorganized and transferred to the production of key resources.

Zhangjiakou, 20th - Central News Agency - The development of underground resources in Mengjiang is aimed at meeting wartime needs.

Iron Ore

and coal mines are the focus of mining. In order to complete the huge production increase plan for this year, in addition to concentrating the overall strength of the government and the people, all difficulties such as labor shortages in development and production increase are overcome. The results are quite promising. Taking coal mines as an example, according to reports from various coal mines, their coal mining conditions are very good. In the future, due to progress in labor countermeasures, their production performance will be even better. Among them, the Datong Coal Mine, the main coal production area, has a production increase target of several million tons this year, breaking past records. The production situation since April has been better than last year.

Labor

Due to the improvement of labor management and the activity of the Diligence Corps, labor efficiency has increased, and the allocation of materials is superior, so the production increase plan can be achieved as scheduled. In addition, special companies, such as the Daqingshan Coal Mine, are currently reorganizing their internal structure and engaging in expanding production facilities. It seems that active labor countermeasures will be implemented soon to complete the production increase target for this year. The production increase at other places such as Huayuan Coal Mine is gradually progressing, and efforts are currently being made to thoroughly solve the labor problem. Next, regarding the iron ore, which is the key point for the development of underground resources, the Longyan Iron Mine has been fully excavated, but it is to complete this year's

Production Increase

the biggest task of the plan. Since the beginning of this year, Longyan Iron Mine has implemented planned countermeasures for transportation and materials. In terms of transportation, the extension project of the dedicated railway has been completed, thereby strengthening transportation capacity. In terms of materials, in addition to striving to ensure the necessary quantity, emphasis is placed on exerting the efficiency of application materials and existing equipment. In the allocation of labor, in accordance with the various countermeasures implemented by the authorities, attention is paid to improving labor management, preventing mobility, increasing efficiency, and utilizing labor, and establishing contact between the Iron Mountain and nearby rural areas to solve the labor problem. The rest of the ironmaking sector, based on the

Enterprise

The highest level of management currently established by the company seeks to ensure raw materials and change the technical and health-related specific measures in order to achieve increased steel production. In practicing this year's steel production increase target, Mengjiang pays great attention to the labor force in mining work. In addition to iron and coal, the recent development status of various other underground resources, except for a very small portion, has achieved more than 100% results, maintaining a good record. Regarding the development and production increase of underground resources, its basic departments, such as

Investigation

The cause is unusually important. This year, it was decided to carry out a large-scale survey of underground resources. Since the beginning of this year, surveys have been conducted separately.

### Adjusting Rural Labor, Allocating Chemical Fertilizers, Japan Central Cooperation Council Continues Discussions

Tokyo, 28th - Central News Agency - On the 27th, the fifth day of the Japan Central Cooperation Council's sectoral meetings, the Sixth and Seventh Committees were held. The issues discussed by the Sixth Committee were labor, farmland, and the adjustment of agriculture and industry. The Seventh Committee focused on issues such as fertilizers and feed. The chairman of the Sixth Committee was Mr. Kohei Kenichi. After the meeting, regarding the plan to adjust rural labor, it was proposed that joint operations should be strengthened and the town and village chiefs should be responsible for managing labor affairs. In addition, women's labor should be fully utilized, and nurseries should be set up to make it easier for women to participate in labor. It was also suggested that women should engage in half-day (six hours) farming, and that women should be planned and assigned to other labor sites. Regarding this point, the government also expressed its approval and issued opinions. Yoshida, the planning section chief of the Mobilization Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, once said: This point has been discussed with the Ministry of Munitions, and a decision has been made to convert the current labor allocation. This point is particularly noteworthy. Regarding the appropriate allocation of current labor, the Japanese government will formulate a system of limited essential personnel centered on the Ministry of Munitions, which will be implemented by the middle of this month at the latest. It goes without saying that this system focuses on industry, and will also clearly stipulate the minimum labor standards in various aspects such as agriculture, forestry, and fishery, so not only the current labor allocation problem, but also future labor mobilization plans can be used for assistance. The Seventh Committee was chaired by Mr. Homi, and the central issue of the meeting was fertilizer feed. In order to promote the appropriate distribution of chemical fertilizers, when popularizing livestock farmers, silk fertilizer and forage should be widely planted, and a comprehensive production plan should be established. The government paid attention to listening to opinions on this issue. Mr. Kato Haruji proposed that agricultural machinery is the weapon of farmers, and shovels, sickles, etc. should be smoothly allocated. Secondly, it is hoped that the iron and steel supplied by the rural areas will be quickly repaired and returned to manufacture agricultural implements, and the requisition should be prevented. The council members expressed their opinions sincerely.

### Wuhan is Peaceful and Safe

Nanjing, 28th - Central News Agency - Governor of Hubei Province, Yang Kuiyi, made the following statement on the 28th: This trip to Nanjing is to ask the central government for guidance on promoting military and political work in Wuhan in the future. The security of Wuhan has been taken over by the National Army since the Hunan Campaign and is extremely solid. Prices in Wuhan are low, and essential goods are abundant. The strength of the security forces in various counties has been strengthened, and the provincial government's directly affiliated security force has also been established. The Qingxiang work in Hubei Province will also be based on the police security force. A civil servant training institute has been established to train Qingxiang workers. Wuhan has been attacked by enemy aircraft, but the damage to the area is minimal, and the people are very calm. The water level in Hubei Province is still low this year, and there are no worries. Seven to eight tenths of the crops in the 45 counties of Hubei Province can be harvested.

Hankou, 20th - Central News Agency - Since its establishment, the Wuhan Clearing and Prohibition Association has actively launched various activities, attracting attention from all walks of life. Recently, in order to thoroughly clear and prohibit, in addition to actively investigating and persuading opium addicts, if anyone is found to have not obtained a smoking license, a fine of 1,000 National Currency will be imposed for national defense contributions.

### Minister Dakin Talks About the Myanmar Youth Movement

Yangon, 28th - Central News Agency - Myanmar Minister of Materials Supply Dakin Diton, on the occasion of the first anniversary of Myanmar's independence "August 1st," spent a week inspecting the situation in Myanmar in detail. He has now completed the inspection and returned here. According to him, the current situation of the vigorous Myanmar youth movement across the country is as follows: The people of Myanmar are now firmly convinced that final victory is coming soon. The determination to fight to the end and win, and new awareness, are now rising across Myanmar, especially among the youth. This awareness is the awareness of taking up arms and fighting alongside the Japanese army to overthrow the British. War is not only a war of money, but also a war of fields, villages, towns, cities, and factories. The cornerstones of these activities are the National Service Corps of various institutions and the East Asia Youth League. These two are now working together and are active together, but the current war situation requires even closer cooperation. Therefore, a new plan to concretize activities is being carried out step by step. In a word, I am confident that through the efforts of organized Myanmar youth, Myanmar will work with Japan to complete the war and contribute to the construction of a new order in Asia.

### The People on the Mainland Front Cooperate in Combat

The statement issued by the Japanese government on the 5th of this month clearly stated the purpose of the mainland operation currently being carried out in North China, with its grand scale and vigorous operation, which has never been seen before in the history of mainland warfare. The nature of the operation is essentially different from previous battles. First, since the implementation of the new China policy in January last year, the China Expeditionary Army, which has returned to its original form of a field army, has clearly demonstrated its original face for a year and a half in this operation. Objectively, the mainland domination posture of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been captured, or "Japan cannot be suppressed without annihilating the Japanese army on the mainland." This kind of ambition to invade the mainland naturally made the Chinese mainland a decisive battleground. The Wuhan strategy battle was the last general battle, and the situation of confrontation for more than five years was changed this time, and it was transformed into a pure combat operation stage to completely destroy the enemy's power and establish a winning posture.

The mainland war during this period was characterized by supporting the war with the war, on the one hand, expanding its points, lines, and surfaces due to the establishment of the National Government, in order to meet the requirements of building a new China and reducing the anti-Japanese forces of the Chongqing side. Out of the series of operations aimed at destroying the enemy's military supplies and destroying its economic power, the operation to cut off the supply road; to expand the Qingxiang area and reduce the security operations that disturb the base of the peaceful area, its entire political and economic nature has become a major element of the operation's requirements.

In these battles, we have declared "not to aim at one city or one town," because our operational goal is "to support the war with war" or security operations. However, the speed and decisiveness of this operation's operational actions have completely changed its character from previous battles containing political and economic elements.

Second, according to the judgment of the anti-Axis camp, the Japanese military power on the mainland is gradually exhausted, but the Japanese army still maintains a strong military force on the mainland. The Hu Zongnan army, which has never been exposed to the Japanese army and tried to preserve itself until the end, was thoroughly crushed west of Luoyang. The Tang Enbo army, which has been avoiding the main force due to my painful blows since the Incident, was completely surrounded and annihilated. Either of these two is the highest peak of battle in the history of the mainland war. In the Hunan field battle, it can be said that it is rare in the mainland operation to take Changsha and Liling in one fell swoop with the power of relying on human and horse power.

Third, this kind of pure strategic operation is a manifestation of extremely strict military discipline. The expeditionary army is now appearing among the people in the anti-Japanese war zone in the posture of acting in battle. The every move of the soldiers has become a touchstone for embodying the spirit of the alliance treaty.

As shown in the statement, the soldiers on the front line do not regard the Chinese people as enemies, but as friends. Those who do not cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army, are not enemies. The love of the Japanese army for the allies makes the general Chinese people pay great attention. The Chinese people's cooperation with the Japanese army is becoming more and more concentrated.

Seven years have passed since the outbreak of the China Incident. The metamorphosis of the mainland operation will become the key to the war situation in various senses. (Translated from the July 7th Mainland New Daily)

### The Soviet Army Forms an Encirclement Around East Prussia; German Troops Abandon Two Important Cities on the Old Border

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German News Agency, military information, said that the German army in Bialystok, located about 75 kilometers from Warsaw, was abandoned on Wednesday evening. There are still major battles in the Bialystok area. The German army retreated several kilometers to prevent the Soviet army from breaking through this point.

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German military authorities announced on the 28th: The German army has left Brest-Litovsk.

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th - Central News Agency - The Soviet Army's Vistula River crossing battle is underway. According to a Reuters report from Moscow, the Soviet army is attempting to cross the river 30 miles west of Robertlin with a large number of amphibious vehicles. The Soviet artillery also concentrated artillery fire to attack the German positions on the west bank. At the same time, due to the German withdrawal from Bialystok, the Soviet army has advanced to the west of Kosno to Bialystok, forming a semi-circular formation surrounding East Prussia, putting heavy pressure on the German positions east of the East Prussian border. The Soviet army north of Tvinsker is attacking Tallinn on the north coast of Estonia from Rudoyarisiknei and Narva on the Latvian border, in an attempt to cut off the German positions, but the German army in that direction is still securing the main defensive line.

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - German News Agency News: The focus of the war is still in the Limburg Robertlin area. After the Soviet army crossed the Sen River at several strongholds, it apparently aimed to advance to the Vistula River, but in the past 24 hours, the enemy has not made much progress in the area. In other areas of the front line, there have been no important changes between Brest-Litovsk and Lake Pskov. A detachment of Soviet tank formations has arrived in the Ponievic district, and the purpose of their attack is obviously aimed at the West Oria area. The retreat from Narva is orderly. The reason why the German army abandoned Narva is that the town is located in a salient on the front line and is of little use to the German army. The new front line is about 45 kilometers west of the town.

### Soviet-Polish Sign Agreement; Polish Prime Minister in Exile Goes to Moscow

Moscow, 28th - Central News Agency - The Soviet government and the Polish Committee of National Liberation signed an agreement at the Kremlin on the 27th, the terms of which are as follows: Within the old Polish territory belonging to the war zone, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army shall have the supreme authority. Within the old Polish territory occupied by the Soviet Army, the Polish Committee of National Liberation may establish Polish administrative organs in accordance with the Polish Constitution (but since the Soviet government declared the West Bug River as the Soviet-Polish border, the Polish administrative organs must be established west of the river). After the end of the military operations, the Polish Committee of National Liberation shall have full authority over civil affairs. The Soviet troops in Polish territory shall still be under the command of the Soviet military command, and the Polish armed personnel shall be under the command of the Polish Committee of National Liberation. The above provisions shall also apply to people outside the war zone.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News: The British believe that Prime Minister Mikolajczyk's visit to Moscow is the last opportunity for Soviet-Polish compromise. Those with keen eyes in Poland do not believe that Mikolajczyk can return to England from Moscow and have the Moscow authorities recognize the existing organization of the Polish government in exile. The Soviet Union may not receive Mikolajczyk as the head of government.

### Baltic States Oppose Soviet Rule

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Central News Agency - German News Agency News: According to the New York correspondent of the Reuter Daily, former Latvian Minister to the United States, Bilmanis, said yesterday that the people of the Baltic States are deeply concerned about the Soviet westward expansion.

The Soviet Union's rule over Latvia violates the will of the Latvian people, and Latvians are absolutely opposed to incorporating Latvia into the Soviet Union.

### Secret Activities of the United States in Spain; Donovan Goes to London

Vichy, 20th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News: American diplomatic activities in Madrid seem to have begun a new stage. This new act begins with the sudden departure of Donovan, the leader of American covert activities, for London. This sudden change of address can be seen as the end of Donovan's work in Spain. Colleagues close to Donovan and those with close ties to the Algiers Committee have recently frequented the American Embassy here, and it will probably take several days to determine the reason for Donovan's early departure from Madrid.

### German Defense in the Sangro Region is Smooth; US Lieutenant General McNair Killed in Action

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German military authorities announced on the 27th: The US First Army has launched an offensive in the Sangro area. The German army is also very active in this counterattack. A powerful American tank unit attempted to break through the German defensive positions between Koman and Sangro east of Sangro. Although a small salient was formed in the German positions, the German army crushed several American tank units and restored the original positions. The battle is still continuing. After large-scale bombing by the US military in the area between Vilt and Middle West of Sangro, it has finally broken through the German positions and advanced towards the Sangro-Courtensé railway, occupying Canigi. On the morning of the 27th, the US military attacked German on the Chinlo-Yerche highway, and another attack force advanced to Marini, attacking the 100 Highland west of Kurshi. The American offensive was supported by powerful artillery and a large number of bomber and fighter squadrons, but the German army has already begun a counter-offensive, which is quite smooth.

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News, the anti-Axis forces have advanced several kilometers west of Sangro and occupied the village of Marini in the southwest. The American tank team is advancing towards Courtensé. The American army obviously wants to cut off the German army in the Bierre-Le Sessé area, but the German counter-offensive has been quite successful. General Bradley's tank team was blocked east of Courtensé, and the US military suffered heavy losses west of Sangro.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News: The anti-Axis headquarters announced yesterday that US Lieutenant General McNair was killed in action on the Normandy front. McNair was the commander of the US Army Group. US Chief of Staff General Marshall once called him the brain trust of the army.

### German Generals Who Participated in the Rebellion

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to an official announcement last night: Generals Olbricht, Beck, and Hoepner participated in the July 20th rebellion. Olbricht was executed by firing squad after being tried by a military court. Former Chief of the General Staff, General Beck, committed suicide after being arrested. General Hoepner has been arrested and awaits trial.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports that among the three generals involved in the assassination attempt on the German leader, only former Chief of Staff General Beck was well-known to the German public. He was dismissed on October 31, 1938. On the evening of the 20th of this month, he committed suicide by gunshot after seeing the assassination fail. Although the rebels designated Beck as the head of civil administration, the actual person in charge was Infantry General Olbricht. He had obstructed various important decisions. He was an army general who served as a division commander in the Polish campaign. At the time of the rebellion, he was the Deputy Commander of the Home Army, and was therefore able to use military institutions to issue false orders to the army. He was executed by firing squad that night, at the age of only fifty-six. General Hoepner was dismissed at the end of 1941 after retreating on the Eastern Front. During the First World War, all three generals served in the General Staff. During the Polish campaign, General Hoepner served as the commander of a tank column, and in the French campaign, he served as the commander of the 16th Army Corps, which included tanks and motorized units.

### Turkish Ships Ordered to Cease Navigation in the Black Sea; Soviet Union Intensifies Diplomatic Activities Towards Turkey

### Berlin Closely Watches Turkey's Movements

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports that yesterday, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry pointed out that recent Turkish newspaper commentaries are the same as those of previous months. There are two main points: Turkey will fulfill its obligations to Britain; the Turkish government has decided to follow the sentiments of the people and not get involved in the vortex. So far, the German government has not heard any indication that the Turkish government has abandoned the above principles.

### Argentine Foreign Minister Elaborates on National Policy

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital: Argentine Foreign Minister General Bertier broadcast to the nation on the 26th, which is generally considered Argentina's response to the recent statement by US Secretary of State Hull. The main points are as follows: Argentina's fundamental national policies are to protect sovereignty and maintain solidarity with the Americas. Protecting sovereignty is different from isolation. On the one hand, Argentina will undertake all tasks to maintain solidarity with the Americas. Although it is now waiting for the United States to show a true attitude, Argentina has no reason to listen to the claims of other countries other than opposing the Axis powers. Argentina's special measures against the Axis powers are: severing communications with Japan and Germany; preventing espionage; blocking Axis communications and propaganda agencies; eliminating secret radio stations; imprisoning the crew of the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee," which was scuttled off Montevideo; supporting the Americas in participating in Pan-American plans; allowing non-belligerent privileges to countries opposing the Axis powers; and prohibiting Axis nationals from entering Argentina. The four policies for assisting countries opposing the Axis powers are: supplying the United States with necessary raw materials; reorganizing the Argentine merchant fleet to meet the urgent needs of the United States; severing economic ties with the Axis powers; and freezing Axis funds.

### Huge British and American Fleets Gather in the Western Mediterranean in an Attempt to Land Again in Northern Italy

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports that the resistance put up by German forces during their disengagement operations has slowed down the British and American advance in Italy. Reports from German reconnaissance planes over the Mediterranean show that British and American forces have concentrated a large fleet in the Western Mediterranean, including giant transports and landing craft. In addition, British forces have concentrated several divisions in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, indicating that British and American forces intend to land in the Genoa and La Spezia areas of northern Italy, according to their initial plans. The focus of the British and American offensive remains south of Florence, where fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of the highway leading from Poggi Bonzi and Montevarchi to Florence. The German defensive positions are entirely guarded by smaller rearguard units. The increased pressure from the British forces again met with strong German resistance on Wednesday.

### Exaggerated Figures from the United States

As both the Eastern and Western battlefields enter decisive stages, the munitions production figures of the various belligerent countries have become closely and inextricably linked to the outcome of the war. In particular, we in Japan must pay special attention to the ambition of the great enemy, the United States, to directly invade the Japanese mainland, as well as the movements of America's overwhelmingly large munitions production. The productive capacity constituted by the enemy's vast land and resources is indeed not to be underestimated. The United States' sudden change from island-hopping warfare to leapfrogging warfare in the Pacific cannot but be acknowledged as a result of the enemy's vast productive capacity. This is one reason why the quantity of material cannot be underestimated in modern warfare.

As the old saying goes, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." This is very applicable to material warfare in modern times. To counter fiery cannons, larger cannons are needed. To deal with tanks, use tanks. To strike at aircraft, use aircraft. Only in this way can victory be achieved. No one can experience the reality of modern warfare more deeply than we do today.

However, should we in Japan unconditionally fear the magnitude of American munitions production and the strategy constituted by the quantity of material? Certainly not. In June 1942, US War Production Board Chairman Nelson admitted that the US munitions industry had shown a state of "dizziness." As a result, some commentators speculated that US productive capacity would decline sharply and fall precipitously. However, the steady rise in US productive capacity over the subsequent two years and more has replenished the counter-offensive and ruthlessly shattered the errors of these commentators' speculations.

The reason for this error is that they have blindly ignored the truth behind the enemy's exaggerated production figures.

The most effective way to drive the modern American people, who pride themselves on being number one in the world and whose philosophy is to maintain their "way of life," into a long-term war is to rely on an inexhaustible supply of material. The main reason why the Roosevelt administration is working hard to promote the country's productive capacity at home and abroad is precisely this. However, since the start of the war, they have always avoided using real numbers and used false numbers when announcing the number of merchant ships built each time, exaggerating by about 25%.

The target for US merchant ship construction in 1944 was a fictitious 20 million tons, but the actual figure was 15.2 million tons. To the layman, this certainly seems like an astonishingly large number. Furthermore, on June 27 of this year, the US War Production Board released a revised munitions production index. Think carefully! The United States has already revised the production index three times. The first revision was one and a half years after the start of the war, changing the index that took September 1939 as 100% to taking November 1941 as 100%. To specifically study the revision, it is necessary to examine the content of the first standard. Taking tanks as an example, before the Second European War, the US tank production was no more than a hundred vehicles per month. The production of heavy tanks was no more than a few vehicles per year. Everyone knows this, and it has been a powerful excuse for magazines and newspapers to fiercely attack the government for not preparing for war. When the September 1939 standard was revised to the November 1941 standard, even if the tank production in 1941 was increased by 50%, this tank production cannot be considered huge. It was announced that it was increased by 50%, but in terms of actual production, it cannot be said to have increased. Therefore, the "vastness" of American munitions production capacity is only limited to written propaganda.

The second time, the content of munitions production was revised again. That is to say, the munitions items with lagging production were removed, and the impact of the entire index was strengthened in form. This time, the average amount in December 1943 was used as the standard. In this way, it is impossible to accurately grasp the actual production figures. The revision was carried out publicly in the formula, thus plunging the public into a fog and not allowing the slightest suspicion. But within this, there is a lot of painstaking deception by the US government.

The prefaces to American statistical books almost all contain the following interesting slogan without exception: "Human lies cannot be hidden forever, but numbers often cannot be revealed." The main point of American propaganda lies in promoting the quantity of material, while playing "mathematical magic" behind the propaganda. The purpose of the enemy's propaganda is to exaggerate the magnitude of its own quantity of material and shatter the morale of the other side, making the other side exclaim, "No matter how much we produce, we cannot catch up with the enemy." This is the American plot.

A spiritualism that lacks material is certainly dangerous, but a materialism that ignores the spirit is even more dangerous. What we most urgently need is a correct understanding of the enemy. If we can really do this, then there will be no "underestimating the enemy" phenomenon, nor will there be any "fearing the enemy" phenomenon. (Translated by An from the July 9 Yomiuri Hochi)

The Sugar Industry Specialized Committee will be abolished, and all sugar distribution tasks will be handled by the Sugar Industry Association.

### Shanghai Branch of Youth Cadre School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Mayor Chen Attended and Delivered a Speech

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Youth Cadre School, in order to cultivate cadres for the Youth Corps and to improve the organization of the Youth Corps in the city, specially selected cadres of all levels from the Municipal Corps authorities at the beginning of this month and implemented training at the Shanghai University College in Jiangwan, Shanghai. The training subjects are divided into spiritual education, military training, and ideological training. They also focused on training in the necessary academics and skills for training young people, as well as labor services to cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance of all students. Since the beginning of school, the graduation period has arrived yesterday. Therefore, a grand graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 am. Mayor Chen personally attended the inspection and delivered a speech. The details are as follows:

Inspection Situation

Mayor Chen arrived at the grand ceremony on time. In addition to Mr. Xiao Peiwen, the deputy director of the school, other senior officials from the city who attended included Liu Yangshan, the chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Lin Jiongan, the director of the Education Bureau, Lu Qi, the director of the Administrative Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, Zhao Zhengping, the president of Shanghai University (represented by Zhao Ruheng), Xu Tian, the director of the Economic Bureau, and dozens of Chinese and foreign guests. More than one hundred members of the First Regiment and the First District Corps of the Municipal Youth Corps also participated in the ceremony. The atmosphere was warm and the ceremony was very grand. The inspection ceremony began at 9:30. Under the command of Wu Pengfei, the captain of the team, all the students were agile and spirited. After the mayor and other senior officials inspected the field for a week, the passing-out parade began in the symphony of military music. The posture was heroic, the steps were neat, and the procession circled the field for a week before it was completed. The graduation ceremony began at 10:00. After all the attendees saluted, Mayor Chen delivered a speech in a sad and encouraging tone. The student representatives gave a reply. The China Film Company filmed a newsreel on the spot, and the ceremony ended at 11:00 am, followed by a photograph and adjournment.

Mayor's Speech

Mayor Chen's speech stated: "The promotion of the New Citizen Movement and the organization and training of young people are major issues in seeking national revitalization and construction. Since the establishment of the Republic of China more than 30 years ago, we have been talking about construction and revitalization almost every day. Until today, we have not been able to achieve our ideal goals. The main reason is that the people have failed to be organized and trained, and that national education has failed to be popularized. Although China truly has 400 million people and a vast territory, because national education has not been popularized, it is difficult to start organizing and training the people. Since the people have no organization and training, the people's minds are scattered, and the discipline is lost. The impact is that the country is declining and society is chaotic. The people are the elements that constitute the country. If the people are not united, how can they express their strength? They are already shaken in peacetime, and they feel difficult to cope with during the period of changing times. If we want to seek national wealth and strength in this way, wouldn't it be very difficult? On the contrary, even if a poor country, all the people, if there is organization and discipline, will be able to gradually become wealthy and strong from poverty. Therefore, if we want to seek revitalization and construction today, we can only organize the people and train the people, especially starting with organizing and training young people, and organizing and training ourselves, to be the example for the people and the model for young people. Only then can we make every citizen have a deep national concept and a selfless spirit. The main points of organizing and training young people and promoting the New Movement are here. I hope that after you students return, do not neglect this point, take the lead, practice the New Movement, and work hard to organize and train young people, so that we can gradually complete the great cause of national revitalization and construction."

The August 1st Chinese Restoration Day is approaching in a blink of an eye. The Municipal Propaganda Department is preparing various commemorative events by contacting various parties and actively carrying out various commemorative events in order to expand publicity. All the preparatory work has been basically completed. It is understood that the commemorative music concert to be held at the Grand Theater at 10:00 am on August 1st has also been scheduled.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Expands its Operations

The First Police Bureau of this city, in order to improve the lives of the police officers, the police consumer cooperative, with the support of all sectors and the fundraising of funds, purchased daily necessities at fair prices and distributed them to the police officers and their families. It has already been established and began to purchase and distribute. From August 1st, the first and second bureaus merged into the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, then its consumer cooperative also became the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau Cooperative. Therefore, all police officers of the second bureau can also participate in the cooperative as members and enjoy the right to distribution. It is actively promoting the purchase of goods and negotiating with relevant parties to ensure that daily necessities are distributed as much as possible and to stabilize the lives of police officers.

### The First Police Bureau Selects Special Senior Police Officers

The First Police Bureau of this city's Special High Section held an examination to select special senior police officers, divided into two types: investigators promoted to detectives and detectives promoted to investigators. In order to carefully select the candidates, an examination committee was established.

### Stamp Tax Bureau Designates Seven Distributors

The Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau believes that the purchase and posting of stamps by merchants and residents in the Shanghai urban area has become increasingly popular and complied with the law. Therefore, in recent months, those who purchased stamp tax tickets have been very enthusiastic. In order to prevent crowding and facilitate merchants and residents to purchase stamps, the bureau has specially designated seven salt shops as special stamp consignment points. In the future, merchants and residents can purchase stamps from the designated consignment points nearby. If the price is raised above the face value or handling fees are charged, they can report it to the bureau or the tax inspection department for punishment. The names and addresses of the seven special stamp consignment points are as follows: ① Yongdahe (524 Hankou Road) ② Yingfengxin (29 Dongxinqiao Street) ③ Xiexichangxiang (1249 Huashan Road) ④ Laoganfeng (1175 Xinzha Road) ⑤ Jinchangtai (34 South Huangpu Road) ⑥ Baochang (461 Changxing Road) ⑦ Zhaochang (9 Yiling Road, Xia Road).

### Huazhong Water and Electricity Company Stipulates Water Saving Guidelines and Sends Inspectors to Various Places

Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, because the water purification chemicals for tap water are mostly supplied by Japan, and the water delivery requires a large amount of electricity. Transportation is becoming increasingly difficult. In this decisive period, tap water must be further saved. Therefore, a tap water saving campaign is being implemented. It is hoped that users will not exceed 80% of their water consumption in June of this year in order to save water. The outline of water saving methods has been stipulated: Users are asked to strictly follow the guidelines: ① Tighten the faucets. ② The toilet should stop flowing water after use. ③ Do not use excessive water and do not use it for alcohol. ④ Do not release as much water as possible when washing clothes. ⑤ Fire-fighting water needs to be retained for a long time, but to avoid direct sunlight, it must be covered with a wooden lid. You can put small fish in the bucket to prevent the stored water from rotting. ⑥ If the faucet or toilet is damaged or leaking, it should be repaired as soon as possible. The organization of the inspection team will go to various places to inspect at any time, and users can make the most of it.

### Industry and Commerce Investigation Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Compiles Various Reports

Since the official establishment of the Industry and Commerce Enterprise Investigation Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in February of this year, it has spared no effort in promoting the investigation and statistics of Shanghai's corporate enterprises. Therefore, the results are very satisfactory. After the various statistical figures of the association were published in the newspapers a month ago, the economic community paid great attention to them. The reporter visited the person in charge of the association to understand the recent work of the association. "Since the establishment of the association, we have started the investigation of the contents of various companies of enterprises, real estate and listed stocks. We adopted an indirect method to distribute the forms to the respective companies to arouse the interest of the industrial and commercial circles in the investigation and fill them out automatically. Since the forms were distributed, most of them were able to fill them out and send them back. Only the real estate industry has not yet been completed. Now we have sorted out the received forms separately and initially counted the regular work, and compiled the industrial and commercial trend report on a monthly basis for the ministry's reference twice a month. The statistics on the establishment and capital increase of industrial and commercial enterprises in the first quarter of this year have been completed, and the statistical figures have been published in the newspapers in summary. Now the second quarter (summer) will also be completed and can be published for reference by all sectors. In addition, the investigation of the capital increase of various companies, etc., is designated by the ministry to be handled, and the investigation of many companies has been completed and reported separately. In the future, in addition to regular investigation and statistics, this association intends to study and analyze the data obtained and formulate countermeasures for the competent authorities to adopt and implement."

### Detention Center Seeks Donations of Medicines

The Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Branch, located within the Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, houses prisoners who have not yet been judged by the court or who are appealing their sentences. According to the branch chief, Hui Erfu, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the current hot weather makes prisoners in the detention centers more susceptible to disease. The branch currently holds approximately 600 to 700 prisoners, with about 40 to 50 suffering from illness. It is imperative to treat the sick promptly to prevent the spread of infection to other prisoners. However, due to limited funds, the branch relies on Mr. Hui's efforts to solicit medical supplies from outside sources, which have been largely successful. Various sectors have donated restorative agents, heart tonics, and various special injections. However, because the quantity used is so large, especially during this summer season when the number of patients increases, the center earnestly hopes for generous donations from charitable individuals from all walks of life.

### The Adjustment Problem of the Old Eight District Trolley Cars

— Jing

According to reports, the old eight district trolley cars are also considering reducing the number of vehicles and abolishing certain routes. Of course, we hope to still consider the convenience of passengers within the realm of possibility. Therefore, a general reduction of 30% in the number of vehicles on each existing route is uneconomical; arbitrarily abolishing certain routes is also not necessarily reasonable. We believe that the following principles must still be followed in handling this: abolish redundant routes and stops, have only one route of trolley car running on a street, appropriately shorten routes, increase the frequency of vehicle movement. Based on this principle, we propose a specific modification plan as follows:

Abolish tram routes No. 1, 2, 7, and 3, preserve route No. 10, and open a new route from Taishan Road Lingbao Road to Xujiahui.

Reason: The current routes No. 1, 2, 7, and 3 are mostly redundant and have relatively long routes. During non-office hours, trolley cars on Taishan Road are often connected end-to-end, moving at a snail's pace, and have few passengers. Now, merging the three routes into one, the number of vehicles used can be half or slightly more than the current total number of the three routes, and congestion can be prevented from becoming too severe. Route 10 has a significant impact on the residents of the eastern and southern districts of the old eight districts, and is the only route to and from the factory, so it can maintain its original state.

Abolish trolleybus route No. 18, while routes No. 17 and 24 are still difficult to maintain in their original state.

Reason: Routes 17 and 18 are mostly redundant. The only short segment of route 18 that route 17 does not pass through is from Shunchang Road Changxing Road to Xieqiao. Route 17, on the other hand, has a longer segment from Shunchang Road Changxing Road to Dapuqiao. Therefore, abolishing route 18 will not affect residents, while abolishing route 17 will cause inconvenience to a large number of residents, and the Nan City gates have now been generally opened, and Xieqiao is no longer an important entry and exit point. As for the reason why route 24 cannot be abolished, everyone knows it and there is no need to say more.

If route 22 bus can be maintained, it should be divided into two sections: one section from Xujiahui to Xiangshan Road on Luoyang Road, and the other section starting from the Bund, going to the Great World, and then not turning into Yuxia Road, but continuing west along Great Shanghai Road to Huashan Road on Luoyang Road as the focal point.

Reason: The current route 22 is too long, and passengers do not necessarily take long trips. If the latter section is straightened (without passing through Yuxia Road and West Lin'an Road) and extended westward, the actual length increase will be limited, but it can compensate for the inconvenience caused to western district residents by the abolition of route 7. Because route 22 had to go around in circles in the past due to the British and French concession lines, now that these border lines no longer exist and the old British-owned buses have also been discontinued, French-owned buses can of course operate on Great Shanghai Road, saving unnecessary detours. Moreover, because there are currently many vehicles on route 22, it will not feel too few after being divided into sections.

Of course, in any case, passenger congestion will be unavoidable in the future. Therefore, in addition to hoping for careful handling of the reduction of trolley car vehicles and the abolition of routes, we also hope that the French-owned trolley car company will implement a queuing system for boarding.

### Madame Lu's Death Anniversary: Saving Extravagance to Help the Poor

Mr. Lu Tongyan's letter: "Respectfully, the first anniversary of the death of my late wife, Madame Cheng, on the tenth day of the sixth lunar month. I have refrained from the vulgar practice of hiring monks to perform Buddhist rituals. Considering the current difficulties facing all, the hardships in making a living, and the prevalence of epidemics during the summer season, countless poor and sick people are in pain and have no way to be saved, which causes me great distress. Therefore, I have saved 1,000 yuan from expenses to contribute to your organization's poverty relief fund, as a token of my heart. I am aware that this is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, but I hope that fellow citizens in Shanghai will echo this sentiment and accumulate little by little. Moreover, with the Ghost Festival approaching, filial sons and grandchildren should save expenses for ancestral rites and contribute to helping the poor and sick, which will create boundless blessings. Even if the ancestors in the afterlife are aware, they will also feel comforted. One."

### Student Aid News

### Student Standing Guard Should be Scheduled Outside of Class Time: A Letter from the First Police Bureau's Baojia Division

The Shanghai Special City First Police Bureau's Baojia Division writes: "Respectfully, your newspaper published an article by Mr. Shen Qiye on July 25th, 'The Problem of Students Standing Guard,' which stated that the Lianbao Office always assigns students from the student self-defense corps to stand guard during class time, and despite repeated requests, it is ineffective. If they go to stand guard, they will miss their studies; if they do not stand guard, they must pay 50 yuan each time, which is unaffordable, etc. After investigating, the regulations for reducing and exempting service for the first district's self-defense corps stipulate that students must serve during their spare time, which has been announced and implemented. Standing guard cannot be replaced by others, and this has also been ordered to be followed. In the future, if the above-mentioned situation occurs and negotiations are ineffective, you may directly report it to the second section of this office for investigation and handling."

Blood and Tears (6)

Submarine No. 43 in 1924, Submarine I-63 in 1939. The determination and attitude of the crew members when they encountered the disaster were very calm and worthy of emulation by future generations. "There were also those who were in the submarine and could not float out. I believe that the attitude of all the crew members at that time was typical of soldiers facing death as if returning home. I will explain the reasons for this below. In short, on the occasion of the disaster of Submarine No. 43, all the crew members knew about it in advance." He continued to say the above.

The disaster of Submarine No. 43 occurred on the morning of March 19 of that year, during an overseas exercise in Sasebo, when it collided with the warship Tatsuta. The periscope was broken, and water entered from near the conning tower, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea in an instant. At the same time as it sank, it released a life-saving buoy, so the rescue team knew the location of the submarine and could contact it by telephone. This means that there would be living people inside the submarine. But this was not all, and it would be known immediately. As soon as the submarine sank, the barriers in all places were immediately closed, so the crew members were cut off from each other. However, the voices heard on the telephone were those of Sergeant-Major Anaumi, Lieutenant Ogawa, the engine operator in the engine room, and seventeen others including Lieutenant Kwanichi Ichimura, who were alive. At the same time as they encountered the disaster, they had used the telephone to inquire about the safety of Commander Kuwashima, the skipper, and others at the headquarters, but there was no response. In fact, at that time, the captain and others had already died. Nevertheless, the telephone from the bottom of the sea reported the condition inside the submarine, and at the same time, they kept asking, "Are the skipper and the first mate safe?" At the same time, the engine room began to have difficulty breathing, and they continued to inquire about the skipper's safety in their gasping voices.

Honestly speaking, since the invention of the telephone, this was the first time there had been such a tragic and heart-wrenching call. Death was approaching moment by moment, and finally, the cry of "Long live the Emperor!" The gasping sound could no longer be heard on the telephone, and they finally drowned. The sinking location of Submarine No. 43 was in the place where the currents were the most rapid. It took more than a month to salvage the hull. Later, it was discovered that in addition to the eighteen people in the engine room, there were fourteen survivors in the torpedo room and the temporary room. Each of them had a will in their clothing. Lieutenant Ogawa and others in the engine room also had wills left behind. Sergeant-Major Onizuka's will was written in block letters for the sake of his beloved child, Nengrang. Among them, Sergeant-Major Anaumi's will was a long essay, not only recording the details of the sinking, but also giving many instructions to his virtuous wife and beloved child. The will stated that his wife could remarry.

When I left home, I already knew that death was coming. There are no more unfinished thoughts. Namu Amida Butsu!

The sergeant even made such a joke. (125)

### Exhaustion of Enemy Manpower and Resources; Domestic Difficulties Fully Exposed; Statement by Minister Matsushima

Yesterday (the 28th), Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, followed his usual practice of hosting a reception for the Chinese press corps at the naval attaché's office and issued a statement. Excerpts of the key points are as follows:

American Manpower Approaching Exhaustion

The United States is currently engaged in warfare on both the Eastern and Western fronts, resulting in a massive loss of manpower. Particularly in the Pacific theater, the figures are so enormous that the American military authorities are making every effort to conceal them. Judging from the inconsistencies and contradictions in the figures of past losses released by the United States, it is clear that there is deep-seated distress within the country. According to reliable sources, the United States now has only slightly more than three divisions of mobile reserve forces. Regarding the Mariana Islands battlefront, the United States will re-deploy divisions engaged in warfare elsewhere to replenish them. The heroic sacrifices of the Japanese forces in Saipan inflicted significant damage on the enemy, forcing them to fight a bloody war. This achieves the ideal objective of the Japanese forces, making the enemy's advance benefit the Japanese situation. According to a New Delhi dispatch dated the 25th of this month, President Roosevelt, in view of the urgency of the Pacific war situation, has signed and implemented a plan to increase the number of active-duty soldiers by 200,000. From the opposite perspective of this news, it is clear that the losses in the American Pacific war are so great that they cannot be replenished without 200,000 additional personnel. In a previous press conference, it was mentioned that the enemy's manpower losses in Saipan must be over 100,000, which can now be confirmed. Furthermore, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Navy Department on June 22, the total manpower losses of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard since the start of the war amounted to 220,006 dead, 9,522 missing, and 4,469 captured, for a total of 49,575 personnel. Additionally, Nimitz announced that the American troop losses in the Saipan operation were approximately 15,000. Combining these figures and considering Roosevelt's proposal to supplement with 200,000 personnel, it is worthy of contemplation. A discerning person can naturally deeply discern where the key lies.

Chongqing's Manpower Will Be Exploited: Nimitz has repeatedly clamored that it is necessary to fight against Japan on the Chinese mainland. The purpose is to exploit the resources of the Chinese people. Recently, Wallace also strongly emphasized this necessity upon returning to the United States. He believes that only by using American weapons to drive the Chinese people to fight against Japan can the loss of American soldiers be replenished. Nimitz strongly advocated this after the Gilbert Islands operation. Recently, Nimitz is deeply concerned that this argument will be met with resentment from the Chinese people, and has slightly changed his position, stating that even if they reach the Chinese mainland, they will use naval operations to replace land warfare, in order to avoid dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Observing the American war situation from another perspective, it appears to be advancing on the surface, but in fact, the enemy has been lured by the clever operations of the Japanese army, and the cost of continuing to fight is bleeding them dry. We firmly believe that "things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme," and we will see the United States exhaust its manpower resources, suffer a setback, and be defeated.

US Forbids Families to Communicate with Soldiers

After the American troops landed on Saipan Island, they broadcast announcements prohibiting the families of soldiers in the United States from communicating with soldiers engaged in combat. This prohibition on all communication indicates that the situation is urgent and becoming more pressing by the day.

American Aims to Enslave East Asia

During his recent trip home, Wallace expressed his so-called travel impressions, saying that the American way of life is the best way of life and that people in all the countries he visited expressed admiration for the American way of life. He also said that after the war, American materials and Asian resources could be used to seek American prosperity, and that the future development of Asia must be included within the American West Coast. From this, it can be seen that the real purpose of the American war is to enslave all the people of Asia. It is definitely not the beautiful goal that Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Song Meiling have long admired.

Habitual Contempt for China and Japan

Recently, some American airmen in China were captured. One of them, after graduating from college, was sent to China after six months of training. He received training in Kunming, Guilin, and other places. After being captured, he was extremely arrogant. When asked about his impression of the Chinese people, he replied that there is absolutely no nation in the world as inferior as the Chinese nation. When asked about his impression of the Japanese people, he said that, of course, they are the same as the Chinese. When asked what he thought of Chinese women, he said that his initial impression of them was not good, and after interacting with them, his impression became even worse. Recently, one day, I passed Jiangwan Road and witnessed an interesting event that I would like to share with you. That day, two vehicles carrying American and Filipino prisoners of war were traveling on Jiangwan Road. When they saw several Japanese women coming towards them, the Filipino prisoners in the front vehicle gestured to the Japanese women to welcome them, while the American prisoners in the rear vehicle pretended to ignore them and looked sideways. As the two vehicles continued to advance, they encountered several Chinese women and children on the left side of the road. The Filipino prisoners continued to act as before, while the American prisoners threw cigarette butts at the women and children. From these two sets of facts, it can be seen that the American habit of despising the Chinese and Japanese people has become ingrained. It is said that some Chinese people in Shanghai are still eagerly hoping for the arrival of the Americans. These facts can be used for reference by such people.

German New Weapons Scare Americans

Germany has recently used a new type of weapon on the Eastern Front, the V1 "flying bomb" and the V2 "one-man midget submarine." The detailed names are not yet known. The great destructive power has frightened the United States and Britain. The U.S. Secretary of Propaganda expressed astonishment at the new weapons, but after hearing about the structure and combat power of this new German weapon, it is said that his heart stopped for a minute.

### Suspension of Publication of Japan's Two Major Magazines, "Kaizo" and "Chuo Koron"

The Chuo Koronsha and Kaizosha, two publishing houses with a long history in the Japanese publishing industry, were reorganized into comprehensive magazines and current affairs magazines named "Kaizo" and "Chuo Koron," respectively, in accordance with the Enterprise Consolidation Order of March of this year. However, recently, in the business policies of the two companies, there have been facts that are difficult to tolerate in terms of guiding national thought. The Information Bureau resolutely declared that the two companies should voluntarily suspend publication. At 3:00 PM on the 10th, Hashimoto, the Second Director of the Information Bureau, summoned Yamamoto Takahiko, the president of Chuo Koronsha, and informed him of this intention. Both companies understood this intention and voluntarily suspended publication. Chuo Koronsha was established in the Meiji 20th year as a magazine of the Hanseikai. From the 33rd year, it published "Chuo Koron." In the Showa 4th year, it welcomed the current president, Shimanaka, and has been a dominant force in the publishing industry for 59 years until today. Currently, the company publishes two magazines, "Chuo Koron" and "Illustrated Science," both of which have been suspended. Kaizosha was founded in the Taisho 8th year. "Kaizo" magazine ceased publication in June of this year. The two magazines "Tanka Kenkyu" and "Jikyoku Kenkyu" will also cease publication in the future. As a result of the closure of these two companies, only two comprehensive magazines, "Gendai" and "Koron," remain. (Translated from the July 11th Mainichi Shimbun)

Special Edition on Social Insurance
— Ding Mocun

### Social Insurance Over the Past Year

This Bureau began implementing the city's compulsory labor insurance on July 22 of last year, and it has now been exactly one year. Here, the progress made over the past year is specifically described below:

Number of Insured Persons

According to the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance, social insurance was originally divided into two types: compulsory labor insurance and general occupational insurance. The former stipulates that all employees working in factories, mines, or engaged in dangerous or unsanitary work are insured under compulsory labor insurance. The latter insures employees engaged in the same business or officials serving in the same institution or organization. After the establishment of this Bureau, Shanghai was designated as the national center of industry and commerce. Therefore, compulsory labor insurance was first implemented in this city. A notice was issued on July 22, and personnel were dispatched to factories to encourage them to purchase insurance. Thanks to the assistance of the city's industrial community, relevant agencies, and trade associations, the number of insured factories has reached 2,065 in the past year, with 57,764 insured persons. The statistical data of the number of insured factories and insured persons by industry is as follows:

(Note) The "Other" category includes more than 30 industries such as shoe manufacturing, ink manufacturing, gas lamps, woodwork, rice noodles, ceramics, tin foil, celluloid, cotton batting, toothbrushes, cakes, ready-made clothes, milk powder, leather shoes, box manufacturing, electric welding, sawing, box-making, instruments, paint, alcohol, seasoning, thermos bottles, metal wire, and oil extraction. Since the number of insured persons in each industry is less than 100, they are not listed separately.

Premium Income

As for the insurance premium rate, except for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers who have separate regulations due to the special nature of their work; the compulsory labor insurance for general factories is based on the standard remuneration of the insured persons, and the employers are responsible for paying 50% of the insurance premium. In the past year, the total insurance premium income was 424,460 yuan. The monthly cumulative number of insured persons in each factory, the insurance premium income, and the average burden per insured person are statistically shown as follows:

Benefit Expenditures

The employer's obligation to the insurer (this Bureau) is the payment of insurance premiums, while the insurer's obligation to the insured has three aspects: first, insurance benefit expenses; second, medical facility expenses; and third, business maintenance expenses. The insurance premium income and the average burden per insured person have already been mentioned above. Now, the insurer's obligations to the insured are explained separately:

A. Insurance Benefits: Insurance benefits refer to the subsidies provided by this Bureau to the insured when they suffer economic losses due to insurance accidents (such as injury, illness, disability, death, and childbirth of female workers) occurring while performing their duties. The statistical data of expenditures in the past year is as follows (amounts below one thousand yuan are not included):

Benefit Items; Amount
Actual Medical Expenses 1,069,000 yuan
Sickness Allowance 214,000 yuan
Injury Allowance 216,000 yuan
Childbirth Allowance 185,000 yuan
Disability Allowance 103,000 yuan
Funeral Expenses 112,000 yuan
Survivors' Pension 138,000 yuan
Total 2,037,000 yuan

B. Medical Facilities: Medical facility expenses refer to the special facility expenses used by this Bureau to improve the health of the insured, which is different from the actual medical situation in the aforementioned insurance benefits. It includes health guidance, medical equipment, important medicines, and diagnostic equipment, etc. The expenditure figure for the past year was 1,000,598 yuan.

C. Business Maintenance Expenses: This includes necessary expenses related to business operations, such as salaries of business personnel, printing, paper, contract surveys, etc. The expenditure figure for the past year was 1,503,052 yuan.

The total of the three items is 4,540,312 yuan, exceeding the total annual insurance premium income by 300,000 yuan. The average monthly expenditure is 378,359 yuan. According to the above statistical data, insurance benefits account for 45%, medical facility expenses account for 22%, and business maintenance expenses account for 33%.

Special Insurance

Due to the special circumstances of the social insurance for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers in this city, separate business committees were organized to handle them specifically. The progress made in the past year is as follows:

(A) Number of Insured Persons: The number of insured persons under the social insurance for tricycle drivers is 7,160, and the number of insured persons under the social insurance for rickshaw pullers is 35,777 (both are cumulative figures up to the end of June of this year).

(B) Insurance Premiums and Income: Due to the special nature of their work, the income of tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers is different from the standard remuneration of general factory workers. Therefore, the collection of insurance premiums for social insurance for tricycle drivers is calculated based on the number of trips, with each trip initially charged an insurance premium of 30 cents, which was recently changed to 50 cents. From October of last year to the end of June of this year, the total insurance premium income was 1,132,505 yuan. The average monthly income is 124,361 yuan. The average monthly burden per insured person is only about 1 yuan. The insurance premium for rickshaw pullers is calculated based on the number of shifts per vehicle, averaging 42 yuan per month per rickshaw. From November of last year to the end of June of this year, the total income was 2,044,148 yuan. The average monthly income is 255,518 yuan. The average monthly burden per insured person is also only about 20 yuan.

(C) Obligations to the Insured: The classified total of the annual expenditures of the two business committees for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers is as follows (amounts below one thousand yuan are not included): Health Implementation

The purpose of social insurance is to improve national health and stabilize the lives of workers. When an unexpected accident occurs to an insured person, in addition to providing actual medical treatment, this Bureau also provides various allowances. The situation of benefits and payments has been described above. However, medical facilities are not only for treating the insured but also for actively improving health. The implementation of health work over the past year is explained as follows:

(A) Special Contracted Hospitals: In order to implement health work, in addition to directly establishing medical clinics and the First, Second, and Third Clinics, this Bureau also selects hospitals with complete city equipment and hires them as special contracted hospitals, including Tongde (various departments), Nanyang (various departments), Yihe (surgery), Dade (various departments), Leren (various departments), Hudong (various departments), Puan (various departments), Qu Zhibu (various departments), Weiguang (various departments), Dongnan (various departments), Shengsheng (internal medicine and obstetrics), Daduan (various departments), Guanghua Eye Hospital (ophthalmology), and the municipal Nanshi, Huxi, Pudong hospitals, and Gaoqiao hospitals.

(B) Mobile Clinics: In order to improve the health of workers and prevent diseases, a mobile clinic vehicle was set up to organize a mobile clinic team, which went to various factories daily for mobile clinic services. In addition to providing timely treatment for the diseases of the insured, they also provided detailed instructions on improving the sanitary equipment of various factories and improving the health of workers, and implemented various preventive vaccinations and vaccinations according to the season.

(C) Number of People Treated for Diseases: In the past year, the statistical data of the number of people treated for diseases at this Bureau's medical clinics, the First, Second, and Third Clinics, the mobile clinic team, and various special contracted hospitals is as follows:

(Internal Medicine) Colds 6,412 people. Tracheobronchitis 7,684 people. Gastrointestinal diseases 1,035 people. Rheumatic joint pain 723 people. Neurasthenia 315 people. Malaria 1,132 people. Typhoid fever 35 people. Epilepsy 2 people. Pulmonary tuberculosis 921 people. Pleurisy 121 people. Beriberi 241 people. Gout 18 people. Arrow eyes 12 people. Pneumonia 21 people. Intestinal tuberculosis 12 people. Dengue fever 2 people. Arthritis 75 people.

(Surgery) Work-related injuries 6,772 people. Lower limb ulcers 5,143 people. Sores 3,216 people. Eczema 1,389 people. Frostbite 524 people. Scabies 530 people. Periostitis 8 people. Bone tuberculosis 6 people. Burns 691 people. Hemorrhoids 345 people. Cellulitis 32 people. Appendicitis 28 people. Tumors 12 people. Erysipelas 10 people.

(Ophthalmology) Trachoma 2,100 people. Conjunctivitis 324 people. Keratitis 102 people. Ocular muscle paralysis 416 people. Ocular muscle granuloma 316 people. Retinitis 218 people. Corneal foreign body 501 people. Corneal injury 69 people. Eye injury 4 people.

(ENT) Otitis 314 people, sore throat 124 people. Rhinitis 99 people. Tonsillitis 2 people. Toothache 41 people. Brain line inflammation 21 people. Other diseases: Gonorrhea 5 people. Urethritis 14 people. Anthrax 2 people.

Preventive injections and vaccinations 3,096 people. Lymphangitis 2 people. Syphilis 20 people.

Additional Remarks

The general situation of this Bureau's work over the past year has been described above. Upon inspection, the number of insured factories has indeed accounted for more than half of the city's total, but the number of workers insured only accounts for about one-thirtieth of the general estimate, which is regrettable. However, it is considered that social insurance is a new undertaking in our country. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation, there were very few factory owners who could fully understand and trust it. For example, in the yarn factory industry, only a few people came to the Bureau to purchase insurance at first, and some reported fewer workers than the actual number. After a few months, they saw that the Bureau's payment numbers for insurance accidents among the industry's workers were indeed very large, especially for the funeral expenses and survivors' pensions of deceased workers. They were able to quickly compensate the full amount. Therefore, not only did most factories come to purchase insurance, but also those who had not purchased insurance came to complete the procedures for additional insurance. If given time to establish norms, it will be possible to achieve the expected goals. It is hoped that the industrial community will be aware that stabilizing the lives of workers during this wartime period is a prerequisite for strengthening the strength of society and the country. Social insurance is indeed a necessary measure to address current needs. It is hoped that they will continue to cooperate and promote it so that this type of undertaking can be spread everywhere.

Fines

Why should labor insurance be compulsory? Here is a ready-made metaphor: just as vaccination is compulsory in order to achieve widespread epidemic prevention, labor insurance is also the same. In order to seek widespread stability in the lives of workers, it is necessary to use the law to enforce it.

Therefore, factories that refuse to provide compulsory labor insurance for their employees must be subject to fines. The compulsory labor insurance fine rules set by the Ministry of Social Resources are divided into two parts: first, factories that refuse to purchase insurance are fined up to 10,000 yuan; second, factories that fail to pay insurance premiums overdue are fined based on the number of days overdue and the percentage of the amount due. As for those who falsely report the number of insured persons and the standard remuneration in each factory, if it is found to be true, the difference will be doubled. Article 9 of the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance stipulates that the fines shall be decided by the Insurance Bureau. If the fines are not paid within ten days after the announcement, the police or court may be requested to enforce them. Factories that have been penalized must still purchase insurance or pay fees.

### Social Insurance Bureau Anniversary

The Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been established for a year. In order to clarify the current status of social insurance implementation to all sectors, the bureau will hold its anniversary celebration at the Medical Capital Garden on Taixing Road at 5:00 PM this (29th) afternoon, and a tea party will be held to entertain leaders from all walks of life in the city and owners of insured factories. Ding Mocun of the Ministry of Social Welfare will personally attend to give instructions. The bureau has also specially compiled charts and photographs, totaling more than 50 types, to showcase the implementation of social insurance over the past year. These will be displayed and exhibited publicly at the venue.

(1) The machinery industry has the most insured factories, followed by the cotton textile and silk textile industries.

(2) The average monthly burden for each insured person in the past year was 35.50 yuan, while the benefits they received were: insurance benefits of 18 yuan, medical facility costs of 9 yuan, and business maintenance costs of 12 yuan, totaling 39 yuan. In other words, the Social Insurance Bureau had to bear an expenditure of 3.50 yuan per month for each insured person.

(3) According to statistics, on average, one in ten people is injured while performing their duties.

### Small Statistics

(4) Business maintenance costs refer to the salaries of salespersons, contract investigations, printing paper, collection, and other administrative expenses. A total of 1.5 million yuan was spent in eleven months, averaging only 135,000 yuan per month, and each insured person bears only 10 yuan per month. However, it is reported that the business maintenance expenses spent by the bureau in the first month required each insured person to bear about 65 yuan, while now it is 7 yuan, a ratio of ten to one. Therefore, the more insured people there are, the less the insured person bears for business maintenance costs.

(5) Under the insurance benefits item, actual medical expenses account for more than one-half, and other subsidies are mostly for diseases and injuries. According to records, one worker enjoyed benefits of more than 37,000 yuan due to illness for the actual medical portion. Recently, each outpatient visit costs an average of about 70 yuan in medical expenses. Initially, it was only 20 yuan, but recently it requires 110 yuan because the price of medical materials has also risen along with general commodity prices.

(6) The average mortality rate of rickshaw pullers is two deaths per week.

(7) On average, four out of ten iron factory workers, rickshaw pullers, and tire drivers suffer from lower limb ulcers.

### Standard Remuneration Calculation Method

1.  The standard remuneration referred to in Article 7 of the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance and the insurance application form refers to all remuneration obtained by laborers through labor. Compulsory labor insurance is based on this standard remuneration as the basis for calculating insurance premiums. If the insured person encounters incidents such as sickness allowances, injury allowances, maternity allowances, disability allowances, or survivor's pensions, the insurance benefits will also be calculated based on the standard remuneration.

2.  Standard remuneration is divided into four items: wages, allowances, other, and total. Their meanings are explained one by one as follows:

Wages: Refers to the salary or remuneration earned by an employee of an enterprise for working for the owner.

Allowances: Refers to allowances obtained by employees for working for the owner in addition to salary or remuneration, such as rice allowances, housing allowances, and living allowances.

Other: Refers to remuneration obtained by employees for working for the owner in addition to the above two items. For example, if the factory provides meals, the amount converted from the meal expenses will be included in this item. The meal conversion is temporarily calculated at 800 yuan.

Total: Refers to the total amount of wages, allowances, and other remuneration (such as the converted amount for meals) obtained by employees for working for the owner.

3.  Standard remuneration is calculated on a monthly basis in principle. For those paid annually, it is one-twelfth of the annual salary. For those paid on a daily basis, it is 30 times the daily wage. If the salary is calculated by the hour, by piece, or the income is unstable, it is calculated by one-third of the total income obtained in the 90 days before the date of determining the standard remuneration.

4.  If the insured person has difficulties in calculating standard remuneration or the calculation is improper, the Insurance Bureau may calculate the standard remuneration by appropriate methods. For example:

Standard remuneration is the average monthly income. It should be calculated according to the actual situation. For example, when calculating the standard remuneration according to Article 3, if the specified period happens to be due to special circumstances or work stoppage due to illness for many days, the calculated amount of standard remuneration must be too low. It is fair to calculate it based on the actual number of working days.

If the salary is calculated on a daily basis but the actual number of working days per month is less than 30 days, it should also be calculated according to the actual situation.

If there are seasonal businesses, where income increases or decreases significantly during a certain period, the Insurance Bureau may handle it with reference to the actual situation.

5.  When an insured person has more than one job at the same time, the remuneration from each job should be combined.

6.  Explanation of meal expense conversion:

According to the standard remuneration of the insured person filled in by general insured persons, the average for those who do not provide meals is more than 1,000 yuan, while those who provide meals are less than 200 yuan, and some maintain the wages from five years ago. In terms of monetary calculation, the former is obviously more than the latter, but in reality, the latter is better than the former. For the collection of insurance premiums, if only calculated based on the amount, the latter is certainly less than the former, but the insurance benefits enjoyed, except for actual medical care, others such as injury allowances, sickness allowances, etc., are also calculated proportionally, and the loser is still the insured person. In this case, the amount converted from the food should be included in the calculation.

The conversion of meal expenses is based on price valuation. Currently, ordinary meal expenses, such as completely allocated rice, plus fuel and vegetable expenses, require more than 1,000 yuan per month for two meals per person. If calculated based on the fixed price of catered meals, each meal costs more than 3,000 yuan. In order to reduce the payment of insurance premiums, a uniform calculation of 800 yuan is used for the time being.
