### After the Restoration of Rationed Household Rice

The city's household rice is about to be restored for rationing, which has been formally announced by the municipal authorities and the Shanghai office of the Allied embassies respectively. In yesterday's short commentary, we briefly discussed its significant meaning. We have always considered the rice and grain issue as the most important aspect of people's livelihoods. Therefore, we have repeatedly elaborated on it without fear of being tiresome in the past. Whenever we saw that the authorities' measures were inadequate, we would not hesitate to brave the cold and offer stern criticism. Our basic stance is to improve the people's livelihood. Therefore, we naturally cannot ignore the rice and grain issue, on which people's lives depend. Therefore, we still maintain this attitude and offer our humble opinions as follows:

Reviewing the rice and grain issue of the past year, simply put, it has gradually deteriorated in the midst of chaotic handling. On the one hand, some people took the opportunity to pursue exorbitant profits and did not hesitate to raise rice prices. As Mayor Chen said, "Nanjing and Shanghai are both metropolises, only six hours apart by train. I really don't understand why the rice price in Nanjing is around 3,000 yuan today, while it reaches 10,000 yuan in Shanghai. I think it's not just poor planning, but deliberate poor planning." That is to say, the high rice price in Shanghai is due to artificial reasons, that is, speculation by profiteers. However, the speculators' tricks can only succeed if there is an exploitable environment first. As the saying goes, things must rot from within before worms can grow. For example, the Rice Control Committee's implementation of the method of requisitioning all rice over five dou not long ago gave speculators the opportunity to raise prices, and then rice prices soared wildly. As for some people, they used their special power or convenience in their positions to collude with unscrupulous merchants to raise rice prices and profit from them. For example, the Gu Zhouhou and Hu cases that have been discovered, and cases similar to the Gu Zhou case that have not been discovered.

On the other hand, passive remedial methods were used in an attempt to level out rice prices, but their effectiveness was weak. For example, the municipal government of this city consulted the Rice Control Committee to change the policy to not requisitioning rice below ten dan. Public opinion called for abandoning requisitioning in order to ease the rice supply. Although it had a positive effect on the rice price decline, the forces of justice were never able to eliminate the speculative atmosphere. Handling a matter carefully and diligently, but with little benefit and many drawbacks, or harmful and useless, this is "poor planning," which, to a certain extent, is still excusable. Handling a matter with bad intentions and doing everything possible to do evil, the result will inevitably be unfavorable and harmful. This is "deliberately causing it to be hidden," which is unforgivable no matter what.

In the past year, the citizens of Shanghai have struggled to breathe under the pressure of rising rice prices. However, the citizens of Shanghai still endured life with the most arduous emotions. Why? Because Shanghai is an important rear base in the Greater East Asia War, and maintaining security is of utmost importance. Every citizen has this responsibility and this awareness. However, there is a limit to the extent to which citizens can endure a difficult life, which depends entirely on how well the authorities grasp it.

Now the Allied forces have won a great victory in Chaoshan. "When Hunan is ripe, the world is sufficient." Hunan's rice production ranks third in the country. Therefore, after this victory in the Xiang War and the occupation of rice-producing areas, a portion of rice and grain can be transported to remedy the food supply for the rear. At this time of the "green and yellow juncture" (the period between the exhaustion of the previous year's harvest and the ripening of the new crop), this remedy and restoration of rationing is the best time and has great significance economically and politically.

However, rationing must be maintained for a long period, which depends on a continuous source of supply. Therefore, restoring rationing is still a palliative measure. The fundamental solution, we believe, lies in how to统筹收买 (plan and purchase in a unified way) and set prices when the new grain comes on the market soon? How to study reasonable plans for the future based on past failures is the most urgent task today. If we want to completely and properly solve the food problem of the people, the relevant authorities should pay attention to it as soon as possible.

### The Japanese Prime Minister's Regular Broadcast States His Determination to Complete the War; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Reports on Diplomacy at the Cabinet Meeting Yesterday Morning

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese cabinet held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 am on the 4th. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. Regarding the matter of clarifying the government's determination to complete the war on the scheduled 8th, it was decided that Prime Minister Koiso would broadcast it via radio on the 8th. After that, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu reported on recent diplomatic issues. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 pm.

### Air Raids on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima; Fierce Battles on Saipan, Enemy Forces Suffer Heavy Losses

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain base in the Central Pacific states that enemy warplanes in powerful formations attacked Iwo Jima twice and Chichi Jima three times on the morning of the 4th. Furthermore, by the afternoon of the 4th, more than ten cruisers and destroyers appeared in the waters east of Chichi Jima.

Central Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Saipan continued to wage extremely fierce battles against the American forces that had broken through to the last line of Japanese resistance in the southern capital of the island. In the three days from July 29th to 31st, the Japanese army inflicted the following losses on the enemy: 250 enemy corpses were left behind, and 8 were wounded. Since the enemy landed, the total number of enemy casualties has reached 5,950.

The Chongqing-US Air Force Has Weak Activity; The Japanese Army Encirclement of Hengyang is Underway

Hunan Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to curb the attacks of the Japanese air force, the Chongqing-US Air Force has recently attacked various places with hundreds of planes every day, attempting to suppress the Japanese defense zone. The Japanese ground forces and transport teams have also fought fiercely in response. Since the start of this operation, the ground forces have indeed shot down more than 60 Chongqing-US aircraft. The gate city of Hunan has already fallen, and Hengyang, the key fortress of the Central Plains, is again under heavy siege. In addition, the Chongqing-US Air Force has suffered extremely large threats, as more than a dozen of its South China bases have been completely lost. The attempted counterattack has been completely ineffective, and has also drawn criticism from the people of Chongqing. Therefore, the US planes have obviously had to launch a Mokugeki (literally "wooden eye") offensive. Since late June, their activities have been focused on surprise attacks on undefended Japanese bases, concentrating their main force to bomb Japanese-occupied cities, roads, and waterways, avoiding air combat with enemy planes. The Chongqing-US planes often attack at dawn and dusk, and mostly use six to twelve B- or B-25 bombers, using B-40 fighters for cover. When Japanese boats and vehicle units are discovered, all bombs are dropped and they leave. From late June to July 10, the Japanese ground air defense forces confirmed the shooting down of eight aircraft, and more than thirty unconfirmed aircraft, averaging one aircraft shot down per day. In addition, due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force in the past few days, the US Air Force bases in southwestern China are also on the verge of collapse, and their activities have also weakened.

Advances Achieved on All Fronts

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The war situation of the Japanese army in various aspects is as follows: China Front: The land-based Japanese army is still continuing to besiege Hengyang, and is besieging the reinforcements to Hengyang everywhere, heavily damaging the Chongqing army tanks coming from the Sixth and Ninth War Zones. (A) The Japanese army in the area east of the Xiang River completely defeated the Chongqing army's 58th and 72nd armies in the southern area of Pingxiang, and attacked and defeated the defeated Chongqing army, occupying Lianhua, a key point 50 kilometers south of Pingxiang on the 1st of the month, and is still continuing to attack. In the southern area of Anren, the Japanese army is using mobile units to besiege the main force of the Chongqing 37th Army and parts of the 24th and 44th Armies, and is currently launching an annihilation operation. The Chongqing army on the front of Laiyang has shown some active movements since July 28. The Japanese army is currently launching effective attacks on its attempts to move. (B) In the area west of the Xiang River, the Chongqing military authorities are currently dispatching their 100th Army and 79th and 62nd Armies separately, departing from the west and southwest of Hengyang, urgently seeking to break the Japanese army's siege of Hengyang. However, after being attacked by the Japanese army in various places, they have been heavily damaged. Air War: The Japanese air force, in addition to assisting land battles, has repeatedly bombed Chongqing military bases in Guilin, Liuzhou, Zhijiang, etc., causing the US planes that are gathering there to collapse. As a result, the number of US planes attacking the Chaozhou-Shantou battlefield has decreased. In addition, the forward bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, such as Liyong, Suichuan, Nanxiong, etc. east of the Yuehan Line, have been lying dormant due to the suppression of the Japanese air force, so these bases have almost completely lost their effectiveness. Due to the integrated offensive led by the Japanese army on land and in the air, the attempt by the Chongqing planes to attack the Japanese mainland from bases in southeastern China and disrupt the maritime transportation routes of the Greater East Asia has now been completely crushed. However, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is still actively supplying aircraft and various military supplies through the Chongqing-India transportation route. The Chongqing side recently boasted that it can use more than 150 transport aircraft every day for transportation, and its monthly transportation volume is about 18,000 tons.

### The Japanese Army Strengthens Pressure on Hengyang; Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency)

According to a report from Reuters' Chongqing correspondent on the 3rd, the war situation in Hengyang is as follows: Although the Chongqing military authorities issue reports on the war situation every night, there has been no report issued late on the 3rd. According to the latest news from Hengyang, the Chongqing army has not improved the current war situation. The Japanese army is now sending more troops south along the Yuehan Road from Hankou, further increasing the pressure on Hengyang. Although the Chongqing reinforcements have begun to attack the outside of Hengyang, they have not yet broken through the Japanese encirclement. The food, weapons, and ammunition supplied by air to the defenders in the city are still insufficient, and there has been no improvement. There are still many casualties. Even if the reinforcements arrive quickly, it will still be difficult for the defenders to hold the old city streets.

### Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Provides Relief to Families of Soldiers on Expeditions; Complaints of Difficult Living Conditions are Decreasing Daily

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to ensure that soldiers on expeditions have no worries about the future and can concentrate on reducing the enemy, the Japanese government previously established a Military Protection Institute within the Ministry of Health and Welfare. As of last month, it has been six years since its establishment. During this period, due to proper operation, the situation of families (the protected objects of the Military Protection Institute) complaining about difficult living conditions has recently decreased day by day. Therefore, the inquiry offices in cities, towns, and villages across the country have become quieter. Now, we will introduce the institute's policies and current situation regarding issues that are of most concern to soldiers on the front lines, such as family life, childcare and support, and re-employment of returning soldiers:

Family Livelihood Status: When the families of non-commissioned officers and soldiers who are called into service encounter economic difficulties, subsidies are given according to the provisions of the Military Assistance Law, that is, 90 cents per person per day in the six major cities, 75 cents per person per day in cities with a population of more than 200,000, 70 cents per person per day in cities with more than 150,000, 65 cents per person per day in cities with more than 50,000, 60 cents per person per day in cities with less than 50,000, and 50 cents per person per day in towns and villages. Although this number seems too small, there is a reason for this. For example, the United States has formulated an unemployment relief law, where the government guarantees the minimum living expenses of the unemployed. However, in the United States, where individualism is extremely developed, once unemployed, even parents and siblings will not care about it unless there is a proper reason. However, in Japan, it is the opposite. In Japan, where the family system is strict, they are all loved and cared for. At the same time, there is also love and care from the residents of the residential area. Therefore, there is no situation where they cannot make a living. Therefore, their lives are far better than the lives of enemy Americans with rights and obligations. Those who are called into service and public employees who live on salaries are given the minimum amount of assistance, and 60% of their salary is paid to their families. This method has been implemented in various government offices, companies, banks, etc. As for farmers, even if they are tenants, their women are allowed to cultivate and feed themselves. For farmers on expeditions, students are mobilized to provide labor services in all counties across the country, so the rice harvest is often completed even earlier than before the owner went on an expedition. The most problematic families are those of salaried workers, small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and freelance workers. However, in today's Japan, where there is a shortage of talent everywhere, when these families want to work, factories, companies, etc. are very welcoming. Therefore, it is not difficult for women to earn income and maintain their lives. Complaints about assistance and lack of talent are directly proportional and have gradually decreased.

The number of assisted households has clearly decreased compared to the total number of those called into service. What soldiers are most concerned about now are families with more young children who cannot leave their mothers, or wives who are weak and sick. Currently, there are 30 production sites with attached nurseries in Tokyo. When mothers work, they can entrust their young children to the nursery for care. After work in the afternoon, they can pick them up and take them home. In addition, hundreds of locations have been established throughout the country, and there are plans to greatly increase the number. Families with sick, weak, and difficult lives are the most in need of care and protection. Helpless families are investigated by officials from the city and village Houfang Bongong Hui (Rear Service Association) or female volunteer assistants, and all are assisted. If there are patients in families with difficult lives, those who are hospitalized are given two yuan and fifty cents per day. Those who go to the hospital for treatment are given the full amount of medical expenses. For childbirth, those who are hospitalized are given two yuan and fifty cents per day, and those who live at home are given an assistance payment of up to fifty yuan. In addition to the above, there are various other forms of assistance, such as life assistance of up to two hundred yuan, temporary life assistance for disaster victims of up to thirty yuan, and burial expenses of up to thirty yuan. The above is determined based on assistance. In addition, the Military Support Association also provides the same assistance as the government to illegitimate children, fiancées, and uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and families of military personnel who actually served before the expedition.

### Several Enemy Planes Attack the South Manchuria Area

Xinjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Several enemy P-38 planes attacked the South Manchuria area at 1:50 pm on the 4th, and attempted to invade Anshan, Xihu, and Dalian, etc. However, after being intercepted by local Japanese air force and air defense units, they fled. No damage was suffered in the South Manchuria area.

### Thailand Announces the War Situation on the Northern Border

Bangkok, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Thai government's propaganda bureau announced on the 3rd the war situation on Thailand's northern border (the old Burmese territory of Khangs Tit) as follows: The Thai army reconnaissance team of Saharat Thai Derm encountered a small team of enemy troops with two machine guns at about 10:00 am on July 14. After about an hour of battle, they were finally repelled. The village side suffered no losses.

### Councilor Tanaka Concurrently Serves as Principal of the Army University

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Tanaka Seichi, the former Supreme Commander of the Philippines, has fully recovered his health after returning to Japan for recuperation due to illness in May last year. The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 4th that Tanaka would be appointed as a military councilor and concurrently serve as the principal of the Army University.

### The Executive Yuan Promotes Agricultural Production Increase; The Ministry of Social Welfare Establishes Rural Clinics

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, in order to understand the actual situation of promoting production increase in the vicinity of Beijing and Ji (Hebei), has specially dispatched members to the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, Dashengguan Cotton and Hemp Seed Breeding Experiment Farm, Qishuangwan Cotton Training Class, Xiaozhu Rice and Wheat Seed Breeding Experiment Station, Yaohuamen Cotton Seed Farm in the Model Improvement Area, cooperatives, and township-level progressive associations for inspection. The results of some of the work are still good.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Rural Welfare Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has established rural service stations in various places, and rural clinics have been established under the stations. Each station employs one Chinese and one Western doctor, and one nurse, to provide free medicine and mobile medical services. It is heard that the plan is to establish 30 stations, and eight have already been established. The Yanziji and Shangxinhe stations have been established in the vicinity of the capital. It is heard that the total cost is 2,550,000 yuan, all of which is allocated by the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, which greatly benefits the villagers and indirectly contributes to increasing production.

### The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Elects Kobayashi as President

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The subcommittee of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held discussions on the evening of the 3rd and the afternoon of the 4th, and nominated the successor president of the association. It was decided to nominate Admiral Kobayashi Seizo, chairman of the central cooperation conference of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, as the second president. The subcommittee reported the process and results to the nomination committee at noon on the 4th, and it was unanimously approved by the entire committee. At the same time, it was also decided that the members of the association would be the negotiating committee, and they would earnestly request Kobayashi to take office. Thereupon, Kinugasa and five others immediately visited Admiral Kobayashi and earnestly requested him to take office as the successor president of the association.

### The Commander of the British Eastern Fleet Changes

According to reliable sources from the Central News Agency, Commander-in-Chief Creasy, commander of the enemy's British and American combined fleet, has been transferred to commander of the Eastern Fleet, which is to command the Indian Ocean Fleet. However, Britain attaches great importance to Creasy's personnel, and has given it a great deal of publicity. Although there is no reliable information about Creasy in this city at present, Creasy is nothing more than a speculator. We will wait for the facts to prove it in the future.

### Japanese Consul in Hankou, Maruyama Sakae, Transfers to an Important Position

Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - Consul Maruyama of the Japanese Consulate in Hankou will soon be taking up a new post in an important position. Mr. Maruyama said goodbye to Mayor Shi of the municipal government at 11:00 am yesterday (3rd).

### The Japanese Information Bureau Comments on the Severance of Relations Between Germany and Turkey, and Vigorously Criticizes the Base Behavior of Britain and the United States

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Iguchi, director of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with Chinese and foreign reporters on the morning of the 4th to express his views on the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, and vigorously criticized the base behavior of Britain and the United States in oppressing neutral countries. The original text is as follows: It is hateful that Britain and the United States used strong-arm tactics to force Turkey to abandon its noble and glorious policy of neutrality. Since the outbreak of the Great War, Turkey has maintained a policy of neutrality, refusing to participate in the war and maintaining national sovereignty for nearly five years. This time, Turkey's severance of relations with Germany was the result of Turkey's best efforts. Those who understand the signs of British and American oppression of Turkey deeply sympathize with it.

Sacrificing Other Countries to Achieve Their Selfish Desires

Sacrificing other countries to maintain their own rights and interests and achieve their own ambitions is a unique policy of Anglo-Saxon countries. Whenever the war situation is unfavorable or stagnant, Britain and the United States will use all means to expand the battlefield and induce other countries to participate in the war. Under such circumstances, Turkey became the target of British and American machinations and finally severed relations with Germany. In the future, Britain and the United States may not be satisfied with this and will make Turkey go through fire and water. Britain and the United States have not guaranteed Turkey's territorial sovereignty. Their greatest purpose is to use Turkey's strategic position and national strength.

The Outcome of Victory is Self-Evident

In short, Germany has long anticipated the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, and has therefore taken all necessary countermeasures. This severance of relations will not have a significant impact on Germany's war capabilities. In the future, it will move forward according to the established war policy. Both the East and West war zones are currently in decisive stages. It is self-evident whether the final victory will belong to human justice or to the aggressors.

### Abiding by Signed Treaties and Enhancing Friendship Between Japan and Thailand; The New Cabinet of Thailand Announces Six Political Programs

Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Thai Parliament held an extraordinary session at 2:00 pm on the 3rd. Prime Minister Apaiwong announced the six political programs of the new cabinet. After being trusted and agreed upon by the Parliament, the Apaiwong Cabinet was officially established. The six political programs of the new cabinet are recorded as follows: This government is the government of the King of Thailand according to the Thai constitution. This government has abided by the following six principles advocated by the people's vote during the revolution: A. The principle of freedom and independence; B. The establishment of a permanent peaceful order; C. Economic freedom; D. Equality of rights; E. Freedom of the people; F. The education of the people. This government must be faithful to the King, the Constitution, and the people. It must strive to avoid policies that violate the interests of the people and make it easy for the people to suffer difficulties, and it must respect the advice of the Parliament. This government has full sympathy and understanding for the people and handles national affairs. This government will maintain the stability of the national finances and strive to reduce unnecessary expenses. This government will abide by the treaties signed with Japan, not only maintain the past friendly relations between the two countries, but also strive to further strengthen them. For other countries, it will implement the same policies in accordance with the treaties or agreements that this country has issued and fixed.

Various Circles in Japan Express Goodwill

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Various circles have expressed great goodwill regarding the establishment of the Apaiwong Cabinet in Thailand. According to the new Foreign Minister Xisenna, before the Greater East Asia War, he served as the ambassador to Japan and resided in Japan for many years, making many contributions to strengthening the relationship between Japan and Thailand. Naval leader and Defense Minister Xien, etc., are all Thai politicians. General Pawong, a veteran of Thailand's founding and constitutional revolution, who contributed to the establishment when Phibun was Prime Minister, also participated in the cabinet, serving as Minister without Portfolio. The whole country is united, forming a strong and unyielding cabinet. The resignation of the Phibun Cabinet this time is entirely a matter of internal affairs. As for the foreign policy of the Japanese Cabinet, it remains unchanged. Under the unity of the whole country, based on the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, it will implement a consistent war policy to jointly defeat Britain and the United States. Former Prime Minister Phibun devoted himself to reforming national affairs and strengthening national power since taking office as Prime Minister. His achievements are well-known. When the Greater East Asia War began, he allowed the Japanese army to pass through the national border, and on December 21 of the same year, he concluded the Japan-Thailand military alliance, and the relationship between Japan and Thailand became closer. In order to defend its territory and avoid the invasion and exploitation of Britain and the United States, Thailand cooperated with Japan and resolutely participated in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation. Its contribution is great.

Spokesman of the Propaganda Department Speaks

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the reorganization of the cabinet in Thailand, the spokesman of the Propaganda Department of the National Government made the following statement: Thailand occupies an extremely important position in the Greater East Asia in terms of military, politics, and economy, especially in terms of military geography, it is a barrier to the Southwest Pacific. Since Prime Minister Phibun took power in Thailand, he has cooperated in the Greater East Asia War and participated in the Greater East Asia National Liberation Movement. His achievements are great. As a part of the Greater East Asia, our country admires Prime Minister Phibun's achievements very much. Now that Major Apaiwong has succeeded as the chief minister and organized a new cabinet, it can not only strengthen the national politics and military, but also strengthen the unity of its people, unanimously support it, and exert its strength to cooperate in the war and protect the Southwest Pacific. This is what we can断言 (assert). As a major member of the Greater East Asia, Thailand can closely cooperate with Japan, which is not only a blessing for the two nations of Japan and Thailand, but also a blessing for all the nations of the entire Greater East Asia. The close military and diplomatic ties between Japan and Thailand have invisibly established a solid pillar in the Southwest Pacific, assisting in the recovery of Myanmar and the independence of India. At the same time, it will also be of great help to our country in reducing the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. Former Prime Minister Phibun has already laid a solid foundation for the close relationship between Japan and Thailand. Now, the new chief minister, Major Apaiwong, will be able to better promote the close relationship between Japan and Thailand in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. This is what our country expects from its future.

### Chongqing Cultural Circles Demand Freedom of Speech and Publication

Central News Agency report: During the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held in Chongqing on May 12th this year, the issue of criticism from Britain and the United States regarding Chongqing's drift towards autocracy was discussed. In an attempt to appease them, it was announced after the meeting that Chongqing would ease its censorship of news, communication, speech, and publication, and this was widely publicized. Chongqing's extreme suppression of public opinion under the pretext of wartime conditions had long been criticized domestically, especially by university professors and writers, who had to swallow their anger and endure difficult lives, leading to a so-called "cultural crisis" and a major social problem. According to reliable sources here, the Communist Party's news agency, "Xinhua News Agency," recently revealed the inside story of Chongqing's easing of censorship in a radio broadcast, stating that during the Twelfth Plenary Session, 78 representatives of Chongqing's cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Hong Shen, Lao She, Mao Dun, Cao Yu, and others, jointly criticized the authorities' suppression of freedom of speech and issued a strongly worded telegram to the entire nation, presenting a firm petition to the Twelfth Plenary Session. Although Chongqing banned the publication of this matter, the Dagang Daily in Hengyang, the New China Daily in Chengdu, and special publications of various universities all exposed it, causing widespread repercussions and support. The telegram stated that for the past seven years, whenever there were speeches, publications, academic research, or theatrical performances, the authorities would prohibit or suppress them under the pretext of "not conforming to national conditions" or "not meeting the requirements of the war," and such disasters were too numerous to count. The authorities' suppression of freedom of speech and publication had reached its extreme, which not only hindered the war effort and national reconstruction but also hindered the development of the nation's culture. Therefore, the following five points were proposed: 1. Abolish the censorship system for books, magazines, and theatrical performances. 2. Magazines can apply for registration at the time of publication and can also be mailed before registration and distribution. Furthermore, registration certificates should not be revoked or distribution suspended without cause. 3. Publication should not be prohibited after publication without legal procedures, and local military and political authorities should not prohibit publication or interfere with theatrical performances. 4. Instruct local authorities to strictly abide by laws and regulations to protect freedom of speech and publication. 5. All plays and writings that have been suppressed in the past, which do not violate the war effort, national reconstruction, or national interests, should have their original manuscripts returned and the prohibition orders lifted. The above five demands were proposed by Guo and others, and the Communist Party's news agency's exposure of them is particularly interesting in light of the current difficult negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

### American Troops Reach Rennes; Germans Prepare for Battle; Fighting in Northern France Extends to Brittany

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: The German Supreme Headquarters announced at midnight on the 3rd that the Allied forces on the Western European front had reached the Rennes area. Rennes is the capital of the Brittany Peninsula, with railways crisscrossing it, making it a crucial transportation hub. On the night of the 3rd, American assault troops attempted to cut across France, forming a large second front, or to turn east at a certain point and directly attack Paris. German troops are now preparing for battle and will inflict heavy losses on them. The movement of the breakthrough troops has now become the starting point for offensive operations.

### Turkey Grants Amnesty to Political Prisoners; Switzerland to Manage German Interests

Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th: Reuters reports that the Turkish National Assembly yesterday passed a law granting amnesty to political prisoners, including British, American, and Soviet expatriates convicted by Turkish courts of endangering national security. Foreigners sentenced for the assassination attempt on German Ambassador von Papen are also included in the amnesty.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The German News Agency reports that Switzerland will take care of German interests in Turkey.

Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th: The German New Agency reports that commerce in Ankara and Istanbul has come to a complete standstill in recent days, but the public is rushing to buy food and withdraw money from banks.

### Germany Watches Developments Closely

Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: Reuters reports that a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Churchill's report in the House of Commons showed that Britain had abandoned Southeastern Europe to the Soviet Union. After Turkey's break with Germany, it is likely to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu's speech did not mention the Soviet Union, which is noteworthy. The Turkish government has released the two Soviet expatriates who attempted to assassinate German Ambassador von Papen, indicating Soviet behind-the-scenes maneuvering. The ultimate goal of the Soviet Union is to obtain military bases. United Press International reported that Turkey may agree to place the Dardanelles Strait under international administration. German officials have avoided expressing the German government's intentions and are only closely monitoring the developments in Turkey.

### Stalin Meets with Polish Prime Minister

Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 4th: The German News Agency reports that, according to British sources in Moscow, Stalin met with Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk of the government-in-exile yesterday for two and a half hours.

### Ten-Ton Missiles Fall on London

Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 4th: For the past three days, flying bombs have attacked London and Southern England continuously for up to fourteen hours each day, the longest sustained attack in seven weeks. According to a special dispatch from London in a Swedish newspaper, the recent flying bombs have been the largest, weighing up to ten tons, demonstrating their devastating destructive power. Public panic has reached its peak, and the number of evacuees continues to increase.

### Major Tank Battles Northeast of Warsaw; German Counterattacks in the Vistula River Pocket

Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The German News Agency reports that Soviet pressure on the eastern side of the Carpathian Mountains continued unabated on Wednesday. Extremely fierce fighting took place in the triangle between the Vistula and San Rivers. The Soviets used very powerful tanks and mechanized units in that area, advancing several kilometers but being driven back by German counterattacks. Southeast of Warsaw, Soviet troops repeatedly attempted to establish new bridgeheads on the Vistula River, but failed due to German counterattacks. East and northeast of Warsaw, German armored units resisted Soviet mechanized units, but German troops were able to hold their positions everywhere. Soviet pressure was particularly heavy along the southern edge of the Augustów Forest and in the Vilkoviskis area. The Soviets fought with fresh rifle divisions and tank divisions, making some progress on an eight-kilometer-wide front.

### Abundant Harvest in Hunan and Hubei Provinces Leads to National Sufficiency

— Yin Gong

Hunan's Rice Production Ranks Third Nationally

Hunan is a major rice-producing region in China. There is an old saying, "Abundant harvests in Hunan and Hubei provinces lead to national sufficiency." The importance of Hunan's rice production in the country has been long-standing. According to statistics from the National Government's Statistics Bureau in 1932, excluding the provinces of Suiyuan and Guangxi, which do not produce rice, and the Qinghai region, which was not surveyed, Hunan province ranked third in the country in terms of rice production, second only to Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, accounting for a total of approximately 11% of the country's total production. The following is a table of statistics:

Due to past statistical shortcomings and survey difficulties, there are no precise figures for the total rice cultivation area in Hunan province. According to the estimates of Mr. Zhang Renjia of the former Hunan Economic Investigation Institute, the total rice cultivation area in Hunan is approximately 28,716,000 mu, with an average yield of 4.9 shi per mu, resulting in a total rice production of approximately 140,955,130 shi. The following is a table showing Mr. Zhang Renjia's estimates, broken down by river basin:

From the table above, we can see that Hunan's total annual grain production is approximately 140 million shi. Hunan has a population of 30 million. If we use the common saying, "One sheng per person, seven shi and two dou per year," then Hunan's grain production is not sufficient to feed itself. However, the reality is not so simple. The common saying, "One sheng per person, seven shi and two dou per year," refers to rice-consuming areas and does not represent the average consumption per person in the entire province. Although Hunan is known for its rice production, there are many counties with surpluses, but also counties with deficits. According to a survey conducted in 1935, there were 33 counties with a surplus of grain and rice, with each county exporting from 8,000 shi to 1,300,000 shi annually. These 33 counties had a total surplus of 797,000 shi of grain. There were 31 counties with a deficit of grain and rice. The majority of the deficit was supplemented by coarse grains, and a small portion was imported from neighboring counties for assistance. The aforementioned surplus counties could surplus 700,000 shi of grain, with approximately half used to supply the deficits of neighboring counties and the other half exported to other provinces. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire province, grain and rice are usually exported annually.

### Three Major Ports for Hunan Rice Exports

In the past, there were three major ports for exporting Hunan rice: Yisuhe, Jinggang, and Cangjiang. Yisuhe is located in Xiangtan, at the confluence of the Lishui and Xiangjiang rivers. Jinggang is located in Changsha, at the confluence of the Liushui and Xiangjiang rivers. Cangjiang is located in Hanshou, at the confluence of the Cangshui, Langshui, and Yuanshui rivers. In the past, Yisuhe was the most famous, with its sales reaching as far as Shanghai and Guangzhou, and as close as Wuhan. Warehouses were lined up, and rice sacks blocked the roads. The prosperity of the rice industry was unparalleled. Jinggang was also well-known. The name "Jinggang rice" is still used for Hunan rice in Shanghai today. Cangjiang was originally a distribution market for grain and rice near the lake. The rice markets in Changsha, Lulin Pond, and Chenglingji have the largest volume, followed by Nanhua and Li'an, and then Liling and Chen County. Rice exported from Changsha, Lulin Pond (in Xiangyin County), and Chenglingji (in Yueyang County) is mostly shipped to ports in Shanghai and Wuhan. Rice exported from Nanhua and Li'an is mostly shipped to Shashi and Yichang in Hubei. Rice exported from Liling is either shipped north to Hubei or east to Jiangxi. Rice exported from Chen County is shipped to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The following are the export volumes from 1932 to 1935: In conclusion, regardless of how bad the harvest year is in Hunan province, there will always be some record of Hunan rice exports. In particular, the rice market in Chen County did not sell any rice outside the province in 1932, exported over 2,000 shi in 1933, and increased to four times that amount in 1935.

Changsha is One of China's Four Major Rice Markets

Changsha's rice and grain industry has gradually developed since the founding of the Republic of China and is now one of China's four major rice and grain markets, ranking first in Hunan province. The reasons for its development are as follows: The relationship between finance and the rice and grain industry. Changsha is the financial center of Hunan province, which has contributed to the development of the rice and grain industry. The relationship between transportation and rice and grain. Changsha is the transportation hub of Hunan province, with convenient transportation, so rice and grain transactions throughout the province are concentrated here.

Hunan Rice Shipped to Shanghai as a Source for Restoring Rationing

Currently, the Allied Japanese forces, with the goal of destroying the American troops stationed in Chongqing, have launched an operation in Hunan, achieving victory after victory. Changsha has already been occupied, and Hengyang is under siege and will fall soon. From an economic perspective, the occupation of the Changsha-Hengyang line is a major source of surplus rice in Hunan, which will greatly assist in the supply of Hunan rice. The Allied authorities, aware of the importance of the food problem in the rear, are currently planning to export Hunan rice to provide relief.

Shanghai stopped rationing household rice for two months because supplies were interrupted, leading to soaring rice prices and hardship for the people. The Allied authorities are now urgently shipping Hunan rice to Shanghai, and rationing will soon be restored. Therefore, the victories in the Hunan operation not only destroyed the American troops stationed in Chongqing and secured a winning advantage in the Greater East Asia War but also greatly contributed to the food problem in the rear, which is worthy of our satisfaction.

### Huazhong Telegraph Company Implements Wartime Special Measures; Non-Urgent Telegrams No Longer Accepted

The Huazhong Telegraph and Communication Company in this city bears a major wartime mission. In order to ensure the smooth operation of communication services, it has specifically set wartime special measures for handling telegrams to impose restrictions. These restrictions will be implemented from August 5th. Thereafter, the situation will be further strengthened with the increasing tension of the situation. The focus of the wartime special measures is to restrict non-urgent telegrams on the one hand, and to devote its full efforts to facilitate important wartime communications on the other hand. Therefore, telegrams containing condolences and greetings are of course out of the question, and other telegrams deemed non-urgent by the telegraph office will no longer be accepted in the future. In other words, only telegrams that are truly urgent will be accepted. Currently, in addition to telegrams exchanged within the Huazhong region, only those marked as express and special express will be accepted for the time being. This is because of the recent surge in telegrams, which, despite the company's best efforts, has been impossible to handle due to insufficient technical personnel and communication equipment. As a result, this extraordinary measure has been taken out of necessity. Furthermore, the time for accepting telegrams will be shortened to 6:00 PM. After that time, only express telegrams will be accepted, except for special telegrams. Telegrams arriving after 8:00 PM will no longer be delivered before the start of business hours the next day, except for those that are particularly urgent. In addition, emergency measures in the event of an extraordinary situation will be subject to change depending on the future development of the situation. Restrictions on the number of words in telegrams and the number of telegrams sent, as well as the implementation of a complete or partial suspension of other telegram services, leaving only important communications, are all expected to occur. This is a major drawback in winning the telegram war, but in order to enhance communication combat power, it is sincerely necessary to have the understanding and support of the general winners. It is also learned that the restrictions on the use of telegrams as evidence will remain the same as in the past.

### Major Salt Field Talks About the Pacific War Situation: The Japanese Army is Prepared to Thoroughly Strike the Enemy

The joint press conference hosted by the three authorities of the Allied forces in Shanghai, land, sea, and air, was held yesterday (4th) at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to meet with Chinese news reporters in this city. Major Salt Field of the Fleet Reporting Department was present, entrusted to Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, etc. Deputy Consul Fukuma of the Embassy's Shanghai Office was also present. Major Salt Field immediately answered in detail the questions raised by the reporters regarding the recent war situation in the Pacific. The details are recorded as follows:

Heavy Losses for the Enemy in the Mariana Islands

Major Salt Field said that the fighting in the Mariana Islands was fierce, especially on Saipan Island. The Japanese army had inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, and the damage to the American army was quite heavy. In addition, on Miyakojima, the Japanese army has been actively gathering in the north. At the same time, all Japanese residents on the island bravely cooperated with the Japanese army. However, there has been no activity of warships near the island. It is believed that the garrison troops on the island are currently quite exhausted and are waiting for the attacking enemy to launch an attack to give them a thorough and severe blow.

The Significance of Dividing Military Administration and Military Orders

Major Salt Field continued to explain in detail the significance of the Japanese government's division of military administration and military orders this time, and said that General Oikawa's new position as Minister of Military Orders and General Oikawa's original position as Minister of the Navy show the attitude of refreshing the situation in the midst of the decisive battle. Moreover, General Shimada will participate in military affairs as a military advisor from now on. General Shimada has made great contributions over the years, and he will make even greater efforts in the future. He is gentle and kind, and he is most suitable for this position. General Oikawa has a systematic approach to research, and the general public trusts him especially. Five or six years ago, when he served as the commander of the stationed troops, he collected quite a lot of ancient Chinese books, and he had a good understanding of Chinese history. His research on Chinese literature is very profound. This appointment can be said to be suitable for his talents and abilities. He is not only an outstanding talent in the Navy, but also deeply expected by the general public in the country.

Japanese Soldiers' Morale is Greatly Boosted

Finally, Mr. Salt Field also said that the Japanese people have great expectations for the Navy, and the planned operation is gradually progressing. Finally, he said that the morale of the officers and soldiers is increasingly boosted, and all are willing to go to the front line for a decisive battle. They are now requesting orders and waiting to be dispatched.

At this time of hardship, our bank originally did not intend to be extravagant. We are now allocating 20,000 yuan in executive expenses to be allocated to your newspaper's scholarship fund and the Xinwen News Loan Fund, 10,000 yuan each, and I hope you will transfer it to the scholarship fund to leave a memory and benefit the guests."

### Calligraphy and Painting Industry Should Also Pay Taxes

— Wang Zhiyuan

Now, all industries have the responsibility to pay taxes and fulfill the obligations of citizens. Even bank deposits and employee salary slips have the obligation to pay income tax. However, there is a group of celebrities in Shanghai who call themselves calligraphers, painters, epigraphers, and art collectors, who have never taken the responsibility of paying taxes. The daily income of this industry is quite considerable. If you are looking for a famous calligrapher or painter, it costs tens of thousands of yuan, or thousands of yuan. Moreover, their fees and commission rates can be increased at any time and are not subject to any restrictions. In Shanghai alone, there are no less than tens of thousands of calligraphers, painters, and engravers. If they pay a small amount of tax each month according to their income, it is really a drop in the bucket, and it will add another source of income for the country. As for those who seek calligraphy and painting, they should be wealthy and willing to spend a lot of money to seek the work of famous artists to please their eyes, or to keep it for a hundred years or so to sell it at a good price. Therefore, it is not too much to say that those who seek micro-loans should pay luxury retail tax. Now I suggest a few items as follows:

Led by the relevant parties, the major fan shops should establish a calligraphy and painting industry and engravers' association to unify management.

All calligraphers, painters, and engravers should register with the association, and then the association should apply for a license on their behalf.

The license fee should be collected quarterly, and the business tax should be paid monthly according to the amount of income.

All micro-loans must be handled through major fan shops to avoid tax evasion.

If it is found that buyers and sellers are privately transacting to evade taxes, both parties will be punished after investigation.

Those who are not registered with the association will not be allowed to operate, and their rights will be deemed to have been waived. (Transferred to help scholarships)

### Prevention Methods for Dysentery

It is now summer, the weather is hot, and people's resistance is reduced. If you are not careful, diseases will follow. Dysentery has already been discovered recently. The Hualian Factory Pharmaceutical Medical Laboratory has specially described the source of dysentery and prevention methods for the reference of citizens.

Dysentery is divided into two major categories: Amoeba dysentery and Bacterial dysentery. The former is caused by Amoeba protozoa, and the latter is transmitted by dysentery bacteria. Every summer, there are more patients than in other seasons. The reason for this is related to melons, fruits, and flies.

Now is the season for melons and fruits, and it is also the time for flies to breed. Melon and fruit stalls can be seen everywhere on the road, and flies gather and cannot be driven away. Therefore, the most opportunities to transmit diseases are at this time. Although chemical methods can be used to disinfect before eating melons, such as soaking them in a potassium permanganate solution, sometimes there are too many bacteria, and the drug is not strong enough to kill the bacteria, so the effect is often minimal.

Dysentery bacteria are transmitted from the stomach. After passing through the stomach acid, they cannot be killed or reduced, so they enter the intestinal tract, where they multiply endlessly and secrete 33% of bacteria. It can be seen that dysentery is related to melons, fruits, and flies.

Prevention methods: Eat less melons, fruits, and cold drinks to reduce the chance of infection. Install screens in toilets or kitchens to prevent flies from flying in. Disinfectant water, such as carbolic acid or lysol water, should be sprinkled frequently in places where flies gather to prevent their breeding. Stone lime powder and bleaching powder are cheaper. Patients with dysentery or other infectious diseases should be sent to isolation hospitals for prompt treatment. Wash hands frequently before eating. It is hoped that citizens will work hard together to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases.

### Tuberculosis Clinic Offers Preferential Treatment to the Poor

The Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Chinese Catholic Medical Association jointly established the Fourth Tuberculosis Clinic at 197 Yueyang Road (Fen Qi Qi Road). It has been open for more than a month, and the clinic is very developed. The clinic recently learned that tuberculosis is the most common disease among Chinese patients. If you do not follow the correct path and treat it with peace of mind, it will be impossible to save. Today, medicine is expensive, and where do poor patients get such high medical expenses? Therefore, preferential treatment methods have been formulated. Anyone suffering from this disease can apply to this office for an introduction to the clinic for treatment. The fees are divided into four types: free, half-fee, ordinary, and special. The fees are collected according to each person's situation. Registration fee: half fee 5 yuan, ordinary 10 yuan, special 30 yuan. X-ray fluoroscopy: half fee 25 yuan, ordinary 50 yuan, special 100 yuan. Artificial pneumothorax: half fee 50 yuan, ordinary 100 yuan, special 200 yuan. Medicine fee: half price according to the wholesale price, ordinary according to the wholesale price, special according to the wholesale price plus 20%.

### Free Malaria Pills

A letter from Moore Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory: "I have the honor to send you 1,500 loose tablets of our factory's sacred medicine for malaria, 'Pumian Ning tablets'. Please distribute them to the poor and sick. Due to electricity restrictions, our factory does not produce much, and the number is small, which is just a token of our intentions. There are also"

According to Moore Pharmaceutical Factory, it previously donated "Sesilong tablets" to this office for charity, and now it is willing to donate "Pumian Ning tablets." At this time of autumn and summer, when malaria is prevalent, it is of great benefit to the poor and sick. In addition to thanking them, we will distribute them on their behalf.

Free Diagnosis and Medication: Dr. Wang Gongjian, a disciple of the national doctor Lu Shi'e, has the intention of saving the world and provides free diagnosis and medication. All poor patients who seek medical treatment only need to pay a registration fee of 10 yuan. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Free diagnosis and medication coupons are printed and can be obtained from this office or from the clinic of the national doctor Tu Gongjian at 35 Bo Boy Fang, Luban Road.

Bade Lecture and Entertainment: The Chinese Confucius Learning Association is scheduled to hold the Rude Festival (Tuesday) on the 2nd of the month, starting at 3:00 PM, at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road. A Rude Lecture and Entertainment Conference will be held, inviting Mr. Wen Lanting, Tan Tiankai, Pan Yangyao, and Wang Shifu to give lectures on the Eight Virtues. The president of the association, Lin Kanghou, will give the opening speech, and the youth group Ruan Zhiqiang, Wang Dunshu, Wang Dunhe, and Shen Huimin will also give lectures. The event will be followed by a "Pipa Solo" by the famous musician Wei Yuele, and Wang Dunshu and others will perform martial arts. It is expected that there will be a grand event at that time.

School Equipment: A certain Buddhist organization has recently established a rural primary school in Nanxiang in order to save out-of-school children in rural areas. It is now planned to solicit 50 to 100 desks and chairs, and other school equipment is also welcome. If there are any enthusiastic educators who are willing to sell at a low price, please come to Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road to discuss, telephone 33855.

Lost Keys: Yesterday at 6:30 PM, seven keys were found at the Donghua Stadium. I have specially sent them to your office for the owner to claim. (Yan Tingde)

### Blood and Tears (9) The Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by a foreigner

Lieutenant Commander Sakuma should have been at the conning tower, Lieutenant Harayama of the engine crew should have been by the motor, Petty Officer 1st Class Suzuki of the engine crew should have been by the gasoline engine, the helmsman should have been by the propeller, and the airman should have been in front of the air tank. It can be said that they each stayed at their posts in the face of their impending deaths and diligently performed their duties.

Only two people left their posts: Lieutenant Hasegawa and Petty Officer 1st Class Kadota. However, the bodies of both men were found at the site of the broken gasoline pipe. The fact that they abandoned their posts proves that they fought against the strong gasoline smell, blocking the rupture with their bodies until their last breath.

Lieutenant Colonel Yoshikawa and Captain Nakajo wept bitterly for them, as they certainly should. They believed that the sacrifice of these submariners was indeed a "death" weightier than Mount Tai.

"Good!"

Lieutenant Colonel Yoshikawa's comment was simple, but it was enough to move people.

Following the lieutenant colonel were the chief medical officer and nurses from the mother ship Toyohashi, who entered the submarine and examined the bodies in detail. They then wrapped the corpses in thick blankets and placed them aboard the Toyohashi. All the crew members wept as they dressed the fourteen dead bodies in new uniforms. In a short while, when the Toyohashi quietly entered Kure Port, the commander-in-chief specially ordered all mooring vessels to welcome these victims with a boarding ceremony.

Later, the respect for Captain Sakuma immediately increased a hundredfold. This was because a small booklet was found in the captain's uniform.

The first person who found it thought it was just a small notebook with random pencil scribbles and did not pay much attention to it. But after reading it carefully, everyone was shocked.

It was a testament that would last forever. In that kind of environment, in that fateful situation, to be able to write such words was truly indicative of an unprecedented sense of will and duty.

At the same time as the sinking, the lights went out. By the faint light of a flashlight, Captain Sakuma, gasping for breath amidst the foul smell of gasoline, finished writing. Until the moment his consciousness was clear, he wrote without omission: the cause of the sinking, everything that happened after the sinking, as well as hopes for the future of submarines, the kindness of superiors to subordinates, farewells to seniors, and so on.

The captain was indeed worthy of being called a superman. At that time, the captain was only thirty-one years old, and his wife had passed away the year before, leaving behind only a two-year-old daughter. (128)
