### Discussing the European War Situation

Question: Paris has entered a state of street fighting, and the anti-Axis forces have landed in Southern France. How will the European situation develop from now on?

Answer: Currently, the focus of the European war is indeed concentrated on the French battlefield. However, it is undeniable that the final decisive battle will be determined on the German border. Taking the French battlefield as an example, the original strategy of the British and American forces may have been to attempt a final decisive battle near Paris, forcing the main forces of the Axis powers to fight them to the death. However, in the end, this strategy of the enemy failed. First, for more than two months, the enemy has been unable to seize and strike the main force of the German army without suffering significant losses. Second, the enemy forces have been unable to strike the Axis forces at the predetermined strategic location and have had to open up battlefields in other areas, resulting in an increasingly dispersed force. Third, the Axis forces' strategy of avoiding battle has succeeded, allowing them to freely choose favorable areas for future decisive battles, concentrate their strength, and inflict a final defeat on the enemy, who has penetrated deep with exhausted troops and dispersed strength.

Question: But doesn't Germany still have to divide its forces to cope with the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front? What is the trend in this area?

Answer: The Soviet strategy is consistent with its political strategy, which is to try to take advantage of the British and American "Second Front" in Western Europe, to concentrate all its efforts, cross Warsaw, and enter Berlin. However, the overall situation has gradually become clear. The internal coup has completely failed, and the westward-advancing Soviet troops, under the recent German counter-offensive, are hovering on the border of East Prussia, and the plan to capture Warsaw, which has long been touted as imminent, has not yet been realized.

Question: But haven't the Soviet troops shifted their political momentum towards the southwest in the past few days?

Answer: Indeed, the Soviet army has already captured cities such as Iasi and is pressing towards Romania, causing Romania to experience a coup similar to that in Italy, with King Michael announcing an armistice with the Soviet Union and negotiating peace. This progress of the Soviet army is clearly a lucky harvest from taking advantage of the weakness after the failures in East Prussia and Warsaw. However, the situation in this area is not that simple: First, a new government has been established in Romania to continue its alliance with Germany and resist the Soviet Union, denying the King's humiliating peace, and the Romanian army will continue to fight the Soviet army to the end. Second, the Soviet Union's abandonment of its plan to directly invade the German mainland and its shift towards the Balkans clearly stems from the fact that an attack on Germany would inevitably result in failure, and even if there were gains, they would inevitably have to be handed over in the future, which is not as beneficial as expanding its influence in the Balkans. Therefore, strategically, it could further promote new contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Question: In this regard, isn't Turkey's dynamic in a pivotal position? What will be the situation in Southeastern Europe and the Near East in the future?

Answer: Turkey has recently been forced to sever relations with Germany under pressure from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Its difficult situation is indeed worthy of sympathy, but its foolish policy is enough to plunge the country into a tragic war. The anti-Axis powers will inevitably demand the use of Turkey's important bases and straits and will force Turkey to participate in the war. Judging from the Soviet Union's comments after Turkey severed relations with Germany, it is still not satisfied with Turkey's continued maintenance of diplomatic relations with Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia, which shows a glimpse of the ambition of the anti-Axis powers. In the future, if the Soviet army develops towards the Danube River basin, the result will inevitably lead to an unsolvable question among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union over the issue of using the Turkish Straits.

Question: So what is the future of the Axis powers?

Answer: The tendency of contradictions on the anti-Axis side is, of course, an optimistic condition for the Axis side. At the same time, we should pay particular attention to the fact that since the failure of the coup plot in Germany, the entire country has been united and strengthened. The new mobilization of a million troops will allow Germany to actively choose favorable battlefields and be sufficient to crush any enemy strategy.

### Zhou Longxiang Flies to Japan

### Zhejiang Province's Aircraft and Iron Donation Achievements are Excellent

Since the beginning, the results have been excellent, and the first phase of the aircraft donation funds from Xiaoshan and Jiashan counties has exceeded the original amount. The second phase of aircraft donation funds was also sent to the province a few days ago, exceeding the original amount by more than 220,000 yuan.

### Chongqing Army on the Hunan Front Suffers Extremely High Casualties, Fierce Fighting Continues Near Hengyang

Hunan Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The war on the China front is fierce, and the Chongqing army has suffered extremely high losses in manpower and equipment, so its combat strength is declining day by day, which is an undeniable fact. According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, the Chongqing army's losses on the Hunan front up to the beginning of August totaled 66,468 killed in action, 27,447 captured, and an additional 226,400 wounded and sick. In addition, the weapons captured by the Japanese army can supply about ten divisions. To date, the Chongqing army operating on the Hunan front and fighting the Japanese army has about 45 divisions, or about 400,000 men. According to the above situation, it can be seen that the Chongqing army's manpower has been depleted by more than half, but the Chongqing army is falsely reporting the Japanese army's losses and making exaggerated propaganda in an attempt to conceal the facts. For example, Chongqing army spokesman Zeng Qingji told foreign reporters on the 18th that two divisions, or more than 36,000 men, of the Japanese army's 200,000 troops had been annihilated. However, this falsely reported figure of Japanese army losses is still far from the Chongqing army's losses. According to the Chongqing army's announcement of its final means of replenishing manpower, it is implementing a "Rear Transfer Division System" in the Sixth and Ninth War Zones. The new troops obtained under this system are, of course, vague about education or training. It is conceivable that this rabble is not enough to fight the elite Japanese army, or it is only engaged in guerrilla warfare in the rear. Moreover, because this "Rear Transfer Division System" is a measure to forcibly mobilize the people to the front lines, it has aroused dissatisfaction among the people. On the contrary, they trust the Japanese army's announcements and increasingly move into peaceful areas. Therefore, the "Rear Transfer Division System" has also failed, which proves that it cannot replenish the losses. Moreover, the dozen or so divisions of the Chongqing army surrounding Hengyang are now surrounded by the Japanese army and are about to be annihilated. As a result, there is a move to send troops from Yunnan to reinforce, but it will take two to three months for these troops to reach the Hunan front, which is like trying to put out a fire far away. Therefore, the Chongqing army's depletion and the decline in its ability to resist have become inevitable, and the Chongqing side seems to be extremely anxious about it.

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, it continued its attacks on the Yuehan Railway and the Xianggui Railway. According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th, Chongqing army spokesman Major General Zeng Qingji met with reporters and announced the war situation in Hunan: In the past week, although fierce fighting has continued in various parts of Hunan, there has been little progress. The two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting along the Xianggui Railway south of Hengyang. The Chongqing army is fiercely attacking the areas east and west of Leiyang, and fierce fighting is also taking place in the suburbs of Anren, Chaling, and Liling.

Hankou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The United States has recently been actively strengthening its strength in the Pacific theater, forming a joint US-Chongqing front to prepare for a counter-offensive. Since the spring of this year, the United States has sent a number of experts to Chongqing to organize mechanized units, consisting of two regiments of paratroopers stationed in Chongqing. Recently, they have been sent to Guilin, Liuzhou, and other places. The Chongqing army's only mechanized corps, the Fifth Army, which was equipped with American equipment and sent to Burma as an expeditionary force, has now been recalled to deal with the Japanese army's Hunan operation. The Chongqing Fourth War Zone Command has moved to the Xianggui Railway line, and a major battle in Hunan is brewing.

### Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Attack Suichuan and Ganzhou

A Certain Army Air Base, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force used night bomber squadrons on the 25th to launch a surprise attack on the Suichuan and Ganzhou airfields in Jiangxi Province, damaging the facilities affiliated to the airfields.

All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base last night.

### Japanese Troops Repel Communist Troops in Yu and Chongqing

Henan, 27th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 17th of this month, the Lin邑 County Security Team was attacked by about 400 members of the Pingyu County Security Team of the Communist Party near Mapingshuizhai, six kilometers northwest of the county town. After receiving a report, the Japanese army in southern Shandong quickly dispatched troops to rescue them, and finally defeated the attacking Communist troops. On the 19th, about 200 Chongqing troops invaded the Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of Zhangqiu County. After receiving the report, the Japanese army quickly cooperated with the county security team to suppress them, and the Chongqing army was defeated and retreated. In addition, on the 21st, Japanese troops launched a night attack on the Chongqing troops who were operating near Xicaishi in Zhangqiu, inflicting heavy damage and forcing them to retreat. In the above battles, the Japanese army recovered a total of 25 bodies of Chongqing troops.

### The Elements of Victory (II)

— Toshio Shiratori

—The Belief in Upholding the National Polity—

Putting the Future of the Nation Aside

Therefore, the Jews and Japan are opposing countries, and their goal is to destroy the Japanese national polity. Roosevelt once said: "Wipe Japan off the face of the earth." This is a Zionist statement. A person without Jewish blood could not say such a thing. The fact that a country's president says this shows that the Jewish leaders have unlimited war intentions towards Japan. Under such leaders, it is not surprising that the American people, who have been guided for a long time, deal with Japan with such fervent animosity and war intention today.

Originally, the leaders of the enemy, whether in Britain or the United States, put the interests of their country and the happiness of their people aside. Therefore, they do not hesitate to pay whatever sacrifices among their people, no matter how they waste materials and lives, they do not care. This is most evident in Soviet Russia. That is, they do not consider the future of the nation before acting. In order to fulfill their ambitions, they try every possible strategy to make the people use up all their strength.

After this war became increasingly fierce, the initial policy of cherishing the lives of soldiers as much as possible has been abandoned, the mask has been taken off, and the lives of soldiers are regarded as dust. This is true in the Pacific and on the European front, but their anxiety for victory is becoming more and more obvious. At the same time, this gives a very deep impulse to the general British and American people. And the deep impulse turns into an overflow of anti-war atmosphere, which is inevitable for the British and American people who originally had no war aims themselves. When that time comes, it can be said that the war is coming to an end.

Although the scale of the recent European landing is small, Britain has paid the greatest sacrifice. Recently, Minister of Munitions Production Lyttelton said: It was the United States that brought Japan into the war, and Britain could not devote all its efforts to the Pacific War. From the above point of view, it is of great significance and reflects the atmosphere of the British people. In short, Britain hopes that the United States will contribute more to Europe because it is gradually feeling difficult, and it cannot continue to do so otherwise. Lyttelton's words represent this kind of mood of the British people.

### Absolute Incompatibility

In short, Japan and Britain and the United States are absolutely incompatible. The depth of the war lies in this. But the enemy's war aims have nothing to do with the masses of the people. Therefore, if the war is prolonged, the people will probably abandon their leaders and end the war. Especially in the United States, in my opinion, there is a great possibility of this. Therefore, it seems that we should publicize the correct war aims in this regard to the enemy people, pointing out the demonic nature of their leaders.

In the previous war, democratic Britain and the United States planned to alienate the emperor, the army, and the people of Germany. This time, our officials and civilians are united as one, and there is absolutely no room for alienation. Only the enemy is inspired by a few ambitions. We should take this opportunity to start a propaganda war to make the people of the enemy country understand the truth.

Some people ask, what if the enemy wins? We Japanese don't even need to imagine this. As long as we adhere to the correct belief in the Japanese national polity, Japan will not fail. Isn't this not yet fully understood by the Japanese?

I think this war is not determined by the victory or defeat on the battlefield, but by the strength and superiority of the rear. The United States is quite uneasy about this. On the other hand, judging from our example, Germany's rear is now immortal. That is, on the front lines, such as Cherbourg and Stalingrad, they are as brave and good at fighting as the Japanese army. The people in the rear are also very firm and cannot be defeated after all. In short, Japan, with its unparalleled national polity that all nations admire, is the most steadfast in the world. As a result, the war will be won by this. The war may become more and more serious, but I am confident that it will not dampen the war spirit of the Japanese people, which is on the rise.

In short, we must separate the leaders of the other side from the general public. How should we do that? We must make the other side see that there is no chance of winning the war. Although there is no other way to do that except through offensives on the battlefield, on the other hand, we should show in practice and tell in words how Japan's bright and great purpose is to build a post-war co-prosperity sphere, regardless of whether the other side listens or not, so that it permeates the other side. In fact, quite a few people on the other side listen to shortwave radios. The previous Greater East Asia Declaration also caused a considerable reaction on the other side. Now, their leaders are gaining the approval of the people because they believe that the war can be won and are inspired by the arguments of their leaders, but once they understand our correct claims, their falsehoods will be revealed. As a result, they will understand, isn't this war for Roosevelt? Isn't Roosevelt a Jew? This is a point that must be made clear to them. (The End) (Xiang: Translated from the July 13 issue of the Mainichi Shimbun)

The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in Shanghai remained stable last week.

The stock market fluctuated uncertainly until Friday, when the authorities announced that the Central Reserve Bank had obtained a 400 million yen loan from the Bank of Japan to strengthen the Central Reserve Bank notes and enhance their value.

### Lao Zha Branch Bureau Formulates Fingerprint Registration and Certificate Exchange Procedures

In order to complete the fingerprint registration for the exchange of resident certificates for citizens as soon as possible, the Baojia Section of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau has formulated temporary measures based on the fingerprint registration principles formulated by the Baojia Office to facilitate the citizens and hopes that the citizens will strictly follow them. The measures are as follows:

Officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment in the current National Government, or members of the Central Executive Committee or Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, or their families, are exempt from fingerprint registration, but must fill out the resident certificate application form in the prescribed manner, affix their seal, and submit it to the Baojia Office of the Police Bureau with a letter, supporting documents, and two 2.5-inch half-length photos.

For ordinary citizens who have missed fingerprint registration, they must state the reason and apply to the Baojia Section after 4:30 PM every day to complete the procedures.

For civil servants who cannot come to register their fingerprints on time due to work reasons, they may apply to the Baojia Section to complete the procedures after 4:30 PM every day, or from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM on Saturday afternoons.

For pregnant women who are about to give birth or are in labor, they must apply to the Baojia Section to complete the fingerprint registration after being certified by the Baojia Chief in charge.

For disabled persons such as the blind or those with paralyzed legs, the Baojia Section will arrange for staff to go to their residence to complete the fingerprint registration procedures after being certified by the Baojia Chief in charge. In addition to the standard handling fee of five yuan, no other fees may be charged for completing the fingerprint registration procedures.

For gentry and celebrities who are well-versed in local public welfare undertakings and are recognized by society, as well as senior officials of the Municipal Government District Public Office and the Municipal Police Bureau, they may apply to the Baojia Section to consider sending staff to their residence to complete the fingerprint registration procedures. In addition to the standard handling fee of five yuan, no other fees may be charged.

### Well Digging Guide

Well Location: A slightly elevated location should be selected, and there should be no unclean or filthy objects nearby (such as damaged sewers, dirty ponds, stables, latrines, and septic tanks).

Construction: The inner wall of the well must be paved with impermeable materials (such as bricks and cement) to the water surface or below, about fifteen to thirty feet from the ground. At the wellhead on the ground, a well curb about one foot high must be built, and the surrounding ground must also be paved with cement, with a radius of at least six feet, sloping outward from the foot of the well curb. The purpose is to prevent sewage from nearby ground from returning to the well without proper filtration.

Depth: The depth of an earthen well should be as deep as possible, but the minimum depth must reach more than fifteen feet underground to be safe.

Disinfection: When well water is used as drinking water, it must be boiled for a considerable amount of time, as this is the most reliable method of sterilization. In addition, it is best to disinfect well water with bleaching powder once a week. The method is as follows: (A) Calculate the volume of water in the well, i.e., (well radius × well radius × 3.1416 × water depth × 6.25), and the unit of the resulting number is gallons. (B) Dissolve five English ounces of bleaching powder in one gallon of purified water to form a solution. (C) Add two ounces of the solution described in item (B) to every 100 gallons of well water to achieve disinfection. Water is an indispensable drink for human beings, and it is of great importance to human health. If one is not careful and drinks it, one will get sick. It is hoped that those who dig and use wells will pay close attention to the above points.

### Teachers' Salaries Should Be Genuinely Improved; Education Seniors Express Opinions

Recently, the cost of living in schools at all levels in this city has risen sharply. In order to take care of the livelihood of teachers and staff and the opening of schools, tuition fees for the next semester have been increased by about four times compared with the previous semester. The average tuition fee for middle schools is 5,000 yuan, so in the future, the treatment of teachers in schools in this city will have a large room for improvement. However, judging from the past situation, the funds of many schools are managed by the principal alone and are never made public. Therefore, how the treatment of teachers should be reasonably improved after the tuition fees have been increased fourfold is highly valued by all sectors of society. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited a senior figure in the education sector, who expressed the following opinions:

"The cost of living has risen sharply, and the increase in tuition fees in various schools is indeed a last resort to cope with the environment. After all, the increase in tuition fees will inevitably increase the number of students who drop out of school. This phenomenon is ultimately not a blessing for the country and society. Fortunately, all sectors of society are enthusiastic about rescuing students who have dropped out of school, which is of great benefit. However, the promotion of education is not only about rescuing students who have dropped out of school. If the lives of teachers are not stable, then there is still no hope for the future of education. Therefore, if the treatment of teachers is not reasonably improved after the increase in tuition fees, it will not only fail to consolidate the education cause, but also make the public enthusiastic, so attention can be paid to the teachers in each school in the next semester.

According to the current fees charged by various schools, the average middle school is 5,000 yuan. If the number of students in each class is 50, then the fee charged for each class is 250,000 yuan. According to the provisions of past education laws, in addition to 30% for school administrative expenses, 25% of 70% is for staff salaries, and the remainder should be used for teacher salaries. That is, of the 250,000 yuan, 131,200 yuan should be allocated for teacher salaries. If this number is divided into six months, then the monthly teacher salary is 21,800 yuan. If each month is counted as four weeks, then the weekly teacher salary is 5,460 yuan. According to the middle school curriculum standards, if each class is taught for 30 hours per week, then the teacher's salary should be reasonably at 180 yuan per hour. In Shanghai, many private schools only calculate the salary for each semester for five months, then according to the above situation, the teacher's salary per hour should be 218 yuan.

However, there are many schools in Shanghai, and the distribution of students may not be average. Moreover, it is not easy for some schools without the credentials to be trusted by the public to have 50 students in each class. However, during the war period, in order to save manpower and material resources, it is really necessary to consider merging schools with only 23 or only 10 to 20 students in each class for classes. Otherwise, it will only waste money, and the teachers will not be able to make a living, which will not benefit the public or the private sector. As for the school administrative expenses, 30% is taken out of the percentage. According to the above situation, each class is about 75,000 yuan. If a school has a total of six high and junior high school classes, the school administrative expenses for each semester will be 450,000 yuan. According to the current equipment situation of general schools, it does not seem to be a concern."
