### President Wang's Meritorious Service to the Party and the Nation: The National Government Issued a Decree for a State Funeral Yesterday, and a Detailed Biography Will Be Compiled and Recorded.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – President Wang passed away in Japan, causing deep mourning both domestically and internationally. The President inherited the teachings of the Founding Father, dedicated himself to the revolution, and struggled arduously, rendering meritorious service to the Party and the nation. The National Government hereby issues a clear decree to hold a state funeral, with all funeral expenses paid by the national treasury. His life's achievements will be recorded in the national history. The decree is recorded as follows:

National Government Decree

The late Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhaoming, cultivated his aspirations and integrity, and skillfully managed important events. As a pioneer of the revolution, he inherited the teachings of the Founding Father. Initially, he joined the Alliance with unwavering determination, and later, he shouldered the responsibility of a turbulent era. The great cause initially flourished, and the foundation of the nation was established, ushering in an era of democratic governance celebrated worldwide, and the people enjoyed the vast benefits of the republic. The creation was arduous, and changes occurred frequently. Despite facing bloodshed and political struggles, he governed for many years, knowing when to advance and when to retreat, and acting with righteousness. His actions, whether in the forefront or in the rear, in times of peace or danger, served as a model for others. In governing the people, he was kind and benevolent; in leading the army, he combined leniency with strictness. He emphasized the importance of establishing a strong foundation for the economy and prioritizing moral education in schools. He encouraged his comrades to persevere and cautioned his subordinates to be honest and humble. All of this was in line with the continuous development of the nation and contributed to the framework of the constitution. Furthermore, amidst the raging global changes and the nation's difficulties, he believed that those who hate their enemies without cause will perish, and those who lightly advocate war will fail. In times of stability, one should be mindful of what influences one, and after a major catastrophe, one should prioritize cultivation and protection. Exploiting the people is not the intention of a benevolent leader, and the establishment of a nation should prioritize good neighborly policies. Seeking a win-win situation, he hoped to achieve harmony. However, when the flames of war spread and peace became unattainable, he embarked on a difficult journey, shedding tears as he sailed. He worked tirelessly to stabilize the nation and transform neighboring countries into allies. He inscribed his efforts to preserve the integrity of the nation amidst the devastation. He led the people with unwavering dedication, daring to revive the nation and shouldering heavy responsibilities. During his five years in office, he achieved great accomplishments that will last for millennia. He worked tirelessly day and night, enduring both heat and cold, solely burdened by the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. He hoped that the people would achieve a comfortable life, that the nation would endure through trials, and that all endeavors would be revived. He further encouraged steadfastness in action and sought peaceful unification. Unexpectedly, underlying illnesses worsened due to overwork, and despite his failing health, he did not neglect his duties. Even during his limited rest, he remained concerned about the welfare of the people. Ultimately, he sacrificed himself to serve the nation, equating sacrifice with benevolence. News of his death spread far and wide, shocking and grieving the world, and deeply mourning the nation. Reflecting on the late President's forty years of service, his contributions extended to future generations, and his comprehensive plans for centuries were embodied in his life. His sudden passing, however, left a legacy of virtue and a model for future generations. Without adequate posthumous honors, how can we fully express our admiration? It is hereby decreed that a state funeral be held, and the Wang Zhaoming Funeral Committee be established to respectfully organize all matters. All necessary funeral expenses shall be paid by the national treasury. Furthermore, his life's achievements shall be submitted to the National History Compilation Committee for careful compilation and biographical recording, so that his noble spirit may shine brightly and his integrity may endure forever, and his majestic mausoleum may symbolize the virtue of a great man for generations to come, demonstrating the nation's profound memory of its leader. This decree is issued by Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo on the 14th day of November in the 33rd year of the Republic of China.

Central Party Headquarters Commemoration

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – The entire members of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, led by Acting Chairman Chen, will pay their respects at the President's coffin in the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM today (the 15th).

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – All working comrades of the Central Party Headquarters, led by Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee and Acting Minister of Organization, etc., paid their respects at the President's coffin in the National Government Auditorium at 11:00 AM on the 14th. The memorial address is recorded as follows: On this 14th day of November in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee and Acting Minister of Organization, Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda, Peng Nian, Minister of Social Affairs, Chen Qun, Chairman of the Party History and Materials Compilation Committee, and Pu Dong, Secretary-General of the Central Supervisory Committee, lead all working comrades to offer incense and flowers to the spirit of our supreme leader, Wang Zhaoming. Alas, our esteemed leader, born with intelligence and raised with family teachings, possessed extensive knowledge of classics and history. He traveled east to study, demonstrating vigor and determination. His nationalist ideas originated from this point. Joining the Alliance, he assisted the Premier, tirelessly engaging in the revolution and braving dangers. His assassination attempt against the Qing government terrified the court. His inspiring poems expressed his noble spirit. In a nation riddled with chaos and turmoil, his loyalty and dedication to the country were met with resentment. He strived to maintain the precarious situation with sincerity and integrity. The survival of China and Japan was interconnected, and the revitalization of China and the preservation of Asia were long-term plans. He overcame numerous difficulties and dedicated himself to the cause. He promoted the New Life Movement and enlightened the people. His great achievements will be remembered for generations. Alas, Heaven was not kind, and he passed away suddenly. The fall of this giant star caused the people to shed tears. His legacy will endure, and his spirit will never die. We, his comrades in the Party, pledge our loyalty and determination to continue the struggle and fulfill his aspirations. May his spirit be our guide. We offer this sacrifice.

President Wang's Last Words

We must unite and concentrate all the strength of China to contribute to China's independence and autonomy.

In a protracted war, the nation whose people are most capable of enduring hardship and toil will be the closest to victory.

The sole objective today is "decisive victory," and the primary requirement is "sincere unity." Forgetting the public good is forgetting the nation, and if the nation is forgotten, it will perish.

### Three Japanese Religions Hold Joint Sutra Recitation to Commemorate

### Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks Morotai Airfield

Southern Japanese Military Base, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force attacked the enemy's northern airfield on Morotai Island at dawn on the 11th, destroying its camouflage areas. Another squadron dropped giant bombs on the southern airfield, inflicting heavy damage on the camouflage areas. At 4:30 AM on the 12th, they attacked Morotai Island again, braving fierce enemy fire to bomb the outposts, causing the material storage area on the west side of the airfield to catch fire. The Japanese planes returned safely.

### Japanese Troops Advance in Guangxi, Occupy Qianjiang County, and Achieve Great Results in the Capture of Guilin

South China Front, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese troops advancing on the Guixian Plain overcame the resistance of the Chongqing troops on the morning of the 11th, crossed a tributary of the Wujiang River east of Qianjiang, and occupied the key town of Qianjiang County (70 kilometers west of Wuxuan). They are continuing their advance.

Guangxi Front, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese troops achieved great results in capturing Guilin this time. As of noon on the 11th, it was determined that they had captured over 13,000 Chongqing troops, and more are continuing to surrender to the Japanese army. Therefore, this number has exceeded the 5,600 Chongqing troops killed, proving that the morale of the Chongqing troops is extremely low. In particular, the Chongqing troops, including the elite 131st Division and two other divisions, who were defending Guilin, claimed to have a comprehensive plan of defense and vowed to hold out for a year even if surrounded by the Japanese army. At the same time, the Chongqing military authorities ordered them to defend to the last soldier. However, the operation shows how demoralized the Chongqing troops are, having lost their purpose for resistance.

Wei Yunsong's Troops Surrender

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – When the Japanese troops attacking Guilin approached the outskirts of Guilin and completed the encirclement, they began a fierce attack on the morning of the 9th. At that time, the defending troops under Wei Yunsong, Deputy Commander of the 16th Army Group of Chongqing, were ordered to defend Guilin strictly, but they were eventually defeated and surrendered after resisting for more than 30 hours due to the fierce Japanese attacks. The losses suffered during the battle included 5,665 Chongqing troops left dead and 13,151 captured, bringing the total number of Chongqing casualties in the battle to 20,000. Among the spoils of war captured by the Japanese army, the number of captured Chongqing troops was greater than the number of Chongqing troops left dead, and a large amount of weapons and military supplies such as artillery, tanks, trucks, and aircraft parts were also seized. This is indeed noteworthy. The tightness of the Japanese encirclement and the speed of the general attack prevented the Chongqing troops from moving heavy weapons and military supplies in time. At the same time, the will to fight of the Chongqing defense forces had already been lost at the start of the battle. These factors contributed to the great results of this battle. According to the results announced by the Japanese headquarters on the 13th, the results were only determined as of noon on the 11th, and the results after that will be even greater.

U.S. Base Moves to Kunming

According to a report from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, the U.S. Air Force Command stationed in Chongqing announced on the 13th that due to the Japanese offensive, the Liuzhou air base had been destroyed and evacuated on the 7th. They will continue to operate from Kunming as the center, with the Guiyang and Nanning airfields as bases. This announcement is tantamount to a self-description of the U.S. Air Force's predicament in being forced to withdraw and implicitly acknowledges the fall of Guilin. According to other reports, when the U.S. Air Force withdrew, the commander personally directed the transportation of personnel and equipment to Kunming in adverse weather conditions in as many as 40 flights, making the general withdrawal quite difficult. This shows the general miserable retreat of the U.S. Air Force.

### The Japanese Army Has Established an Absolute Strategic Advantage: Broadcast Speech by Minister of Information Matsumura

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Major General Matsumura, Minister of Military Information of the Japanese Headquarters, gave a broadcast speech on the 13th evening on the topic of Guilin and Leyte, saying: "The Japanese army has repeatedly achieved victories on the southern front in China. At the same time, the fighting is very fierce. The enemy's attempt to obstruct the Japanese army's supply lines in the Philippines has also been destroyed. Here, the Japanese army has established an absolute strategic advantage, the importance of which is extremely clear. The key to the final outbreak of the Philippine battle lies in how aircraft are produced and supplied. At present, the national will of all Japanese people is aroused, and they are working together to produce and expand production capacity to build the Philippines into a graveyard for the American enemy and to become a base for the Japanese offensive."

Editorial

### People's Livelihood Needs to Be Stabilized Urgently

Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, returned to Japan in early July and has now returned to his post and arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, and went to Nanjing on the 5th. Advisor Ogura gave important speeches in Shanghai and Nanjing on the 4th and 8th, respectively, elaborating on the issues of improving China's economy in great detail.

Advisor Ogura discussed important matters and recuperated in Japan for four months. Although there have been no major changes in China's internal situation during these four months, there is a feeling that various economic issues have become more complex. In particular, the high degree of price increases must have surprised Advisor Ogura at first sight. The prices of various goods, not only on the black market, have risen alarmingly, and even the officially set prices have been repeatedly increased. The situation when Advisor Ogura returned to China this time is very different compared to the situation in early July, and even more different compared to when Advisor Ogura first arrived in mid-April. Advisor Ogura led important figures from the allied economic circles to China for inspection in July last year, came to China in April this year to take office as the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, returned to Japan in July, and then came back this month. In his previous speeches, he has particularly emphasized China's price problem, currency problem, food problem, and production problem. The points raised by Advisor Ogura, who is relatively knowledgeable about China's actual situation, are indeed the truth of the Chinese economy, which has been in a serious state for years.

Now the price problem is getting worse and worse. What about the currency problem? Although Central Reserve Bank notes do need to be issued more frequently as the circulation area expands, the situation of too much money and too few goods is undeniably having a significant impact on finances and stimulating prices. As for industrial and agricultural production, industrial production has obviously declined due to insufficient raw materials, electricity, and transportation difficulties; on the agricultural side, the situation has been undermined by imperfect personnel management and heavy taxes and levies. The relatively good rural areas at present are only inclined towards self-sufficiency. This primitive self-sufficient economy is not a reasonable thing in terms of exerting China's material resources to contribute to the Greater East Asia War.

How can we improve the above things? Here, we believe that the points raised by Advisor Ogura in his speech to the press corps in Beijing on the 9th of this month, "thorough unification of administrative power is something that should be worked on." However, to make administrative power thorough and strengthen the power of the National Government - giving the National Government greater power, adjusting political and economic institutions, improving administrative facilities, and recruiting useful talents from all quarters, etc. - are necessary conditions. At the same time, we also feel that what Advisor Ogura mentioned in Nanjing in July last year, "The Chinese side hopes that the Japanese economic circles will have a deep understanding of the truth about China," (see this newspaper on July 24 last year) is still important now. Advisor Ogura also said at the time: "The operation of the Chinese economy still seems to require guidance with the thinking of the Chinese people. Japan must study the Chinese national character and use the special characteristics of the Chinese people in economic terms." Therefore, taking into account the reality of China and implementing appropriate countermeasures within the scope allowed by the realistic conditions is also the key to solving China's current economic difficulties.

Furthermore, the point raised by Advisor Ogura in his article "To Chinese Financial People" in August last year, "If the minimum living standard cannot be maintained, the war cannot be carried out," is particularly important. Advisor Ogura also expressed the same emphasis on the issue of people's livelihood in his speech after coming to Shanghai this time, which is what we agree with. Stabilizing people's livelihood is one of the basic conditions for exerting China's human and material resources. We hope that concrete countermeasures will be implemented, which will not only be a blessing for the Chinese people, but also a benefit for Japan.

### East of Luzon Island: One Enemy Battleship Sunk - Results of the Japanese Army's Special Attack Force

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 14th: (1) The Fugaku Flying Corps of the Japanese Special Attack Force attacked the enemy's mobile unit east of Luzon Island on the evening of the 13th, sinking one enemy battleship.

(2) Regarding the aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Hiroshi Ishikawa and Corporal Tomifuku Mitsuda of the same flying corps, it collided with an enemy ship when attacking the enemy's mobile unit east of Luzon Island on November 7th, so the results of the battle could not be determined.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army's Special Attack Force annihilated an enemy mobile unit again in the sea east of the Philippines on the afternoon of the 13th, sinking one of its battleships. The Kofu aircraft of the First Squadron of the Fugaku Flying Corps (piloted by Major Tsunezaburo Nishio, Second Lieutenant Sadao Shibata, and Second Lieutenant Yoshitaro Yonezu) and the Second aircraft (piloted by Warrant Officer Takeo Kunishige and Sergeant Nobuo Shimamura) departed from the base at noon on the 13th. At 5:47 PM, they arrived over the enemy's mobile unit in the sea east of the Philippines. Major Nishio, the squadron leader, immediately telegraphed the "All-aircraft general attack order," followed by messages at 5:50 PM, "All personnel are in high spirits," and at 5:58 PM, "Descending for reconnaissance." At 6:02 PM, they reported a sinking, after which contact was lost. The accompanying command reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the vanguard aircraft and the second aircraft, above the enemy's mobile unit, eliminated the obstruction of twelve enemy giant fighters and attacked from an altitude of 8,000 meters. At 6:05 PM, they violently hit one enemy battleship, sinking it in just 30 seconds. They then safely flew back to base and reported this. Furthermore, the Second Squadron of the Fugaku Flying Corps, due to dense clouds, could not find the enemy and returned to base, where they are currently awaiting orders to sortie.

### Announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry: Sugakawa's Wartime Achievements

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Navy Ministry announced on the 14th: Petty Officer Hiroshi Sugakawa of the Navy's Air Force shot down two fighters protecting the enemy's mobile unit in the sea east of New Ireland Island on October 25th, enabling the attack force to sink one enemy aircraft carrier and one cruiser, and damage one aircraft carrier, establishing enormous merit. The Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet has announced his distinguished service to the entire army.

### Enemy Forces Surrounded in the Carigara Area

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese Army forces in the Carigara area of Leyte Island are gradually encircling a portion of the enemy's 14th Division that boldly advanced to the west of that area. The enemy forces under Japanese encirclement are currently struggling desperately. On the 10th of this month, the enemy, with several tanks and approximately 700 infantrymen, attacked the front of a small Japanese unit's position in that area. However, the Japanese forces fought bravely and received reinforcements from new forces in the rear, turning defense into offense and inflicting a painful blow on the enemy, causing them to flee. The enemy forces are currently on the verge of collapse under the Japanese siege. Furthermore, as of 2:00 PM on the 8th, the war results achieved by the Japanese land forces in the Carigara area have been confirmed to include over one hundred enemy bodies abandoned, three tanks immobilized, and six automobiles, one anti-aircraft gun, and three heavy machine guns destroyed.

The city's various government departments held the first preparatory meeting for the memorial service at the Municipal Government Conference Hall yesterday (the 14th) at 4:00 PM, and decided to hold a grand memorial service today at the City Chamber of Commerce Auditorium.

Municipal Government Officials Held a Preliminary Memorial Service Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon, a preliminary memorial service was held in the Municipal Government Conference Hall, with Secretary-General Wu leading several hundred participants, including the heads of various bureaus and departments and senior officials of the municipal government. Secretary-General Wu presided over the ceremony. Chairman Wang's portrait was solemnly enshrined in the hall, surrounded by flowers. The altar was arranged with extreme solemnity and reverence. The ceremony began at 4:00 PM with everyone standing in solemn silence. Presiding Officer Wu Songgao took his place, and mourning music was played. The most respectful three bows were made to the portrait, followed by the offering of flowers and a moment of silence. After the eulogy was read, the ceremony concluded. The eulogy read: "On this 14th day of November in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality, leading all his officials, offers heartfelt condolences to the spirit of Chairman Wang. Ah, our Chairman, born into this world, possesses warmth, kindness, respect, thrift, and humility. Heaven bestowed upon him intelligence and wisdom, knowledge of ancient and modern times, and fame at home and abroad. He educated the people and nurtured all things, growing from childhood to adulthood. He followed the National Father, dedicated himself to revolution, and espoused freedom and love, diligence and personal involvement. Patriots from all directions flocked to him like the wind. He faced dangers and obstacles, never avoiding hardships. He恪遵遗嘱, 不忘不愆 (idiom meaning he carefully followed the dying wishes of Sun Yat-sen), never forgetting or deviating from them. He built the Republic of China for over forty years. He never forgot his responsibilities and shouldered great tasks alone. As the tide of chaos was about to overwhelm, he bravely turned the situation around. He created the harmony movement and became the mainstay of the nation. He宣揚主義, 共榮亞洲 (idiom meaning he promoted his ideology and advocated for the shared prosperity of Asia). He faced countless difficulties and toiled tirelessly,鞠躬盡瘁, 一死千秋 (idiom meaning he gave his all until his dying day, leaving a legacy for generations to come). Alas, why did Heaven not protect us and take away our leader? The shocking news spread like wildfire, shaking the world. Mount Tai has collapsed, and the entire city is in mourning. All the officials are in tears and bewildered. We will inherit your legacy and dare not retreat. The responsibility of those who survive will never change. We pray for your continued blessing and guidance. A fragrant offering of respect, we will always follow your example. Please accept this humble offering."

### Zhao Zhengping and Chen Shao, Eulogies for Chairman Wang

Mr. Zhao Zhengping, a member of the National Government, issued the following statement from his sickbed regarding the passing of Chairman Wang: "I have been confined to my sickbed for the past two weeks, and my knowledge of external affairs has been limited. I was shocked to learn of Chairman Wang's death during my illness and can only offer my condolences from my sickbed. I believe that in this turbulent world, there is no happiness to be found. Those with political aspirations and ideas, and those engaged in political activities, are even more unfortunate than ordinary people. Chairman Wang was one such unfortunate individual. He harbored the ambition of promoting peace, but in this turbulent world, he overworked himself into illness and passed away. It is truly unfortunate. However, the idea of striving for peace to save China is an absolute truth and will undoubtedly endure. Often, an ambition, even if not realized during one's lifetime, will eventually see the light of day within a reasonable period of time after death. Although Chairman Wang has passed away suddenly, I firmly believe that the ambition of striving for peace to save China will be achieved through the united efforts of the Chinese people. Not only will we see the light of comprehensive peace in this turbulent situation, but the peace of the entire world will undoubtedly be realized as well."

Mr. Chen Shao, Director of the Hua Zhong Headquarters of the Economic Negotiation Council, issued the following eulogy regarding the passing of Chairman Wang: "Chairman Wang of the National Government toiled tirelessly for the nation, sacrificing himself selflessly. His passing due to overwork is deeply regrettable. Throughout his life, from his acquaintance with the National Father and his participation in the revolution to his efforts in the peace movement, he devoted himself to the cause of China's independence and the liberation of the East Asian nations. Now that we have lost our great leader, in addition to expressing our deepest condolences, we must implement Chairman Wang's unfulfilled aspirations and strive for the realization of comprehensive peace, so that we may console his spirit in heaven."

### Strict Prohibition by the Economic Security Office: Over-Quantity Removal of Materials - Regulations on the Permitted Quantity of Materials Leaving the City

The economic authorities of this city are inspecting the inventory of goods in storage yards and warehouses. To prevent the clandestine removal of materials, the Economic Security Office, with reference to the quantity table for material removal stipulated by the Economic Bureau, is supervising its subordinates to strictly enforce regulations. The permitted quantities of various materials being removed are as follows: Cotton cloth, three yards; cotton thread, two ounces; matches, five small boxes; sugar, one catty (the same applies to substitute sugar leaves); candles, one package (six pieces); soap, half a dozen (the same applies to six pieces of laundry soap). Any items exceeding the stipulated quantity will be subject to confiscation.

### Police Bureau's Inspection Department Rectifies Police Discipline

The Inspection Department of the Municipal Police Bureau is strictly rectifying police discipline, especially regarding the inspection of traffic police. Various inspection districts are actively promoting this, resulting in a large number of policemen being punished recently. As for illegal activities such as police openly extorting money, which constitute criminal offenses, once verified, in addition to administrative punishments such as dismissal, they will also be handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution according to the law.

### Deadline for Dangerous Goods Registration Extended

The Municipal Police Bureau has extended the registration period for explosive and flammable dangerous goods. The authorities issued the following statement: "On November 4th, the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau issued Notice No. 4 instructing the registration of explosive and flammable dangerous goods. This process began at the Economic Security Office of this Bureau on November 6th. However, this registration of dangerous goods differs from the registration of major commodities and other items because it involves items of a special nature. It is more difficult for trade associations and other groups to supervise registration, so there may be omissions among general owners and custodians. In particular, the registration of dangerous goods is an important measure for prevention policies during air raids and emergencies. To ensure thoroughness, the registration period is specially extended. Extending the registration period after issuing a notice is a customary practice. Based on the above reasons, we are extending the period. Owners and custodians who are required to register dangerous goods must register with the Economic Police Team nearest to the Economic Security Office of this Bureau during the registration period. After the registered dangerous goods are moved, the Economic Police Team must be notified within three days. We have previously warned that violations of these regulations will result in the confiscation of the illegal items and severe penalties according to the law. We hereby reiterate this warning. The extended registration period is from 9:00 AM on November 13th, 1944 to 4:00 PM on November 18th, 1944. Application forms can be obtained from the nearest Economic Police Team. Regarding Notice No. 4 of this Bureau, which stated that all quantities, regardless of size, must be registered, this time, items listed under items (1) and (2) that are small quantities necessary for daily household use or business operations do not need to be registered."

### Special Broadcasts Begin: Ren Yunpeng Lectures Yesterday

After the passing of Chairman Wang of the National Government, the entire nation was shocked and mourned. The National Government ordered all provinces and cities to suspend banquets and entertainment to express condolences. Government officials and the public complied and followed the orders. The China Broadcasting Association also scheduled special broadcasts for mourning in both Nanjing and Shanghai, beginning immediately for a period of one week. The Shanghai Radio Station specially invited Mr. Ren Yunpeng, Director-General of the Shanghai News Association, to lecture yesterday (the 14th) from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM. The lecture was titled "Respectfully Mourning Chairman Wang," and it provided a detailed account of the Chairman's great personality and his life of heroic struggle.

### Reviewing the Qualifications of Directors, Supervisors, and Managers of Banks

As the strengthening of the business of financial institutions has begun, the names, ages, native places, addresses, and qualifications of the chairmen, directors, supervisors, general managers, and managers of the various financial institutions will also be reviewed. All financial institutions are hereby notified to complete and submit the forms by the end of this month for screening and rectification.

### Over Seventy Illegal Rice Merchants Arrested Yesterday: Authorities are Conducting Strict Interrogation

The relevant authorities in this city are making every effort to suppress prices and stabilize the livelihoods of the people. However, unscrupulous merchants, disregarding the laws, often raise prices arbitrarily, severely affecting the livelihoods of the people. This is especially true of the recent sharp rise in rice prices. In view of the unabated nature of this trend and the further suffering it will cause the people, the Economic Security Office has mobilized its cadres in recent days to conduct a rigorous investigation. As a result, yesterday (the 14th), it quickly investigated and arrested over seventy rice shops and their customers who were illegally manipulating rice prices. They are currently undergoing strict interrogation. Anyone found to have manipulated the rice market will be punished to the fullest extent of the law and will not be shown any leniency. It is also heard that the Economic Security Office authorities, in order to thoroughly implement the policy of stabilizing the livelihoods of the people, are also investigating the causes of the sharp rise in other commodity prices and the individuals manipulating them behind the scenes. In the future, anyone found to have arbitrarily raised prices or violated the law will be severely punished. It is hoped that all businesses and the public will abide by the laws and regulations and refrain from any transgressions.

### Deadline Extended for Nanshi Household Coal Briquettes

The issuance of household coal briquettes in the entire Nanshi district has been extended to the 25th of this month due to the shipping of the coal briquettes by various retail merchants. Comprehensive Rationing Certificate No. 20 will be used.

### Urging Coal Briquette Factories to Register

The Municipal Economic Bureau, in view of the fact that the various coal briquette manufacturers in the city, which are not subject to rationing, produce various coal briquettes of low quality, high price, and difficult to burn, in order to regulate the quantity needed, stabilize prices, and supervise the composition of the coal briquettes produced by these manufacturers, published a notice in the newspaper on the 3rd of this month, instructing the manufacturers to collect the investigation forms from the Bureau and fill them out according to the format, so that the Bureau can find ways to adjust the situation. It is now known that the majority of those who have complied with the deadline to fill out the forms within the past week are in the majority, while there are still many who are waiting to see what happens. It is also heard that the Bureau has set the 21st of this month to begin the investigation. At that time, those who are found not to have filled out the forms with the Bureau will be severely punished or ordered to suspend their business as a warning. The date of the start of the investigation is approaching, so it is hoped that they will quickly go to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to collect the forms and complete the filling out procedures.

### Various Schools Initiate the Organization of Public Libraries

The biggest problem in Shanghai's education sector at present is the lack of books. Students in secondary schools and above must collect various reference books to supplement the deficiencies of textbooks, but they cannot buy various important books, and even if they can buy them, the prices are too high to bear. To make up for this shortcoming, the only way is to enrich the libraries of various schools. However, the libraries of various schools in Shanghai are limited by funds, and the collection of books is not sufficient. More than ten schools, such as Shanghai Girls' High School, Chongde Girls' High School, and Huade High School, are initiating the joint organization of a public library by various schools, so that the collection of books from various schools can be put together to enrich the library. On the one hand, they will submit a request to the Education Bureau for assistance in the process. If this plan can be carried out smoothly, then the physical and chemical laboratories, etc., can be organized in this way, and students can be expected to benefit immensely.

### YMCA Prize Exhibition: Selected Works Sold for Charity

The Prize Exhibition organized by the YMCA is very crowded with visitors every day.

It is now heard that the YMCA authorities, with the consent of the four gentlemen, plan to select one work each and hold a charity sale. The proceeds will be allocated by this newspaper to charitable causes.

### The Venting of Public Opinion in North China

— Wu Gong

— The Entire League Conference of the New People's Association —

This time, the reporter was in the old capital when the New People's Association convened its Fifth Plenary Joint Conference. This entire league is actually the general assembly of all the representatives of the New People's Associations in various places, but its nature is only an agreement and does not have legal significance. At first, I did not attach importance to this meeting, thinking it was just a meeting to talk and say things, but after personally seeing the situation on the second day of the entire league's discussion, when the representatives unanimously stood on the people's position and loudly called out, I deeply felt that it was really rare to see it in today's peaceful area. At least the opinions of the general public have been presented to the public, and even the current unreasonable situation of Sino-Japanese cooperation has been clearly stated. The reporter now briefly reports on the various sections recorded in the "New People's Voice" published by the General Association of the New People's Association, so that the people in the south can see a glimpse of the public opinion in North China. At the same time, it is hoped that the National Government will pay attention to the establishment of this public opinion organ, which is sufficient to assist the government in cooperating with the Allied powers in the decisive battle.

To Control the Economy, First Control the Conscience

It is said that in this entire league, the most outspoken and powerful speaker was Cheng Xixian. Mr. Cheng is a representative of Beijing. He used to be a cadre of the Northwest Army and served as the chief of the Tianjin Police Bureau and the Beijing Garrison Commander before the incident. The cases discussed this time can be roughly divided into the following items: (1) the poor management of the economy, (2) the problem of drug prohibition, (3) the problem of water conservancy in the management of the Yellow River, (4) the problem that Sino-Japanese joint ventures have become Japanese national policy companies, (5) the problem of civil servant treatment, and (6) the problem of corvée labor.

Regarding the improvement of the economic management problem, Wang Shijing, the Economic Supervisor, personally came to the venue that afternoon to explain. Let us note that it is said that in previous years, many officials attended the entire league to answer questions, but this time only Supervisor Wang was willing to come, and the others only sent people who were not actually responsible. However, before Supervisor Wang explained, he also put forward two conditions to publish his speech. I remember when the reporter went to see him a month ago, he also put forward these two conditions at that time, which shows that officials are still very afraid of people who are reporters!

What great views did Supervisor Wang express that day? It is said that he clearly attacked the deformed economic management and said in a serious tone: "What qualifications does such economic management have to be called management?" His conclusion put forward a new economic point of view. He believed that if China wants to talk about economic management at the current stage, it must first control the conscience, otherwise, it would be ineffective to arrest an economic criminal every day. Mr. Wang further said that although there is a shortage of materials now, it is not necessarily true that there is not enough. Finally, he guaranteed that there is no malignant inflation in North China now. Everyone at the time expressed satisfaction with Mr. Wang's remarks, because he had guaranteed to all sectors of society with his conscience last year, and this year he repeatedly emphasized his conscience, which shows that he himself would never do anything against his conscience.

Thoroughly Investigate the Property of Corruption and Run Social Undertakings

Afterwards, Pan Junqian, the representative of Tianjin City, temporarily moved to ask the government to thoroughly investigate the property of corruption in order to run social undertakings. He has the following paragraph of speech: "We people have the obligation to endure the suffering of wartime, but we cannot add the suffering of corruption, otherwise, it will reduce the strength to endure the suffering of wartime." Speaking of this, it brought up a problem of civil servant treatment. The North China authorities did not solve this problem until September, but the highest increase was only 260 yuan, which caused general dissatisfaction. What's more, at the same time, starting in September, the price of rationed flour was doubled, which has the pain of gaining without compensating. The venue was very tense at the time, and some people were even crying. Mr. Pan Junqian immediately quoted a slogan in a corner of the venue and said: "Giving full play to public opinion and solving the people's difficulties is when they are hungry. If you don't let the people eat, you will never be able to grasp the hearts of the people!" At this time, the famous gunman Cheng Xixian also inserted his speech and quoted the words of Wang Songwu, the representative of Tianjin, saying that a Japanese person saw Mr. Wang and said: "I didn't expect the prices to be so high, you are still alive!" (Before quoting, Mr. Cheng also asked Representative Wang if he could say it and said that he was willing to die with him. Representative Wang said, "Yes.") And shouted: "These are the words of people who pity us, doesn't the government pity us?" At this point, Mr. Cheng burst into tears, and the atmosphere in the entire venue reached its climax! The reporter saw this kind of conference that can really represent the people for the first time in the peaceful area.

Other issues such as the eradication of opium were changed to be discussed on the third day due to time constraints. However, in the article "To the Representatives" published in the "New People's Voice," the following is said about the prohibition of smoking: "Food has become a problem, we can forgive the poor public security and poor distribution, and we can also say that the economic system is unsound! But the opium problem has been like this year after year, I don't know what the reason is?" Therefore, the author argues that in order to solve the problem of drug prohibition, the government must have the determination! "He further said: "Let's shoot all the opium smokers, our people have no complaints!"

Odds and Ends at the Venue

In addition, I will report some odds and ends of the entire league. At the opening of the entire league, Foreign Minister Chu sent a representative of Chairman Wang to give instructions. The entire venue applauded and everyone stared intently, which deeply expressed the unity of China! The chairman of the conference was a "three-dynasty veteran of the entire league," 50 years old, and currently the assistant manager of the North China Commercial and Industrial Bank. It is said that he is a standard chairman. The vice-chairman was Wang Zisheng, a representative from Shandong, also known as Wang Xiaoyin in the news industry, a scholar in cloth clothes. In addition to the chairman and vice-chairman, there were also five female representatives from other places. (Sent from Beijing)
