### Public Utilities

The purpose of public utilities is to seek the welfare of the public, which is an immutable principle of nature and morality. Emphasizing public welfare does not mean cultivating habits of extravagance and dissipation among the general populace but rather enabling them to fully realize their individual intellectual and physical potential under various conveniences, reducing all unnecessary waste and increasing work efficiency, thereby forming the overall achievement of various undertakings.

Now, as the war is raging and the decisive moment is imminent, everything should be tightened. Public utilities, of course, should also be economized to contribute to strengthening war capabilities. This is another immutable principle of nature and morality. However, tightening should have its limits, and economizing should be rational. Otherwise, if one simply sits and consumes resources, how many days can the existing materials last? Moreover, the utilization of materials also requires manpower. If the efficiency of manpower decreases, the value of materials is also diminished, indirectly running counter to strengthening war capabilities!

For now, let's not discuss matters that are distant or grand. We only hope that public utilities, whether in terms of charges or supply quantities, when there are changes, will announce the date of implementation of new measures in advance. Since it is inevitable, why not announce it early? This is not a military secret, so why the need for such secrecy? For example, notices restricting water and electricity have sometimes been delivered more than a month after the deadline. How can the public utility agencies ensure that the actual situation aligns with their plans? And how can users know how to respond? Moreover, there are those who never receive notices of supply restrictions, and the execution of penalties comes suddenly, which is particularly offensive. Accepting the penalty is unwilling, and refusing the penalty will result in severe punishment. There is nothing more stimulating to the public than this! The same goes for the increase in tram fares. Passengers often only learn of the fare change after boarding the tram (the price increase on October 1st was indeed handled with great care and can be considered an exception). Moreover, if passengers do not have enough fare, they are forced to get off the tram midway, so what is the loss in terms of time and spirit?

Recently, the postal situation is also far from what it used to be. Letters within the local area often take three to five days, while letters to neighboring areas such as Suzhou and Hangzhou often take about a week to arrive. External areas may be affected by transportation, but not to such an extent. There is even less reason for this to be the case in the local area. Some postal workers openly engage in private peddling using their official bicycles, citing insufficient compensation as justification. But why doesn't the postal authority seek to improve this situation rationally? If the number of deliveries has indeed been formally reduced to save expenses, then the public should be notified so that senders know to mail letters earlier or even use other means, so as to avoid delaying the expected timeframe. Strictly speaking, the post office is not part of the public utilities because each urban area handles it separately, but its impact (especially the local post office) is no different from that of telephones and trams, so it is discussed here.

Decay breeds worms, and this has a gradual origin. Even one or two minor traces of corruption are enough to affect the entire society, and the rate of expansion is even greater than that of epidemics. Moreover, like the wind on the grass, it spreads even more violently. Reducing public trust, and the manifestation of a demoralized spirit in handling public affairs, is particularly alarming. How can other undertakings be any different? However, the quality of public utilities is felt more keenly and remembered most deeply by the general public because of their direct impact. It is hoped that public utilities will be improved. Let's not talk about increasing welfare; at least, unnecessary suffering can be avoided. At the same time, they can serve as a model for other undertakings, and the entire society will undergo a new look!

### Air Raids on Nansei Islands: Over Twenty Enemy Aircraft Shot Down, Japanese Submarines Also Sink Enemy Aircraft Carrier

### U.S. Ships Attacking Minami-Tori-shima Repelled Three Times

Three Cruisers and Destroyers Sunk

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Enemy U.S. warships shelled Minami-Tori-shima three times at dawn on the 1st. The Japanese garrison fiercely retaliated from the land-based artillery platforms, sinking one enemy destroyer and damaging one cruiser and one destroyer. There were two fierce battles in the morning and one in the afternoon. On the same night, the enemy's attempt to invade the Japanese military base failed, sacrificing many ships and soldiers. Japanese losses were light. The details are as follows: 1. In the first battle, an enemy U.S. formation composed of one Pennsylvania-class battleship, two Pensacola-class heavy cruisers, and several other types of destroyers attacked Minami-Tori-shima at dawn on the 9th, shelling and advancing. The Japanese garrison retaliated from the artillery platforms. As a result, one enemy destroyer was hit and sunk, and another heavy cruiser was hit by three shells and fled. 2.

### Fierce Fighting Continues on Geyatbus Island

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The enemy on Peleliu Island attacked the Japanese positions on Mt. Fuma in the northern part of the island again on the 8th with units equipped with sudden projectile launchers, but they were severely damaged and repelled by the Japanese forces. However, the enemy fiercely shelled the Japanese positions throughout the 9th, but the Japanese ground forces were not shaken by this. Therefore, from these movements, it is known that the enemy, in view of the significant damage they suffered in the past, are using ground forces with extreme caution. It is also learned that as of the 9th, nine enemy hospital ships had arrived on the island, as confirmed by the Japanese side. At the same time, after the Japanese launched a night raid on the enemy airfield on the 5th, a Japanese infiltrating attack team further infiltrated the enemy airfield and launched a daring attack, causing a violent explosion in the western part of the enemy airfield, followed by black smoke billowing into the sky, making the enemy tremble with fear. However, fierce fighting continues between the two sides on Geyatbus Island, north of Peleliu Island, but the enemy is actively using the airfield in the Peleliu Island area.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Central Pacific Telegraph: On Peleliu Island, the enemy forces, under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, launched an invasion of the Japanese positions in the southeastern area of the central highlands and the area of Mt. Suifu on the 7th, but they were all repelled. On the 8th, the enemy attempted to land on Sanzi Island from Peleliu Island with three amphibious tanks, but after 30 minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated.

### Taiwan Implements Armed Preparedness

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Korea and Taiwan have contributed all they have to the war. Korea is the central axis connecting Manchuria and Japan, and Taiwan is a stronghold for defending the sea transportation routes to the south and the mainland. Therefore, these places are of great importance. The current situation in Taiwan is introduced as follows: From a geographical perspective, Taiwan is the "pivot" for Japan's development in the South Seas. Its political value is even more important in the Greater East Asia War. Following the shift in the war situation, Taiwan has acquired an even more strategic character. The Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, anticipating that the U.S. military would simultaneously invade Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands after commencing operations in the Philippine Islands, decided on August 5th on the outline of Taiwan's armed preparedness, emphasizing defense facilities and combat operations, and prioritizing the mobilization of manpower and resources. The goal is to combine "strengthening defense capabilities" and "preparing the battlefield industrial economic situation," operating "battlefield administration," and establishing the Defense Headquarters of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan and the Economic Mobilization Department of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan. All affairs of the Governor-General's Office are merged into these two organizations. The affairs of the government offices under the Governor-General's Office are thoroughly abolished or suspended, and all personnel are assigned to production. The conscription system was implemented in Taiwan for Taiwanese people from September 11th. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people of Taiwan have been active on the front lines, serving as military laborers, interpreters, and nursing assistants. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, participation in the army and navy as special volunteers has been extremely enthusiastic. In 1943, there were 200,000, and this year it has exceeded 310,000. As for naval volunteers, there were 320,000 in 1943, and this year it has increased by 135,000. At the same time, Taiwan has specially established a "Labor Service Map," and the activities of the "Takasago Volunteer Corps" have been commemorated with勋功 and will be immortalized. With the implementation of the micro-conscription system, the people of Taiwan have now formed a large number of defense corps, engaged in the construction of public land, and all students have abandoned their textbooks.

### Thai Anti-Aircraft Bureau Announces Three U.S. Aircraft Shot Down

It is reported that the successor has been decided as Mr. Tokugawa Iesato, who was officially appointed this afternoon, the 11th, as follows: According to Article 11 of the House of Peers Ordinance, Duke Tokugawa Iesato, of the second rank and second order of merit, is appointed Speaker of the House of Peers.

### Two Armies Confronting Each Other North of Guilin

No Change in Xiang-Gui Railway War

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing army is currently confronting the Japanese army 25 kilometers north of Guilin. There has been no major change in the Xiang-Gui Railway war, but according to experts, this is a temporary situation. The Japanese army is currently continuing to reinforce and reorganize its troops, and may launch an attack in the near future to capture Guilin in one fell swoop. It is also possible that the Japanese army will attack Guilin from the east and west, and advance on Liuzhou via the city.

### A Glimpse of the Chaotic Situation in Shaoguan

Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency) - A young Chongqing army officer who recently fled from Shaoguan stated that the internal situation of the chaos in Zhao Guan is as follows: "I am an adjutant staff officer of the 158th Division under Yu Hanmou, and concurrently the deputy head of the National Guard. I fled from Shaoguan, the chaotic and uneasy anti-Japanese area, in late September. The area is currently terrified due to the rapid southward and northward advance of the Japanese army. The authorities have forcibly implemented evacuations, but now one-third of the evacuated citizens have been permitted by the authorities to return again. When the civilians evacuated, prices plummeted, but now they continue to rise, and most of the commerce has stopped."

### People in War Zones Cooperate with the Japanese Army

A Certain Japanese Army Frontline Base, 11th (Central News Agency) - Bai Chongxi, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army, is currently stationed in Guilin, responsible for defense. Recently, in addition to forming committees to prevent popular defection in Guilin and Liuzhou, the Chongqing Army has also deployed armed Three Principles of the People Youth Corps in areas where Japanese attacks are expected, making great efforts to defend. Moreover, after the fall of Hengyang, during a military conference held in a certain area of Hunan Province, Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin reported frankly on the fact that the people in the war zones were actively cooperating with the Japanese army. The fact that the Chinese people in the areas attacked by the Japanese army are actively cooperating with the Japanese army is due to their understanding of the Japanese army's strict military discipline and its true intentions. That is, they are awakened to the fact that peaceful unification is the only way to save the country. After the National Autonomous Army led by General Ou Daqing in South China was formed in Guangdong, within three months, it had generals, officers, and soldiers, which clearly shows the trend of popular sentiment in the Southwest region.

### Japanese Naval and Army Forces in South China Cooperate to Achieve Success

A Certain Japanese Army Base in South China - The Japanese naval unit stationed in China, South China Detachment, has been closely cooperating with the army units in the Guangdong area since the beginning of September to conduct operations. The summary of the battles up to the previous month is as follows: (1) In mid-September, the Japanese naval unit that advanced to Sanshui-kou continued to clear the waterways bravely under continuous enemy air raids. On the 17th, six P51 enemy aircraft attacked, and on the 14th, fourteen P5l enemy aircraft also strafed with machine guns for an hour and a half. The Japanese army immediately engaged them, shooting down one of them. On the other hand, the enemy's resistance from the riverbank was extremely fierce. The Japanese army resisted and repelled them, and also sunk the mines placed by the enemy when they retreated. By the end of September, the waterway at the planned location was successfully opened, and more than 200 mines were sunk during this period. (2) The naval unit that advanced to Zhaoqing continued to clear the Xijiang waterway since mid-September. On the 18th in Rongwan and on the 19th near Kong, less than 100 mines were disposed of. During this period, enemy aircraft frequently harassed. Thanks to the activity of Japanese army aircraft and the artillery fire of the army units on the riverbank, the crystal army warships were able to engage and gave full play to the magic of sea, land, and air integration, enabling them to continue the sweeping operations. When the Japanese army advanced to Fengchuan in late September, enemy aircraft attacked even more frequently. In early October, in the vicinity of Panlong, they engaged seven P5l enemy aircraft, and after repeatedly overcoming difficulties, they completed the expected tasks.

### The Central Government Solemnly Holds National Day Commemoration Ceremony

Acting Chairman Chen Reads Admonitory Speech

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Double Tenth National Day Commemoration Ceremony was solemnly held in the National Government Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 10th. Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo read out Chairman Wang's instruction on his behalf, the gist of which is as follows: "Since the birth of revolutionary thought, after thirty years of tempering, the Wuchang Uprising finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China. However, the oppression of imperialism has become increasingly severe, and the country has not yet reached a position of independence and freedom. With the power of China alone, it is impossible to fight against imperialism. The most rational method is for the oppressed nations of Asia to rise up together and overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. The Greater East Asia War truly has the so-called righteousness of liberating the East Asian nations, and it is also a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for China to break away from the shackles of imperialism. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has declared that it will share weal and woe with its ally Japan, and then declared war on Britain and the United States, mobilizing manpower and material resources to strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Since our National Government has returned to Nanjing, Japan has not only returned the concessions, but also abolished the unequal treaties, and in the protocol attached to the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, it has recognized that after the full realization of peace, it will withdraw its troops and abandon the right to station troops. Since Japan treats us equally with this attitude, Pan-Asianism is the highest principle for saving China and defending East Asia. All my comrades must strive to abide by it and believe in its implementation. Reviewing the facts of the past thirty-three years, one should know that the efforts of the early stage of the revolution were only for the success of the Wuchang Uprising. As for the completion of the revolution, it is necessary to fully recognize the National Revolution direction indicated by the Founding Father, and it is necessary to realize that this is the only way to save China and defend East Asia."

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - On National Day, the ambassadors of various countries in China went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the morning to offer their congratulations.

### Japanese Emperor Congratulates Our Country on National Day

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the Double Tenth National Day commemoration on October 10th, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, sent a special telegram to the Chinese central authorities to express their congratulations.

### The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy Four

— Tokutomi Sohō

As I said before, the enemy used 2,900 tons of shells and bombs to occupy Makin and Tarawa Islands, and 14,500 tons of shells and bombs to occupy Kwajalein and Roi-Namur Islands. The extravagance that the United States has shown in naval warfare in the Pacific, as lamented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, is that the war expenses since the start of the war have totaled 20,000 billion yen. The cost of simply occupying the Marshall Islands also amounted to 6,000 billion yen. If we calculate it according to the exchange rate before the war, the Marshall Islands operation alone would have cost 24,500 million yen.

But they don't just use material quantity to deal with us. They also have considerable spiritual strength. Although their spiritual strength is quite low-level, the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor!" does indeed have the greatest electrifying effect for the Americans. They regard war as a kind of sport, and swear to avenge the humiliation they have suffered from defeat. This is the meaning of sport. They themselves didn't know the Japanese spiritual strength in the past, but today they all have some understanding of it.

Now is the time to gradually and urgently counterattack. Before the authorities hope that the general public will all become like the Ji Sect, we have to fervently hope that the military and political authorities themselves will first become like the Ji Sect. Turning misfortune into fortune, now is the best opportunity. Reversing the tide when it has already fallen, today is the best time. The land that the enemy can attack has already been occupied. The road that can be advanced has already been advanced. It is impossible for them to further invade our homeland. In other words, since we are using the motherland with a three-thousand-year history as the battlefield, Japan, as the Art of War says, is "standing on invincible ground." They are an army suspended thousands of miles away. No matter how many aircraft carriers there are, no matter how much they use the Mariana Islands as an air base, in short, they are floating on foreign waters and standing on foreign soil. Their real source of strategy is far away in Washington.

This means that we are luring the enemy down to our feet to fight. If we have great determination, the closer the enemy gets, the more confident we will be. This is what is called waiting at ease for the fatigued.

Speaking of this, we can't help but think of the Battle of Byeokjegwan in the Japanese-Korean War. Naturally, during the Imjin War, the Japanese army landed in Busan and occupied Gyeongseong in a few days, and then divided the army into two routes, one to take Pyongyang and one to take Wiyeongdo. However, the Ming Dynasty reinforcements, with Li Rusong as the general, crossed the Yalu River and advanced like a hot knife through butter, capturing Pyongyang. Konishi Yukinaga barely escaped and fled to Jeongju. So the Japanese generals discussed how to intercept the Ming army, and most people advocated a forced battle in Gyeongseong. But only Kobayakawa Takakage opposed this opinion. He said:

"Since the beginning of the expedition, you have always won every battle, and only have the experience of winning battles, so you are not familiar with the methods of fighting in defeat. I have failed several times in previous expeditions, but in the end I achieved victory, turning defeat into victory, so I know the method of fighting in defeat. This time, I dare to ask to be entrusted with the great mandate. Even if our army wins one or two battles... it is like chasing away flies, which will come back after being chased away, then the Japanese soldiers will be exhausted from fighting, and at that time they will be in a situation of ten deaths and one life."

That is to say, you are all subordinates of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and only have the experience of victory, but I myself have the experience of failure, that is, the experience of turning defeat into victory. Therefore, this time it should be completely entrusted to him to fight. He himself took on the role of commander of the counterattack army, intercepted at Byeokjegwan, and finally defeated the Ming army, and Li Rusong barely escaped with his life.

### Japanese Government Extends Huge Loan of 200 Million Yen in Economic Aid to Philippines; Contract Signed Yesterday in Tokyo

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th: "[Based on the request of the Republic of the Philippines, in order to promote economic relations between Japan and the Philippines, the Bank of Japan will extend a credit loan of 200 million yen to the government of the Republic of the Philippines. This contract was signed on October 11th by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Shibusawa, and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of the Philippines to Japan, Vargas]." This credit loan aims to enhance the economic relationship between the Philippines and Japan after the Philippines' participation in the war. This loan, which coincides with the first anniversary of Philippine independence on the 14th of this month, is expected to strengthen the country's financial foundation.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Outline of Japanese Credit Loan to the Philippines: 1. The government of the Republic of the Philippines may, within five years from the date of the conclusion of this treaty, borrow Japanese loans from the Japanese Bank, but limited to 200 million yen. 2. When the government of the Republic of the Philippines engages in the above borrowing, it shall, within five years from the date of the conclusion of this treaty, at any time repay the above borrowing in one lump sum or in several installments. 3. The period during which the above borrowing may be repaid may be extended after consultation between the Bank of Japan and the government of the Republic of the Philippines.

### Philippine President's Statement

Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel issued the following statement on the 11th: "[The Republic of the Philippines has received a credit loan of 200 million yen from the government of the Japanese Empire. This loan is very necessary for the continued stability of Philippine finances and for the promotion of domestic economic development. Now, my government and people are contributing to the increase of agricultural production, the restoration of public order, and the revival of businesses in order to achieve self-sufficiency in the Philippines. However, the current national income is absolutely insufficient to complete these undertakings, and it is necessary to seek additional large amounts of funds. Moreover, the government is spending a considerable amount of national funds to alleviate the suffering of the people. At this time, with the appropriate assistance of the Japanese government, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Japanese government on behalf of the government and the entire nation]."

### Remarks by the Philippine Finance Minister

Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Finance Minister Alarms issued the following statement on the 11th: "[The Philippine economic organization before the war was solely dependent on exports and imports to and from the United States. One-third of the government's revenue came from import taxes and transaction taxes levied domestically on goods imported from the United States. Since the independence of the Philippines, in order to adapt to the progress of the new order, the domestic economic organization has had to devote all its efforts to reconstruction. As a result, although the results have exceeded expectations, the war situation has reached a critical stage, and economic activities have been negatively affected. As a result, the financial resources of the Republican government have also been depleted. Today, we can no longer generate revenue from entertainment facilities as in the past, and cash transactions have been drastically reduced, resulting in a decrease in government revenue. At this time, the Japanese government, in order to fully assist the Philippine government, has extended a credit loan of 200 million yen to our country. With this huge sum of money, we can not only restore the soundness of government finances, but also continue to carry out various economic developments and maintain public order to the extent permitted by the current environment. In addition, relief funds can be increased for the working people. As the Finance Minister, I would like to express my gratitude for the Japanese assistance in rescuing the people and increasing the strength of the Republican government.]"

### Aachen Fortress Surrounded, German Troops Refuse to Surrender

Canadian troops land in Breskens. Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Hai Tong News Agency reports: The German commander in Aachen has rejected the final surrender ultimatum from the American forces. Berlin, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: Hai Tong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is taking place around Aachen. American forces are attacking the southeastern suburbs of the city with a large force, breaking through the German lines around the city. Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Hai Tong News Agency reports: There is no change in the Dutch war situation. The majority of the British Second Army is concentrated in the Nijmegen area, presumably to coordinate with the American forces and advance from the Nijmegen bridgehead into the Westphalian industrial area west of the Rhine and the northern plains of Germany. The battles in Lorraine and the western foothills of the Vosges Mountains have become secondary. It goes without saying that the right wing of the anti-Axis forces, including the American and Seventh Armies, has the mission of containing the German forces and diverting their attention from the center of the offensive. Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports: On the eve of Tuesday, Canadian troops landed southeast of Breskens, Belgium, and were reinforced in the morning by thirty to forty landing craft.

### Background of Visit to the Soviet Union

Stockholm, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Hai Tong News Agency reports: The Swedish newspaper's correspondent in London reports that the conflicting opinions among the anti-Axis countries and the urgency of the situation have forced Churchill to visit Moscow.

A Meaningful Night Meeting
— Wu Gong

### Symposium for Leading Figures of Society's Backbone

In Europe, it is common to gather prominent figures of society together during the evening to exchange opinions on a particular issue during dinner. Therefore, these kind of [night meeting] symposiums have not only led to several political changes in Europe, but have also reformed many of society's unhealthy systems. After I, the reporter, returned to Peiping from Tianjin and Tangshan, Mr. Liu Longguang, the editorial director of Wude News, sent me a letter inviting me to participate in the [Symposium for Leading Figures of Society's Backbone] organized by their National Magazine. The time was 6:00 PM on October 4th, and the location was Di Hua Li Restaurant, No. 5 Wuliang Daren Hutong, East City.

Although this meeting was organized by the National Magazine of Wude News, because Wude News is directly operated by the military news department here, Mr. Liu Longguang asked Mr. Takeda, the news department director, to serve as chairman. The so-called leading figures of society's backbone who attended were mostly rising young political figures and military personnel in North China. I, the reporter, was merely there due to being from afar and happening to be present! Now, let me first report on who exactly attended: First to be mentioned is Mr. Du Chaojie, Director of the General Affairs and Statistics Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He was originally a military officer in the old Northeast Army system. He assumed this position when Wang Kemin re-emerged last year after the reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Commission. This position was originally called the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, equivalent to the Investigation and Statistics Department in Nanjing, but later the word "Investigation" was removed. Although I had never met Mr. Du before, many of his old friends were my comrades, so I had heard of him long before coming north. He is a calm person with a face that has a very stern air.

Next is Mr. Yu Tianxiu, a member of the National Economic Commission, President of the Chinese Cultural Society, and Professor at Peking University. I had already met him when I attended the National Propaganda Conference in Nanjing last year. He is now a famous economist in Beijing, and like Mr. Li Quanshi in the South, he is a celebrity without money. It is said that he also has a wife who is good at socializing and has a robust physique. In addition to News Director Takeda, there was also Mr. Kudo Yoshihiro, a consultant to the military, who I had met ten days ago at the Great Assembly of Decisive Battle Writers held here.

In addition to Mr. Liu Longguang, the host side also included Mr. Wang Jieren, Secretary of the North China Writers Association. The others were all people I met for the first time, including people from military, political, and business circles. For example, Mr. Wu Qiuchen, the organization minister of the Xinmin Association, Zhou Futing, the chief of the No. 1 branch of the Beijing Municipal Police, Major General Long and Colonel Wang Kuipu of the Military Affairs Commission's Special Commissioner's Office in North China, Xu Chuanrong, the deputy director of the Beijing Railway Bureau, Jin Zhongming of the Beijing branch of Sanfeng Co., Ltd., Yu Zhenmin, a specialist of the municipal government, Zhang Bowu, the director of the general affairs bureau of the Cooperative Enterprises Association, Mr. Xing, the former director of the Beijing Economic Bureau, as well as a Mr. Chuan Xin, etc.

### Questions Concentrated on Corrupt Officials

At the beginning, News Director Takeda asked Colonel Wang to explain how the National Government army should suppress bandits. Colonel Wang's conclusion was that it depended on strengthening politics, and strengthening politics required the emergence of a force for reform to promote overall peace. Therefore, the topic turned to corrupt officials. News Director Takeda said with a smile: [I often hear people talk about this, but what exactly is going on? Are the high-ranking officials corrupt, or the low-ranking officials corrupt?] Everyone was silent on this question. First, Director Du briefly described his views on clarifying officialdom, the key point of which was that central power must thoroughly penetrate the local level. Because, according to Mr. Du, the North China Political Affairs Commission's power simply had no way to deal with the local level, so to implement the committee's policies at the local level, it was necessary to strengthen political power in a unified manner. Later, while eating, Mr. Du also sighed and said that regarding the crackdown on corruption, they had submitted several proposals, such as freezing idle capital, banning speculation and consignment shops, and restricting bank hoarding, but unfortunately, none of them had been implemented. The topic then focused on current prices, so News Director Takeda asked Dr. Yu to express his views on inflation. Mr. Yu said in a humorous tone: [The current economic situation cannot be measured with ordinary views. For example, the residents in the area where we live have not received any rations from March to July. In this situation, can we still talk about economic control?]

While eating, everyone exchanged opinions more casually. I, the reporter, deeply felt that listening to a night's worth of talks here was really better than doing several months of investigation elsewhere! News Director Takeda asked me: [Is North China better than the South?] I replied: [It is indeed.] Finally, I said that in the South, such as in Shanghai, there was still no situation where rations could not be received. News Director Takeda was also silent after hearing this, and then our topic focused on the recent coal shortage in Beijing. However, Consultant Kudo soon said that the military was confident that Mr. Okomoto Daijiu would have a good solution to this matter. Therefore, everyone said that in this case, tonight's [night talk] was not entirely without results.

Later, because News Director Takeda had other engagements and left first, but we continued talking until 10:30 PM before adjourning. Such a frank and sincere symposium, not to mention that this was the first time I had encountered it since coming to Beijing, was also rare even in Shanghai. It was especially admirable that both China and Japan could exchange opinions from a sincere standpoint, without any hypocrisy or concealment. After News Director Takeda left, Consultant Kudo answered various questions. Mr. Kudo spoke excellent Chinese, so the atmosphere was harmonious without any gaps. The frankest and most incisive speakers tonight were Colonel Wang and Director Xing, who both spoke fluent Japanese, eliminating the need for translation.

### Debate on the Issues of People and Systems

Most people believe that improving our country's politics requires a focus on the issue of people. The so-called issue of people means that the people currently bearing political responsibility have not yet reached a healthy state. They mostly agreed to establish a [good people government], especially to cultivate such young political figures to lead, and to expect the creation of new neutral political figures. However, Dr. Yu opposed this view, believing that China's problem was not in people but in the system. His theory was extremely insightful. His main idea was: [The Republic of China] the four words, have a need to reflect, because the so-called [Republic] is now, only exists in name only! He said: [The Qing Dynasty died in revolution, but the Republic of China that emerged after the revolution died in the remnants of feudal forces, the so-called feudal forces are not warlords or even disguised bandits]. His view on our country's indistinct military and banditry is really a problem worth studying. His conclusion is that our country should quickly emulate the Meiji Restoration of the Allied Powers. The great Meiji Restoration was the return of great governance to the Emperor, and our country is already a democratic country, so it is appropriate to return great governance to the people. The so-called return of great governance to the people, the most important thing is to return all military power. Directly return the constitution. He said that if this is not the case, in any case, China will not seek political stability, and no constitution will be implemented. He compared today's Chiang Kai-shek to the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan eighty years ago, so he advocated using an innovative political system to overthrow the remnants of feudalism.

Is China's problem in people, or is it in the system? This is really a problem worth discussing deeply. I, the reporter, respectfully report the experience of my personal participation in this night talk to the readers in the South, hoping that we will quickly wake up at this critical juncture! China's politics must be created in her own hands to create a new future, and the issues of people and systems may both need emerging vitality. In my humble opinion, it is currently as if everyone is in the dark night, so both people and systems become dark things, but once the light is revealed, the power of darkness will naturally be eliminated. What is the light? Needless to say, of course, is the new issue of central belief. The current darkness has proven that all existing thoughts have become obsolete, and we must take double the courage to seek new central ideas, so that we can advance the times, so that we can innovate China, and integrate the two major forces of people and systems to create a new era of light!

The association was attended by Executive Directors Xu Liqiu and Huang Jingqi, as well as Secretary-General Ren Yunpeng. After the whole body sang the national anthem and performed the rituals, Chairman Huang Jingqi delivered the opening speech, saying that today is the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Looking back on the past, our country has been in a state of hardship and difficulty and has not been able to develop as much as possible. Tracing the historical records of China in the past 100 years, he explained that it has suffered from the invasion, oppression, exploitation, and bondage of Britain and the United States, and China has not been free. In order to achieve the independence of the Chinese nation, we must concentrate our strength, unite the 450 million compatriots in China, and unite all the nations of East Asia to work together to not only strive for the independence and freedom of China, but also strive for the independence and freedom of East Asia. At the current time of decisive battle, in order to achieve China's independence, we must firmly believe in victory and strive to move forward. This is the meaning of today's celebration, and we are very grateful for the cooperation of all parties. Then, Li Sihao gave a speech on behalf of Chen Binhe. Finally, the Huaying film "[Bitter Child's Paradise]" was screened, and the meeting was adjourned at 10:30 PM.

### Li's Speech

The original text of Li Sihao's speech on behalf of Chen Binhe is as follows: [Today is the 33rd anniversary of the Republic of China. Celebrations are held all over the country. At a time when the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult and politics is not on track, we cannot but express our feelings of [the young do not work hard] for this Republic of China, which is already 33 years old. However, this responsibility is not the sole responsibility of any individual, but is the responsibility of anyone, especially young people who should strive to recognize their responsibilities and assume their responsibilities. Young people are the responsible members of the country and society in the near future, especially at a time when the country is in trouble. We hope that young people will be motivated to improve themselves, starting with exercising their bodies and studying hard, cultivating the most useful talents, and using them for the country, building the country, and revitalizing the country in the future. The country is the place where the people live and rely on. Every compatriot must love the country at all times and in all places. If the country is strong and developed, our survival will be guaranteed and we will have something to rely on. There is no country in the world whose people do not love their motherland. If the motherland survives, the people will also survive. If the motherland perishes, the people will naturally have nothing to rely on. For example, the Jews only know about private interests and have no concept of the country. Therefore, when their own private property is full, the country has already perished. At this time, even if they want to love the country, there is no country to love, and what is the use of private property. This is the most practical lesson for us, and the country with the highest patriotic enthusiasm of the people, so we ask for the strength of the country, and we must first love the country. Secondly, we should also recognize clearly that the current period is a period of striving for national liberation and national survival, which is the common goal of all families within the scope of Greater East Asia, so we must not only love our own country, but also love our allied countries, love Greater East Asia, and work together in the spirit of sharing the same boat to reach the other shore. Today we celebrate National Day, and we hope that our compatriots, especially young compatriots, will be particularly alert to the difficulty of creating the Republic of China and the importance of the current situation, unite our minds and goals, strengthen our beliefs, and move forward toward the future.] Yesterday (11th) at 8:00 PM, a charity drama performance was held at the Lyceum Theatre. Tickets were sold at half price, and all the proceeds were used as scholarship loans. The editor of New China News, Lu Feng, chaired the performance, and the association's secretary-general, Xing Yunpeng, reported on the significance of commemorating the Double Tenth National Day. After Lu Feng gave a speech, Lianyi performed the famous drama "[Sea Burial]".

### Household Flour Sales to Begin Tomorrow

### Memorial Service Today for Lieutenant Commander Oya of Tenian Island by Chinese and Japanese Groups

After Lieutenant Commander Goichi Oya, commander of the Allied naval forces on Tenian Island, heroically sacrificed his life on the 27th of last month, the news spread, and Chinese and Japanese people mourned in unison. Lieutenant Commander Oya had served as an investigator in the Asia Development Board during his time there and later worked at the Shanghai Embassy Office. Chinese and Japanese people knew him well.

Furthermore, after the memorial service is completed on the same day, friends of the late Lieutenant Commander will continue to gather in another room of the hall to hold a memorial meeting.

### Evaluation of Gu Tingkang's Solo Exhibition

— Siyuan

In recent years, with society's emphasis on culture and promotion of art, art exhibitions have flourished. Therefore, many painters have held solo exhibitions in various places, one after another. This time, Mr. Gu Tingkang held a solo exhibition, and the opening day coincided with the Double Tenth [National Day], giving art lovers a double joy. Mr. Gu's paintings seem to be familiar to people in the art world, business world, and cultural circles. This exhibition of his recent works at the YMCA in Ba Xianqiao is his first solo show. It is said that Mr. Gu is famous for his pastel paintings, but his oil paintings, in terms of observation of things and the brilliance of colors, can also be ranked among the first-class painters. Many of his works are oil paintings, which shows Mr. Gu's strong interest in painting and further suggests his level of research in oil painting. The entire exhibition includes more than 70 works, plus the works of his students, totaling about 80 pieces. The content of the works is mostly still life, followed by portraits and landscapes. The decoration and layout were carefully considered and well-executed. The colors and themes of his oil and pastel paintings can be said to have reached the point of expressing his own sense of beauty and style. His colors are sometimes melancholy and sometimes passionate, and perhaps this is where he succeeds. The feeling he gives to the appreciator is complex colors and a unified tone. Those using cold colors as the main tone are rippling and gentle, clear and tranquil. Those using bright colors as the main tone are bright and crystal, fiery and lustrous. This may represent the author's personality to some extent: more excited than anyone when excited, and colder than anyone when indifferent. According to people close to the author, the author is limited by certain conditions and cannot express his [harvest of the land] ambitions, so his works this time mostly take place indoors. What a pity! However, the author's works have a unique appearance. The still life themes usually taken by Western painters often use a strong Western flavor as the background, while his works have an Eastern color and a viewpoint of Eastern beauty. For example, the still life he paints, the bottles, and the accompanying scenes, mostly use antique domestic items as the object, which is very in line with the taste of antique collectors. He told the writer: [I am Chinese, of course, I want to love our own things more.] It is not easy to be satisfied with painting figures without a solid foundation, but the effort he puts into figure painting must not be less than that of still life and landscape painting. Therefore, although there are not many figure paintings in the exhibited works, they are very brilliant. Among them, in addition to a few ladies who can fully express feminine beauty, the most noteworthy are portraits Nos. 3 and 4. The composition is solemn, and the colors are gorgeous, which is fascinating. In short, he tells the audience that he is an author who strives for art. In terms of his meticulous observation of things and the brightness and darkness of colors, there seems to be no room for criticism. Naturally, it is not easy to be a painter and not just a talking head. It is even more difficult for a painter to succeed in some techniques. Painters must put in effort and cultivate in many ways, and they must have the conditions for putting in effort and cultivation, and material and environment are the elements that dominate this part, which is undeniable. However, it is not impossible for authors with pure skills to rely on thinking to construct works that are relevant or relatively great and rich in content. However, one thing we can be sure of is that it depends on what the author is thinking and the breadth of his usual concerns as a point of evaluation. Like Mr. Gu, who works hard at art and devotes himself to the current situation in the city, although he cannot be said to be a successful author, he is still valuable in this capacity and in terms of technique.

### This Month's Air Defense Training Generally Successful

Comments from the Japanese Air Defense Command. The Shanghai Japanese Army Air Defense Command and the Naval Air Defense Command recently issued comments on the air defense training held on the 9th, stating, [The civil air defense training implemented this time, due to the enthusiastic guidance of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters and other related agencies, as well as the unanimous cooperation of the citizens, has generally achieved its intended purpose. Good results have been achieved in comprehensive training such as air surveillance, evacuation, fire extinguishing, and rescue. This is very gratifying. However, some people were completely passive, and the training results were quite unsatisfactory. There are still doubts about peacetime training preparations, which is regrettable in the current war situation. The various training programs are briefly commented on below:]

### Points to Note

[Evacuation] 1. The evacuation situation is generally good, but it is also necessary to consider using terrain and ground objects, as well as dispersed evacuation. Special attention should be paid to glass fragments. 2. The posture of evacuation should not have the face and abdomen close to the ground. 3. Regarding the evacuation of pedestrians, the self-defense corps in the area must further review methods such as guiding evacuation sites. [Fire Extinguishing and Air Surveillance] 1. In terms of fire extinguishing, many water tanks and hand-operated pumps are not perfect and should be quickly rectified. 2. In terms of air surveillance, it is necessary to actively train in accordance with the surveillance guidelines issued by the guiding agencies in the future, and the terminology for relaying orders should be further studied. [Rescue] 1. In the central part of the city, general rescue techniques have greatly improved. 2. The evacuation methods for patients in various hospitals are progressing smoothly. 3. The accommodation of patients in high-rise buildings and factories, as well as emergency treatment equipment, still need further research in the future. 4. If there is no doctor in the rescue station, it is necessary to immediately contact the doctor, hospital, and civil defense rescue team. 5. Many people are not proficient in hemostasis and splint application. [Factory Air Defense] Many factories lack air defense equipment and the air defense organization is not thorough, and it is too noisy. The purpose of factory air defense is to ensure wartime productivity, but the air defense measures should not be generalized due to the different business scales and locations of each factory. The person in charge of each factory should quickly review its characteristics and establish an air defense posture that does not affect production capacity. It is often heard that air defense affects productivity, but this is purely due to the factory's person in charge's poor review. It is hoped that the factory will actively cooperate and study in the future. [Lighting Control] 1. Although lighting control has been one of the most important items in the past, there are still many shortcomings in general, and it is regrettable to have to express this, especially in the Yangshupu area, where the results are the worst. The reason for this is roughly because the warning alarm was issued early in the daytime, so people generally do not pay attention after dusk, and this point should be promptly re-examined. 2. The self-defense corps must be responsible for supervising and guiding the thorough implementation of lighting control. 3. There are also many places where direct light is leaked and residual lights are not extinguished. 4. The subtitle lights and headlight illustration lights of streetcars are too bright. In summary, the results of this air defense training have been greatly improved, but there is still a lack of training in small details. It is hoped that in the future, we will review the past and strive to make the civil air defense front perfect.

### Property Owners Not in Shanghai Urged to Register Real Estate

The main task of the Shanghai Municipal Property Owners Not in Shanghai Real Estate Management Committee is to maintain the people's property rights and protect the legal interests of property owners. In order to clarify whether property owners are in Shanghai or not, the committee, with the approval of the municipal government, is conducting a real estate survey and registration in the Huxi and Hubei districts, with a deadline of the end of November this year. All property owners in these two districts who are currently in the city must bring their accurate property ownership certificates, originals and copies, to the committee's Huxi office (358 Yuyuan Road) or Hubei office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor) to apply for registration. Otherwise, they will be considered property owners not in Shanghai, and the committee will take over the property. It is also heard that those who are currently occupying ownerless houses in the two districts must personally go to the above-mentioned offices in the two districts before the end of this month to sign lease procedures. If they conceal and do not report, once verified, they will be ordered to move, and they will be fined ten months' rent. Those who are reported by others will receive a bonus of 50%.

### Donation of a Percentage of Consultation Fees to Charity

Dr. Gu Naigang wrote in a letter: [Doctors should have the spirit of mutual assistance in helping the poor and treating illnesses, adhering to the purpose of benevolence and saving the world. At this time, when rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, and everything is soaring in price, it is difficult for ordinary people to maintain their lives. Once they are entangled in illness, and poverty and disease are intertwined, it is even more pitiable. In view of this, I am setting up a clinic at the east of the Iron Gate at Lao Beimenkou, specializing in all kinds of hot and cold diseases, and also treating internal and external acupuncture departments. I will charge appropriate consultation fees, and waive all fees for the destitute. In addition, I will donate 10% of the consultation fees to charity. I am enclosing 1,035 yuan, which is 10% of the consultation fees for September, to be used as medical assistance funds for your organization.]

### Shanghai Anlaoyuan Appeals for Donations, Hopes People from All Walks of Life Will Participate in the Charitable Undertaking

Goal: 5 million yuan. Period: October 10th to November 10th. Collection location: Social Service Department of this newspaper. Publication date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. When people reach old age, they all hope to have filial sons and obedient grandchildren. Unfortunately, they may encounter misfortune and lose their support. They have no way to rely on themselves, and they lack the skills to make a living. Their distress is definitely not something that old hearts can bear. The Shanghai Anlaoyuan was established to make up for this deficiency, housing lonely elderly people and providing them with support and care by nuns. They are served with food and drink, their daily life is taken care of, they are cared for when they are sick, their clothes are washed, and even when they are old and weak and need to use the toilet, they are helped with kindness. They are accompanied at the end of their lives, and their funerals are taken care of after their deaths. Is this not a miracle of the world? Recently, due to financial difficulties, they are appealing for donations. The Book of Songs says: [Good are the rich, pity the lonely]. I hope that benevolent gentlemen will donate generously and participate in the charitable undertaking. We cannot help but look forward to it.

### The Youth of Today (3)

The impact that the nine martyrs gave to the country was more powerful than a tidal wave. Reporters from magazines and newspapers were rushing to visit their hometowns, and famous poets were publishing eulogies in newspapers and magazines every day. Among them, a private letter written by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet to a certain major general in Tokyo said: [The daredevil team formed by the young warriors who graduated from the military academy before and after each other broke into the enemy port and achieved such results, which is truly admirable]. After this letter became known to the general public, it caused an even greater impact. When the general public had a habit of often criticizing young people for not recognizing the situation, the completion of this great achievement was all by young people, which made people pay more attention. Longfu thought he was also a young man. Shame and pride (I can also do something earth-shattering.) He felt that now was not the time to be shy in front of Mr. Zhen. During this period, he received a long letter from his father in his hometown. (One is about my sister.) He hurriedly opened the letter to read it, but the letter hardly mentioned his sister. The long letter paper written in brushstrokes was all about Mr. Zhen. The Zhen family in Xiahuangtian has stopped the rice shop business and opened a grocery store instead, but this shop is simply blocked by a sea of people visiting. Wreaths and sacrificial gifts from the county and city governments, former feudal lords, and various parties filled the courtyard and houses, and even the front of the door, leaving no room to stand. I personally went to greet them, but Mr. Zhen's mother and younger brother, Siji, were so busy that they couldn't even exchange a few words— The neighbors in the front and back, and even everyone in the streets and alleys of the whole town, took Mr. Zhen's affairs as talking points, and hundreds of telegrams and express mail remittances sent to the Gu family from all over the country came like snowflakes every day. Several female students from Kagoshima wrote thank-you letters in blood and brought them to the Gu family in person. The Taniguchi Major Commemoration Association was quickly launched by local celebrities. The principal of Kawata Second Middle School and Mr. Zhufang are entertaining the visiting press corps from Tokyo every day, and there is really no time to rest— On the night of March 6, Colonel H broadcast, and Gu Zhen's mother listened quietly without shedding tears. When Mr. Zhen's class visited in military uniforms, Mr. Zhen's mother burst into tears! My father's letter was obviously promoting the merits of his son's friend out of excitement. But due to emotion, he even forgot to mention his daughter's marriage. Longfu felt that this letter was worthy of his father, and even more worthy of the people of Kagoshima. He smiled and just wrote a line on the edge of the letter: ——Zhi's marriage has also become a dream, but I am not particularly pessimistic either. (150)
