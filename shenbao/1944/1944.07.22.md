### The Enlightenment of Industrialists

The recent six-month decline in the stock market fully demonstrates the errors in the past operational policies of Shanghai industrialists. Seeking individual exorbitant profits through speculation, trickery, manipulation, and other means ultimately harms the public and the nation. It prevents national capital from being accumulated into state capital, causing Chinese industry to regress hundreds of steps. It also invisibly destroys most of Shanghai's already limited industrial foundation. All of these are worthy of reflection by industrialists today.

Mr. Tosuke Yoshida once said: "If 1944 is the year of stock speculation and the era of 'industrial companies,' then 1944 is like the third stage of tuberculosis, requiring a determined treatment; otherwise, the patient is incurable." The past six months have fully exposed the symptoms, eliminating the need for examination and diagnosis. The current problem is to quickly seek treatment, and the industrialists themselves must realize that this is a pathological condition. They must immediately and thoroughly change their policies, only then can they be saved.

Firstly, industrialists should realize that they must henceforth start with honest, down-to-earth agriculture and industry. Any enterprise that does not have agriculture and industry as its foundation is not a true industry. To be separate from agriculture and industry, or to use the guise of agriculture and industry while trading stocks, is a sham industry, not a real industry. Even from a commercial perspective, it cannot be considered legitimate commerce. This kind of illegitimate commerce is not only unhelpful to agriculture and industry, but harmful. It adds to the instability of the national livelihood and harms the people's welfare. During times of national war and when the people are enduring suffering, when agriculture and industry are striving to increase production, we cannot tolerate such disruptive, opportunistic, and harmful behavior. Even if the government does not immediately punish it, public opinion will not tolerate it, and public opinion will determine whether an individual or an organization has any value in society. "What ten eyes see and ten fingers point at" may be an invisible force, but it has the greatest authority, and we hope everyone pays attention.

Secondly, industrialists should realize that they can no longer only seek their own selfish interests. All industries need social support. The capital of industry requires investment from the public, and the products of industry require purchase by the public. A large enterprise must first establish credibility in society. It must ensure that investors receive the benefits of their investment and that consumers have convenience in using its products. Only in this way can its industry expand and progress. Only by pursuing the interests of the masses can individual interests be obtained. Only when the masses have interests can individual interests be guaranteed and enjoyed. An industry needed by the masses and supported by the masses is a permanent industry. An industry that only creates opportunities for private wealth may deceive for a time, but it cannot be sustained permanently.

Thirdly, industrialists should realize that now is the opportunity to establish a foundation for national revival. War is destruction, but it is also construction. During this war period, look at other countries and see how many new inventions and new constructions there are. Then look at China; there is practically nothing new. Yet, now we are about to destroy even the smallest bit of the old foundation. Taking Shanghai as an example, what has been painstakingly managed in the past is being destroyed not by war, but by speculation. Those in charge, when they reflect in the quiet of the night, the reproach of their conscience is unforgivable. Taking advantage of this little foundation, seeking progress and innovation during wartime, and seeking revival and expansion after the war are all things that benefit oneself and the country, and are worthy of deep thought and consideration by everyone.

Dear industrialists, over the past few years, what has been the material gain or loss of yourselves and the enterprises you manage? What has been the gain or loss in reputation? We don't need to make this profit and loss statement; you are all perfectly clear about it. Which path you should take from now on, you should all of course decide for yourselves. The public is watching your transformation with anticipation. Whether you become supporters of the masses or opponents of the masses depends on the performance you show in the future.

### Key Task of New Cabinet Is to Vigorously Complete the War; Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides to Provide Full Assistance

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) After General Koiso of the Army and Admiral Yonai of the Navy received the imperial order to form a cabinet, they worked tirelessly day and night. They worked continuously from 8:00 PM on the 20th until dawn at 4:00 AM on the 21st before resting. At 8:00 AM, they returned to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters and consulted with their aides to continue the cabinet formation work. At 10:30 AM, General Koiso left the Cabinet Formation Headquarters and visited General Nobuyuki Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, at the Association's headquarters for about 40 minutes before departing and returning to the Cabinet Formation Headquarters. It is reported that the Cabinet Formation Headquarters, recognizing the gravity of the situation, is placing special emphasis on completing the war in its cabinet formation policy. The aim is to form a powerful cabinet, and key tasks are underway to realize the cabinet formation plans of Koiso and Yonai. The two generals are also proceeding with great enthusiasm and cooperation, carefully handling matters in order to form a cabinet as soon as possible.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) General Koiso and Admiral Yonai have received the imperial order to form a cabinet. The previous instance of such a joint cabinet formation was on June 27, 1898, when Count Shigenobu Okuma and Count Taisuke Itagaki formed a cabinet, exactly 46 years ago. The emergence of this joint cabinet in Japan this time is different from the previous situation. The two generals, elders of the Army and Navy responsible for the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War and enjoying popular support, are now cooperating happily, standing at the forefront of 100 million soldiers and civilians. The significance is very profound. The more severe the war situation, the closer the cooperation between the Army and Navy. The expectations for the new cabinet are based on this point. At the time of the Okuma-Itagaki cabinet, Count Okuma served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, while Count Itagaki served as Interior Minister, and it was created by enlisting powerful figures from political parties. This time, the new cabinet is also composed of people who are sincerely shouldering the heavy responsibility of the nation, needless to say. The formation of the cabinet by the two generals is to respond to the intensifying war situation and to succeed the heroic battle spirit of Vice Admiral Nagumo of the Navy and Lieutenant General Saito of the Army, who died in battle at Saipan. In terms of establishing a domestic system, it is to strengthen the war system of unity between the Army and Navy, gather the total strength of the nation, and advance towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain. The future is worthy of great anticipation.

In this critical situation, he requested the full cooperation and assistance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and exchanged opinions frankly. The President agreed to consult with various organizations in the Association and then respond. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association held an extraordinary standing general affairs meeting at 12:30 PM this afternoon, followed by an extraordinary general affairs meeting from 2:00 PM.

### German Government Welcomes the Formation of a New Cabinet in Japan; United States Recognizes That Japan Is Strengthening Its Wartime System

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) The German government is very concerned about the fact that Generals Koiso and Yonai have been ordered to organize a new cabinet under this decisive battle situation. The German Foreign Ministry met with reporters on the 20th and stated: "When new events occur, new figures are put in charge of the situation. This is a frequent occurrence in Japan. The emergence of such new events in Japan, with the allied nation of Japan forming a government on a very broad foundation, is something that the government welcomes most. During this great war, it is difficult for belligerent countries to avoid difficulties in the war situation. Germany deeply understands that under such circumstances, the entire country must unite and devote all its efforts. The change of cabinet in Japan is not only a manifestation of Japan's political normality, but also a factual expression of Japan's determination to strengthen the war effort with new people."

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch, American political circles seem to attach great importance to the mass resignation of the Tojo cabinet in Japan. Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Patterson mentioned this matter when they met with reporters on the 20th. Grew, the former ambassador to Japan and the current Director of the East Asian Bureau of the State Department, also issued a statement, stating that Japan's wartime system will inevitably be further strengthened as a result of the cabinet change. He warned the American people not to be optimistic about the future of the war against Japan. For example, Secretary of State Hull stated: "After Japan's cabinet change, we must fully realize that Japan has re-established and improved its war plans." Undersecretary Patterson also stated: "The change of cabinet in Japan will inevitably appoint the strongest and bravest commanders to the key positions in the Army and Navy." The following is the gist of Grew's statement: "Although the Japanese cabinet has changed, Japan's war policy of fighting to the end has not changed. The traditional spirit of the Japanese people, who are not afraid of life and death, is deeply rooted. It is dangerous for the American people to feel optimistic about the future or make hopeful observations simply because of the Japanese cabinet change."

Great Expectations

Hsinking, 21st (Central News Agency) The Manchukuo government is deeply grateful that Generals Koiso and Yonai have been ordered to jointly form a cabinet and has great expectations for the future of the new cabinet. It is believed that the new cabinet will be more resolute and have a greater determination to fight, and will be able to refresh domestic affairs and increase production. On this day of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, this new cabinet will be stronger and more powerful in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that the peoples of Greater East Asia can unite as one and launch a general offensive against the enemy. Manchukuo has particularly high expectations for this. No matter how the Japanese cabinet changes, Manchukuo's important mission as a joint base for Greater East Asia remains the same. Based on the spirit of the inseparable foundation of Japan and Manchukuo, it will gather the total strength of the nation and advance together towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain and completing the Greater East Asia War.

### Pillar of the Japanese Navy; Admiral Yonai Is Most Trusted; Admiral Fujita Discusses His Achievements

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Admiral Takanori Fujita, a friend of Admiral Yonai for 40 years, spoke about Admiral Yonai as follows: "There are many admirals in the Navy, but the most trusted is Admiral Yonai. Although the Admiral is not particularly talented, he is honest and trustworthy, which can be said to be his greatest characteristic. Thanks to his strong cooperation with the late Marshal Yamamoto, the Japanese Navy was not even slightly shaken, and he was always responsible for carrying out all duties. When he was appointed Commander of the Chinkai Naval Base, he suddenly received an order to return to Tokyo from Chinkai, at which time he thought he was being placed in the reserve. After that, he was out of the public eye for a long period, before successively serving as Commander of the Combined Fleet, Minister of the Navy, and Prime Minister. He also served as Minister of the Navy in the Yonai cabinet. After the Hiranuma cabinet resigned en masse, when he served as a military councilor, although he claimed to be free, the Navy, which had great trust in him, did not allow him to retire in this way. He received the imperial order to form a cabinet in January of the 15th year of Showa (1940). At that time, the Navy, in addition to saying goodbye, even advocated that he should remain in active service, but the Admiral resigned on the grounds of following precedent. As these facts show, the Admiral is still in a key position in the Navy. Although he is in the reserve, he is still the pillar of the Navy."

### Yu Army in Southern China Surrounded; Japanese Army Occupies Lingshan; Attacks Enemy's Flank to Cut Off Their Retreat Route

A Former Red Base of the Japanese Army in Southern China, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army's Southern China troops pursued the Yu Army of the 7th War Area in a dragon and phoenix configuration, trapping them in a dilemma. In the past twenty days, they captured Longmen, about 100 kilometers north of Guangzhou. The elite troops of the Japanese flanking unit, with Lingshan, about 24 kilometers north of Longtan Market in Zengcheng, as their base, aimed to annihilate the enemy's 153rd Division, which was about 32 kilometers north of Zengcheng. At midnight on the 13th, they began a surprise attack, advancing north to the right bank of the Zengjiang River. A flanking unit, from the direction of Fuluo Market (about 20 kilometers northeast of Zengcheng), stormed into the enemy's flank and cut off their retreat route. By the evening of the 14th, they successively occupied the key enemy strongholds of Zhuling (8 kilometers north of Zengcheng), Kengkoushi (14 kilometers north of Zengcheng), and Daloushan (16 kilometers north of Zengcheng). Under the cover of Japanese artillery fire from Daloushan, they pursued the fleeing Yu enemy across the Zengjiang River. At about 5:00 PM, they broke into Zhongyue Village. At dawn on the 15th, enemy troops from Baojiao Hill resisted from Fukuzhou Hill in three directions towards Longtan Market. The Japanese army shelled them simultaneously in three directions, launching a mountain battle. At that time, the Japanese flag on the right side was raised, and the enemy troops fled to the Paitan Market plain before noon. The enemy's entire main force fled rapidly towards Lingshan. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Lingshan from dawn on the 16th in a melee battle, defeating the counterattacking enemy.

### Successful River Crossing Operation – Japanese Troops Capture Chaling – Fierce Battles Unfold in the Urban Area of Hengyang

Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 21st (Central News Agency) – The battle to capture Chaling, a stronghold of the Chongqing Ninth War Area forces, is currently underway. The area is a steep mountain range with an elevation of 900 meters and a major strategic point. The enemy has deployed a portion of the 44th Army north of Chaling and the main force of the 20th Army in Chaling, coordinating with the 6th and 58th Armies in Lingling in an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Japanese advancing units continued their attack on the enemy north of Chaling and launched a general offensive on Chaling at dawn on the 14th, forcibly crossing the Mo River. The enemy constructed defensive positions along the Mo River, putting up fierce resistance, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing provided air support in an attempt to stop the Japanese forces from crossing the river. After eight hours of intense fighting, the Japanese left-wing forces broke through on the eastern side of the city and engaged in street fighting. They continued to pursue the defeated enemy, and by 4:00 PM on the 14th, they had completely occupied the city. On the same day, they linked up with Japanese troops crossing the Mo River from the north. The enemy, due to the speed of the Japanese advancing forces, collapsed and fled in panic, leaving behind years of accumulated military supplies, which were all seized by the Japanese army.

Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 21st (Central News Agency) – Hengyang has been under tight siege by Japanese forces since the beginning of this month and has fallen into a state of despair. With the arrival of strong reinforcements, the occupation of the airport on the east bank of the Xiang River, and a portion of the city, as well as securing river crossing points, the Japanese army has now established a complete line of attack. Since the 12th, they have launched a fierce offensive on Hengyang City, and Japanese units are currently engaged in a large-scale annihilation operation. The Japanese vanguard, on June 26th, with only a small number of troops, launched a surprise attack on the airport, seized military facilities, and captured a large amount of military supplies, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. A portion of the force crossed the Xiang River to coordinate with the attacking forces in the southeast. At the same time, a powerful force continuing to conduct a roundabout attack appeared in the Pei River area west of Hengyang City on the 28th, thereby completing a large horseshoe-shaped encirclement from the north, southwest, and west. The enemy, relying on numerous trenches scattered around the perimeter of Hengyang, resisted in layers, suppressing the enemy to the city center. The enemy's 10th Army, consisting of the 2nd and 48th Divisions, and a portion of the 151st Division, totaling approximately 20,000 men, although fighting back, have been forced to retreat to the southwest. Relying on the abundant resources of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, aircraft flew over Hengyang to counterattack, but the Japanese forces, in addition to guarding the city's perimeter to prevent enemy soldiers from escaping, also distributed leaflets urging surrender to the enemy, whose morale was rapidly declining. However, the repeatedly defeated enemy did not cease resistance, so the Japanese army launched a spirited general offensive from all directions outside the city, initiating a grand and heroic annihilation operation.

Air Force in Fierce Battle Shoots Down Chongqing Aircraft

A Certain Japanese Army Air Base, 21st (Central News Agency) – On the mainland battlefield, on the 19th, a Japanese fighter squadron engaged in a fierce battle with thirteen P-40 type aircraft attempting to disrupt the Japanese supply depot over a certain area, shooting down five of them (two unconfirmed) and destroying one. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to their base. Also, on the same day, a Japanese fighter squadron attacked Hengyang.

The Japanese squadron immediately took up battle positions and engaged in a minor skirmish. After a fierce attack, they destroyed two Chongqing aircraft, causing them to crash.

Chongqing and US Aircraft Bombing Changsha - Hunan Daily Frontline Report, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing and US Air Forces blindly bombed Changsha on the 10th of this month. Japanese ground troops bravely fought back, and no military facilities or supplies in the city were lost. However, 250 ordinary citizens were killed, and 800 houses were destroyed or burned. For days, enemy aircraft continuously dropped 50 kg to 100 kg bombs on the city, instantly turning it into a dragon of black smoke with flames soaring into the sky. Citizens fled in a panic, and Japanese troops rushed to the rescue, saving more than half of the refugees. At the same time, the Japanese army also dispatched medical teams, with significant results. However, the refugees' homes were destroyed by fire, and wives and children were separated, wandering the streets everywhere, all deeply resenting the brutality of the Americans. The enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing undoubtedly adopted a scorched-earth tactic, completely disregarding the lives of the citizens, and this kind of atrocity only aroused anti-American sentiment among the populace.

### Intense Fighting on Both the East and West Coasts of Italy

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The focus of the Italian campaign remains on the coastal regions on both sides and the Montelupone area.

The British Eighth Army launched smaller pushes in the nearby eastern area, but their offensive was halted before it reached the German lines. On the Adriatic flank, British tank units, followed by infantry composed of Polish mercenaries, crossed the Esino River after fierce fighting. Prior to this, the German forces had withdrawn to the high ground behind the river, unhindered by the enemy.

### Assassination Plot Ultimately Fails - German Leader Safe and Sound - Broadly Broadcasts to the Public Afterwards Denouncing the Crime

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German Leader's Headquarters announced on the 20th: As a result of an attempt to assassinate Leader Hitler with explosives, several members of the staff were seriously or lightly injured, but Leader Hitler only suffered burns and bruises. After being injured, he continued to work and met with Commander Mussolini at the scheduled time. After the incident, General Göring had already arrived at the Leader's Headquarters.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports, according to official announcements: Those seriously injured in the explosion include General Schmundt and Colonel Brandt; those lightly injured include General Heusinger, General Korten, General Buhle, General Bodenschatz, and General Hausinger. The so-called Leader's Headquarters is where Leader Hitler and his staff oversee military and state affairs, but the exact location has not been determined.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: According to sources in charge, General Jodl, Chief of the German Armed Forces, was not injured, but Leader's Secretary Scherff died from his injuries.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: According to qualified sources this morning, all the conspirators who plotted to assassinate the German Leader have either committed suicide or been executed. Colonel Stauffenberg, who planted the bomb, has also been executed, and others involved in the matter will be charged with conspiracy. It is said that no other incidents have occurred elsewhere, and this conspiracy has completely failed.

The Initiator of the Conspiracy Is Not Related to the Military

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German Leader Hitler broadcast to the nation this morning, stating that although he was assassinated yesterday, he was not injured and is still very well. He said that the bomb was planted by Colonel Stauffenberg and exploded a few meters away. Many of his closest staff members were injured, and one died. He believes that this failed assassination attempt is a good omen from heaven. The initiator of this conspiracy has no relation to the military, so it does not damage the honor of the military in any way. He has appointed Himmler as Commander of the Domestic Defense Forces. Hitler's speech stated: "The purpose of my address to the nation is twofold: first, to let the people hear my voice and know that I am well, and second, to let the people know the details of this unprecedented crime in German history. Due to a small number of unconscionable and ambitious stupid criminals, colluding with some ignorant military officers, wanting to kill me and the entire staff of the German High Command, the bomb planted by Colonel Stauffenberg exploded two meters away from me. Many of my staff were injured, and one has died, but I was not injured, only slightly bruised and burned. I believe this is Heaven's will for me to continue pursuing my goals. I can solemnly declare to the nation that since joining the government, my only ambition has been to dedicate my intelligence and conscience to fulfilling my responsibilities. I have dedicated myself to working for the people day and night. At this time when the German army is fighting its most difficult battles, a very small group of people wants to repeat Italy's mistakes, thinking they can imitate the old trick of 1918, stabbing Germany in the back, not knowing that this is a huge mistake. These usurpers claim that I am no longer alive, which is refuted by my broadcast. These usurpers are very few in number and have nothing to do with Germany’s, they are just a small number of criminals who will be ruthlessly eliminated. I now declare that no leader of any army or organization and no soldier shall follow the orders of these usurpers. Anyone should report those who convey orders for these people, and if they resist, they should be killed on the spot."

Military Leaders Express Loyalty

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: German Air Force Minister Göring and Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz have both broadcast orders to their subordinates, stating that their subordinates should only follow their orders, and anyone who conveys false orders or induces obedience to false orders should be immediately arrested and executed. The two admirals expressed their gratitude for Heaven's protection of the Leader and their hatred for the rebels. Dönitz also said that the assassination of the Leader would hand the German people over to the enemy.

Heaven's Blessing, National Joy

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: After the people of Germany heard the news yesterday that the assassination attempt on Hitler had failed, they were deeply relieved and joyful. Apart from revealing that the weapon used was a bomb, no other details of the crime were announced, and it is expected that the police will not release any information until the preliminary investigation is complete. It is recalled that when the German Leader was first assassinated on November 8, 1939, in a beer hall in Munich, the details of the case were not revealed until thirteen days after the incident. The German Leader was assassinated again yesterday, and fortunately, he was not seriously injured. All sides believe that this was a blessing from Heaven. German Deputy Intelligence Chief Sontheimer said: "Germany's enemies attempted to assassinate Leader Hitler, and they are once again using criminal means to assist the progress of the war, but Heaven's decision has backfired. The failure of this assassination attempt on the German Leader proves that the Leader will complete his mission under the protection of Heaven."

### British Advance South in the Caen Area Meets Strong Resistance - American Forces Launch Offensive Towards La Haye

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The major battle east of the Orne River continued on Wednesday, with undiminished intensity. Due to the heavy losses suffered by the British Second Army, the British High Command had to urgently transfer reserves from the rear to reorganize and replenish its battered formations, but even these reinforcements could not achieve victory. British and Canadian units launched new offensives along a broad front from the areas of Colombelles, Douvres-la-Délivrande, and Sannerville, but were stopped after advancing less than two kilometers. The localities of Hérouvillette, Franqueville, Cuverville, and Bourguébus in this area were reported lost. At the same time, British troops advancing from Caen reached Hill 67 north of St. André, as well as Ifs and Hubert-Folie. British tank units attacking Troarn were driven back to their original positions. There were no reports of significant changes southwest of Caen. In the Caumont area, American artillery heavily bombarded the new German positions there on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. West of the Vire River, German forces repelled all American attacks, and a gap in the German line was closed during a counterattack. American forces between the Vire and Drôme rivers attempted to dislodge German forces from the high ground, but all their attacks were unsuccessful. The enemy's reckless advance on the Losque-Mesnil-Véneron road also failed. On Thursday morning, American forces launched a new offensive towards the La Haye area, but details are not yet known.

Invasion Force of Forty Divisions

The British and American forces currently stationed on the narrow Normandy landing beach number forty divisions, at least half of which are engaged in the current offensive. In addition, there are many artillery units, engineer units, and other special units in the landing area. Despite this concentration of powerful forces and materiel, General Montgomery has ultimately failed to expand his operational area. The depth of the British and American landing area does not exceed twenty kilometers at any point.

### British Casualty Statistics from Flying Bomb Attacks

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch: The British Home Office has recently announced that in June, the number of British citizens killed in air raids totaled 1,935, including confirmed deaths and those missing, including 716 men, 988 women, and 231 children. The number of wounded and hospitalized totaled 5,906, including 2,151 men, 3,262 women, and 493 children. Most of these deaths and injuries were caused by flying bombs during the half-month period of attacks. The number of deaths in July totaled 68, including 26 men, 32 women, and 10 children. The number of wounded was 75, including 36 men, 38 women, and 1 child. The difference between the two months is significant, demonstrating the enormous power of flying bombs.

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: British Minister of Public Health Willink stated in the House of Commons yesterday that 170,000 women and children have been evacuated from London since July 2nd. Home Secretary Morrison informed the House of Commons that he will report on the new warning system for defending against flying bombs next week.

### Soviet Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive on the Central Sector of the Eastern Front - The Battle for Lviv is Particularly Intense

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: In the past two days, the fighting in the central and southern sectors of the Eastern Front has expanded to the north. Soviet forces are hindering German operations, and fierce fighting is currently underway on that front. From Lviv (i.e., Lemberg) in the south to south of Pskov in the north, there has been continuous fighting throughout the day, with the focus currently being northeast of Lviv, west of Kovel, northwest of Velikiye Luki, south of Tver, and in the Opochka area. In the southern sector, German forces west of Brody engaged in fierce battles with powerful Soviet tank and sniper divisions. Although Soviet forces west of Kovel attempted to pursue the German forces with the upper reaches of the Bug River as their target, the German forces safely crossed the Bug River. Soviet forces have now begun a large-scale offensive in an attempt to cross the Neman River. Soviet forces have now reached the west bank of the Neman River, and fierce fighting is underway in two locations. After several hours of fighting, the Soviet forces were repelled. The focus of the fighting in the northern sector of the Eastern Front is the Opochka area. Soviet forces broke through the German lines in several places, but the breakthroughs were blocked by German counterattacks from the flanks.

### Record of the Battle of the Mariana Sea - A New Form of Modern Naval Warfare

In the battle between the Japanese and US fleets in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, the Japanese side adopted a flexible and adaptive stance, launching a preemptive attack on the enemy's incoming forces, and achieving a great victory by sinking five aircraft carriers and at least one battleship. However, the enemy's remaining forces still number considerably.

The enemy, taking a stand on Koror, where they could freely choose their targets, attacked the Mariana Islands on June 11th, planning to destroy the air bases first to make them unusable. The enemy aircraft's continuous bombing and the naval guns' bombardment from surface warships continued day and night, inevitably causing considerable damage to the bases. The enemy's carrier groups were of the Essex-class (26,000 tons) and converted special carriers from Copan and other heavy cruisers. The battleships in the escort fleet were the newly-built 45,000-ton Iowa-class and the 35,000-ton South Dakota-class, etc. They also used a considerable number of destroyers for transport, seemingly using their speed to achieve high-speed transport.

Japanese Carrier Aircraft Preemptively Attack

After landing on Saipan Island on the 15th, they reinforced with additional aircraft carriers and replenished their aircraft in order to expand their landing area. At this time, the base garrison resolutely defended its positions, and the land artillery shelled the enemy battleships, hitting the turret at the stern of a ship, causing a major fire, or submarines sank the enemy's new-type battleships. The base air force's new bomber aircraft also seriously damaged at least three enemy aircraft carriers, causing them to catch fire.

By the 18th, the enemy seemed to be secretly expanding their search line against a portion of our Combined Fleet. However, they ultimately failed to discover it. On the morning of the 19th, they were subjected to a preemptive attack by our mother ship's aircraft.

A battle between large fleets requires unimaginable preparation and enormous supplies. The reporter is thoroughly familiar with and amazed by the thoroughness and meticulousness of our operations. The timing of the battle was subtle and completely unpredictable. Behind that firm grasp of the opportunity for a preemptive strike was the great merit of our search aircraft (including carrier-based seaplane reconnaissance aircraft).

Recently, the enemy's mobile task force has combined aircraft carriers and new-type battleships, using the battleship's powerful anti-aircraft firepower to compensate for the carrier's weaknesses. Many cruisers and destroyers are arranged around its outer perimeter, and the wheel-shaped formation tends to expand. This large wheel-shaped formation maintains organic contact with other carrier groups, and with the development of radar and other detection devices, surprise attacks are completely impossible. Our attack aircraft squadron sacrificed fifty aircraft to break through this wheel-shaped formation and attack the enemy carrier in the face of anti-aircraft fire, which shows how difficult the task was.

Close-Quarters Night Attack Ultimately Not Realized

On the other hand, repeated attempts at close-quarters night attacks, taking advantage of the convenience of a preemptive strike, were ultimately not realized. A gun battle with surface warships, which would have been absolutely advantageous to us, never occurred, because the performance of carrier-based aircraft has improved, increasing their speed and enabling long-range air strikes, and because the enemy's escape was extremely rapid. Moreover, the moonlight at the time was dim, and the enemy's mobile task force continued to move at high speed, making the search work unprecedentedly difficult.

Eighty Percent of Attacking Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Speaking of aircraft, the Japanese carrier-based aircraft squadrons are absolutely superior, repeatedly attacking with giant bombs in dive bombing and torpedo attacks. The enemy's counterattack consisted of only one wave of dive bombers and torpedo bombers, and the enemy's dive bomber techniques were extremely crude, dropping many small bombs in the hope of hitting something. Under these absolute conditions, the fact that the fleet was able to remain intact, and that there were surviving enemy forces, was entirely due to the long-range nature of the battle on the open ocean. The difference lay in the "number" of enemy carrier groups arriving in succession and the "quantity" of supplies. The enemy's base attacks were extremely crude and cowardly, strafing from an altitude of 1,000 meters. Of the fifty attacking enemy aircraft, forty were shot down in one fell swoop. The pilots' technical skills were immature, and they only relied on randomly dropping timed bombs and cluster bombs in an attempt to achieve some effect. Because these base attacks continued without interruption, the activity of our base air force was significantly hampered.

The overall results of the battle since the enemy's attack on the Mariana Islands have been enormous in terms of warships sunk and damaged, and aircraft shot down. However, it cannot be said that a decisive blow has been dealt to the enemy's numbers, and our side can only use "quantity" to counter the "quantity" of the attack.

Not only the quantity of aircraft, but also surface warships, supply ships, all require "quantity", and the rapid preparation and repair of bases also require the utmost mobilization of mechanical power and resources. This depends solely on a dramatic increase in combat power in all areas. (Shō: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, July 8th)

### Department Head Matsushima Elaborates: Significance of the New Cabinet's Formation and Reports on the Pacific War Situation

Department Head Matsushima of the Allied Japan Naval Fleet Press Department stationed in China, met with the local Chinese press corps yesterday (the 22nd) afternoon at his department as a routine meeting. He elaborated in detail on the formation of the new Japanese cabinet, the recent situation in the Central Pacific, etc. A record of his speech is as follows:

New Cabinet Formed to Strive for Victory

Now is a time when the situation is becoming increasingly critical. As the new cabinet has been formed by command, I, as a Japanese military man, am not allowed to criticize politics. However, my views on this matter are the same as those published by the Cabinet Information Bureau: "It is not related in the slightest to Saipan Island, and it will never take the battle situation there as a standard, but is an adjustment of the political system to strive for final victory." There is no need for me to elaborate on other aspects, but I firmly believe that the Saipan battle has given the entire Japanese nation a great awakening and further promoted a surge of enthusiasm. Since the last change of Naval Minister, the enemy has made the following arguments, such as claiming it was due to the defeat in the Mariana Islands operation, etc., attempting to confuse the public. In fact, the reason is definitely not this. The change of Naval Minister is determined by the overall war situation. I can further explain to you that this is not only not a sign of Japan being unable to continue, but rather a task to open up the entire war situation in the future.

Saipan Has No Economic Value

Next, regarding the recent situation in the Central Pacific, Department Head Matsushima elaborated as follows: Recently, some enemy submarines near Saipan have occasionally moved toward Omiya Island and small islands, carrying out bombing several times. We regard the area near the Mariana Islands as a "pig farm," meaning "slaughtering them after they are fattened." As for Saipan Island, economically speaking, it has little value other than producing a very small amount of sugar. In military terms, although there are some locations that can be used as airfields, it is absolutely impossible to use them for naval fleets to moor. Therefore, we firmly believe that the enemy will definitely shift its main force in the future to try to seize Truk Island, because that place can be used as a naval base. Therefore, if the enemy continues to fight in a "not defeated posture" and invades Truk, it is inevitable. Otherwise, it will take a considerable amount of time for the enemy to advance westward. Now, looking at the heroic demeanor of Grand Admiral Minei when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, we feel more confident. The "Fudōkyō" [Immovable Scripture] has the phrase "The heart dwells in immovability," and we firmly believe that Grand Admiral Minei's heart is in the same state. Regarding this matter and the recent impact on Japanese residents in Shanghai, it can be said that the people's spirit is extremely high. On the 20th of this month alone, the Naval Attaché's Office received more than 7.6 million yuan in donations from the people, which can purchase more than ten aircraft.

Significant American Losses on Saipan

Regarding the Saipan Island operation, American Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Nimitz called it the biggest loss in American history. From June 11th to July 16th, the losses suffered by the fleet near Saipan accounted for 50% of all battleships, 60% of aircraft carriers, and 87% of aircraft. On June 19th, Nimitz broadcast on Honolulu that "the entire Japanese fleet has been annihilated," but in a broadcast on the 18th of this month, he announced to the country that "the aircraft of the Japanese fleet are still intact, and the American people must work harder to increase production." Making contradictory remarks on the same radio station in less than a month reveals the inaccuracy of enemy American announcements. At the same time, Nimitz further stated, "Although Saipan has been captured, the progress of the war in the future will be more difficult." Based on his so-called words, we can imagine the general losses suffered by the enemy Americans near Saipan. According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 20th of this month, the American troops in Burma collected Japanese national flags to commemorate their operations. Its use is nothing more than preparing to use them as cover when attacked by the Japanese army, or when surrendering to Japan.

Failed Plot to Assassinate German Leader

Reuters reported from London this month that "the plot to assassinate German leader Hitler failed. Herr Hitler, after suffering only minor burns, met with Mussolini." This reminds us of Christ being betrayed by his disciple Judas, Confucius going to Song to lecture on rites and music under a tree when Huan attacked and felled trees to harm Confucius, and Shakyamuni people being jealous of his name and wanting to harm him. Although we cannot know the purpose of the plan to assassinate Hitler, we must know that after every great man, there must be the actions of ordinary people and villains. If the assassination of Herr Hitler is made into a drama, it will be even more interesting. If historians continue to this point in a hundred years, what will they think? It will be said: "For true righteousness, we should fight to the end."

Unity Between Chinese and Japanese Military and Civilians in Hankou

Finally, Department Head Matsushima also said that according to the Naval Attaché who recently came to Shanghai from Hankou, American planes recently bombed Hankou day and night. The spirit of unity between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians in Hankou was fully demonstrated. At that time, I questioned that if American planes bombed Hankou, the Chinese people would definitely say that because the Japanese were in Hankou, the American planes came to attack, causing the Chinese people to suffer losses. But the answer was the opposite. It was said that "under the tragic circumstances, the Chinese and Japanese people have truly demonstrated the spirit of living and dying together." Recently, the Chinese side has been extremely enthusiastic about the aircraft donation campaign. Hankou City can donate as many as three aircraft in a month. I am very grateful after hearing this. Although we have had many problems in the past, it is better to talk about the present than the past. How should we eliminate Britain and the United States?

### Today a Century Ago: Founder of German Trading Company, Melchers & Co., Recalls His First Visit to Shanghai

The 10th of July, a century ago, was the date when Mr. R. von Carlowitz, the founder of the German trading company Melchers & Co., first visited Shanghai. Mr. Carlowitz embarked on a ship from Bremen, Germany, on November 2nd of the 24th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty. The ships were named "Anna" and "Aretsai," sailing ships of a German expedition team. They arrived in Singapore on March 29th of the following year, stayed for a month, set up a sales office, and then chartered a brig named "Henggeer" to Macau. They arrived in Zhoushan and Ningbo from Macau on June 21st of the same year. Mr. Carlowitz contacted local Chinese businessmen in Ningbo and conducted business smoothly. The process and impressions gained from visiting Putuo and other famous places were very beautiful. He described them in detail in his family letters, praising them to the extreme, which made the listeners fascinated. He left Ningbo on July 8th, and on the 10th, he brought the remaining goods he sold and arrived in Shanghai. This was the first time that the person who built the eastern route for German merchants visited Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai had been opened as a trading port by the Treaty of Nanjing several years earlier by R. von Carlowitz. Merchants from various countries gathered to develop their country's commerce in China. Mr. Carlowitz stayed in Shanghai for a week, examining the local customs, and merchants' needs in detail. Afterwards, he went to Zhoushan again on August 1st, passed through Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the commercial areas of India and Java before returning to his country. As a result, he gained more experience and understood the situation clearly. He concluded that if he wanted to develop commerce in China, he should first establish a trading company in Guangzhou. From there, he could extend it to all parts of the country. He presented his suggestion to the organizers of the German expedition, namely the giant merchants C. Hirzel & Co., Carl and Gustao Harkort, from the city of Leipzig. He won unanimous support. The companies widely issued announcements for him on October 31st, 1845, expressing their willingness to provide strong support for Mr. Carlowitz's new business. So on January 1st, 1846, Mr. Carlowitz and Mr. Hart officially announced the establishment of the German trading company Melchers & Co. in Guangzhou and started business. Later, the business became increasingly developed. Up to now, all well-known cities in China have branches of Melchers & Co., with a grand scale. People regard it as the leader of German merchants, but tracing the origin, all of it is due to Mr. Carlowitz's long-term vision and the hard work of creating it a century ago.

### How Should Jiaotong University Charge Tuition Fees?

— Xiang Jun

The university entrance exam has not yet finished, and there is already a stir among the students, "Tuition fees are going to increase." But everyone still has a bit of joking and humorous tone, so the situation is naturally not very serious. Obviously, everyone seems a bit "indifferent," but to say that this "indifference" is a negligence of us university students is not necessarily the case. Some people say that engineering students are good at analyzing things, and we will indeed use common sense to speculate and conclude that there will definitely not be any drastic changes. There are ten reasons:

The original tuition fee was only ten yuan. Even if it increased a hundredfold, it would only be a thousand yuan, but there is absolutely no reason to suddenly increase a hundredfold. After the war, various colleges and universities usually have loans and grants to help students in war zones and maintain wartime education. Now it is cancelled, but it will not reverse the situation and increase tuition fees. The government's annual income is not known to us, but it has obviously increased in recent years. In addition, there are always special funds for education expenditures, so it is not necessary to increase tuition fees. The prices are soaring, and the lives of professors are difficult - not only difficult, but simply impossible to live on, which is indeed the case. However, considering the arduous responsibilities and important missions they bear for the country, the government should be responsible for providing relief and solutions. Wartime education should adapt to the wartime environment and cultivate specialized talents, which is the most urgent of the urgent tasks. University students receive special education and can contribute to society and benefit the people. If they are allowed to drop out of school, all previous efforts will be wasted, which is definitely not what a wise government would like to do. The strength of a country depends on education. The lack of universal and developed education in our country is almost the best in the world. University education is especially pitifully young. Even if we don't think about improving and expanding it now, we should try our best to maintain the existing rigorousness. Increasing tuition fees and increasing the burden on students is not ideal. The government's prestige is the foundation of the country. The living needs of professors in national colleges and universities must also be sought from the students, which has a profound impact on the national psychology. The solution to the problem is to treat the root cause rather than the symptoms. The lives of professors are one part of the lives of the national people, so a comprehensive solution should be given to thoroughly solve it. Saving the professors and hurting the students is like cutting flesh to heal sores, how is that a solution? As for Jiaotong University, it has its own glorious history and lofty status, which we cannot fully express. The talents of all the professors are outstanding, and their spirit of burying their heads in hard work is especially commendable. In terms of meritorious service, the government should especially favor them and find extra ways for them. Most of the students at Jiaotong University are poor, which is obvious to all, but their spirit of hard study has not been weakened. The government will definitely give special consideration and will not deepen their pain.

Various factors, but I don't think there will be any serious difficulties imposed on us. But according to news from well-informed sources, the tuition fee for the next semester will be 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. After listening to it, I can't help but be shocked and a little panicked. This amount is not huge at present, but it is not known that the hardworking students have empty pockets, and it is already difficult to handle books and stationery. In a situation where "money is not needed unless there is something," food and accommodation have long become a problem. To increase this huge expenditure out of thin air, it is not difficult to imagine the situation, although it is understandable.

At this time of decisive battle, it is the responsibility of the people to help each other in the same boat. We are extremely considerate of the government's difficulties and are unwilling to make any harsh demands or extravagant hopes. However, the lives of poor professors must be resolved, and the burden of hardworking students must not be increased. I hope the government will carefully handle things and give a satisfactory solution.

The fee increase is so huge, I hope it is not true. Unfortunately, it has been decided by the authorities, so I only hope to make changes again. People in society should not sit idly by, and we are waiting for the help of sympathizers.

### Public Works Bureau's Reply on Preventing Accidents on Shangchuan Road

The Shanghai Special City Public Works Bureau sent a letter yesterday saying: "I read Mr. Cheng Yingming's article 'Suggestions to the Public Works Bureau to Prevent Accidents on Shangchuan Railway' in the National Forum of your newspaper on the 15th. The damage to Shangchuan Road, the difficulty of driving, and the difficulty of management are concise and appropriate, and the two suggestions are also unquestionable. I deeply admire him. In order to prevent accidents, this office has been trying its best to reduce the load of vehicles. It would rather sacrifice income and refuse to transport large quantities of goods, especially salt. In recent months, train derailment incidents have not occurred, and it has achieved practical results. On the one hand, we are trying our best to raise funds to purchase sleepers for local repairs and to ensure traffic safety. Mr. Cheng's proposal to purchase trees from the people on the spot was drafted by this office in March this year and submitted to the city government for approval. Later, due to the complexity of the procedures and the difficulty in ensuring fair prices for the purchase, and later because the city government considered that too many trees had been felled by the people, it expressly prohibited it. This office had to suspend the plan and commission merchants to purchase 5,000 sleepers from eastern Zhejiang. On May 17 this year, a contract was signed. Now the sleepers have been concentrated in Ningbo, waiting for shipment to Shanghai. In the shortest possible time, we can choose the best ones to replace and repair the road surface. In the current wartime when materials are scarce and it is difficult to purchase, even if there is no problem with financial resources, it is difficult to achieve the construction goals of peacetime. Therefore, there is no need to issue public bonds or add surcharges to tickets to raise funds at present. Shanghai Special City Public Works Bureau, Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads Management Office."

### Citizen Consumer Cooperative's Reply

The Citizen Consumer Cooperative sent a letter saying: "I read the article 'When Can the Citizen Consumer Cooperative Distribute Goods?' in the National Forum of your newspaper on the 20th of this month. I have to state a thing or two to clarify the truth. When the cooperative was established in June last year, it originally planned to contact various industry federations to obtain a large number of allocated materials in order to solve the pressure of citizens' lives. Unexpectedly, after its establishment, the environment became more and more difficult, and the industry federations were unable to take care of themselves, and it was impossible to obtain materials. This is a common fact. Therefore, the cooperative can only purchase on the black market and distribute it on the black market. After trying it three times, it was finally felt that it could not be satisfactory. In November last year, when materials were even more scarce, the second meeting of the directors and supervisors was held, and it was decided to distribute the remaining materials as much as possible to the members, recover the cooperative certificates, and seek to end the cooperative. When this news was announced in the newspapers, and the members were notified in the files, a part of the members did not come to the cooperative to receive the allocated materials, nor did they come to the cooperative to go through the withdrawal procedures, so the cooperative could not be ended. In order to save expenses, the scope had to be reduced. However, the cooperative will never harm the interests of its members in any way. It is now preparing for the last distribution to end the cooperative. When the date is set, it will be announced. Shanghai Citizen Consumer Cooperative."

### Members of Huai'en Church Establish Educational Grants

Hoping that all churches will start advocating

Recently, five enthusiastic church members of Huai'en Church in Menlu, in view of the soaring prices and the steep increase in tuition and miscellaneous fees of various schools, most parents are unable to bear the burden, and young children are inevitably suffering from dropping out of school. Shen Xin Two Newspapers have been handling student aid funds for many years with remarkable results. Although they have loudly called for donations from all parties, there are still more monks than porridge, and there are inevitably pearls left in the sea. Some fellow villagers' associations and charities occasionally respond to the call, but their strength is limited, and how can they provide assistance to thousands of poor students? After consulting with the Deacon Board of the church, the Huai'en Church Education Group was formally established, with the purpose of raising educational grants to help poor church members' children go to school. It is reported that the group has now raised 100,000 yuan, and will make every effort to raise more funds. It is hoped that enthusiastic church members and people from all walks of life will embrace the heart of helping the hungry and drowning, and promote the righteousness of helping others as they would themselves, and donate as much as they can to jointly support this righteous cause.

As for the scope of assistance, due to funding reasons, it is temporarily limited to the children of church members. However, if the results are good and a large sum of money is collected, it will be extended to the children of poor church members in other churches. As the autumn school season is approaching, the responsible personnel of the group are working hard every day to actively handle the matter. Now the first application form and registration form have been compiled and printed. All church members who are poor and whose children cannot afford to go to school can go to the Education Group of the church to apply from now on. Also, the colleagues of the group feel that the loss of young people dropping out of school is a great loss to the country and society. They earnestly hope that enthusiastic church members in this city will uphold the purpose of student aid and advocate for it in groups. Then the children of poor church members will all be able to continue to attend school and will not wander astray. Their merits are truly indescribable.

### Student Aid News

Mr. Tang Weizhi and others from Taicang County have initiated a university loan for poor children in Taicang County. Since its implementation, donations from all walks of life have been very enthusiastic. In the second half of this year, six university students are approved. All poor university students from Taicang County can apply for registration to Mr. Lu Boquan at 7 Xinkaihe, Taicang City, or Mr. Gu Zhongchao at 14 Puja Lane, Taicang City.

Taizhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai

In view of the increase in tuition fees in various schools, there will inevitably be more young people dropping out of school. In order to rescue them, we are gathering the strength of fellow villagers to promote the student loan movement. We have now raised 10,000 yuan. Also, the third membership recruitment movement of the association is very enthusiastic, and the results of the second recruitment will be announced on August 15.

### Donate Small Loan Fund

The small loan fund is the service of this office six. All those who run a small business and feel short of capital can apply for registration to this office. Repay the principal once a month, in ten installments, without interest.

Donating a small loan fund can give poor people the opportunity to make a living, and it implies the ultimate meaning of helping the unemployed.

### Are There Any Flexible Measures for Reporting and Cancelling Household Registration When Returning to Hometown?

My friend Mr. Zhang returned to his hometown two months ago because his father was ill. Now he has received a letter saying that his father has passed away, and there is no one to take care of his family, so he cannot come to Shanghai. He sent back his Shanghai citizen certificate and entrusted it to the Baojia Office to cancel it on his behalf. After submitting it to the Baojia Office for cancellation, it was said that he must return it in person and cannot be represented. However, now that transportation is inconvenient and the travel expenses are huge, I am still entrusted to inquire by letter. I don't know if the Baojia authorities can understand the people's difficulties and provide flexible measures for this type of situation. (Sincerely, 　Zhen)

Blood and Tears (1)

The car sped along the path below the cliff, arriving at the school gate in the blink of an eye. At the gate, Masato paid the fare.

Upon entering the gate, the fine gravel path was very clean, with a garden-style arrangement in the middle, with stones and blooming azaleas. On the central platform, two small submarines were displayed, remnants of the era known as the submersible boat era. In front of one with the number "Six" written in white letters, a small shrine was enshrined. This was the Submarine Shrine.

Masato stood in front of the shrine, respectfully bowing and saying:

"This is Lieutenant Sakuma's No. 6 boat. This shrine is dedicated to all those who sacrificed themselves for the country. These martyrs are more like the guardian deities of the Imperial submarine, rather than just the guardian deities of the submarine school... Wait here for a moment. I'll go get Nitta."

Having said that, he ran into the building directly ahead.

Takao also knew about Lieutenant Sakuma's heroic martyrdom, so he secretly paid his respects in his heart, and then carefully observed this leaf-shaped No. 6 boat. Because Takao had read naval literature, he understood whether the early submersibles were Dutch-type or single-hull type. Soon after, that person appeared, dragging Lieutenant Nitta along.

"Takao, you're really lucky. The dean is still here on Sunday and will come to see you in a while. This is because Nitta introduced you to him, saying you are a naval painter."

Masato was very happy, as if it were his own affair. Takao also thanked Lieutenant Nitta.

"Don't mention it. Well, let me lead you on a tour of the school buildings! Today is a day off, there are no classes..."

The lieutenant said, waddling forward with his large buttocks.

The workshops were built separately and were located everywhere. There were various workshops for steering, machinery, torpedoes, etc., but since it was a day off, they were all locked, so we could only stand outside the windows and take a look.

"You'll see the real thing in the future, so this is enough for now."

Later, Lieutenant Nitta led them to the school building. That was where the trainees lived and studied academic subjects, but most of them had left the school on Sunday, so it seemed particularly quiet now.

In a moment, they ran to the trainees' dormitory. There were several large pillars supporting the building, with many long tables and benches arranged below. Furthermore, the rifle racks and shoe racks were all neatly arranged, but they were all placed very close together.

"The Imperial Navy doesn't pay much attention to dormitories, especially in submarines. But the trainees' dormitory also imitates this point, so this room serves as a dormitory, dining hall, and study. Look, there are hooks hanging on the beams! They put up a rope frame and sleep on it... (12.1)"
