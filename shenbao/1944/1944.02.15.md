### Assisting Education and National Compulsory Education

In handling this year's student aid fund, we discovered something different from previous years, namely the large number of elementary school students applying. It has already been reported that over 700 former students and over 800 new students have been approved. Over 100 former students were rejected due to poor grades, and nearly 1,000 new students were rejected due to poor grades. In total, over 2,000 elementary school students applied for assistance. We further considered that even more elementary school students applied to other national institutions, and some out-of-school elementary school students did not even request assistance. By rough estimate, there are at least over 10,000 out-of-school children in Shanghai alone. This is truly a major issue!

Entrusted with a great responsibility by our readers, we handle student aid affairs with the firm belief that "donations are the readers' hard-earned money, and we must repay them with our hard-earned work." We have established the standard of "poor but outstanding," strictly adhering to it without any compromise. Outsiders may think it is too strict, but we feel that only in this way can we be worthy of our readers. Around the end of the year and beginning of the new year, when people are celebrating, our colleagues and many of the gentlemen who sponsor us are buried in application forms, registration forms, transcripts, family situation investigation reports, graded lists, grouped exams, and other forms, working day and night. Here, we find more interesting pleasure than watching a play or eating a meal, and we gain unparalleled comfort in spirit. We have done these small tasks for the readers of the *Shen Bao*, but the readers of the *Shen Bao* have pulled the Republic of China forward a few more steps.

Regarding the elementary school portion, from the beginning, we stipulated that it would be limited to higher elementary school students. There were two intentions: first, the tuition for lower elementary school is relatively lighter; second, four years of lower elementary education should, in any case, be the responsibility of the children's parents and relatives. However, the current situation is different. The increase in tuition for lower elementary school has reached a point where not everyone can afford it. When registering applications this year, many lower elementary school students came to the office accompanied by their elderly parents, and burst into tears after we explained the situation tactfully. All of our colleagues were shocked. Everyone has compassion, and we are unwilling to break the rules. In this situation, our colleagues pooled some money and, after careful investigation, tried to give these children some comfort so that they could make progress.

As for the higher elementary school portion, over 2,000 people applied. We guarantee that the over 1,000 people approved are poor and outstanding. However, the children who were rejected are not necessarily not poor or not outstanding. Their rejection was truly due to the limitation of funds. Here, there are three viewpoints: according to educational principles, it is more important to help children who are out of school than to help adults who are out of school. Adults who are out of school can still review at home, while children who are out of school are truly "completely" out of school. According to the needs of the nation and society, it is most important to help students who are about to become talented so that they do not give up halfway. According to the motive of readers providing student aid, the meaning of student aid lies in helping in times of urgent need, not in helping the poor. Although it has charitable implications, it is not fundamentally a charitable undertaking. Therefore, the greatest purpose is to cultivate talent for society and the nation, and thus more attention is paid to students who can immediately serve the nation and society. We have had many discussions in the past, and with the guidance of the gentlemen on the Student Aid Fund Committee, we have set a proportion that suits all aspects of the opinions. Because more elementary school students are taken, the number of middle school and university students will inevitably be reduced, and vice versa. However, the current social and economic situation is before us, and the number of elementary school students applying for assistance has increased, which makes us hesitant about the future direction. We have already sought the opinions of the gentlemen on the committee, and we are even more willing to accept the opinions of our readers.

The increase in tuition and the decline of the social economy have made six years of elementary school education extremely difficult for the majority of children. This is truly a serious problem! To solve such a big problem, the government's great effort is indispensable. Therefore, we reiterate our proposed national compulsory education issue. The actual need is even more urgent now. The situation in Shanghai is like this, and the situation in other places must be even worse than Shanghai. The number of out-of-school children must be several times greater than in Shanghai. We hope that the authorities will quickly decide on a direction, at least first increasing the funding for national education, strictly ordering that elementary school tuition not be increased in the future, and further striving to ensure that children throughout the country have the opportunity to receive education. We earnestly look forward to it!

### Beijing Correspondence: Tensions Amidst the New Year's Greetings - The God of Wealth Teases the Hoarders -

— Zhiren

Along with the passage of time comes the tension of economic life. The period around the New Year is a time of great activity for the hoarders. There are successes and failures. Blue cloth had been rising in price all along to 1,600 yuan per bolt, but now it has suddenly dropped to around 500 yuan. Gold had risen to around 2,400 yuan, but now it has dropped to 1,500 yuan. Rubber tires had risen to around 500 yuan per pair, but now they have dropped to 300 yuan. The people who once stroked the cloth, kissed the gold, treasured the rubber tires, and secretly laughed to themselves are now glaring and cursing the God of Wealth for playing tricks. However, on the other hand, the soaring of prices continues. Sesame oil rose from 8 yuan to 9 yuan per catty before the New Year, but now it has jumped to the 16 yuan mark, and shoe merchants are also refusing to sell their stock in order to raise prices. The rickshaw pullers are very imposing on the streets. It costs 4 yuan to go from Dong'an Market to Xidan. Don't want to ride? Suit yourself. The trams are packed to the gills. Some time ago, because the trams were crowded, there were often quarrels caused by accidental bumps, but now there are no more quarrels, only glares and curses, as there is no space to even move one's limbs to fight, only the eyeballs and lips have room to move. As for food, millet flour has also risen to 3.20 yuan per catty, and the number of people collapsing on the streets is gradually increasing. This is the appearance of Beijing in the New Year.

### Allied Occupation of Singapore, Second Anniversary Today, Our Government Authorities Issue Important Reflections

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) The 15th marks the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore. A Central News Agency reporter visited government authorities to inquire about their thoughts. They agreed to publish the following opinions: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Allied forces have used their rapid action to defeat the British fleet, causing the enemy forces to lose courage. They then occupied Singapore, destroying an important military, political, and economic base of British aggression in East Asia. On the occasion of the second anniversary, we cannot help but admire the fighting spirit of the Allied soldiers. Recalling the past two years, in terms of military affairs, after the Allied occupation of Singapore, they swept through the Dutch East Indies, reaching the Solomon Islands, went west to Burma, and approached the Indian border. Both the eastern and western fronts established glorious war achievements unprecedented in world war history. In terms of politics, the independence and liberation of East Asian nations have risen one after another. Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and the Free India Government has been established, all unfolding a bright new page in East Asian history. Last year, East Asian countries held the Greater East Asia Conference, issued a declaration, and expressed their beliefs. This further proved the determination of East Asian nations to unite sincerely and exert the total strength of one billion people. In terms of economics, the Southern Development has been largely grasped, and there is ample preparation for the needs of the rear, which is more than sufficient to cope with the war. On the enemy's side, due to the loss of Southeast Asia, resources are scarce. One gain and one loss, the winner is self-evident. In short, in terms of military, political, and economic aspects, we have entered the path of absolute victory. Recently, the enemy has extravagantly mentioned a counteroffensive in the South Pacific; their reckless actions are merely seeing their efforts exhausted. However, before the enemy surrenders, they will seize the opportunity to move in a foolish manner, which is inevitable. It is hoped that all the people and East Asian nations will work hard and strive to push towards the final general battle, and the day of the enemy's total collapse will not be far away.

### The Government Promulgates the Anti-Smoking and Detoxification Law

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Today (the 15th) is the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore (now known as Shonan). On this anniversary, all East Asians and all Chinese people are recalling the crimes of the British imperialists who have invaded and oppressed East Asia and China for two or three hundred years. All are recalling the brave battles of the Allied soldiers since the Greater East Asia War, who charged into battle and destroyed the basic strength of Britain and America in a few days, and demolished the final base of Britain and America in a few months. Their heroic achievements are all urging us to strive forward, increase our total strength, and seek to complete the war. It is learned from this agency that the government's anti-smoking and detoxification bill will be reviewed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan today, which is no accident and has great significance for the times. The spread of opium was the beginning of British imperialist aggression, and it should share the same fate as British imperialism in East Asia. Today's resolution on anti-smoking and detoxification has the dual meaning of destroying both opium and Britain and America, which is even clearer. It is found that in the 24th year of the Republic, while Chairman Wang served as the President of the Executive Yuan, he promulgated a five-year anti-smoking plan, which was implemented for more than a year and achieved results. This bill will continue the previous plan and be more stringent in order to achieve thorough implementation. This reporter interviewed cadres of the youth detoxification movement and learned that the youth were very excited about this news and were more determined and courageous to support the government, cooperate with the Allies, and eliminate smoking and detoxify, destroying Britain and America. All are awaiting the promulgation of the anti-smoking law and are moving forward in unison, strengthening their organization, and hoping to use the combined power of the people and the government to implement the detoxification movement, and not to let down the original intention of the supreme leader to promote the new movement and save the country and the people. At the request of the youth of the capital, the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee has scheduled a meeting of youth representatives at 5:00 PM today and has sent letters to the Minister of the Interior and the Director of the Chinese Youth League and Secretary-General of the Chinese Youth Model Regiment to personally provide guidance. It is said that Minister Mei will announce the implementation measures for anti-smoking, and General Lin will instruct on the future direction of the detoxification movement.

### Chiefs Ye and Bao Specially Express Thoughts

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Minister Ye of the Army and Chief of Staff Bao specially expressed their thoughts on the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore on the 15th. Minister Ye said: "The supposedly impregnable fortress of Singapore was taken down by our friendly Japanese army, navy, and air force, showing it to be unusually fragile and useless. It was occupied only two months after the opening of the Greater East Asia War. Naturally, the bravery of the friendly soldiers deserves admiration, but the real key is that the aggressors had no righteousness as their foundation, and any strong construction of a great endeavor is ultimately not worth a blow. Our Eastern spirit of kingship leads a billion people and will never be defeated even after ten thousand tribulations. This is not only the victory of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, in addition to expressing infinite respect to the friendly soldiers, we are more determined in our belief that the king is invincible." Chief of Staff Bao said that on December 8th of the 30th year, our ally Japan launched the Greater East Asia Liberation War. In just four days, it captured Guam; in half a month, it occupied Wake Island and Hong Kong; and in two months and seven days, it occupied Singapore, the enemy's only solid naval base in East Asia for a hundred years. Why did it collapse and be occupied in such a short period? There are at least the following four reasons: In terms of politics, the Allied forces fought to liberate East Asia, not only causing the total rise of the people of our country but also the total unity of the East Asians. Therefore, the enemy's defeat and the Allied victory came unexpectedly quickly. In terms of strategy, the enemy was arrogant by nature, while the Allies were cautious and were victorious due to their brilliant strategy. In terms of tactics, the enemy's tactics were extremely slow, while the Allies were able to land in one fell swoop, causing the enemy to be defeated. In terms of spirit, the enemy's spirit was decadent and depressed from beginning to end, while the Allied spirit was unusually vigorous. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, it is certain that our side will achieve complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### Mr. Nakajima, Director of the Southern Army Press Department, Speaks

Shonan, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Mr. Nakajima, Director of the Southern Army Press Department, gave an interview to reporters on the 14th, with the 15th being the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, and made a speech, the general idea of which was: "Two years have passed since the birth of the new Malaya. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, the thoughts are indeed deep. Singapore, formerly the base point for British imperialism to invade East Asia, has now become the source of defense and supply for East Asia. At the same time, the natives of various places have also been liberated from the oppression of Britain, America, and the Netherlands and have been reborn. The Southern Army's political First

Operational

Principle is also steadily advancing, aiming to exhaust the total strength within the Southern Sphere to defeat Britain and America, and moving towards the path of completing the war. To adapt to local conditions, drastic and appropriate measures are being implemented. The natives of various places have also actively cooperated, which has achieved practical results. The various places in the South have become a part of Greater East Asia, eliminating British and American forces, breaking the old order, and working hand in hand with Asian countries towards the goal of building a grand new Greater East Asia order. Furthermore, Southern construction has a great connection to completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the development of the Southern military and government shoulders an extremely important mission. Due to the progress of various measures, the residents of various places are increasingly aware of their mission. The residents of Malaya, Java, Sumatra, and other Southern regions are all able to understand the true meaning of this war, and with a determination to win,

Cooperate with the Japanese Army

in combat until victory is achieved. There are even those who have joined the volunteer army to defend their homeland. With the joint efforts of Japanese military and civilians and local residents, the Southern construction of Japan has made remarkable progress. Most buildings and other items were destroyed when the enemy retreated. However, they were repaired completely within a short period of time, and various industries are also rapidly recovering. The resources currently sent to the Japanese mainland and the supplies transported to the front lines are also increasing daily. At the same time, the development of important resources that are indispensable for modern warfare has achieved excellent results beyond expectations. In the past, as British and American colonies, the production and export of special raw materials in their industries were restricted. However, now, industries that are suitable for local conditions have been formed in various places. Therefore, the old system under British and American control has been completely destroyed. The Southern Industrial Five-Year Plan is being strengthened daily and can overcome all difficult conditions. Promoting construction in all aspects during wartime

Construction Promotion

will make the Southern regions self-sufficient industrial supply bases. Shipbuilding industry has made great progress in various parts of the South. Therefore, the transportation of important materials from the South to the mainland and the promotion of material exchanges have made Southern resources a fighting force, which has made a great contribution to completing the operation. Regarding the food self-sufficiency system, past malpractices have been eliminated. The increase in food production is currently being promoted. In Malaya, rice imports have been reduced to a fraction of what they were before the war, and overseas Chinese have taken the lead in participating in food production increases. From this, after the occupation of Singapore, the construction under the Southern Sphere's First Operational Principle has made considerable progress. Its construction will be further strengthened in the future, and its contribution to the strengthening of combat power will be enormous. Today, the Southern construction battle is a military battle, and it is a part of the military battle. At the same time, it is also

Striving for Victory

a military factory. In order to win the war, there is no difference between the front and the rear. Every citizen must exert all their abilities, contributing money if they have money, and contributing strength if they have strength. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, this phenomenon has been clearly manifested, which is the current situation on the front line of the South.

### The Road to Delhi

— Chandra Bose

Having completed preparations for attacking Delhi, Mr. Bose, leader of the Indian Provisional Government advancing into Burma, personally wrote "The Road to Delhi" and sent it to the Japanese Shimbun Rengosha the day before India's Independence Day—the 25th—declaring his determination to break through all obstacles and attack Delhi. The full text is translated below:

Since ancient times, Delhi has been the decisive point for all armies coming from abroad to attack India, and the target of all Indian armies aiming for India. In fact, the history of India is engraved on the stones of the great Indian plains around Delhi. Indeed, as the saying "He who controls Delhi controls India" shows, this is deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Indian people. In the past, poets even sang, "The ruler of Delhi is the ruler of the present world." Unlike Rome, where all roads lead, the West is often closer than the Northwest, a lesson of history. In 1857, when Britain completely conquered India, it made full use of this lesson. Initially, Britain wanted to protect its empire in India by occupying Afghanistan. But when all attempts to conquer Afghanistan failed, Britain wanted to build a barrier between Afghanistan and India.

British Strategy

Britain is a country that has always instinctively believed in the value of propaganda. Even recently, Britain gave the world the impression that Singapore was an impregnable fortress. Similarly, it was also propagated that the fortresses on the northwestern border of India were indestructible. However, although the border between India and Afghanistan is more fortified, the road through Balochistan from Persia is easily attacked. However, Persia is militarily weak, so Britain is not in much danger. What [they] fear is that the Soviet Union might attack India from Afghanistan at any time. Therefore, the main force of all British defenses guarded the border between India and Afghanistan to deal with invaders from the Northwest. As a result, after 1919, many Indian revolutionaries fled to Kabul to seek help from Moscow. King Amanullah knew that the defense of northwestern India was just a myth. Therefore, when a dispute arose between the British Indian government and Afghanistan, the King immediately and unexpectedly launched a state of war. In 1919, the Afghan army invaded India, causing great panic in Britain. Because of the conditions proposed by the Afghan King, [Britain] made peace with him.

When Tsarist Russia was at its peak, the British in India constantly feared that Russia would invade from Afghanistan. They were only relieved after the collapse of the Tsarist regime. However, the communist regime established in Moscow in 1917 expressed sympathy for all enslaved peoples in Asia; and King Amanullah, who expressed sympathy for Indian independence, ascended the throne of Afghanistan in 1919. These events gave Indian revolutionaries hope that Afghanistan might receive assistance from communist Russia, and increased their strength considerably. However, ten years later, Britain used a trick to exile King Amanullah from the country. In this way, 1929 was like a year of resurrection for Britain. Ten years later, the situation changed again. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August of the same year, and the outbreak of the German-British war in September of the same year, plunged Britain back into a nightmare of fear of the Soviet Union. In an attempt to prevent the invasion of the Soviet army, [Britain] began to strengthen the defenses of the northwestern border of India again.

The sudden outbreak of the German-Soviet war in June 1941 saved the extremely embarrassed British people. Although the rapid advance of the German army into the Caucasus region temporarily worried [them] about reaching the Iranian region, in the end, they felt that the outbreak of the German-Soviet war saved the British Empire in India. However, once the Greater East Asia War broke out, all situations changed drastically. The northwestern border of India temporarily lost its historical significance, and the border between Burma and India became the focus of attention. The treacherous mountain range on the border between China, Burma, and India, the undeveloped jungle, eventually became a passable place. The British Governor-General of Burma and his embarrassed British army crossed the mountains, along newly opened roads, and fled to Bengal, and then to Delhi. The former British Governor-General of Burma is now living in New Delhi, plotting mischief with his subordinates who fled from Burma. But when they fled from Burma to India, they left roads for our comrades to use. After they went from Rangoon to Delhi, the roads they passed through were also opened up by our comrades. These roads are now awaiting the advance of our Indian National Army. In this way, the route to India from the Northwest has completely changed, and the road to attack India from Burma has become a new problem.

The Route to Attack Delhi

Today, countless roads to Delhi are open before our eyes, and these roads are the shortest and most effective routes for us to attack. In Europe, there is a saying: "All roads lead to Rome." Here in East Asia, all roads on land lead to the capital of India, to that ancient and red fortress in [our] steady gaze. Delhi is our desired destination. We will attack Delhi by this road. Although there are many mountains and dense forests on our way forward, there are no fortresses like those set up on the northwestern border to prevent our attack. That is a newly opened road, and nature has become our friend. We have now gained the power to overcome this heaven-sent obstacle effortlessly. From Burma to Delhi, to the Governor-General's residence, to the Red Fort that reigns over all of India. Our road ahead is long and difficult, but the opportunity has ripened. Do not miss a moment. Strike quickly. "The Road to Delhi"! "The Road to Liberation"! (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, January 27th, by Xiang)

### The Enemy Air Force in Burma and India is Facing a Crisis. The Chongqing Commentary Shows Increased Dissatisfaction.

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The Chongqing commentary circles believe that the anti-Axis air force on the Burmese-Indian front is facing a crisis. Therefore, they are increasingly dissatisfied with Britain. The editorials of various newspapers on the 11th expressed increased disappointment with the powerlessness of Imphal, and frankly admitted that the Japanese army has already taken the lead in the war. The second act of the Arakan tragedy, staged by the anti-Axis forces, shows a dim and worrisome color. The organ newspaper "Sao Dang Bao" of the Chongqing Military Commission has abandoned its usual optimistic tone and made a pessimistic commentary. It said that the British and Indian armies under Imphal are taking an active offensive to recapture Burma. However, the sale of love over the past few months has proved that this offensive is completely contrary to expectations. In particular, the situation on the Arakan front in recent days has confirmed that the Japanese army has grasped the leading role in the war. Soon after the dry season, Imphal will have nothing to expect, and it is feared that it will give the Japanese army the opportunity to decide on both offensive and defensive operations. Ta Kung Pao also strongly stated the powerful combat power of Japan to warn the British and American sides, and said that the reason for the failure belongs to the British and American sides. The Japanese army has now obtained an excellent opportunity to launch a major offensive against India, and the British army stationed in India seems completely unsuitable for actual combat. Looking at the rapid increase in the productivity of Japanese aircraft, it can be seen that the Japanese army can now freely defend its operational bases. Moreover, Japan can continue to fight for ten or twenty years. This is not just exaggerated propaganda by the Japanese army. The question is whether the United Kingdom and the United States can change their foreign policies and continue the ten-year war? Will isolationism or appeasement factions in the United Kingdom and the United States repeatedly cause setbacks in the war? The United States and Chongqing have recently taken military action in the Marshall Islands; Has it embraced the determination to defeat Japan? Also, what is the action of the United Kingdom? If so, we cannot help but be suspicious of what Imphal has been doing since he was appointed commander of the Southeast Asian Army. After this extremely news-worthy comment was published, the British and American journalist corps stationed in Chongqing was greatly surprised. On the same day, when meeting reporters at the Military Commission, someone questioned whether this comment represented the opinion of the Chongqing authorities, making it extremely difficult for the Chongqing military spokesperson to answer.

### Enemy Planes Attack Hong Kong, Four Shot Down

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: At about 3:40 pm on the 11th, twelve North American B-25 type enemy planes and fifteen P-40 type planes attacked Hong Kong. The enemy planes' air raid seemed to target Kai Tak Airport, but their bombs failed to hit, and the airport equipment suffered no losses. At that time, Japanese naval fighter planes took off to intercept, resulting in one unconfirmed B-25 being shot down. The remaining planes fled, and one Japanese plane was also lost.

### Criminal Defendants in Custody: Do Not Abuse Power. The Ministry of Justice Admonishes Various Branch Courts.

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Ministry of Judicial Administration's Changju recently discovered that courts at all levels often do not follow regulations and detain criminal defendants indiscriminately. Minister Zhang Yipeng issued a warrant admonishing his subordinates not to abuse their power in order to respect legal rights. The original order is as follows:

Investigating the detention of criminal defendants, according to the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, there must be legal grounds and it must be done only when necessary. In investigation or trial, [courts] should differentiate the circumstances and repeatedly order compliance with bail or restriction of residence. Recently, it has been discovered that when courts and offices at all levels are handling criminal cases, they often detain people indiscriminately without legal conditions, which is not the way to respect human rights or be careful with prisons. It is hereby ordered that you follow the instructions and comply. In the future, if any cases of indiscriminate detention are discovered, they will be immediately transferred for disciplinary action. Officials who are negligent in supervision will also be held accountable. You must all comply.

The original text is recorded below:

Investigating judicial officials, the place is dignified, and the pursuit of wandering is prohibited. At this time of rising prices, the cost of a meal is often thousands. How can the law be cheap and clean? It must be known that more one point of expenses is one less point of integrity. Although the cause is small, the matter is huge. In the future, in addition to the necessary entertainment, the heads of the various prisons should comply with the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Civil Servant Banquets and Gift Restrictions promulgated by the National Government on December 15, 32nd year of the Republic [1943], and all other subordinates should absolutely prohibit entertainment and prohibit gifts. If there are weddings or funerals among colleagues, the court's prison shall determine the minimum limit, send cash together, and tear them apart separately, and must not send them privately individually. The income of the officials is only enough to make a living. In this difficult time, daily life should be as thrifty as possible. If they still go to the wine poverty exchange, the entertainment powder, not only waste time, but also fear that the cost will increase. Although they guarantee not to drink until they are exhausted, they will eventually step into the criminal law, and there is no regret in chasing. Thinking of this, how can they not be awe-inspiring. All my colleagues should each understand the situation and be vigilant, and if they still resist, they will be punished. All officials should set an example and conduct a thorough investigation without slight favoritism. It is ordered to comply and to inform all subordinates to comply.

### Huaihai Province Currency Trending Towards Unification

Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch to Open

Xuzhou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Since the Central Reserve Bank notes were used in conjunction with the United Reserve Bank notes in this area since December 1st of last year, it has been extremely convenient for the people to use them. In order to promote the widespread circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes within Huaihai Province, the Huaihai Provincial authorities have abolished the previous regulations that required a clear explanation for exchanges of value notes exceeding one thousand yuan, as well as restrictions on remittances, from the 6th. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. As the realization of currency unification is near, it is of great importance to the drop in prices and the stability of people's lives. Therefore, there is extraordinary attention and expectation from the general public. For this reason, the reporter made a special visit to various related agencies yesterday. According to the statement, since the Huaihai Provincial Government has been established, the adjustment of local currency is necessary. Moreover, the current rise in prices and the people's livelihood are all insecure. The further expansion of the exercise of reserve coins, especially local exercise, is due to the fact that the bank has not yet been established, so the amount of circulation is small, so it is not enough to apply. Now that the exchange restrictions with the United Reserve Bank have been lifted, and the branch is also scheduled to open, the future of reserve coins is naturally expected. Subsequently, the economic policy of the authorities, the general expectation of price reductions, can also be smoothly achieved. In the future, regarding prices, all stores must uniformly indicate the prices of reserve coins and the prices of United Reserve coins. However, the stores will inevitably have tricks in the future, and the authorities responsible for the treasure will strictly crack down on them at any time.

### Loose Cloth Transferred to Temporary Rationing. The Business and Trade Committee Reports to the Executive Yuan for Approval.

The Shanghai Special City Cloth Shop Trade Association has separately submitted a report to the Business and Trade Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Shanghai Office of the Materials Review Committee, stating that the business of its members' cloth shops has stagnated and their lives have become increasingly difficult. They have also asked their members to sell loose cloth and give prices at rationing prices, with a one-time cash payment for relief, with three attached measures, requesting to handle according to the regulations. According to reporters' inquiries, the Business and Trade Committee believes that the various sections requested by the association are in requesting that all loose cloth be exempted from purchase, and specially prepared for rationing to citizens of this city. The meaning is that the rationing money obtained should be fully collected by the original applicant for sale, which is not in line with the originally promulgated purchase regulations. However, the cloth merchants in this city have suffered hardships due to the purchase of yarn and cloth this time, and sympathy should be given in the commercial collective position. For this reason, it is planned to approve the full collection of loose cloth from the cloth merchants by the association on behalf of the association for this temporary rationing. If there is any surplus, the association will be responsible for safekeeping and will be transferred to other rationing. The association has now submitted a report to the Executive Yuan for instructions, and a decision can be made after the instructions arrive. It is also heard that the Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee has also expressed its approval in principle based on the request of the association.

### Soliciting Donations for Student Aid from Those with Means; Hoping Readers Will Report Abuses; Receiving Many Accusations Daily, Awaiting Thorough Investigation

Since this newspaper published the list of students approved for student aid, we have received many letters of accusation from various sectors, complaining that some applicants have considerable family financial resources, ample enough to support others; some have the ability to pay tuition and do not need to apply at all; and some are even frequent patrons of entertainment venues. They see it as an unexpected gain to participate in the application process. They have specified the names, schools, and family circumstances of these students, urging us to thoroughly investigate and cancel their student aid. We deeply admire the enthusiasm and assistance of members of society and fellow students. This newspaper has previously advised students of this type that those with means should not only avoid taking away the opportunity of education from those without means but should also donate as much as they can. If they insist on taking advantage through trickery, the truth will inevitably be revealed. This newspaper is now investigating based on the letters received. Once verified, in addition to demanding the return of the received aid from the guarantors, their names and facts will be publicly announced in the newspaper as a warning to those who attempt to deceive. At the same time, we hope that readers will provide timely and detailed reports. This newspaper will definitely investigate thoroughly and report back to reassure the enthusiastic donors.

Commemorating Deceased Son by Withdrawing Funds for Student Aid

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Yu Zhongnan saying: "My eldest son, Runfu, had an extraordinary intellect. In the 29th year of the Republic, he applied to St. John's University. He excelled in his studies and, after entering the school, immersed himself in diligent study, but his physical strength could not keep up, and he developed a heart condition. Despite my advice to temporarily withdraw from school, he did not heed it and eventually succumbed to his illness. My deceased son had unfulfilled ambitions and endless regrets. Considering that there must be many who are eager to learn but are hindered by financial constraints, I have decided to use the funds saved by my deceased son as a fund for nurturing talents for generations to come. I am hereby withdrawing 15,000 national currency units to contribute to your newspaper's primary and secondary school student aid program. I hope you will accept and handle it accordingly." Mr. Yu's transfer of his love for his son to the countless impoverished students is deeply admired.

### The Central Book and Newspaper Distribution Office Establishes Measures for Allocating Cultural Paper

Central News Agency: In this time of white paper scarcity, a detailed calculation should be made of the quantity needed for production and transportation during the war. Due to the difficulty of even meeting the minimum needs and the gradually decreasing sources of white paper, distribution should be carefully planned, and efforts should be made to conserve resources. The Central Book and Newspaper Distribution Office has prepared a quantity budget form, which should be submitted to the Ministry of Propaganda for review to eliminate waste. The Ministry of Propaganda's Central Reporting and Distribution Office has formulated provisional measures for the allocation of cultural paper, which have been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Propaganda.

If the self-report paper is used for other purposes, it may be converted at market prices.

Once the publications printed with allocated white paper are completed, they should be submitted to the Central Propaganda Department's Reporting and Distribution Office for verification. The following points should be noted:

A. The number of publications printed should match the quantity listed in the quantity budget form.

B. The publications verified by the Central Propaganda Department's Newspaper and Book Distribution Office should clearly indicate the quantity for sale, donation, direct subscriptions, and storage. After verification, all quantities except for the sales portion will be returned for self-disposal.

C. If there is surplus allocation paper after the publication is printed, it should be included in the paper consumption form when submitting the publication for verification.

D. The remaining allocation paper from the previous time must not be used for other purposes and can only be combined with the paper for the next printing.

Publications printed with allocated paper, except for direct subscriptions and stored copies, must be entirely handed over to the Central Propaganda Department's Newspaper and Book Distribution Office for allocation to various retail stores for sale.

For publications printed with allocated paper, except for direct subscriptions and purchased copies handled by the publishers themselves, the wholesale prices allocated by the Central Propaganda Department's Newspaper and Book Distribution Office are as follows: 1. The Central Reporting and Distribution Office's wholesale price is 65% of the retail price. 2. The Central Book Distribution Office's wholesale price is 75% of the retail price.

Economic Commentary

### Employment Issues

The First District Public Office has been considering ways to train unemployed workers in the city and turn them into specialized commercial knowledge or special technical talent. The Social Welfare Employment Referral Section has also decided to take effective measures in the near future to strengthen its relationship with various industrial and commercial organizations to cooperate in solving the city's unemployment problem. This is an important task that meets the current social needs and should not be taken lightly.

In our previous discussions of industrial economic policy, the economy of the entire society, and employment referral agencies, we have always believed that increasing production involves the simultaneous concentration of human and material resources. We also believe that the achievements of the Allied Powers in handling employment referral services can be used as a reference for China today. This is because the severity of the unemployment problem is closely related to the economic issues of the entire society.

Solving the unemployment problem is not an easy task. The fundamental problem lies in the economic prosperity or recession of the country and society. However, the ways to solve the unemployment problem are nothing more than: training the unemployed to become talented individuals with special industrial and technical expertise and commercial knowledge; and introducing the unemployed to various production sectors, especially the family handicraft industry sector. Therefore, the widespread establishment of two types of institutions must be actively promoted: one is an institution for training unemployed personnel, and the other is an institution for introducing unemployed personnel. These two institutions must be actively promoted and strengthened under the joint efforts of the government and the people to initially solve the domestic employment problem in China. Assuming that the unemployment problem is solved by "treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts," it will be of no avail.

### Industry Evaluation Committee Begins Secret Investigation, Strictly Prohibiting Illegal Transactions by Similar Businesses

The city's major commodity trade associations have established "Goods Evaluation Committees" with reference to actual conditions to carry out evaluation work. The agreed-upon standard limit prices for the goods operated by each industry have been submitted to the authorities for approval. Recently, the evaluation committees of various industry associations found that the member businesses of the industry association were not selling goods at the limit prices and were arbitrarily exceeding the limit prices in the hope of obtaining illegal profits. This not only violates the current charter of the industry association's evaluation, but also violates the evaluation purpose of the association. Now, the association is happy to accept honest reports from all walks of life, and on the one hand, it has sent personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If it is found that there are illegal transactions, the license number and address will be copied and sent to the association for punishment. Minor offenses will be warned, followed by fines as a warning, and serious offenses will be reported to the authorities to prosecute in court.

Strictly Prohibit Illegal Transactions

The reporter has also learned that the industry associations are aware that the rising prices of all goods have not yet been eliminated. If this continues for a long time, people's livelihood will be at stake. Therefore, in addition to actively carrying out and requesting the authorities to fully allocate materials to increase the spot goods in the market, and assisting industry members to purchase from various production areas for continuous supply and sales, and processing and production, on the one hand, they absolutely prohibit member industries from engaging in illegal transactions. Regardless of buying or selling, only spot goods are allowed, and empty sales are not allowed. If such incidents occur, they will be severely punished. As for the sale of goods in stores, in addition to complying with the limit price, it is strictly prohibited to refuse to sell goods, reduce quantities, or use substandard weights and measures.

### Qian Industry Public Resolution on Checks, Requesting Payment Guarantee Method

The Qian Industry Association, after serious discussion on the acceptance and guarantee of checks, has decided on a method. After the check has been added with the words "Payment is correct" by the holder to the bank, according to the provisions of Article 49 of the industry rules, the scope is limited to verifying whether the promissory note is forged, whether it has been reported lost, and other disputes. It is set up separately from the meaning of the check guarantee. In the future, if there are checks requesting guarantee, the guarantee words should be clearly stated to avoid disputes due to future resolution of differences.

### Proposal to Pay Teachers' Salaries Once Every Six Months

— Tang Jingguo

The cost of living is now rising, and teachers are the most severely affected. Because the school's tuition fees are collected in full at the beginning of the semester, while the teacher's salary is determined according to the cost of living index at the end of the semester and paid monthly during the six months. During these six months, if the cost of living is assumed to double, then the teacher's salary is equivalent to a 50% discount, and one hundred yuan is only used as fifty yuan. If the cost of living is assumed to increase two, three, or four times, the teacher's salary will effectively be discounted in sequence. At that time, how can teachers use their salaries to maintain their lives?

Therefore, I advocate that the school authorities and teachers should be open and honest and discuss a win-win solution. It is best to pay the teacher's salary for the six months in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester so that the teacher can arrange for their living needs for the six months as early as possible. If the school authorities cannot trust the teachers and are afraid that the teachers will not teach attentively after receiving the salary, they may use a joint guarantee method, asking the teachers to provide mutual joint guarantees when paying the salary. Or, pay half of the salary first, and use the remaining half of the salary to purchase physical goods, which will be kept by the school and paid monthly after three months. This

### How to Solve the Book Famine

— Yi

Since the price of newspapers has soared, the prices of various books and newspapers have also risen accordingly, and the most affected are various textbooks. Every time school starts, they must rise several times. Often, when you buy a book, you open the first page or the last page and it still has the price from the previous semester printed on it, so it is definitely not a new book, but inventory. A thin elementary and middle school textbook costs dozens of yuan, and the price of university textbooks is even more astonishing. A book that cost 100 yuan last year cannot be bought for less than 400 or 500 yuan this year. It is even more painful to run all over the bookstores and not be able to find a book. Going to the used bookstore to buy old ones is even more difficult, I am afraid it is more expensive than a new book. Outsiders will definitely be fooled, and even those who are familiar with the situation will hide the books and not buy them. Therefore, this problem is not only a matter of concern for school authorities and teachers, but also a serious problem for the entire society regarding children's education. Why? It is because when the cost of living rises to the point where teachers cannot maintain their lives with their prescribed salaries, teachers cannot teach to their full potential. Wouldn't that cause the children to be trapped in a difficult situation of dropping out of school?

Therefore, this problem not only needs to be resolved fairly and properly by the school administration and the teachers themselves in an open manner, but also all members of society must think about their children's education and urge them to implement it. The school's tuition plus a not small book fee is really unbearable for students' parents.

Investigating the reason for the soaring book prices, the impact of the decreasing amount of newspapers in stock is one reason, but the direct reason is that the current generation of booksellers, who are greedy for profit, have hoarded textbooks as ordinary commodities, waiting for a good price to sell them. And the most hateful and terrifying phenomenon is that it has been discovered that several university professors, who are known as the highest level of knowledge, are also taking advantage of this convenient opportunity to hoard a large number of university textbooks and engage in the business of petty merchants. This situation is really unimaginable for the educational future of Shanghai. Now that school is about to start, the passive solution to the book famine problem is the most urgent task today. Now I will only talk about the university aspect:

In terms of physics and chemistry, students can take notes without having to limit the purchase of any books. Even if there are no books, it doesn't matter, students will naturally look for references in various ways.

English often has a thick book, but only a few pages are taught in a semester, and then it is discarded and not read, and another book needs to be purchased, which is not in line with the principles of economy and "making the most of everything." Moreover, there is no need to force students to buy the latest edition of English books, which only makes the bookstores make money. Because English is not like modern scientific books, the content of old and new editions may be very different, but only some materials and chapters are added or subtracted. Now it is suggested that the English professors write a few essences in the book and print them into lectures, and distribute them to the students like a loose-leaf anthology, wouldn't that save the students a sum of money?

History can also be copied into notes. Books such as "Di Shi" are not something that students can afford.

The school library should purchase more reference books for various subjects, and more copies of each type should be prepared for circulation, and the library director should manage them strictly. Often, after a certain book is borrowed, the second person is often unable to borrow it again. Students should not regard public books as private, and professors should not occupy them without authorization, so as to prevent circulation.

### Sea Turtle (2)

— Written by Navy Officer Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang

Section five of that song was what Bei Ren liked the most. When singing that part, he would unconsciously exert more force. It is said that the lyrics were written by a student of the 50th class during the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Naval Academy in the eighth year of the Taisho era. But looking at the lyrics of the fifth section, even twenty years ago in Etajima, there was such an understanding and awareness. This is something that we must deeply examine. Those few lines of lyrics are as follows:

Not seeing Western civilization,

Luxury mixes with anxiety and impurity,

Looking back at the Pacific Ocean,

Dark clouds densely cover the sky.

We, no longer

Fail the great task of this nation.

Chang Ren was shocked by "singing rest" for the first time in his life, so he progressed quickly. Even without the military band present, he did not forget the correct way of singing when he began to practice the school song under the guidance of upperclassmen. There was only one place where, for some reason, he always made mistakes in the lyrics. That is, he would change "We no longer exhort to sing" to "We no longer rise up."

(We no longer rise up!) When Ren goes to the garden, even in the solemn moment of lowering the warship flag, he will think of this sentence in his mind.

(It's not rise up, it's exhort!) Just as he thought of this, he would forget it again.

After a happy fifteen minutes of conversation before going to bed, the bugle for bedtime sounded. The students closed their mouths and began to sleep. Ju Ren also placed his hand on his chest, praying silently like a devout believer. (We no longer rise up!)

(3)

He barely overcame his weak singing of military songs. However, his swimming skills did not improve so quickly, so Zhen Ren was expelled to the red-hat class outside the ranks.

The summer schedule included early morning physical education and swimming time. Wrestling was also very popular during this period, but like swimming, it was not just a sport but a training exercise, and it was graded.

Zhen Ren hoped to achieve a certain level in swimming, at the very least. Sometimes he heard from student number three that diving was the standard for advancement. From then on, he practiced diving every day. Not only during the morning schedule but also during the afternoon practice time for those who were interested, he made sure to go to the diving board. His white chest was struck by the water, turning red as if sprinkled with wine. But he still jumped into the water repeatedly. Although he was the opposite of the frog of Ono no Tofu in behavior, he was quite comparable in spirit.

"A clumsy but persistent kid!" The swimming instructor, seeing Zhen Ren's practice situation, said to student number one next to him, "But his posture is too bad. It looks like a sea turtle falling into a pond. That will ruin his chest." "Should we tell him to pay attention?" "Don't bother. Let him do what he wants. With that kind of perseverance, he will naturally improve."

From that time on, Zhen Ren's characteristics gradually attracted the attention of those around him. His small stature, white face, and constant smiling made him seem unreliable to become a naval officer. Furthermore, he didn't go to the liquor store, and his seemingly money-loving attitude was viewed with contempt. However, they had to change their misconception about his extraordinary fighting spirit.

Why? Because nothing was more valued in this school than "fighting spirit." When Hirose Chuza was a student, he climbed Mount Koryu more than three hundred times, earning the respect of everyone. Even now, it is still a legend among the students.

However, Ju Ren's fighting spirit was not an innate character trait. And he himself knew that this was from his childhood, a stubborn mentality. The easily excitable and easily cooled nature of the Satsuma people flowed in his veins. In the school's prefectural association, it was often discussed that he was simply working hard because he lacked perseverance. Therefore, his fighting spirit was extremely unnatural. Sometimes it went too far.

He had considerable confidence in judo and wrestling, but he was extremely weak in marksmanship and swordsmanship. So he stubbornly exerted his fighting spirit. Even if he was being targeted, he would not be cowardly, constantly targeting the opponent. "Gu... you're a bit too tactless." His opponent would finally say with indignation.
