### Determination to Endure Hardship

During wartime, it is the duty of the people in the rear to endure hardship. The opposite of enduring hardship is seeking pleasure, and seeking pleasure inevitably increases the consumption of resources. Because every extra bit of consumption by the people means a corresponding decrease in the nation's reserves, which in turn reduces its combat power. Therefore, the hardship endured by the people indirectly increases the nation's combat power, leading to an earlier victory.

Enduring hardship can save the nation, not only during wartime but also in peacetime. The most obvious example is the Soviet Union, where the success of its three Five-Year Plans hinged on the spirit of enduring hardship. The slogans of the time were: "Eat less, wear less, live in less, and exchange the surplus materials for foreign production machinery," and "Eat poorly, wear poorly, live poorly, and exchange the good materials for foreign production machinery." This spirit of enduring hardship ultimately created modern Soviet Union. Consider our own China: for thousands of years, we have been an agricultural nation. The peasants, with empty stomachs and inadequate clothing, toiled from sunrise to sunset, living a life of

During wartime, it is not only "right and proper" for the people to endure hardship but also "inevitable." By studying the history of the last European war, we can understand the hardship experienced by the participating nations. Even the United States, the wealthiest nation at the time, enacted economic regulations after entering the war. On July 7, 1917, it stipulated that citizens must observe a "wheatless day" each week (i.e., abstain from bread) and limit meat consumption to once a week. Countless other examples exist of citizens of various countries economizing on consumption and resolving to endure hardship. This is because, during wartime, everything is for the war effort, and the nation's resources must be fully committed to military needs. Replenishing the combat power of the soldiers on the front lines with the resources of the people in the rear is the path to victory.

The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation, a life-or-death moment for the nations of Greater East Asia. Allied Japan was the first to demonstrate a spirit of enduring hardship. The people of Japan eat less and eat poorly, wear less and wear poorly, as anyone who has visited Japan can attest. Japan has sufficient resources to provide its citizens with fine clothing and food, but the government is unwilling to do so, and the people are unwilling to do so. They are willing to endure hardships, conserve national strength, and promote the victory of the war in order to achieve lasting peace in the future. This is a model wartime system, a good example that we should emulate.

China was originally a frugal nation, but since the Opium War and the intrusion of European and American capitalist forces, the people in the cities have gradually become extravagant. Especially in Shanghai, where in the past, the British and Americans, relying on the power of the concessions, exploited the earnings of the Chinese people to enjoy luxury, the officials and wealthy merchants followed suit, creating a culture of extravagance. The money that the British and Americans spend is the interest from their exploitation, but the money that the Chinese spend is the lifeblood of the nation. This extravagant trend has increased China's trade deficit and impoverished the country. If not for this Greater East Asia War, then the economic aggression of Britain and America would make it impossible for China to recover. The time for liberation has arrived, and if we still indulge in pride, extravagance, and pleasure, then the consequences in the future will be unimaginable. If the nation is finished, then the individual will naturally perish along with it. At this critical moment, we must make a great determination, live the most frugal life, avoid seeking comfort, avoid thinking about waste, constantly endure hardship, be self-disciplined in everything, and conserve the nation's vitality. This is to leave ourselves a margin of comfort in the future.

### Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Steadily, Completing General Attack Posture; Enemy Near Ukhrul Completely Annihilated

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain location on the Indo-Burmese border in eastern India and Burma on the 1st reports: After the Japanese and Indian troops on the Indo-Burmese border cut off the enemy's supply line connecting Imphal and Kohima on the night of the 28th of last month, their powerful forces continued to advance to the highway on the 29th, thoroughly destroying the enemy's supply line to the 4th Army Corps. At the same time, they controlled the enemy's base in Imphal from the rear, establishing a general attack posture. On the 28th, the Japanese army, with its suicide squads at the vanguard, cut off the Kohima highway in the Tseminyu area, and on the 29th, another powerful force occupied a point 30 kilometers north of Imphal.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indian front on the 2nd reports: Japanese and Indian troops crossed the Kungdawng River southwest of Homalin and continued to advance westward, reaching the vicinity of Ukhrul, a key point northeast of Imphal, on the 21st. After five days of fierce fighting, day and night, from the 22nd to the 26th, they completely annihilated the enemy in that area and are continuing to advance north towards Imphal. In an attempt to reverse the situation, the enemy dispatched approximately 3,000 troops from the 50th Brigade and other units from the rear to launch an attack, but these troops were defeated again near Ukhrul, Kungai Ukhrul, and Sarai Haree, 20 kilometers southwest of Ukhrul. The results of this battle were quite significant.

### Enemy Airfield at Namyu in Northern Burma Heavily Bombed by Japanese Aircraft

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma: Although the enemy's airborne troops in northern Burma are receiving ample support from the enemy army in an attempt to increase their strength, they are still being constantly annihilated by Japanese and Indian troops. On the 28th, a large formation of bombers and fighters attacked the landing field of the glider unit being constructed by the enemy in the Namyu area, 15 kilometers northwest of Mawlu. Despite fierce anti-aircraft fire from the enemy, the bombers heavily bombed the landing field, destroying five of the enemy's gliders. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Another report: In support of the Japanese army's ground forces' rapid pursuit of the defeated enemy, Japanese army aircraft launched a large-scale air raid on Kyaukse on the 28th. Another squadron bombed the enemy troops retreating along the Tamu-Imphal highway, inflicting heavy casualties.

### Main Force of the Enemy Surrounded in the Bipa Mountains, Falling into Disarray

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain location in southern Burma on the 2nd reports: The main force of the enemy's 87th West African Brigade, approximately 1,000 men, entrenched in the area between the Kaladan River and the Bipa River, attempted to launch a counterattack. Upon learning of their plan, Japanese and Indian troops launched a preemptive strike at dawn on the 30th, causing the enemy to fall into disarray again and begin to retreat. The 2,000 enemy troops at Kyauktan began to flee along the highway through the Bipa Mountains via Paletwa on the evening of the 30th. In order to annihilate them in one fell swoop, the Indian army has surrounded the Bipa Mountains.

### Burma Determines to Exert All Efforts to Engage in the War of Liberation; Ba Maw Broadcasts to the World

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The head of state of Burma, Ba Maw, broadcast to the world on the 31st, strongly stating that the current Japanese and Indian military advance into India has great significance in history. He also pointed out that the Anglo-American attempt to retake Burma will be crushed before the solidarity of the emerging Asia. East Asia will be further consolidated and united under new ideals. The main points are as follows: At present, the Burmese front has launched a fierce offensive operation, which is progressing very smoothly.

### Complete Mobilization of East Asian Peoples

It is well known that this war is a war of liberation for the people of Asia, a war fought for all the people of Asia. Its scale is even greater, and in order to thoroughly implement the struggle against the common enemy of Asia, all the forces of Asia have now begun to mobilize as a whole. Now, as I observe this offensive operation, first, from a military point of view, the enemy has completely failed and internal strife has occurred. We are now engaged in a life-and-death battle to liberate ourselves, but the British war policy remains unchanged, merely using the lives, property, and labor of other nations to fight the war. The enemy, Britain, is using Indian and African troops and American weapons to defend India, a great plunder. Second, the Indian National Army's advance into India can be called a historical feat.

### Indians Rise Up to Save Their Motherland

The Indians and our Burmese, who have been defeated by British military force for generations, have long understood the reason for this. The current events are the beginning of the end of all things. We are convinced that all the people of India must know that the Indian army has now entered their motherland and is fighting for the people of India. The so-called Indian nationalism and anti-British sentiment in India will surely reap great results when the opportunity arises. The Indian National Army's advance into Indian territory has proved that this opportunity has already arrived. India is vast and important, so if India does not speak, it is fine, but if it speaks, it will be astonishing. Its resistance to racial discrimination is not only the resistance of all the people of East Asia but also the great resistance of all mankind to the inhumane world order of the enemy. This kind of resistance from all mankind is a weapon that the enemy, Britain and America, must understand and is most afraid to understand in this war. It is more powerful and terrifying than any of their material weapons.

### Army and People United, Immense Strength

Examining the ever-improving offensive in Burma, one can discover a major fact: the posture of the new Asia, acting in unison, united and firm. At present, there are armies from three independent countries on the Burmese front, working together in a tense and fierce situation. This kind of unity is based on a firm belief that will never change. This belief is perhaps one of the forces that determine the Greater East Asia War. What is even more important is that behind these three armies is a large army with immense strength: the entire Burmese nation. Our efforts in the war of all-out strength are now playing a great role in the smoke-filled Kassapa region. The enemy's airborne transport force has suffered a major blow from the beginning due to the heroic resistance of the Burmese. This is just one example.

### Enemy Propaganda Counterproductive

The reality in Burma is like this everywhere, at all times. The enemy army is being deceived by its own propaganda, but this propaganda only invites our contempt and scorn. The iron will of the Burmese cannot be shaken by it. The enemy army's invasion of India is now turning into the Japanese army's attack on Imphal. This is an absolutely true fact. A new nation is developing vigorously day and night in Burma. Although the war has not yet ended, we must continue to struggle. No matter what sacrifices we make, we must complete the great cause. We have the spirit of disregarding any sacrifice in order to achieve our goals. In this war, we are exerting all our efforts and rising up to fight for the highest goals.

### New Situation in Burmese Air Combat

The ambitions of Britain and the United States to regain Burma in order to gain control of the air and reopen the route to support Chiang Kai-shek have intensified the air battle in Burma and India. Both sides are strengthening their air defense systems. The current state of air combat is that, under the absolute requirement to surpass the opponent's air defense measures, flights are gradually moving to higher altitudes and night flights are being developed, creating new leaps forward in time and space. Air combat in the extreme high altitudes and even the stratosphere has already become a real issue, and the difficulties of night air raids are about to be overcome.

During the aerial annihilation battles in India last year from January to February, the Hurricane aircraft that challenged the Japanese army stationed there initially flew at an altitude of only two to three thousand meters, but later reached five to six thousand meters. From March, the altitude increased day by day, and around April and May, it suddenly exceeded eight thousand meters and came to counterattack. In terms of aircraft, especially fighter aircraft, altitude is speed and power. When higher than the enemy, in addition to being able to use formations to control the attack, one can also decisively end the battle with one strike. Furthermore, it is easy to implement dispersed pursuit. Conversely, if lower than the enemy, one must first evade the enemy's attack to reverse the unfavorable position, otherwise, one cannot gain control of the battle.

### Efforts in High-Altitude Combat

Therefore, both sides are very concerned and are working hard on high-altitude combat, competing with each other for altitude. The air combat after the rainy season last year was very different from before the rainy season. Britain has prepared new, high-altitude performance, excellent aircraft to replace the old Hurricane aircraft, while the United States has strengthened its P-51 aircraft. Since the aerial battles on the Arakan front at the end of last year, as well as in the air offensives in Calcutta, Dum Dum, and other places, the dogfights between the fighters of both sides have mostly taken place at an altitude of eight to nine thousand meters. Of course, this is not enough to defeat the Japanese Hayabusa fighter, which has excellent aerial performance and pilots, but the high-altitude performance of the enemy aircraft is not to be taken lightly. Leaving aside the threat of anti-aircraft guns, because the high-altitude performance of fighter aircraft has reached this level, the bombing altitude of bombers has also increased accordingly. For example, the bombing by the American Consolidated B-24, compared to before the rainy season last year, is usually at an altitude of one to three thousand meters higher. The Consolidated B-24 and other aircraft that intrude over Rangoon during the day, although their bodies are extremely large, their flying altitude is rare even among fighter aircraft.

It is said that the enemy has unveiled the B-29 (Boeing) superbomber, which they have boasted is a stratospheric bomber. The altitude of air raids is increasing day by day. The altitude and speed of reconnaissance aircraft are of the greatest concern to both sides. Aircraft such as the British Mosquito have been intruding into the Rangoon area at an altitude of nine to ten thousand meters.

In this way, the air battle on the Burmese front has now broken into the stage of high-altitude combat, becoming an essential requirement for achieving victory.

### Enemy Emphasizes Night Raids

Another noteworthy point is that recent enemy aircraft attacks have been mainly at night. After the rainy season last year, the enemy, who had been clamoring to counterattack Burma from the air, gradually conducted large-scale air raids on Burma from October to November. Each time, they suffered great losses due to the strong Japanese defenses. On December 1, a dozen Consolidated B-24 bombers, escorted by P-51 fighters, were shot down entirely over Rangoon. After this, the daytime sorties of bombers were suspended. Seeing that the Japanese defenses were tight during the day, the enemy changed tactics and attempted to achieve their goals by attacking at night. The scale is quite small, with each raid involving only a dozen aircraft. However, their intentions and tactics have forced the Japanese to pay greater attention to both offense and defense in night air raids.

At night, due to the difficulties of navigation, the inconvenience of finding targets, and the methods of attack, there are various natural restrictions, but these restrictions also apply to the defenders. Moreover, conversely, the difficulties of navigating at night make it difficult to counterattack, which is an excellent condition for enemy air raids. With the development of weather forecasting and radio navigation, as well as the development of lighting and aiming equipment, if they undergo rigorous training, they may be able to exert more power at night than during the day.

### Special Yuan System Abolished in North and Central China

Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Special Yuan settlement system in North and Central China, which has been implemented since the freezing of assets in July of the 30th year of the Republic, has exerted a special function in transactions and settlements between the two regions.

### Goebbels' Speech Reveals Belief in Inevitable Victory; Self-Reliance Sufficient to Overcome Crisis

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the National Socialist Party's local leaders on the 1st, revealing Germany's confidence in overcoming the crisis. The main points are as follows: Although we have achieved victory in this war, we have also experienced failures. Our National Socialist Party members often grow in difficulty, so they are more capable of overcoming difficult times. When the leader and his comrades did not deviate from this fundamental idea, they adhered to the final goal in all developments and battles of [inaudible], and adhered to the final goal, which is especially important in the crisis. In the war for our right to survive, we only seek victory. We must not forget that we have broken through the enemy's encirclement in 1939. The war in the east is only part of the world war, so the development of the eastern front has become [inaudible]. To judge correctly, it can only be linked to other operations. Regarding the possible development of Western Europe, we will control the situation with effective methods. The people are heavily responsible for the air war, but the Anglo-American air raids have not been able to help German arms production. Not only is the capital united, but the whole country is also united to deal with the enemy's terror and overcome the many difficulties of wartime.

### Retention and Exemption of Gauze and Cloth, Acceptance of Requests Ceases to Facilitate Statistical Processing and Prompt Conclusion

Entrusted by the government to handle the purchase of gauze and cloth in this city, the National Commercial Control Association previously received numerous objections and requests for corrections regarding the originally approved retention amounts and exempted items, accumulating thousands of cases. After submitting the approved standards to the government, a committee was established to re-examine them day and night, which has recently been completed successively.

Director Zhang of the association personally came to give a speech amidst his busy schedule, titled "The Thrift of Medicine." The main points of his broadcast are recorded as follows:

Reduce Disease and Save Medicine

"In life, in addition to the four major elements of clothing, food, housing, and transportation that need to be saved, there is also medicine that needs to be saved. The expenses for clothing, food, housing, and transportation can still be budgeted, but not for medicine. As the saying goes, people have unpredictable fortune and misfortune every day. The amount of expenses is unpredictable, and its consumption is also unlimited. Currently, the price of medicine is very high. It is difficult to guarantee that one will not get sick in their lifetime. It is really necessary to save medicine. Therefore, we need to strive not to get sick and reduce diseases as much as possible. There are many ways to reduce diseases. The most important thing is to pay attention to daily life. Food should be moderate, and clothing does not need to be elaborate. Add clothes when it is cold, reduce clothes when it is hot, get up early and go to bed early, and exercise the body often. Then diseases can be reduced naturally. Serious diseases become lighter, and major diseases turn into minor illnesses. If you unfortunately get sick, you must not be afraid in your heart. Strive to calm down. If you panic too much, delay seeing a doctor and taking medicine, the loss will be huge, then minor illnesses will become major illnesses, and light illnesses will turn into serious ones.

Indiscriminate Use of Tonics is of No Practical Benefit

Finally, I advise citizens not to indiscriminately take tonics. We often see people who take tonics eat less and become lazy. Tonics only supplement a part of physiology but do not help in practice. Moreover, they are expensive and can be saved as much as possible. According to the current consumption of tonics, it is a waste for the rich, and it affects the lives of the poor even more. Some people think that drug stores will lose money and doctors will have no business. But we are willing to do so, and we hope that our compatriots will pay attention to their health, save on medical expenses, and build a strong East Asian nation."

### Mr. Zhang Yuwen Entrusted to Handle Special Scholarship Funds

Mr. Zhang Yuwen, the manager of the Southeast Tobacco Company, entrusted this newspaper to handle special scholarship funds and donated 30,700 yuan to select 18 students above the high school level. We deeply admire his cultivation of talents. Furthermore, the donations received from all walks of life yesterday were also very enthusiastic. We would like to express our gratitude to the impoverished students on their behalf.

Short Comment

### Contribution to the Aircraft Donation Movement Committee

The Shanghai Municipal Public Aircraft Donation Movement Committee has been promoting and advancing the work with all its might since it was launched, which is admirable.

The significance of the aircraft donation movement has been understood by all citizens and will not be explained further. However, we look forward to achieving even more satisfactory results from this movement and offer some humble opinions:

It is remembered that before 1937, the government also launched a similar movement and received a broad response from the people. However, the results were that the personnel of the handling agencies were not sound, and the amount and use of donations were not made public, causing general controversy. We hope that the authorities handling this matter will pay special attention to this point and disclose the amount of various donations raised, various expenses, and methods of safekeeping at any time, such as charity performances of Peking opera and musical food, etc., to show great credibility. We believe that publishing income and expenses will not only demonstrate credibility but also promote the righteous deeds of donors and the enthusiastic emotions of donors, thereby arousing widespread recognition from society. We are confident that the responsible authorities will adopt this intention.

### Supervising Intra-Industry Trading Associations Strictly Enforce Scheduled Delivery of Goods Upon Completion of Transactions

Industry associations have recently received orders from the authorities to prevent speculators from creating trouble, and strict regulations have been established for intra-industry trading: Industries should abide by laws and regulations and must not use other companies' trademarks or brands. Customers must issue order forms when placing orders, indicating the name of the goods, price, quantity, and delivery date. Intra-industry transactions must issue a transaction order, with each of the buying and selling parties holding one copy, and another copy submitted to the market management committee or industry association for reference. Goods from completed transactions must be delivered and paid for on schedule and must not be deliberately delayed. Incoming goods from the trade must be distributed to the medium-sized parties in the market within one month. Incoming goods from the medium-sized parties should be displayed in the retail department for people to choose and buy, but they must absolutely not exceed the legal profit margin, etc.

### Financial and Industrial Commerce, Market Conditions are Stable

Financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai are generally stable. The interest rate is stationary, and the call loan interest rate has not changed. Stock prices have turned from falling to rising gradually. Although the money market is still tight, the Central Reserve Bank supplies as much as possible to legitimate industrial and commercial needs. Therefore, financial personnel are using funds in an exceptionally flexible manner. The black market of the ratio between the Joint Reserve Notes and the Central Reserve Notes, which was created by speculative merchants last week, has been gradually eliminated since the Central Reserve Bank designated eleven Sino-Japanese commercial banks to handle the exchange of the Joint Reserve Notes of North China. As for various industrial and commercial sectors, the circulation of funds is lively because the authorities supply as much as possible for legitimate needs. In particular, the relevant authorities have been preventing the activities of speculative industrial and commercial people and strictly cracking down on hoarding, which has caused hoarders to continuously sell off hoarded goods. Both wholesale and retail market prices of various daily necessities have gradually declined. Therefore, market conditions are trending towards normal, it is said.

### The Timber Industry Association Regulates the Scope of Business Operations for Fellow Traders

The Shanghai Special Municipal Timber Industry Association has now officially started operations and has strictly stipulated that the various goods operated by fellow traders are: Domestic construction wood, pillow wood, Guangzhou wood, West book, Ou wood, Hangzhou wood, miscellaneous trees and miscellaneous wood, and wood from Japan, Europe, and the United States, as well as various new and old wooden plant boards made in China and foreign countries.
