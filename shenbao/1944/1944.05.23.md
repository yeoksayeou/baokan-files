### Work as Leisure

Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors are gradually stagnating due to various factors such as raw material shortages, power limitations, and inconvenient transportation. This stagnation is causing many people to be idle, a phenomenon that should not occur under a wartime system. The suspension of business and people not working represent a loss of national strength. Shanghai is unknowingly losing national strength in this way, although it may only be a temporary phenomenon. The political and economic adjustments in Shanghai will surely transform it into a complete wartime city, like wartime Japan. All industrial and commercial endeavors that benefit national war efforts are expanded to the fullest extent, production quantities are increased to the highest limits, and every citizen capable of working has a job. Even women and children have appropriate duties. If this can be achieved, then Shanghai will truly be worthy of being the center of gravity of the nation's society and a model area for the nation's politics and economy. Transforming from a free, permissive, and leisurely society into a disciplined, striving, and industrious one requires the redoubled attention and effort of Shanghai residents, both in and out of government. The sooner Shanghai adjusts, the sooner Shanghai becomes a successful wartime metropolis, the sooner China's national strength will increase, and the sooner victory in the war will be achieved. The loss to the nation due to the people's idleness must be addressed using national political power. However, the people's idleness is also a loss to the people themselves, and the result of idleness can lead to many unfortunate evils. In recent months, various industries in Shanghai have shown signs of decline, yet the atmosphere of feasting and gambling among Shanghai residents is increasing daily. The packed entertainment venues are a clear demonstration of this. Such consumption of spirit, money, and time is simply a form of slow suicide for the people. The majority of Shanghai residents are destroying themselves, and the ultimate result for Shanghai will be annihilation, truly ruining oneself, ruining society, and ruining the nation. There are many reasons for the psychology of enjoyment, the most common being "passing the time." We do not oppose entertainment, and even more so, we do not oppose leisure. However, the only prerequisite is that there must first be work, and secondly, entertainment to restore energy. Leisure after work is true leisure, and entertainment to restore energy is legitimate entertainment. Anything that does not meet these principles is neither leisure nor entertainment. A good citizen must first have work. After work, one engages in entertainment. The purpose of entertainment is to restore energy in preparation for continued work in the future. These are the most basic conditions for being a good citizen, and Shanghai residents, who serve as a national example, should remember them well. When there is no work for you to do in society, wouldn't you find your own work to do? If you can play mahjong all day, at least you have the time. If you can eat, drink, and feast all day, at least you have the money. Won't people with time and money use their time and money to do some beneficial work, instead of letting it be consumed invisibly in self-destruction? Work doesn't fall from the sky; work must be found. Look around. How many suffering children, out-of-school boys and girls, and disabled compatriots are there in society? People with time and money can at least dedicate a portion of their time and money to engage in this kind of social welfare work. Existing welfare organizations can help, and new endeavors can be established by gathering many like-minded people. If you're not interested in social work, you can think about how many books you wanted to read in the past but couldn't because you were too busy. Now that you're idle, you can read those books. If you're not interested in reading, you can think about how your business has stagnated. You might as well gather friends and discuss the reasons for this, and find ways to remedy it in the wartime environment. What are the alternative raw materials? What are the alternative power sources? These are all work, and this work is beneficial to both yourself and others. If you achieve significant results through this kind of work, your joy will certainly be much more flavorful than gambling and entertainment. This is the most profound meaning of our advocacy for using work as leisure.

### Fierce Interception Battle Unfolds in Two-Day Air Raid on Nansei Islands: Japanese Forces Shoot Down a Total of Thirty-Two Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on May 22nd: On May 20th, an enemy mobile unit appeared in the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands. Over the two days of the 20th and 21st, it launched an air raid on Minami Iwo Jima. The garrisoned Japanese forces intercepted the enemy, shooting down thirty-two enemy aircraft. The losses of ground Japanese forces were minimal.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – An enemy mobile unit, under severe surveillance by Japanese forces, which was conducting operations in the Marshall Islands area, suddenly appeared in the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands. Over the two days of the 20th and 21st, it repeatedly launched air raids on Japanese Minami Tori Shima. The air raid on the 20th involved ninety-four enemy carrier-based fighters. After 9:00 AM, they launched repeated attacks five times. However, the Japanese land and naval forces in the area were fully prepared. Therefore, as soon as the enemy aircraft appeared, they launched a fierce interception battle, shooting down twenty-three enemy aircraft (five of which were unconfirmed). In addition, many other aircraft appeared to have been hit and crashed immediately. The enemy used aircraft, submarines, and destroyers to search for or rescue the pilots of these enemy aircraft. Japanese forces also attacked these enemy vessels. One enemy submarine that surfaced was subjected to two fierce attacks by Japanese forces, and the shells hit directly. The submarine was sunk. On the 21st, approximately thirty enemy aircraft attacked twice from 4:30 AM to 6:30 AM. Due to the damage inflicted on the previous day, they launched high-altitude attacks. However, nine more aircraft were shot down by Japanese forces. The Japanese side sustained very light losses in the two days of combat.

### Japanese Military Reporting Department Elaborates on Recent Henan Battle Situation: Luoyang Already Encircled

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese military reporting department, in order to elaborate on the recent Henan battle situation, met with Chinese news reporters at the Japanese Press Club yesterday (21st) at 4:00 PM. Major Shimada announced the battle situation as follows: The Luoyang area is defended by the troops of Tang Enbo's First War Area, which is directly under the Chongqing government. A portion of these troops are stationed along the Xin-Old Yellow River, known as the River Defense Army. In that area, there are two lines of defense. The first line of defense is in Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Sishui, Xinzheng, and other places. The second line of defense is in Dengfeng, Yuxian, Xiangcheng, Linru, and other places. On April 18th, Japanese forces, after crossing the Xin-Old Yellow River from Zhongmou and the Yellow River Railway Bridge, occupied Zhengzhou and other places. Afterwards, they advanced on Luoyang in three routes. The first route advanced from the south end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge, attacking Sishui, Rongyang, and other places. The second route passed through Mixian and Dengfeng, southwest of Zhengzhou. The third route advanced from Xuchang through Xiangcheng and Linru. During the advance, Tang Enbo immediately mobilized several of his units in Yiyang, attempting to reinforce Luoyang. However, Japanese forces, before his preparations were complete, launched a fierce attack, catching him off guard and successively occupying Xuchang and other cities. The Japanese forces in the Xinyang area also simultaneously began a fierce northward attack on May 1st. On May 9th, they joined forces with the Japanese forces that had occupied Xuchang, attacking southward in Queshan. As a result, Tang Enbo's troops faced difficulties in maneuvering, and the command system could not be unified. They scattered and fled to the southwest area. Therefore, the Japanese forces, in addition to using a small force to clear out the remnants, used a portion of their forces to directly attack Luoyang. Currently, Luoyang is already encircled. Its capture is only a matter of time. The troops of Tang Enbo, known for their combat prowess, were unable to withstand a single blow from our Japanese forces, which was beyond our expectations.

### Key Figures from North China and Japan Hold Cordial Meeting

Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The North China Political Affairs Commission's Advisory Conference concluded on the 20th.

### Vice Minister Wang of the Ministry of Construction Meets with Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Explains Adjustments to Shipping and Other Matters

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Wang Jiajun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction, met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital on the 22nd to explain the intentions behind the recent adjustments to shipping restrictions in Central China, increases in railway fares, and increases in domestic postal rates. A record of the explanations is as follows: (A) Plans to Ensure Smooth Shipping: In order to ensure smooth shipping, the following points are being planned and implemented after discussions with the Allied maritime and military authorities regarding revisions to the shipping control regulations. Transportation will be smoother, and the supply and demand of materials can be matched accordingly. Attention will be paid to textiles to flatten prices and eliminate the black market. Obstacles to shipping will be eliminated, such as illegal inspections along the way, detention of ships, and arbitrary extortion. Smuggling will be prevented, and the supply of materials to the enemy will be prohibited. Security along the way will be ensured, with assistance requested from the Allies. (B) Revision of Central China Railway Freight Rates: The Central China Railway has reported that its expenditures have soared and revenues are insufficient to cover expenses. It has requested adjustments to freight and passenger ticket prices. Upon verifying the claims, it was determined that they were factual. After forwarding the request to the Executive Yuan for review and receiving approval, the company was instructed to implement the adjustments. (C) Stabilizing Postal Finances: The postal finances have been affected by the war in recent years, with revenues sharply declining and expenditures rising sharply. Revenue and expenditure are unbalanced, and the only way to supplement the shortfall is through bank overdrafts. The collapse of postal finances is a cause for concern. In order to remedy this situation, it is necessary to increase domestic and foreign postal rates and exchange fees. The Executive Yuan approved an increase of 200%, which will be implemented from the 16th of this month. Although the current postal rate increase is sixty times higher than before the incident, it is still low compared to the general increase rate of commodities. The Ministry will also thoroughly rectify the postal bureau to save on unnecessary expenses. Central Government Holds Weekly Meeting.

### Chongqing and the Communists Reach Superficial Compromise to Ease British and American Criticism, But Friction Is Actually Intensifying

Central News Agency Report: Regarding the Chongqing and Communist friction and disputes, the situation has become increasingly serious since last year. Although both sides have nominally expressed compromise recently, the future is fraught with hidden reefs, making cooperation difficult. This Chongqing-Communist compromise is actually a move by the Chongqing government to ease attacks from Britain and America. Secondly, it is due to Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing. Wallace's purpose in visiting Chongqing is to observe the current situation in Chongqing. In order to cover up domestic scandals, the Chongqing government is feigning goodwill towards the Communists. According to reliable sources, the details are recorded as follows:

Wallace's Mission: The US Vice President will travel to Chongqing from the US this month. When Wallace was in Washington, he hosted a banquet for Wei Daoming, Shi Zhiji, and other influential figures related to Chongqing who were stationed in the US. Wallace's mission is related to the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, so that he can inquire about the details from all parties after arriving in Chongqing. Our observation of this mission includes: US aid to Chongqing has been delayed for various reasons, causing Chongqing to express deep dissatisfaction. Therefore, in order to ease Chongqing's anxiety, he will give perfunctory answers. The issue of revising the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chongqing legal tender. The Chongqing government wants to establish a democratic political system and strengthen its power. In other words, Wallace's mission is nothing more than to observe the internal situation and strength of Chongqing. The Chongqing side was greatly worried when it received the news that Wallace was about to visit, because it was aware of its own internal weaknesses and feared that it would have a negative impact. Therefore, it was anxious to cover up this secret. According to the Chongqing side, the reason for the Chongqing army's defeat in the recent Japanese military operation in Henan was that the US did not provide the greatest assistance. Therefore, it has repeatedly requested the US to actively provide assistance. As a result, this trip had to offer strong perfunctory answers. The second is the US-Chongqing exchange rate. In the past, one US dollar was converted to twenty Chongqing legal tender, but the black market exchange rate is much higher, which has a great impact on the Chongqing legal tender and a great blow to the Chongqing financial system. Therefore, after Wallace arrives in Chongqing, he will find a way to revise the exchange rate. In addition, British and American public opinion has recently criticized the Chongqing side for adopting a dictatorship instead of a democratic political system, and the attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. Therefore, from an objective standpoint, the recent Chongqing-Communist compromise is to respond to attacks from British and American public opinion.

Differences Have Already Arisen: Regarding the Chongqing-Communist compromise, on the 2nd of this month, Communist representative Lin Zuhan, commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and Chongqing government representative Wang Shijie reached a compromise in Xi'an. Ten days later, Lin immediately left Xi'an for Chongqing, which shows that the Chongqing side has made the smallest concessions to the Communists. The Chongqing side is nominally compromising this time, but in reality, it is unwilling to allow the existence of small parties, that is, it is unwilling to allow the existence of the Communist Party. Now, in order to ease the close attention and attacks of Britain and the United States, it seems to be using its power to win over all parties and factions. In the past, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists has shown signs of compromise whenever the situation became tense. Therefore, it has now been proven that Chongqing is in a time of crisis. When the Chongqing 11th Plenary Session began last year, it advocated resolving the Chongqing-Communist issue politically. The Communist Party's attitude was to agree in principle, but it demanded the implementation of a democratic political system to ensure that safety was no longer hindered. At the same time, the Chongqing Kuomintang demanded that the Communist Party fulfill the four conditions stipulated on September 22, 1937: Implement the Three People's Principles. Reorganize the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army into the Central Army. Abolish the border region government. Abandon the red ideology. The Communist Party initially stated that it had been implemented, but it also made demands on the Chongqing side, including: Open up party bans and recognize the legal status of all parties. Recognize the border region government and the national border base as its base. Provide logistical support for all rear areas of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Restore the designations of the New Fourth Army. Abolish the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the blockade and encirclement of various bases. Guarantee democratic freedoms. Guarantee people's freedom of residence, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech. Demand the implementation of local autonomy. However, it was quite difficult for the Chongqing side to take action. As a result, Chongqing and the Communists launched offensive propaganda again. The Chongqing side said that the Communist Party did not provide any assistance in the great defeat in Henan and did not cooperate with the Central Army, accusing the Communist Party of lacking patriotism. The Communist Party's response was that the Chongqing side surrounded the Communist army in the border region with its military force, causing the Japanese army to defeat them. This shows that differences have arisen in the Chongqing-Communist compromise, and internal friction is intensifying. Its future is self-evident.

### Ambassador Chen Returns to Post

Xinjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Chen Jicheng, our ambassador to Manchukuo, returned to his post on the 21st. He stated: After returning to the country in mid-March and arriving in Beijing, I reported to the central government and participated in the National Government's fourth anniversary celebration. Ambassadors Gu and Lu, as well as people from all walks of life, hosted banquets for me. In the two months that followed, I gave lectures at the invitation of various places in the country on the construction situation in your country in recent years. Since China entered the second year of its participation in the war, there has been considerable progress in various decisive political measures. The focus of the National Government's policy this year is on three items: "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production." Increasing production is the National Government's top priority. Therefore, since January this year, the National Government has successively held national economic conferences and agricultural production increase conferences in various provinces and cities across the country. Officials and civilians are working together to increase production in order to cooperate in the war and complete the great cause of invigorating China and protecting Asia.

### Minister Tajiri Expresses Impressions of Inspecting Manchuria

Xinjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After arriving in Manchuria on the 16th, Minister Tajiri, stationed in the Philippines, inspected Xinjing, Jilin, Anshan, Fengtian, Fushun, and other places. He has now completed his inspection and returned to Xinjing on the 21st. He departed for home on the morning of the 22nd. Before his departure, he expressed his impressions of inspecting Manchuria as follows: It has been many years since I last visited Manchuria. This time, I have witnessed remarkable progress in everything. I am very pleased. To complete the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria's mission will become increasingly important.

### Overseas Guangdong and Indian Residents Hold Anti-British Meeting

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – To strengthen the will to achieve independence and to pray for the brave fighting of compatriots on the front lines, overseas Indian residents in Guangzhou held a meeting of Indian residents on the 21st. Under the atmosphere of vowing to oppose Britain, they unanimously voted for independence and resolved to publish a document stating that overseas Indian residents in Guangzhou are responsible for their respective tasks. Under the guidance of Bose, the leader of the Indian independence movement, and with the assistance of the Japanese army, they vowed to fight to the last person for independent survival.

### Post-War Southern Transportation Will Still Focus on Maritime Transport: Mr. Yuuzaki Toshio Expresses His Views

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Yuuzaki Toshio, an authority in the Japanese shipping industry, met with reporters from our agency on the 22nd and asserted that future transportation between Japan and the South will still focus on maritime transport. The main points are as follows: After the war, railways and aviation will also be quite important for transportation to the South, but the main mode of transport will still be maritime transport. Large ships are not particularly necessary. What is necessary are medium-sized ships that connect Southeast Asia with Central China, North China, and Korea, and small ships that connect various parts of Southeast Asia with South China. Therefore, Japanese industry must also develop towards western Japan and various parts of Southeast Asia. It is necessary to industrialize the southern cities of Kyushu, to industrialize the entire of Taiwan, and to industrialize major cities in Southeast Asia such as Singapore and Java. After industrializing various parts of Southeast Asia, ship will be able to save, Japanese should first develop light industry in Southeast Asia, gradually progressing to heavy industry. At the same time, maritime transport will be extremely developed. Japan should use 80% of its maritime transport capacity to engage in maritime transport in East Asia. The Europe-Asia route and the Asia-America route, the round-the-world route, will also exist. Ships on those routes should only account for 20% of the ships on the Greater East Asia route. In short, after the war, Japan should have 20 million tons of ship. In principle, should be the responsibility of shipping companies to operate. In addition to expanding the number of ships, each company can also operate large maritime aircraft.

### Heavy Showers Frequent on the Indian Frontline, Fierce Fighting on the Central and Northern Routes: Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Attacks to Crush Enemy Attempts to Lift Siege

Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Heavy showers are frequent on the Indian Frontline as the rainy season approaches. Japanese forces are launching fierce attacks daily with Imphal as their target. Enemy forces on the Imphal front believe that the Japanese supply volume will decrease during the rainy season, and their striking power will also weaken. They have launched fierce attacks towards Kohima with a strong mechanized unit as the backbone, attempting to break through the Kohima-Imphal road and lift the heavy siege on the Imphal Plain. Conversely, the Japanese forces moving north are fiercely attacking the enemy forces on the Palel front, achieving significant results. The enemy's Fourth Army is also doing its utmost to defend that area. Tanks and armored vehicles are being sent south from Imphal in succession. The Japanese forces are intercepting them at a certain location, engaging in fierce tank battles on the banks of the Iril River. The battle is currently raging. A summary of the battle situation in that area is as follows: In the Kohima area, the Japanese forces are gathering forces from the Dimapur area to counter the enemy's stubborn counterattacks, engaging in fierce battles in the Narhema-Zubza area. The Japanese are also cooperating, continuously bombing enemy artillery positions in that area, and are still attacking the choke point of the Kohima-Imphal road. Enemy paratroopers have landed in northern Burma, attempting to maintain areas behind the Japanese forces. They are currently surrounded by Japanese forces. The enemy forces have constructed fortifications in the Mawlu area, resisting stubbornly. Since the 8th, they have been unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese forces and have abandoned the Mawlu fortifications, retreating towards the eastern shore of Lake Indawgyi. In the Nujiang area, the Yunnan Army, advancing towards the eastern shore of the Nujiang, has crossed the Nujiang in several places since the 11th, attacking towards Tengyue. The Japanese forces in the Nujiang area are intercepting them, inflicting heavy losses. The Japanese forces engaged the 115th Regiment of the Yunnan New 39th Division 23 kilometers east of Tengyue, repelling them and achieving great results. Because enemy air forces are still mainly carrying out harassment operations around Dimapur and Imphal, preventing the advance of the Japanese forces, and recently, enemy air forces in the northern general area have also been unusually active, providing material assistance to the Yunnan Army in the Nujiang area. In response, the Japanese air force is cooperating, attacking ground units in Imphal, bombing enemy paratrooper flight bases and their air force bases, destroying the Sazub enemy airfield and other important facilities, and severely damaging enemy gliders, transport planes, and ammunition depots on the ground. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been crushed. Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the enemy army's retreat route from Ukhrul was cut off, it continued to retreat towards Imphal. On the morning of the 16th, it gathered a force of approximately 1,000 men, under the cover of more than a dozen tanks, and launched a fierce counterattack near Hill 3913, four kilometers east of Sengmai, and Hill 5417 in Meitrakhong and Chittakong, behind the Japanese fortifications, along the Ukhrul River. The counterattack was repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy army is trying its best to seize the retreat route from Ukhrul, and counterattacks in that area will become increasingly fierce in the future. However, the elite Japanese forces are firmly defending and are fully prepared.

### Burma Strengthens Anti-Espionage Measures

Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The continuous advances of the Japanese-Indian allied forces have caused the British and American forces defending India to feel extremely anxious. Paratroopers have been dropped into Burmese territory to conduct propaganda activities, claiming that wells and reservoirs have been poisoned, threatening residents, and causing Burmese people to be terrified. In order to counter such schemes by the British and Americans, the Burmese government has decided to strengthen anti-espionage measures. Recently, Bhamo, in the name of the Director of the National Service Bureau, issued a circular to local district and county administrative bureaus, stipulating that members of the National Service Corps in each area will be the center of the people's anti-espionage teams, and must maintain close contact with the police station and the Japanese and Indian armies, taking the lead in assuming the important responsibility of defending the country. Bhamo also said that the government has ordered National Service Corps members in various areas to make efforts to arrest spies who have infiltrated the country to engage in activities, and at the same time ordered each Corps member to do their best to defend and eliminate elements that threaten the people. Desperate after defeat, the enemy sent spies to infiltrate the country, carrying out despicable acts such as spreading in wells and reservoirs. The people of Burma absolutely cannot tolerate such inhumane measures.

### Mr. Oka, Chief of Information, Discusses the Second Front

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, Director of the Public Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Acting Director of the Third Department of the Information Bureau, met with a group of reporters on the 22nd. He addressed the issue of the so-called "second front" that the enemy is rumored to be preparing to open, criticizing their scheme. The main points are as follows:

England and America frequently publicize the imminent opening of a second front, but this has no value whatsoever. The enemy has always considered this to be a masterful stroke. Although the enemy has made considerable preparations for opening a second front, the date of its realization remains unclear. America's insincere attitude of preparation is also a mystery. German intelligence indicates that England has concentrated fifty divisions of troops in southern England, and there are more than twenty divisions in Scotland and other areas, but this force alone is insufficient to launch a landing operation in Western Europe. England and America are currently focusing all their efforts on the Southern Italy front, with their main attack force positioned on the Italian line. This may be the reason why the second front has been delayed.

A meeting was held in London on the 16th, rumored to have resulted in the establishment of a political agreement between Belgium, the Netherlands, and other governments-in-exile, as well as England, America, and the Soviet Union. The spheres of influence of the anti-Axis countries in Europe have been largely determined. This agreement largely follows the Soviet Union's proposals, with England and America ceding all rights and interests in the Balkans and Northern Europe to the Soviet Union. Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Italy are placed under the sphere of influence of England and America, who can dispose of others' territories at will, which is inherently unreasonable. Based on this, the relationship between England and America is easily understood.

The establishment of this agreement can be seen as a byproduct of the Soviet Union's forceful urging to open a second front. Whether it can satisfy the Soviet Union's desires in the future, and whether the Soviet Union will continue to urge for a second front in the same way, deserves close attention. England and America know that even repeated defeats in air combat are not fatal, but a failed landing would be. We observe that the so-called Western European landing operation does not match its name in reality. Although they exaggerate their propaganda, they may not have the determination to take the risk.

### US Air Force Raids, Nearly Eighty Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German News Agency reports military news: Yesterday, 120 American aircraft invaded German territory, of which 38 fighter planes were shot down. In addition, British aircraft attacked the Rhine region in northwestern Germany last night, and 11 were shot down.

### Smuts Reveals Invasion of Europe Plan; Scale Will Be Unprecedented

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a London dispatch: South African Prime Minister Smuts delivered a speech on the current war situation at a ceremony for freemen in Birmingham on the 19th, stating:

The attack on Hitler's European fortress will be carried out by the Soviet army from the east, and by the British and American armies from the south, that is, from the Mediterranean and Atlantic fronts, as well as the west, launching a three-pronged attack. The Western offensive is also considered the second front, but it is actually the third front. This war is the largest offensive in history. A major continental operation will soon be launched. This continental war has been long awaited, and its scale will be enormous and of utmost importance.

England and America Stake Everything

Bern, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Swiss German News newspaper comments that as the world eagerly awaits the anti-Axis powers to launch an invasion of Europe, Dr. Goebbels once said that the anti-Axis powers hope that the German army will shorten its lines, just as in November 1918, followed by a military collapse, and then a domestic political collapse. Now the anti-Axis powers must also admit that Germany's political and economic power has not been shaken at all. The Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences failed to find a way for the anti-Axis powers to respond to the current situation. They were forced to decide to invade Europe, hoping to stake everything on one throw, but the enemy will undoubtedly suffer great losses, such as in Dunkirk and the Dnieper River campaigns.

Vast Manpower and Material Resources Required

The London Daily Worker newspaper claims that the relatively small-scale landing operation in North Africa required two million tons of shipping space, or 550 ships each of 4,000 tons. If a large-scale invasion of Europe is to be launched with one million men or sixty divisions, the shipping space required would be at least three times that of North Africa. According to American military expert Major Eliot, about eighty divisions of troops are needed to have any hope of success in Europe. Even more unacceptably, this shipping space is not only needed temporarily, but must be constantly increased to supply military needs. According to an American official from the Second Front Chief of Staff, the preparations for the second front and its first phase will be largely carried out by the British and American air forces. In other words, in the weeks before the battle, the future landing sites and defense fortifications will be constantly bombed. According to British assessments, the current air raids are a prelude to the invasion of Europe.

Prepared and Calm: Germany Remains Calm

According to Dr. Goebbels, the German response is not only partially prepared but has already taken effect. Although Moscow is urging them intensely, the anti-Axis powers are hesitant about launching a large-scale invasion of Europe. The reason for this is understandable because once a war starts, it cannot be easily stopped. The anti-Axis powers are struggling to act rashly. German weapons and secret fortifications are well known to the public, and Germany controls a favorable situation. British and American authorities have repeatedly retreated, unwilling to take this final step, because the invasion of Europe is a desperate gamble. The delay only demonstrates the weakness of the British and American position, as Dr. Goebbels said. The Germans look forward with full calmness and hope.

### Fierce Battles in Three Focal Points of Defense in Southern Italy

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces on the Southern Italian front halted their operations again on Saturday and Sunday morning, probably due to the heavy losses suffered in recent days, requiring time to reorganize their troops. After half a day, General Alexander's troops began another large-scale offensive with infantry and tank forces, focusing on three areas: near Fondi along the coastal highway, near Pico and Pontecorvo, and near Peidimonte. The American forces are having difficulty advancing in the coastal area because the German army laid many mines when they withdrew from Itri and Gaeta. The fighting was most intense near Pico and Pontecorvo, with both armies advancing and retreating last week. The positions gained by the enemy were mostly recaptured by German counterattacks.

### Special Issue on Allied Japan Navy Day, No. 3

Reverence for the Imperial Decree

Diligently striving in accordance with the Imperial Decree, possessing abundant strength to seize opportunities, and forever fulfilling the great mission of the nation.

Enjoying the Path of Divine Protection

The existence of divine protection is certain, but it cannot be obtained carelessly.

Divine protection is a reflection of utmost sincerity. Therefore, one should reflect, and unrealized achievements are due to insufficient sincerity. By further cultivating sincerity, "Heaven will surely be with justice, and the gods will surely be moved by sincerity." This is the reason.

Honesty is the Final Victory, Believe It

Although this is true for everyone, young people who are about to stand up for the nation must especially believe it. Even if others mock you for being foolish and laugh at you for being stupid, the final victory will surely belong to the honest. This is because honesty is the natural order of things.

Filial Piety is the Foundation of All Virtues

Filial piety is the foundation of all virtues, and no matter how times change, this is an unchanging truth. Filial piety originates from the most sincere feelings of love and remembrance for one's parents. Therefore, without filial piety, loyalty, integrity, and trustworthiness cannot originate from sincere intentions. Inevitably, everything will lack authenticity, and even if one gains temporary luck, one will eventually fail. When we observe people, we often consider their way of treating their parents as the best indicator.

Dignity is a Natural Manifestation of Personality

True dignity emanates from personality. With the cultivation of character, dignity will naturally arise. Therefore, affectation is not the right way. It must be remembered that dignity cannot be created through pretense; it is naturally felt by others.

Merely Playing with Small Talents Will Lead to Misfortune

Sloth can also be called the disease of the talented. Those who are considered talented often think that they can accomplish things at any time, so why rush? Consequently, they become lazy in everything. However, time waits for no one, and things progress rapidly. In their arrogance, they unconsciously become outcasts of the world. By the time they realize this, they are no longer worthy of respect. Therefore, the primary principle for us to conduct ourselves in the world is to not rely on cleverness, but to handle affairs earnestly.

(Note: The term "talented" here refers to people with intelligence and ability.)

Do Not Confuse Bravery with Recklessness

Nothing is worse than the likes of an ignorant person.

Do Not Abandon Righteousness Because of Personal Feelings

The way to conduct oneself in the world lies in upholding righteousness and fulfilling one's duties. This is simple, but also extremely difficult and most important. If everyone practices it, there will be no mistakes.

Know Evil and Not Tolerate It.

To condone evil, or to intentionally distort the good because of the person involved, is not an attitude we should have. The world often sees people harboring resentment and jealousy, which is undesirable. To slander as evil what one has always disliked, even if it is good; or to not condemn as evil what one often pleases, even if it is evil, are both wrong. Even if one does not like a person, one must praise them if they act righteously, otherwise it is wrong.

Do Not Take Profit as Profit; Take Righteousness as Profit

There is a saying that one should take righteousness as profit. If one takes righteousness as profit, there will be no troubles. Today, there is endless turmoil because people take profit as profit.

Considerations

It must be remembered that our every action immediately affects the character of the Imperial Nation. Therefore, we should be cautious in our actions, and when the time comes to act, we should do so decisively without hesitation. By doing so, we can demonstrate the awakening of the Japanese people of the Imperial Nation and have no regrets.

The Necessity of Preparatory Strength

The necessity of preparatory strength applies not only to the nation but also to individuals. For example, if one has ten units of strength and uses six or seven, using the remaining strength as preparation, one will make fewer mistakes and complete tasks successfully. If one merely seeks quick success and fame, making unrealistic demands and using all ten units of strength, one will only create self-inflicted troubles and ultimately fail. This must be remembered.

### The Largest Naval Battle in World History; A Commentary from the North China Daily News Thirty-Nine Years Ago

The Battle of Tsushima

(Commentary from the North China Daily News) Late in the evening of May 30, 1905, news arrived from Tokyo that Admiral Togo's Japanese navy had won a great victory in the Tsushima Strait. Admiral Togo had previously been called indecisive. Newspapers reported that Admiral Togo would likely destroy the Russian Far East Fleet and the Baltic Fleet separately before they could join forces. However, Admiral Togo believed that when the Russian fleet decided to leave port from Annam, they would take the shortest route to Vladivostok and waited silently for the opportunity to arrive. Admiral Togo then decided on a plan to intercept the enemy fleet. As expected, the Russian fleet took that route. Reports arriving yesterday from China and other places are news for which the Japanese people can be thankful.

The US Consul General in Nagasaki reported to Washington that the Japanese navy had sunk one Russian battleship and four other warships, as well as one auxiliary ship. According to information obtained yesterday in Shanghai, the Japanese fleet captured one battleship and one cruiser. Admiral Rozhestvensky, commander of the Russian fleet, suffered losses due to his Russian-style fatalistic strategy. This is the most profound point we, as third parties, feel. Moreover, according to a special telegram from our Tokyo office, Admiral Togo, under careful planning, deployed his fleet in a rigorous formation, preparing to annihilate the Russian fleet in one fell swoop in the Tsushima Strait. According to a special telegram from our Osaka office, Admiral Togo had indeed established a meticulous operational plan, so the cruiser Izumrud, which was extremely fast, was able to escape, along with only three small ships.

On the Japanese side, the center of the battle was the destroyers, and losses were minimal. On the contrary, the Russian side suffered huge losses. He also included all the great commanders from all eras in world history. This Battle of Tsushima is related to Japan's future. Japan entrusted Admiral Togo with full responsibility for the naval battle, and the dedication and struggle of the admiral and his subordinates are enough to show figures worthy of the trust of the entire Japanese people.

The Battle of the Sea of Japan (Commentary from the North China Daily News)

May 31, 1905—The 16th greatest naval battle in world history, one hundred years after the Battle of Trafalgar, was carried out by the Oriental Nelson, Admiral Togo. As a result of that naval battle, the entire Russian naval force was completely annihilated. The first thing naval history researchers should point out is that between the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Tsushima, a hundred years passed, and during this period, military armaments and warfare methods underwent extraordinary changes. But there is one thing in common: the Battle of Trafalgar was the most important naval battle in England, and similarly, the Battle of Tsushima is the most important naval battle in Japan.

The highest commander must have foresight. The British war expert Wellington, on the crest of the mountain, could know how the enemy was acting on the other side of the mountain. Similarly, Admiral Togo also judged that the enemy Baltic Fleet would definitely take the shortest route to Vladivostok through the Tsushima Strait. Based on this presumption, he sent Admiral Uemura with a cruiser to the waters off Taiwan. Therefore, Admiral Togo did not concentrate his entire fleet in the Tsushima Strait. Before entering their final grave, the Japanese navy would never completely blockade Vladivostok to disperse their troops. Also, the commander of the Baltic Fleet believed that the straits of Tsugaru and Soya had mines and defensive patrols, so he chose to pass through the Tsushima Strait. Furthermore, Admiral Togo did not lay mines in the Tsushima Strait, because his own fleet would encounter danger with the enemy fleet.

On the morning of May 26, the last team of the Japanese naval reconnaissance unit reported that the Baltic Fleet was approaching Tsushima. The next morning, the Baltic Fleet was seen approaching the Tsushima Strait in two teams. The team on the right was composed of battleships, and the team on the left was composed of cruisers and small boats. There were two reconnaissance boats in front of the fleet. The Japanese fleet allowed the two ships to pass safely, and the two ships reported to the commander of the Baltic Fleet that there were no preparations along the coast of the island.

In this way, Vice Admiral Rozhestvensky hoped to reach Vladivostok without contacting the Japanese navy. The Japanese fleet used one ship to lure the vice admiral forward, as if there was only this warship defending the Tsushima Strait, opening fire on the Russian ships, while a large force was hidden to the northwest. The battle began on the morning of the 27th. The Japanese navy knew that taking advantage of the gaps in the Russian fleet's formation was very advantageous. Detailed reports on the battle have not yet been obtained. What we know now is based on direct telegrams from local correspondents. We previously knew that shells and torpedoes could not destroy steel ships, but the losses suffered by the Russian fleet were indeed caused by attacks from shells and torpedoes. As a result of the war, the Baltic Fleet can be said to have been completely annihilated, with only two or three cruisers escaping. The commander and senior officers were captured, more than 3,000 prisoners were taken, and the warships Oryol and Nicholas I were captured.

The Japanese naval battle was a tragic end for the Russian navy, which planned to rebuild its naval power in the Pacific. Russia also wanted to send out the Fourth Fleet, but this would only be a repeat of a new tragedy. As the commander of the Russian fleet said, he had indeed used all his strength, but facing the brave, calm, and unarrogant Admiral Togo, and the fleet under his command, he was naturally no match.

### Key Points of the Economic Security Office's Current Policies; Statement by the First Police Bureau

The First Police Bureau issued the following statement regarding the current policies of the Economic Security Office:

The purpose of establishing the Economic Security Office has been reported in various newspapers. In order to realize this goal as soon as possible, the Bureau organized its structure and adjusted personnel at the beginning of this month, striving to move towards the path of fulfilling its mission as soon as possible. The purpose of establishing the Economic Security Office is well understood by the citizens. In short, it is to implement the wartime special criminal laws, economic control regulations, and various regulations promulgated by relevant economic agencies of the National Government. On the one hand, it will support various economic institutions in Shanghai. At the same time, it will crack down on essential consumer goods that directly affect the lives of citizens, which is the focus of the current policies of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office.

The notices issued by the Economic Department of the First District Public Office this time, regarding the registration of stockpiles of matches, candles, soap, and coal, and the reporting of sales and transfers, are measures to investigate the exact quantity of the aforementioned essential consumer goods and then suppress price increases to stabilize people's lives. This is not a forced purchase. The Bureau has repeatedly stated this. Therefore, we hope that the owners and custodians of these materials will deeply understand the Bureau's intention and promptly carry out registration and reporting. Those who refuse to register or conceal quantities will be severely punished in accordance with the Anti-Hoarding Act and other laws.

Unified Implementation of Economic Controls

The establishment of the Economic Security Office will enable the centralization of economic controls within its jurisdiction. In the past, various agencies and police stations in the First District had the authority to implement economic controls. Now, the Economic Security Office will be responsible for all of this. Police officers who are not economic police officers cannot exercise their authority in matters of economic violations. In the future, the economic work undertaken by other agencies will be limited to the investigations necessary for administrative policy. This point should be especially noted. The distinction between general police officers and economic police officers is outlined below:

Distinction Between Economic Police Duties

Economic police officers must hold an economic police certificate with the seal of the Director of the First Police Bureau and must present the certificate to the other party when performing their duties.

When performing their duties, whether wearing a uniform or not, they should wear a brown armband with a yellow background, bearing the seal of the Director of the First Police Bureau and a number.

When performing their duties, they must be in groups of two or more and are strictly prohibited from working alone.

The Economic Security Office will cooperate closely with various agencies to implement effective controls. The public is urged to have an accurate understanding of and closely assist the Bureau's intentions. Economic police officers who engage in corrupt conduct will be severely punished. If citizens discover that police officers are engaging in corruption, they should record the date, location, police officer's name, and number and report it to the Director of the First Police Bureau or the Director of the Inspection Office.

### Collection of Teachers' Subsidy Fees Must Comply with Promulgated Methods; Statement by Director Lin of the Education Bureau

Regarding the collection of teachers' living subsidies from students' parents by public and private primary and secondary schools in this city, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated detailed methods and issued orders for their implementation. Recently, it has been learned that some schools are not following the Bureau's orders. In order to prevent abuses, Director Lin of the Education Bureau issued the following statement:

This time, the collection of teachers' living subsidies has received the enthusiastic assistance of relevant officials, authorities, and members of society, which has enabled the maintenance of education in this city. We are deeply grateful.

All teachers' living subsidies collected by the schools shall be used for the living subsidies of the teachers in the respective schools.

The teachers' living subsidies are divided into four categories: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Parents are free to determine which category to contribute based on their ability. Parents from poor families may declare their actual circumstances and be exempted from making a contribution. Parents from wealthy families who are enthusiastic about education and sympathize with teachers are welcome to donate more than 100 yuan. There are also reward measures in place.

On the 20th of this month, the Municipal Chinese Newspaper reported that the Municipal He'an Primary School was collecting this subsidy without following the Bureau's methods. The principal was immediately summoned to the Bureau for reprimand and ordered to correct the situation.

It is also heard that a small number of schools are violating the Bureau's methods and forcing parents to donate 100 yuan per month. This is unreasonable and improper. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate and punish those responsible, the Bureau still hopes that all parents will comply with the methods promulgated by the Bureau (as published in various city newspapers on the 7th of this month) and cooperate in correcting the situation. This is of utmost importance.

When making a donation, parents should request the "Certificate for Determining Living Expenses Subsidies for Public and Private Schools" from the school authorities. After filling in the amount of their own contribution (one of the four types: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan) in the required format, they should donate it and request the return of the receipt stamped by the Bureau.

As of 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, 13 private schools had submitted receipts for the collected subsidies to the Bureau for stamping (including Yiye Primary School, Newspaper Workers' Children's School, Bihua School, Zhaofeng School, Zide School, Peihao School, Sanmin School, Yakai School, Guanbei School, Zhongguo School, Chunyi School, Yanguang School, and Zhenying School). It can be seen that the other schools have not yet begun to collect. Parents are requested to pay attention.

### Purchase Certificates for Cloth in Zhabei Will Be Issued Starting Tomorrow

Regarding the rationing of cotton cloth, the Economic Bureau has ordered the distribution of purchase certificates to each household by the various district public offices. It is reported that the Third District, in order to handle matters carefully, has specially established nine temporary certificate issuing offices in the one town and four villages of Zhabei, so that residents can collect cotton cloth purchase certificates nearby. The procedures for collecting certificates are as follows: To prevent fraud, residents must present their household registration certificate, residence certificate, and personal seal, as well as household registration documents, directly to the designated issuing office to collect certificates for use by cohabiting households. If residents are between the ages of six and ten and do not have a residence certificate, they can present a household registration certificate issued by the village office to show completeness and demonstrate seriousness. In addition to ordering village heads to assist and notify residents, the dates of issuance, the number of certificates issued daily, and the locations of the issuing offices will be announced and posted in various villages. A schedule is attached to facilitate residents in collecting certificates according to the listed addresses.

### Mr. Chen Youren's Corpse Cremated Yesterday, Yan Huiqing Elaborates on Chen's Life

Mr. Chen Youren passed away in Shanghai a few days ago. In accordance with his will to cremate his body, Mrs. Chen, to comply with Mr. Chen's last wishes, held a cremation ceremony at the Jing'an Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (the 22nd) at 3 PM. Friends of Mr. Chen who attended the funeral included Yan Huiqing, Wen Zongyao, Zheng Hongnian, Zhao Jinxiang, Lin Kanghou, Shen Siliang, Gu Nanqun, Chen Shao, Chen Binhe, Li Guohua, and approximately two hundred others, including Major General Kawamoto, the Shanghai Army Minister from the Allied Japanese side, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Yushida Tosuke, and relatives. At precisely 3 PM, a memorial service was held before the altar, where Dr. Yan Huiqing briefly recounted Mr. Chen's life, and Li Weichen spoke on behalf of the Chen family to express gratitude. The body was then cremated.

Dr. Yan Huiqing briefly described Mr. Chen's life, saying: "I first met Mr. Chen in Tianjin in the first year of the Republic of China (1912). At that time, Mr. Chen was returning to the country for the first time, and his ambition to serve the motherland as an overseas Chinese was truly admirable. For decades, I served in the diplomatic field with Mr. Chen, and there are several aspects of his life that I deeply admire: His patriotism. Mr. Chen was an overseas Chinese from Trinidad, educated abroad. Once he heard of the establishment of the Republic of China, he abandoned his comfortable foreign life and returned thousands of miles to serve the motherland. This was entirely an expression of patriotism. His superb knowledge. Mr. Chen devoted himself to learning throughout his life, never slacking off. The articles Mr. Chen wrote in English were unmatched even by famous figures in England and America. His writing contained no hint of falseness, but was entirely meticulously crafted and sincere. Readers, regardless of whether their views were the same as Mr. Chen's, were invariably moved. His grand ambitions. Mr. Chen was a statesman, not a politician. He returned to the motherland to serve with great ambitions. He admired Premier Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of civil rights, and especially agreed with it. Externally, he hoped to make China equal in the international community. Internally, he hoped that China could become a truly republican country. Although Mr. Chen once held office, he believed that holding office was a means to achieve his ambitions, which was completely different from politicians who take holding office as their goal. When his ambitions were not realized, Mr. Chen abandoned his official position and refused to serve, his integrity shining brightly, which is truly admirable. Looking at Mr. Chen's life as a whole, it is very similar to that of Premier Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Chen passed away in the current environment, his ambitions unfulfilled. I imagine that the main points of his last words were the two sentences that Premier Sun said at his deathbed: 'The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard.'"

### Private School Subsidies to Be Issued by the End of the Month

In view of the difficult lives of teachers and staff at Hongli Primary and Secondary School in this city, the municipal government has been subsidizing 500,000 yuan per month since the last semester, which has been fully distributed by the Municipal Education Association. The Municipal Education Association has once again requested subsidies for private school teachers and staff for this semester, and the municipal government has approved the continued subsidy. However, the Municipal Education Association has only received 500,000 yuan for February so far, which is scheduled to be issued by the end of this month. The Municipal Education Association is actively urging the municipal government to issue the 500,000 yuan each for March and April.

### Next Rationed Flour Sales Permits to Be Issued Tomorrow

### Citizen ID Cards Required for Entry and Exit of Major Buildings

To address security concerns in this city, in addition to military and police authorities stepping up security and maintaining close communication with police security, special self-defense groups have been established in various high-rise buildings to patrol and inspect. The citizen ID card number and address of visitors are recorded at the entrance to prevent criminals from infiltrating and causing trouble.

### National Forum: Parental Opinions on Slightly Increasing Subsidies

One

Life is difficult, and families are suffering. How can parents bear to let their children drop out of school! However, the burden of tuition and miscellaneous fees is a serious pressure. Recently, schools have started to levy subsidies. According to the notice from Nanguang Primary and Secondary School, it is approved by the Education Association. However, according to its method, it first says that it will be from now until the end of the semester; then it says that it will be from May to July, with amounts ranging from 100 to 300 yuan, and it must be paid in full for three months at once.

The end of this semester is the end of June, and the summer vacation starts on July 1st. Since it says until the end of the semester, how should the words "before" and "until" be interpreted? Is it necessary for parents to subsidize during the vacation! Alas, it is really impossible to know whether this contradictory move by the school is opportunistic or not! Parents, parents, it is a situation of both crying and laughing - (A poor parent)

Tonight, I received a notice from the school through my child, which seems to say: According to the instructions of the authorities, each parent must pay a subsidy of 300 yuan from now on. With the rising cost of living, the lives of teachers are indeed difficult, but do all the parents of students have money? I hope the authorities will instruct each school to have wealthy parents pay the subsidy, while those who cannot afford it will be exempt. In this way, we who are poor can bear a little less burden, and the school will not force the collection of fees. (Chen Bingwen)

### Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute, Working Hard, Welcomes Visitors from All Walks of Life

In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association announced its dissolution. At that time, Mr. Yuan Lihui and Mr. Huang Yuqi, witnessing the general homeless refugees wandering the streets, which was bound to form beggars, which was very pitiful, resolutely founded the Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute in Fahua Town, laying the foundation for this institute. In the 31st year, Mr. Zhang Lianfang continued to maintain and expand the institute and moved it to No. 99 Jisi Feier Road, managing it diligently and sparing no effort. However, the rising cost of living was endless, and the living expenses of more than 300 refugee children, this huge expenditure, finally became a problem. Should they be dismissed? How can we bear to let this group of lost lambs wander? At that time (winter of the 31st year), the directors of the institute invited Mr. Chen Fukang to take over, and with Mr. Chen's enthusiasm, running around and appealing, the institute was finally moved to No. 1318 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi (the current site), and a second institute was opened in Wenmiao Road, which can be regarded as not failing the expectations of people in society.

Teaching and Cultivation Combined

In addition to providing food and clothing for the children, the institute also ran a half-day full primary school and opened three workshops (sewing department, mesh bag department, towel department), and a temporary design of a small handicraft, so that they have the opportunity to study and practice, and develop a spirit of self-reliance. When they leave the institute in the future, they can all stand on their own feet in society. As for the institute's band, it has long been praised by social members, and their traces can be seen in funerals and large-scale gatherings. The institute's hygiene facilities, in addition to hiring a hospital , also set up a medical room ○ ward, in addition to self-diagnosis of mild cases, the remaining more serious illnesses, by the hospital sent to Yongchuan Hospital and Nanshi Civilian Hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

Financial Difficulties

In terms of funding, in addition to Director Chen's efforts to raise funds, most of it relies on the institute's students' handicraft production, such as weaving wool, knitting mesh bags, and sewing clothes. Others rely on donations from various clubs in Nanshi. Now, the production of the factory has been interrupted due to the interruption of raw materials and cannot start work, and the various clubs have successively announced their closure. Therefore, recently, the institute's funding has been very difficult. To express openness, from May 1st, visits are welcome. At the same time, we hope that benefactors from all walks of life will provide material donations so that the institute's more than 200 poor children can continue to learn art.

### Letter to My Sister (3)

Iwatada Yu, translated by Hong Hongyang

(I haven't forgotten...)

Sitting in a rural bus, from Mannaga station to Kurihama, I kept saying this kind of thing in my heart.

Along the way, there was a slope. Wild grass ears were swayed by the sea breeze. Soon after, a blue sea appeared in front of me. This day was a clear autumn day. However, he had no intention of appreciating it.

(Yes. I have not forgotten. Have not forgotten.)

His eyes were full of tears, and he couldn't help but continue to think about the "lover" of the past.

"End of the line, please get off!"

The conductor noticed him, and he got off the bus in a hurry.

In front of him was a deserted and quiet seaside rest area. The white strip with the words "House of the Sea" written on it was half broken, and military curtains were wrapped around it. The sea was just in front of him, like a piece of blue paper, very quiet.

Rather than saying it was quiet, it was better to say it was blurred. That was his feeling about the coast. There was no one walking on the streets along the coast. Longfu stood there, looking at the beach as if he didn't know where to go.

"Where is the Kurihama Hotel?"

He finally found a few children playing by the sea and asked.

"Isn't it over there?"

Although summer had passed, the child, still wearing shorts, thought the question was superfluous, because it was something he should know, so the tone of the answer was not very pleasant. Longfu looked in the direction the child pointed, and saw a vertical street.

As if he had lost hope of recuperating, he walked listlessly towards that road. He found the sign of the Kurihama Hotel on the third door at the intersection. Although it was a two-story building, it was a very simple room. It was a bit unfair to call it a hotel, but it actually looked like a small restaurant. Although he said this, it took a long time for a woman to come out of the kitchen. The landlady, who looked like a fisherman's wife, stared at Longfu with a very peculiar look. When she saw the introduction letter written by a colleague, she said with relief, "Please come in! We only have summer rooms here, but it's okay for a rest, maybe

Saying this, she led him to the second floor. The children on the second floor had lowered the partitions, creating a desolate space.

"In the summer, we rent it to elementary school students from Tokyo. We haven't finished cleaning up yet. Please choose a room you like! I'll do it right away

The landlady said to herself and ran downstairs.

Longfu, like a tired traveler, fell on the faded child, not caring about anything. From the window, he could not see the sea, but only the color of the sea, showing the vast sky.
