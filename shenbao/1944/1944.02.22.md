### Unified Standardization

The Ministry of Industry, considering the rapid surge in commodity prices across various regions in the past half-month, with multiple price changes occurring in a single day, causing widespread anxiety and unease among the people, convened a meeting of provincial and municipal economic bureau chiefs in Shanghai today to urgently devise countermeasures and curb the rising trend.

Since the Lunar New Year, the prices of most commodities have been soaring, with increases of several times compared to pre-New Year levels being commonplace. Citizens are astonished, lamenting and clicking their tongues, and are once again rushing to exchange cash for tangible goods, just as they have done during previous periods of rapid price fluctuations. The more fearful citizens become about rising prices, the more inclined they are to prioritize tangible goods over currency. Meanwhile, stores are becoming increasingly reluctant to release their inventories, further fueling the citizens' eagerness to purchase. In such circumstances, the vicious cycle of rising prices is like a runaway horse, impossible to restrain. Of course, there are many causes and the problem is complex. It is akin to having multiple sources of illness and a weakened constitution, reaching a dangerous state that cannot be remedied by ordinary medicine or superficial treatments. It is necessary to address each factor driving up prices and carefully devise ways to eliminate them, not seeking quick results, but making it a priority to prevent further increases and stabilize the public's volatile mindset.

In the past, the task of suppressing and stabilizing prices has been uniformly emphasized by both the government and the public. The organizations managing prices and the methods for adjusting prices cannot be said to be incomplete or inadequate. However, the facts show that the desired results have not been achieved, with the crux of the issue lying in "ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate execution." Therefore, while management organizations may be well-organized, they are merely decorative; while adjustment measures may be meticulously formulated, they are mere formalities. They are as good as nonexistent. This is something that all organizations bearing responsibility for managing prices, as well as those directly or indirectly related to prices, should deeply reflect upon together. The fundamental solution to the price problem lies in increasing production to ensure an abundance of goods, streamlining transportation to facilitate smooth exchange, and tightening the money supply to stabilize currency value. However, these fundamental measures have not been effectively implemented, while stopgap measures have also failed to be executed effectively, resulting in a complex and chaotic price situation. Nevertheless, to achieve thorough price stability, the fundamental measures of increasing production, facilitating smooth exchange, and stabilizing currency value, as well as the stopgap measures of fair-price management and cracking down on hoarding, must be pursued simultaneously without neglecting any aspect.

Taking daily necessities as an example, for food, the primary focus should be on increasing production since the output does not meet the needs of the people. Second, streamlining transportation. Third, rational allocation. Fourth, cracking down on hoarding. For coal, which is not in short supply, the priority should be on streamlining transportation, followed by rational allocation and cracking down on hoarding. For daily necessities, which are also in short supply, the priority should be on increasing production, followed by cracking down on hoarding. Without increasing production, distribution will eventually be exhausted.

Increasing production has long been emphasized by both the government and the public, so it should not be a problem. But the reality is the opposite. Why is that? The answer is "poor governance." On the one hand, there is much talk of increasing industrial and agricultural production, while on the other hand, conditions that suppress production are being created. Regarding grains like rice, the slogan is to increase production, but in practice, farmers' costs are disregarded, and they are forced to sell at low prices, prompting farmers to use rice to make wine and sugar to avoid being bought out, or to reduce production and switch to other crops. Take light industry, for example. The slogan is also to increase production, but in reality, power is restricted, transportation capacity is weak, coordination is lacking, and the public prices of finished goods are too low, making it difficult to obtain industrial raw materials and inconvenient to transport and sell finished products. As a result, the cost of production is insufficient, leading to hoarding of raw materials, production shutdowns, and a concentration on speculation in company stock listings.

We have said before that economic measures alone are not enough to avert a crisis. Political reform is essential, with political power and economic measures working together. We hope that the economic bureau chiefs' meeting convened by the Ministry of Industry will not only focus on current price adjustment countermeasures, but also emphasize comprehensive fundamental solutions, coordinating with each other to achieve complete success.

With General Tojo's appointment as Chief of the General Staff, the consolidation of military administration and command, centered on personnel, has been achieved. Simultaneously, the establishment of a dual Vice Chief system within the General Staff Headquarters further strengthens the Japanese military's command structure, solidifying the highest personnel appointments in the Japanese military.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently serving as Minister of the Army, has decisively assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff, closely linking and unifying military administration and command through personnel changes.

### Personal Appointment Ceremony Held at the Imperial Palace

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, recognizing that the current situation is crucial to Japan's rise or fall, and in order to respond to this critical era, seizing the opportunity to shift from defense to offense and thwart the ambitions of Britain and the United States, passed a resolution in the cabinet meeting of March last year to strengthen the domestic posture, with the three major policies of consolidating the integration of the supreme command and state affairs, establishing a decisive domestic system, and promoting appropriate and vigorous diplomacy, and is determined to achieve their speedy realization. The convocation of the 83rd Extraordinary Session of the Diet, the reorganization of administrative institutions, the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference, and the convocation of the 84th Session of the Diet were all based on these policies, as was the previous reorganization of the current cabinet. The Japanese government, recognizing the severity of the current war situation, has decided to thoroughly strengthen the close relationship between the Supreme Command and state affairs. After careful deliberation, it was decided to realize the consolidation of the Supreme Command, the highest authority guiding operations, and the government, by appointing Prime Minister and Minister of the Army General Hideki Tojo as Chief of the General Staff, and Minister of the Navy Admiral Shigetaro Shimada as Chief of the Naval General Staff. This is an unprecedented measure in Japanese history. To this end, Prime Minister Tojo visited His Majesty the Emperor at the Imperial Palace at 2:00 PM on the 21st to report this matter, which was graciously approved. The personal appointment ceremony was held at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. At the same time, the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of the Navy separately announced the matter. With Prime Minister Tojo's appointment as Chief of the General Staff and Minister of the Navy Shimada's appointment as Chief of the Naval General Staff, the harmony between the Supreme Command and the government will be further enhanced, and strategy and policy will be further integrated. At the same time, the win-at-all-costs policies in both military and national affairs will become more proactive, and the rapid increase in decisive battle power (centered on increased aircraft production) will be promoted swiftly. This, in contrast to the replacement of the three major ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Commerce, and Transportation and Communications on the 19th, proves that Japan's win-at-all-costs posture has been completed and further strengthened. Military officers and civilians, united as one, will surely crush the enemy's counterattack.

Politics and War Strategies Fully Aligned

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the current major war situation and to further consolidate the relationship between the Supreme Command and state affairs, the Japanese government has decided to appoint General Hideki Tojo as Chief of the General Staff to vigorously promote various policies. Prime Minister Tojo has aligned political and war strategies and harmonized operations and politics through coordination between the Supreme Command and the government. What is noteworthy about this measure is that the inviolable independence of the Supreme Command, the relationship between the government, the General Staff, and the Naval General Staff has been clearly distinguished. Therefore, the close harmonization of command and state affairs has been perfectly integrated and consolidated by this epoch-making measure. Secondly, all measures necessary for operations will be taken quickly and smoothly in the overall national policy. This is a shortcut to enhancing both material and psychological combat power. The Japanese government has completed the strengthening of political power through five cabinet reshuffles and the decisive posture of the entire operation of national policy. After strengthening the relationship with the Supreme Command this time, this posture has been further consolidated, and the posture for winning victory has been further completed. From now on, specific measures such as increasing production in key industries, increasing food production and transportation, mobilizing national labor, and national movements will be made concrete, and the Japanese government and the public will unite as one to achieve the final victory with their total strength.

### Japanese Army's Defense Line in the Bay of Bengal is Extremely Well-Guarded; Enemy's Attempted Maritime Counterattack Will be Difficult to Achieve

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval aircraft continued to attack Arakan and Pirisun Island on the morning of the 21st, strafing enemy ground troops with machine guns and hitting all enemy facilities with bombs before returning safely.

Zhaonan, 21st (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army and the Indian National Army joined forces to break through the steep Arakan and began their offensive, Mountbatten, commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, seems to be actively launching a counterattack from the sea in an attempt to cover up his failure in land battles and reverse his decline. The most important thing for the Green River and the Burmese-Indian border in the war situation is the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which are located on the front line of the Indian Ocean. The two islands are the strategic line for the western defense of Greater East Asia and the key to controlling the sea and air power of the Bay of Bengal. Since the Japanese army entered the area on March 23, 1942, it has been two years, and the solidity of its defense is no less than that of Germany's western fortress line in Europe. The name of the Bay of Bengal Fortress Line stretches for 1,700 kilometers from the southern end of Burma to the northern end of Sumatra, with dozens of islands scattered in between. The main islands are the Andaman Islands, with Little Andaman in the north, central and south, and the Nicobar Islands, including Nicobar, Gamo, Monsoon, Gachal, and Little Nicobar, all of which are small islands of less than 1,000 square kilometers. Except for Nicobar, most of the other islands are dense forests, and there is very little flat land suitable for land air bases. The geographical conditions of the islands make them a special fortress line, whether for counterattack or defense. The distance from Ceylon Island to Port Blair in South Andaman is 2,000 kilometers, and the distance to Calcutta is about 2,000 kilometers. It takes about five hours for enemy bombers with a speed of 400 kilometers per hour to fly there, and it takes two days for enemy warships with a speed of 15 meters per second to arrive. Even if the enemy lands on these islands, it is extremely difficult to quickly establish a flight base after occupying the area, judging from the geographical conditions. It is even more difficult to attack other islands. From the standpoint of defense, the vast sea of the Bay of Bengal is its most complete barrier, and the defensive installations on each island are quite solid. The Japanese and American forces have engaged in reconnaissance battles and bombing battles over the Bay of Bengal. The enemy has repeatedly bombed and reconnoitered Yangon, Andaman, and Nicobar. The Japanese army has also bombed Calcutta. The modern fortress line of the Greater East Asia War, the Bay of Bengal Line, has become an impregnable fortress due to the thorough defense of the Japanese soldiers. On the contrary, if Mountbatten tries to launch a counterattack from the sea, his ambitions will be completely shattered.

### Philippines Promotes Food Production

Manila, 21st (Central News Agency) – The food production movement in the Philippines is still continuing.

In addition, the Department of Agricultural Resources will send agricultural technicians to the countryside to guide ordinary farmers and actively encourage the planting of short-term crops such as white rice. It also plans to increase agricultural products nationwide. All religious groups, including Catholics and Protestants, recently resolved to launch an active cooperative movement to increase food production at a Christian annual meeting. The entire country is currently planning to achieve food self-sufficiency.

### Anniversary of the Establishment of the Provisional Indian Government

The Times added that the Japanese fleet is currently concentrated in one location and will surely come out to fight.

### The National Government Implements a Decisive Strategy; Japanese Residents Wholeheartedly Support and Provide Full Assistance

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – The government's measures after entering the second year of the war have made considerable progress. Because these measures are extremely important for completing the Greater East Asia War, both the Japanese government and the public are paying great attention to them. In particular, the Japanese residents in China, witnessing the Chinese people's efforts to cooperate in the war, support the government, and overcome difficulties, express great respect and anticipation. Recently, a reporter specifically interviewed influential Japanese residents in Nanjing to inquire about their views on the National Government's recent policies. A summary of their main points is as follows:

It is stated that since entering the second year of the war, the National Government's various policies have made considerable progress, especially the decisive political facilities, which have been vigorously developed. The determination of the whole country, from top to bottom, to complete the war was fully expressed both domestically and abroad in Chairman Wang's New Year's address. At the same time, on January 9th, the anniversary of the war's entry, Chairman Wang, in a conversation with reporters, also mentioned that the focus of this year's policies is: rectifying thought, establishing public security, and increasing production, with increased production being the most important of all. Therefore, since January of this year, the National Government has successively held national economic conferences, agricultural production conferences in various provinces and cities, and national rural clearing conferences, etc., mobilizing the total strength of the national military, government officials, and civilians to promote the decisive war strategy. In summary, its main points include three aspects: agricultural production strategies, the price issue, and rural clearing work. The implementation of these three measures will further strengthen the political power of the National Government in the four years since the return to the capital. We express unlimited respect to the National Government, which is closely cooperating with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War.

When the National Government implements these important policies, Japan should provide full assistance. Especially during this year's agricultural production conference, the statements issued by the Japanese Embassy and the authorities of the dispatched army in China made the determination to assist the National Government even clearer. At the same time, after the National Government formally announced its participation in the war last January, the Japanese side also announced the implementation of new policies towards China, declaring the abolition of extraterritorial rights. This year, it transferred all former enemy property and issued the third notice of transferring the taxation rights of Japanese residents in China. All these are clear proof of assisting the National Government and strengthening its politics. The purpose of Japan's new policy toward China has been stated above. We are willing to use great sincerity to expect the rapid success of China's decisive strategy this year. We also hope that China, as an important link in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, will reach the road to prosperity as soon as possible.

### National Government Holds Weekly Meeting

### Vice President Zhou Addresses Audience in Xuzhou

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan visited Xuzhou on the 19th. Taking the opportunity of presiding over the opening ceremony of the Xuzhou branch of the Central Reserve Bank, he gave a speech to the young people of Xuzhou at 6:00 PM. He mentioned that he had spoken to educators and young people in Xuzhou in the past. Recalling the previous situation, he couldn't help but feel emotional. The young people of Xuzhou occupy a very important position in history and in all aspects. Historically speaking, Emperor Gaozu of Han used the youth of Fengpei to overthrow the tyrannical Qin Dynasty, making a great contribution and achieving great achievements in history. We must not forget the past glory of Xuzhou, and we must not miss our current responsibilities. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of revolution was not just to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, but also to defeat Britain and the United States and strive for China's freedom and equality. In 1926, the Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition was to overthrow the warlords and unify China. Japan sympathized with and cooperated with us in these two great movements. The past history has clearly shown us. We can assert that China cannot achieve freedom and equality unless it defeats Britain and the United States. Seeing that East Asia was increasingly endangered by British and American aggression, Japan launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, and expelled British and American forces in a short period. In order to thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States and cooperate with Japan to defend East Asia, China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th last year. Soon after, it was able to abolish the unequal treaties, and the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's 40-year-old will was finally realized. Now we can say that we have already obtained true freedom and equality. Cooperating with Japan, defeating Britain and the United States, revitalizing China, and defending East Asia are the highest policies of the country, so our young people should shoulder this important burden, complete this great mission, and earnestly implement the national policy to revitalize China. Since the youth of Xuzhou have had past glory, implementing the national policy is what the national people should strive for, then the youth of Fengpei should work even harder. Students will naturally reach the road to prosperity after stepping over the thorns. We can only remember the instructions of the supreme leader, Chairman Wang, and be diligent, enduring, brave, and progressive, so that China can have a way out and East Asia can be liberated.

### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat on the Pulebet Grassland; German Troops on the Northern Front Shift Positions

### Current Situation of Japan's Active Production Increase

For the sake of victory, not blaming heaven or others, dedicating everything in life to enhancing war power, a hundred million people are all advancing on the production front. In the production war, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. It is not only the people who work directly in the factories to manufacture airplanes and tanks; all 100 million people are soldiers in the production war. Send airplanes and bullets to the front line with the hands of all the people! The road is near, and we can do whatever our hands can do! The way of public service is around us. For the sake of victory, use creativity and research to build daily life, and use our strength to increase combat power! Airplanes, warships, cannons, tanks, bullets, and other weapons require iron, copper, light alloys, and iron, wood, and cement for factory construction materials. Production equipment requires machine tools and other various machines. Driving the machines requires power, labor, coal, and transportation of raw materials. This unimaginable amount of materials, labor, and power are directly or indirectly related to production. Now is indeed the time to use everything for production for the sake of victory. Our lives must also be reviewed from various angles.

Airplanes

Necessary things in the home are also necessary for producing airplanes. From salt to magnesium, airplane materials can be made. Fuel can be extracted from ether liquid; high-grade fuel "isooctane" can be extracted from sugar; it can also be extracted from sugar cane, or it can be extracted from corn. Sugar is used as yeast in the manufacture of isooctane. Soap and castor oil can be used to make lubricating oil. Are there people complaining about the lack of sugar and salt? Are there people who want sugar cane and soap? Yes, enduring these is precisely cooperating in the increased production of airplanes and fuel.

Responding to the call of "one more is good," many textile, silk, paper, and other non-urgent factories have been converted into airplane factories. This has restricted the people's clothing and reduced the number of daily necessities. However, enduring these and thinking of various ideas is precisely helping to increase the production of airplanes.

Iron

The amount of iron used to manufacture warships, cannons, and various weapons is enormous. Airplanes also use a considerable amount of special steel. We gladly respond to the movement to recover iron and contribute various iron products, even a pair of fire tongs and a paperweight. These things are now being reborn as weapons to destroy the enemy. The iron ore, scrap iron, coal, limestone, etc. required to refine one ton of iron total five to six tons. No amount of scrap iron is too much. Donate more iron! Are there any unused iron products hidden away? Go to the pile of old things that are not being used to find them! Even an empty iron can can be dedicated to the country!

Copper

Copper is also an indispensable military material. Airplane bearings, pipes, connecting rods, shell bands, armor, shell casings, detonators, tanks, cannons, automobiles, optical weapons, electrical wires, etc. all require copper. So turn around and check again: if there are any copper products, quickly donate them.

Electricity

Electricity is also the basis of production, like coal. This alone requires a great deal of electricity. If we consider the rapid increase in the production of airplanes in the future, the amount of electricity used cannot be imagined even just for manufacturing airplanes. Moreover, not only is electricity needed to build airplanes, but the better the results of increasing production in other departments, the more electricity is consumed.

Therefore, household consumption should be saved as much as possible for use in military factories. Are the lights in uninhabited rooms not turned on? Are the lights in the toilets not turned off all night? Other than when necessary, do people still often listen to the radio?

Coal

Coal is the foundation of combat power. If the transportation of coal stops for a day, the military industry will not be established. Even a piece of coal should be dedicated to victory. Save on the "bath" that is heated with coal. Or consider using alternative fuels to heat bathwater. Use a little effort when turning on the gas switch. Doing so can save a lot of coal!

Transportation

In order to increase production, this is an absolutely essential department. Transportation is the foundation of production and the mother of increased production. As long as there is transportation capacity, all the important resources of the Greater East Asia region, such as iron ore, bauxite, oil, coal, tungsten, manganese, chromium, tin, lead, rubber, Manila hemp, coconut kernels, coconut oil, palm oil, sugar, etc., can be fully utilized to create the combat power to destroy Britain and the United States.

Furthermore, transportation capacity, i.e., ships, is also needed to transport the manufactured military supplies to the battlefield. The smooth distribution of national food also absolutely requires transportation capacity. Therefore, the more ships, the better. If the entire nation demands an increase of one spoonful of rice per day in rations, it would require 380,000 tons of ships if this rice were transported from the south. If there were so many ships, a large amount of important materials could be transported. So don't make wild demands, and instead think of ways to save.

At the same time, regarding land transportation, because it is necessary to enhance the transportation capacity of the railways, it is necessary to suspend transportation that is not necessary for production. To this end, it is natural to reduce passenger cars and increase freight cars. Therefore, unnecessary travel should be stopped, and personal luggage and gifts should be reduced. Not only that, but people should not go out casually during office hours, so as not to increase traffic congestion. Industrial soldiers who arrive at the factory on time and without fatigue have a great effect on increasing production. All transportation capacity must be mobilized for production.

"Stop unnecessary travel!" the railway authorities are calling, but are tickets to tourist destinations not sold out in an instant? Are the trains still not crowded?

Every citizen must know that the war is by their side, and daily life must be strict until the day of victory. (Ji: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, February 5)

### German-British Conciliation is Purely Groundless; German Consul General in Shanghai Denies Rumor

Central News Agency – The German Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Beyer, visited the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai on the 18th, and then visited the Shanghai Special Municipal Government on the 19th. He strongly denied the recent rumors in Shanghai about the conciliation between the German and British forces, and pointed out that the rumors were completely unfounded and were nothing more than enemy propaganda.

### Commercial Control Association Sends Letter to Cloth Trade Association to Strictly Investigate Illegal Actions; Rumor of Collecting Campaign Fees from Retailers

Central News Agency – The reporter recently learned from the Commercial Control Association that the Shanghai Special Municipality Cloth Trade Association has been rumored to charge its retail members 30 yuan per bolt of cloth sold in order to obtain campaign fees for the free trading of cloth, and that some have already paid the fees. The authorities of the Commercial Control Association were deeply surprised upon learning of this news and immediately sent a letter to the Cloth Trade Association to inquire about the matter. The main point of the letter stated: "The matters of this association's purchase of yarn and cloth have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be handled. For half a year, they have been executed in accordance with laws and regulations. It has long been stated that personnel of this association must not accept requests, let alone have any favoritism or illegal acts, as is known to the social community. The Cloth Trade Association is a legally organized group and a lower-level organization of this association, and should be well aware of this meaning, so it is unlikely to have any actions that violate laws and regulations. However, there are many rumors, and for the sake of rectifying discipline, this association must conduct a thorough investigation. This association has sent a letter to the association to investigate and reply as soon as possible, so as to handle it according to law. At the same time, the association has sent a letter to the supervisor to perform his supervisory duties, and it is heard that the supervisory committee is scheduled to hold a supervisory meeting at 4:00 PM on the 23rd of this month in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Building.

### Second Meeting of the Fuel Saving Committee

The committee was officially established on the 14th of this month. The first meeting discussed various electricity-saving measures for archival research. It is now scheduled to hold the second meeting at 3:00 PM this (22nd) afternoon in the office meeting room. At that time, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will also send representatives to attend and discuss various measures and answer various questions together.

### Japanese Embassy Holds Regular Press Conference Yesterday

Central News Agency – After deciding to postpone the regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy to every Monday, yesterday (the 21st) was the first regular meeting, held at 2:00 PM in the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. On the embassy side, Chief of Information Department Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukuma attended.

### Sales of Household Rice Flour in the 63rd Period Begin Today

The 63rd period of household rice flour, etc., in the First District of the city (including the old Eighth District) will begin to be sold today (the 22nd). Citizens can purchase two liters of white rice or brown rice per person with the 63rd rice purchase certificate, priced at 18 yuan, and purchase one catty of No. 2 flour per person with the same certificate, priced at 7 yuan. All rice shops and rice stalls in the public office will be closed for one day on the 9th. As for the method of distributing rice and flour in the newly merged Huxi District, the public office will issue a separate announcement. However, residents in the Huxi District urgently hope that the authorities will distribute rations as reported.

The selling price of household rice in the city will increase by one yuan per liter, for a total of nine yuan. The group ration rice will be resold for 1,125 yuan per bag. The areas within the blockade line have been approved by the Municipal Grain Bureau and will be implemented from the 34th period. The First District will also change the price to 9 yuan per liter when the next period's public announcement begins.

### Nanshi Yongkang Cigarette Shop – License Revoked for Fraud

The City Baojia Committee and the City Economic Bureau worked together to implement a quota rationing system for various essential daily necessities, such as matches, soap, and coal briquettes, in the Nanshi District. The purpose was to alleviate the burden on residents in the district. However, it was discovered that a small number of contracted merchants often replaced rationed goods with inferior products to make profits, which undermined the wartime economic policy and was deeply regrettable. The City Baojia Committee had previously issued a public notice to prohibit this. The Yongkang Cigarette Shop at 1529 Zhonghua Road repeatedly made excuses and created difficulties when selling allocated goods. Each small box of matches contained only sixty or so matches. After receiving reports of this exploitation and deduction, Ying, the head of the Nanshi District Office and concurrent District Commissioner, investigated and confirmed the facts. He immediately ordered the revocation of the shop's business license and ordered it to cease operations, to serve as a warning to others and to eliminate the corrupt practice. The Yemiao Police Precinct was responsible for carrying out the order.

### Ninth Soup Kitchen to Register Soup Recipients

The office of the 32nd Year Winter Relief Fund筹禀 Committee has established the Fifth Soup Kitchen at 93 Bailinan Road, Luxue Residence. The renovations have been completed and it is scheduled to begin distributing soup. Starting today, registration for soup recipients will be conducted. Civilians living near the soup kitchen may apply for registration. Those found to be truly impoverished will be issued a soup-receiving certificate, which can be used to receive soup at the designated time. The registration period is from February 22nd to February 25th, 1944. The date for soup distribution will be announced separately.

### Business Openings, etc. – Gift Money Donated to Charity – Economy Association Requests Assistance in Promotion

Central News Agency report: The Shanghai Special City Economy Association, recognizing that extravagance is still prevalent in the city, such as at shop openings or relocations where prominent figures and celebrities are often invited to preside over the opening ceremony with little restraint, has sent letters to Mr. Wen Lanting, Yuan Fudeng, Lin Kanghou, and other gentlemen, requesting their cooperation in guiding improvements through persuasion. It is hoped that future opening ceremonies and other events can achieve a win-win outcome. The idea is beautiful and the method is good, and it is believed that it will achieve significant results. The original letter from the association to the three gentlemen is as follows:

(Omitted above) Greetings to Mr. [Name]: Our association is actively promoting economy and savings and is launching various practical measures. The Third Board of Directors meeting recently unanimously passed a motion to "invite social leaders to advocate for cash gifts and for recipients to donate double the gift money to charitable and public welfare causes." Knowing of your high social reputation and extensive connections, we are sending this special letter to you to encourage and promote this initiative. In addition, commercial firms in the city, when newly opening, relocating, or commemorating an anniversary, often invite prominent figures and celebrities to preside over the opening ceremony. Although this practice is legitimate, the expenses incurred are often significant, amounting to nothing more than superficial fanfare that does little to alleviate the current difficulties. You have always advocated for thrift. In the future, when invited to preside over opening ceremonies or other events, we hope that you will explain the meaning of economy and savings to those who extend the invitation, persuade them to avoid unnecessary waste, and if they do hold a ceremony, to limit gifts to cash only. After the event, the entire sum of gift money (or double the amount) should be donated to charitable and public welfare causes. This would both benefit the public and align with the principles of economy and savings. If the commercial firm can comply with these guidelines, then you may preside over their opening ceremony; otherwise, we hope that you will decline the invitation. We urge you to consider and adopt this proposal to assist our association in its efforts to promote economical consumption, indirectly suppress prices, and alleviate the people's hardship. We are deeply grateful for your public service. (Omitted below)

Economic Circle Commentary

### After the Sharp Rise in Prices

The serious impact of the sharp rise in prices can be summarized as at least two aspects: one is of a semi-political nature, that is, the impact on the status of the national currency; the other is of a purely economic nature, that is, the impact on the living conditions of the common people; in general, both are detrimental to the country's future in wartime. Someone might ask: Didn't the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance recently state that the recent sharp rise in prices has nothing to do with the currency? Someone might also ask: Aren't the stores and entertainment venues still crowded with customers amidst the sharp rise in prices? It is better not to answer these two questions, because answering them would require saying too much.

In any case, everyone's only hope after the sharp rise in prices, except for a few with ulterior motives, is that the price issue is resolved reasonably and quickly. The recent meeting of provincial and municipal economic bureaus convened by the Ministry of Industry and the three-province, two-city price control committee, whose establishment was requested by the capital authorities to the central government, are all aimed at comprehensively and uniformly implementing measures to address the serious price issues in various provinces and cities. This is to ensure mutual coordination and adjustment in managing price control measures, avoiding each region acting on its own, which would only lead to confusion and complexity, and make those responsible for price issues feel lost and directionless. Undoubtedly, unifying price management to standardize prices across provinces, cities, counties, and districts is a prerequisite for establishing price standards. However, how to implement such price management is entirely the responsibility of the agencies controlling and allocating materials, and no relaxation is allowed. We only hope that the past state of no management will not be seen again in future price issues.

### Minister Matsushima's View on the Truk Island Battle Results – Firm Belief in Victory Will Lead to Final Victory

Central News Agency report: Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China, on the 21st, shared his views on the battle results around Truk Island, stating: Based on the results of the Truk Island operation announced by the General Headquarters today, it is clear that significant damage has been inflicted on the attacking enemy's important warships, and some have been sunk. At the same time, our side has also suffered considerable losses. Our views on this battle result are as follows:

Firm Belief in Victory Lays the Foundation for Victory

The war is becoming increasingly fierce, and all people in the rear should feel that the enemy is close at hand and further strengthen their determination to eliminate the enemy in order to achieve final victory. In a long-term war, victories and defeats are inevitable. The most important thing is to achieve final victory. If slight wavering occurs due to occasional damage, it will inevitably lead to even greater and irreparable failures. Conversely, if one can remain calm and make thorough preparations to achieve a major victory in the future, then the ultimate victory will belong to us. This can be clearly understood by examining historical war examples. As far back as May 15, 1904, in the sea off Lushun, the major warships Hatsuse, Yashima, and Yoshino were lost in one fell swoop, but the morale of the entire army was not diminished, and the great victory of the Battle of the Sea of Japan was ultimately achieved. This was the great achievement of Marshal Tōgō Heihachirō. More recently, in mid-August 1937, our Marine Corps was heavily besieged but was able to remain calm and overcome the difficulties, laying the foundation for Shanghai today. This was due to the unwavering belief of the Marine Corps officers and soldiers at the time. A firm belief in victory is essential in such difficult situations. This should be the only way to achieve victory in war.

Strictly Discern and Listen, Do Not Be Misled by Rumors

It is expected that the enemy will take this opportunity to further strengthen its ideological warfare and launch a comprehensive propaganda offensive against us, fabricating various rumors to disrupt morale, which is inevitable. All our people in the rear should strictly discern and listen at this time, and not be misled.

The accuracy of the announcements made by our General Headquarters is even more evident, while the enemy exaggerates the damage it inflicts on us while simultaneously adhering to its past doctrine of concealment regarding its own losses, attempting to deceive the world. Herein, the fairness of our propaganda becomes even more evident to the world.

In addition, the simultaneous replacement of the two chiefs of staff of the General Headquarters this month is essentially to strengthen the unity of command and political affairs in order to further promote the rise of war power. At this time, we should be even more solemn and courageous in our advance in order to unleash the great victory that comes with a firm belief in victory in the final battle.

### Provisional Measures for the Supervision of Private Enterprises

In order to manage various types of private enterprises, guide them onto a normal track, eliminate illegal business practices, and stabilize the entire financial, industrial, and commercial operations, the Ministry of Industry has specially formulated provisional measures for the supervision of private enterprises. These measures have been submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan for promulgation and implementation. The provisional measures for the supervision of private enterprises are outlined below: All private enterprises, industries, developments, revitalizations, trades, investments, real estate, and other similar companies (hereinafter referred to as "enterprise companies") established with the approval and registration of the Ministry of Industry, regardless of whether they are limited, unlimited, or general partnerships, shall be supervised in accordance with these measures unless otherwise stipulated by law. All enterprise companies shall fill out a general information form on company operations (form attached separately) and submit it to the Ministry for record. All enterprise companies shall fill out a monthly asset and business report form (form attached separately) each month. At the end of each year, a business report shall be submitted, accompanied by a certified statement from a certified public accountant, to the Ministry for record. The submission of the aforementioned monthly report form, report, and certification shall not be delayed by more than one month. The Ministry of Industry may send personnel at any time to investigate the actual business operations of each enterprise company. If any of the following circumstances occur, the company's registration shall be revoked: (a) The business operated exceeds the scope stipulated in the company's articles of association. (b) The business operated is inconsistent with the information filled out in the asset and business monthly report form. (c) The business operated violates current laws and regulations. When carrying out the duties in the preceding article, the investigators dispatched by the Ministry of Industry may, upon presentation of the investigation credentials, question company personnel about the facts and may inspect books and other relevant documents. Any enterprise company that fails to fill out various forms on time or refuses to be investigated shall have its registration revoked. These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Bank of Communications Economic Department Establishes Branches in Various Locations

The Bank of Communications was previously ordered by the Ministry of Finance to handle agricultural finance business. It has established an Agricultural Economic Department, and on December 16th of last year, an Agricultural Economic Branch was established in Jiaxing. At the same time, branches were established in Suzhou on the 10th of last month and in Nanjing on the 12th of last month. As for the Dongtai branch, preparations are actively underway, and it will soon be established. Furthermore, staff have been dispatched to Wuhu, Anhui, to prepare for its establishment.

### Abolish Sending Worn-out Items from Money Shops, Switch to Bill Discounting, Discretionary Lending for Legitimate Needs

Since the members of the Money Shop Trade Association followed the procedures passed by the general meeting, implemented the abolition of the current account passbook system, appropriately increased interest on arrears, and switched to bill discounting for external transactions, this reporter learned from the money shop sector yesterday that the various clearing money shops have stopped issuing current account passbooks to new customers after listing. The credit overdraft amount for each customer has been strictly regulated and efforts have been made to tighten it without exception. However, the switch to bill discounting is being promoted with full force. For example, if a certain firm or factory has a legitimate need for funds in its business, it can apply for a loan from the various shops, which will be handled through bill discounting. The term is not as long as in the past, and the interest rate is directly negotiated between the borrower and the shops. Upon maturity, the principal and interest must be fully repaid, and the guarantor is fully responsible. If the bill is not honored upon maturity, the issuer will not only violate the Bills of Exchange Act but also be guilty of criminal fraud, which is better than the previous current account passbook system. It can also reduce the risk of bad debts for the various shops and can suddenly tighten the loan amount, which will cause speculators and hoarders to face a dead end. The entire financial system can achieve stability.

### Brief News

The general office of the China Chemical Industry Company is located in the New World Building. There are three factories under its management, with a total capital of 25 million yuan. Its products, such as hydrochloric acid, baking soda, and various original medicines for soap, as well as sauces and seasoning powders, have all been launched on the market.

### Brief News

The first all-star benefit performance was originally scheduled to be held at the Tianchan Theater today (the 22nd). It has been learned that the performance has been postponed in order to strive for excellence in the program arrangement. It will still be held at the Tianchan Theater. It has also been learned that the film industry's new film replacement and new film charity premiere is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 23rd).

### National Forum Clothing Revolution

— Zhao Runsheng

No matter which country it is, wearing clothes should always be for convenience; and it should be based on the principles of durability, practicality, and economy. Looking back at our country, in recent years, we have completely learned the extravagant habits of Europe and the United States, and almost completely overturned the original clothes of our country and made them extravagant. Although the inherent clothes of our country are not convenient and durable, the current extravagance is worse for the people of the country than not wearing extravagant clothes. If we recognize the purpose of wearing clothes, and base it on the principles of convenience, durability, and economy, we will know that a clothing revolution is necessary.

In addition, there are many facts that can make our people more thoroughly understand the clothing revolution.

In order to save money: Expensive clothes can cost thousands or even tens of thousands of gold. Such a large price takes up a large part of a person's living expenses. Even wealthy people feel it is too wasteful. Moreover, if you wear beautiful and gorgeous clothes, once you enter society, all kinds of social expenses and friend entertainment expenses will increase! Even when you go to a restaurant or tea house to eat the same food and drink the same tea, you will have to spend more money. This is not worth it.

Rectifying the national system of the country: The strength of a country depends on its people. If the people are frugal and hardworking, the country will be strong. The most obvious sign of people's frugality is their clothing. Japan has something called national clothing, which is such an expression.

After the clothes are regulated, the poor and the rich I have carefully studied this situation, isn't it because of the difference in clothes?

As for the methods of clothing revolution, indirectly: The government should issue an order to organize propaganda teams, distribute them to various places, and give various speeches in turn to give the people a cordial explanation.

And connect it with the simple and plain movement, work together to achieve great results.

Government officials, school teachers and students, and employees of factories and other institutions, places, and groups with a large population must take the lead and set an example, first practice the clothing revolution, and abide by the clothing laws and regulations promulgated by the government, so that the people can imitate and emulate them.

Textbooks should use more topics about the simplification and simplicity of clothing, and supplement them with articles and explanations that correct aesthetic views and noble thoughts, so as to complete the psychological construction of not pursuing vanity and not valuing luxury.

Directly. Establish agricultural improvement agencies in various places to encourage people to plant durable and practical crops such as cotton and linen so as to increase the raw materials for clothing and make them self-sufficient and abundant. And establish an excellent variety sales agency, where the state hires agricultural experts to purchase excellent varieties from abroad, or selects indigenous ones, and carries out cultivation and breeding of new species, etc., and then cultivates a large number of excellent varieties and sells them to farmers. In addition, scientific agricultural implements and efficient machinery should be used to strengthen the power to monitor factories and protect the legal loopholes. For the textile and dyeing industries related to clothing, a large number of machines are needed. The government should establish factories to manufacture textile machines to meet the needs of the people.

Formulate national uniforms, and the methods are: 1 Establish a clothing research institution. Hire experts to design styles suitable for the season, based on the principle of convenience. 2 Establish a cloth control and allocation agency to study the formulation and revision of control policies and allocation mechanisms. 3 Establish a statistics survey and crackdown agency to severely punish illegal merchants who hoard and hoard goods, and people who transfer and resell cloth. At the same time, those who refuse to wear the prescribed national uniforms should also be given certain penalties.

Govern the textile and dyeing industry: Allow yarn factories to only spin strong and tough raw materials, weaving factories to only weave durable fabrics, and dyeing factories to only dye the colors specified by the state. In this way, even if people want to make light shawls or wear red, green, and colorful clothes, they will not be able to obtain them. This is the most effective way to implement the clothing revolution.

### Navy (6)

— Written by Iwata Toyo, Translated by Hong Mou

From July 1st, the naval academy entered its summer term.

The term examinations, which had started the month before, only finished on the 5th. Shin-jin barely unloaded the heavy burden from his shoulders, but he didn't have confidence in this term's exams. The naval academy's academic subjects are complex and diverse. Even military science can become tedious. Sitting at a desk from morning till night doesn't make it easy to organize things, and in the midst of those exams, one must also undergo various training sessions - intense training in military skills and physical education. In particular, one cannot focus solely on studying for the exams (like the "candlelight studying" at the First Higher School), because there is a consistent daily schedule. Therefore, to avoid panicking during exams, one must pay attention to lectures on a regular basis. However, before the academic time, there is always time for physical training, and in the middle of the academic time, one is bound to feel tired. Even when the heart is drowsy and one is dozing off, one must maintain a normal posture. Shin-jin, in particular, feels more tired than others, so he often misses parts of the lectures.

"First—Have I violated sincerity anywhere?"

When the evening self-study period ends and the five self-reflections begin, Shin-jin is almost ashamed every day of his dozing off. The five self-reflections involve reflecting on one's actions for the day, in relation to the five items of sincerity, words and deeds, energy, effort, and diligence versus laziness. The squad leaders of each division respectfully recite them, and the students close their eyes and listen quietly to the pine wind outside the window, beginning a sacred silence.

However, due to a habit from childhood, Shin-jin doesn't feel tired during the evening self-study period and can concentrate extremely well, so the exam results are not as bad as he imagined. His anxiety is mainly a moral uneasiness about dozing off.

But by the morning, everything is forgotten.

In the morning, there is short boat cleaning. The naval academy's short boats are not Boats but Cutters. For the sake of each division's reputation, one must cherish one's Cutter. Therefore, when cleaning, one must be extremely careful and thorough.

In general, the cleaning at the naval academy, whether it's cleaning the student dormitory or repairing the short boats, is mainly done by fourth-year students. At a minimum, wiping things with cloths is the job of the fourth-year students. The cloths are made of broken hemp rope and are not easy to use. When it's cold, it's easy for the fourth-year students to cry from the cold. However, Shin-jin always received praise from his teachers when he did cleaning in elementary school. He is confident in himself, and it's summer, so he has never been reprimanded.

During the afternoon training time, there is wrestling. Shin-jin uses quick techniques to defeat his opponents. So, wrestling is not a "sea turtle" style.

(I'm not a new fourth-year anymore.)

Shin-jin reflects on the past semester and feels this way.
