Minister Lin Xuan Broadcasts Last Night

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - At the request of the Capital Afforestation Movement Temporary Committee, Minister Lin broadcasted on the Central Broadcasting Station last night, titled "How to Commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen." The main points were as follows: The afforestation movement is in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to cultivate forests and improve agriculture, and it has a significant contemporary meaning in the current wartime production increase movement. Pan-Asianism was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last speech before his death, and it was the guiding principle for the National Revolution to progress from liberating China to liberating East Asia. Why was it not followed after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, but instead took the opposite path? Although a glimmer of hope has been opened in the unfortunate blood change, how to remove the current thorns and how to overcome the difficulties ahead are all things that we should deeply reflect on and encourage ourselves to do today. We must mobilize all our spiritual and material strength to assist our allies in completing the Greater East Asia War to establish the fundamental realization of Greater East Asianism, which is to lay the foundation for the success of the revolution. The above is the understanding we should have when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death today. Only by commemorating afforestation in this way can it have its indelible value and significance.

### Japanese Forces Control the Situation in the Kaladan River Valley Offensive; Main Force of British and West African Troops Surrounded

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The various units of the Japanese army are fiercely attacking several thousand main force troops of the British 81st West African Division, which are currently active in the Kaladan River valley, in the area between the Kaladan and Bilin Rivers. The enemy troops are retreating in disarray towards Paletwa. However, they are being surrounded by the Japanese army from several directions, so the area is in danger of being cut off. According to a captured captain from the British 7th Division headquarters, the enemy planned to launch an attack on Akyab in mid-February, linking the 81st Division with the 5th and 7th Divisions, and then advancing south from Kaladan in an attempt to directly attack Akyab. However, the Japanese army launched an offensive first, fiercely attacking the enemy's 7th Division, which changed the situation. The enemy immediately changed its plan, urgently redeploying the 81st Division south to contain the Japanese army's flanks, hoping to reverse the situation. The Japanese army had already detected the enemy's plan and lured the enemy troops in for a decisive defeat. Furthermore, the Indian National Army is currently advancing towards Chittagong and, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, is launching a fierce attack on the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's plan to retake Akyab has failed. The enemy is now ordering its last reserve unit, the 26th Division, to move to the front line to try to salvage the situation. However, this will not only fail to retake Akyab but also put the defense of the border line in danger. The Japanese army has now completely seized the initiative and is actively launching offensives in the Akyab and Kaladan areas, while launching fierce preemptive strikes in the Qin Hills area of the central Burma-India border. The enemy army is now in a state of chaos. The great decisive battle from the southern to the central Burma-India border has made the enemy uneasy about defending India.

The First Lesson in Reforming Shanghai

A person suffering from an illness, of course, desires health. However, if an inferior doctor treats the illness without removing the root cause, it will be impossible to restore health. This is a very obvious thing. The same is true for a person, a society, and a country.

Our China is like a person suffering from a serious illness. The people desire national revival, just as a patient desires physical health, without any difference. However, without thorough and complete "reform," it will be impossible to realize national revival. At the same time, it will be impossible to contribute real strength to the war effort and fulfill the responsibilities we should bear in the war against Britain and the United States.

"Reform" is already the only prerequisite for national revival and for genuine participation in the war. The time is pressing, and we can no longer hesitate, procrastinate, or delay. However, in speaking of "reform," we must consider the whole and start with the parts. Here, let us first discuss the issue of reforming Shanghai.

Whether in the past or present, Shanghai can be said to be the center of the country's economy, culture, and education. In terms of political center, it is second only to the capital. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become one of the most important rear bases. Therefore, from the perspective of all of China or the Greater East Asia sphere, Shanghai occupies an extremely important position. In other words, all of Shanghai's actions have a great impact on all parts of China and the Greater East Asia sphere. We can assert that if Shanghai can reform, it can influence and promote the reform of all of China and can genuinely cooperate to win the Greater East Asia War.

However, observing Shanghai's current state of illness, we cannot help but feel deeply concerned. First, Shanghai's idle capital is concentrated, and at the same time, it has always been a hub for the distribution of goods. Idle capital flows into the commodity circle, and with the complexity of society, the abundance of rumors, and the disunity of the people, it has created extremely deceptive speculation and hoarding, disrupting prices. Second, because of price fluctuations, the livelihood of 70 to 80 percent of Shanghai's salaried class is difficult, forming a serious phenomenon of popular anxiety. They are worried about their livelihood all day long and cannot help but have unreasonable thoughts. The concept of selfishness and profit-seeking is spreading, and social morality is declining. Third, after competing for speculation and pursuing exorbitant profits, people are no longer interested in normal production. On the one hand, the supply of industrial raw materials and power is difficult, production is decreasing, goods are in short supply, and prices are rising wildly. The people's livelihood is becoming more and more difficult.

Reforming Shanghai should start from all aspects. In terms of politics, a great deal of effort has been made, which is commendable. However, the distance to the goal of reform is still far. We believe that the primary condition for political reform is the personnel issue. Mayor Chen of Shanghai originally held an important central position. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, and the central government must increase its responsibilities and cooperate with the decisive battle at any time. Therefore, Mayor Chen may take on greater responsibilities in the central government and be unable to take care of both. Then, let us make a hypothesis. There are infinite expectations for the mayoral candidate who controls Shanghai's safety. Our ideal mayor:

Can make solving the livelihood problems of Shanghai citizens the first great wish.

Can promote the restoration and improvement of production efficiency, cultivate human and material resources, and practically contribute to the Greater East Asia War.

Can rectify officialdom, eliminate redundant personnel, adjust civil servant salaries, improve work efficiency, and gradually put politics on track.

Can guide police officers to improve their service aspirations, cultivate a love for the people, and work with citizens to build Shanghai.

Can devote all his energy to municipal administration, focus on one position, and not hold other political positions concurrently.

Can take the welfare of citizens and political reform as his mission and not hold partisan views.

Has rich political experience, has a noble personality, has integrity, has grandeur, has a spirit of selflessness, and has the courage to be positive and decisive to reform everything.

At the same time, we believe that those who only know how to be officials but do not know how to do things, those who are procrastinating and perfunctory, and those bureaucratic politicians who only know the party and not the people are not ideal figures and cannot shoulder the heavy responsibility of reforming Shanghai, saving Shanghai's crisis, relieving the suffering of citizens, and truly contributing to the war effort. They are not worthy of being our "parents" and officials.

Secondly, the key municipal government cadres in important positions must also adopt personnel who are commensurate with their talents and positions, thoroughly implement expert politics, and quickly establish a public opinion institution to communicate the opinions of citizens and jointly reform Shanghai's municipal administration. How to implement this specifically, we will make further suggestions.

We feel the seriousness of the current situation. Without thorough reform, it will be impossible to eliminate the deep-rooted illness. All our claims are nothing more than hoping for the health of Shanghai, which will affect the health of China, become a truly healthy rear base, and be of great help to the revival of China and the joint victory in the Greater East Asia.

Strategic Self-Contradiction; Britain and the United States Deeply Feel the Pain

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the destruction of the Sinzewa campaign, the Japanese dispatch army in the Indian region launched a surprise operation against the enemy troops in the Qin Hills area of the central Indian border. These continuous operations have not only crushed the enemy's attempt to retake Burma, but also given a major blow to the joint Pacific strategy of Britain and the United States. Its significance can be said to be profound. Due to the defeat of Mountbatten's army, the US military's senior leaders have expressed extreme dissatisfaction and harsh criticism of the British army's method and speed of counterattacking Burma. The biggest dissatisfaction of the US military is that while the United States is making every effort to launch an offensive against Japan, Britain is maintaining its own strength and not doing its best in the joint war against Japan. For example, the US military has severely criticized that General Wavell has used most of the British troops stationed in India to maintain security within India, so Mountbatten cannot launch an offensive. However, Britain has tried to cover up this criticism, claiming that the counterattack operation in Burma absolutely requires ships and naval support, but the current European war situation does not allow naval forces to go to Asia. It seems that it is only trying to defend itself. Regarding this point, it is still the contradictory argument between the US Pacific offensive theory and the British firstism theory. However, this argument was finally adjusted last autumn. Unexpectedly, when the decisive battle in the Pacific is imminent, the unified operation between the two countries in the Pacific has reappeared. Recently, this was also an important issue at the Anglo-American diplomatic talks held in London. This can also prove the urgency of this fact. In short, the United States is still wary of Britain and the Soviet Union expanding their influence in Europe after the war in Europe and the isolation of the Pacific operation. Therefore, it wants to strongly carry out the decisive battle with its direct enemy at the same time as the European war, but Britain wants to fight against Germany. Therefore, Britain and the United States are opposed to each other because of their respective interests.

### Japanese Forces Occupy Enemy Airfield in Bougainville

Zürich, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the Western Ukrainian front, the Soviet army launched an offensive in the mud, and special motorized units continued to attack the German positions. The entire front stretches four hundred miles from Lviv to the Dnieper River. The current battle situation is tense. Marshal Yegorov wants to achieve a decisive victory with this offensive, so he attaches great importance to it. At the same time, the German troops under General von Manstein are taking advantage of the Soviet army's attack on the Kamenets-Podolsk area to launch a fierce attack from the west and southeast. Auxiliary countries reinforced from Poland and Romania are also continuing to arrive on the front lines. It is also said that powerful Soviet artillery units have begun shelling the German positions on the outskirts of Vinnytsia.

Lviv, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from the Eastern Front: The Ukrainian front of Marshal Koniev's troops operating southwest of Kherson in the Dnieper River is echoing the offensives of Yegorov's army in the Ternopol area and Malinovsky's army in the Krivoy Rog area, and has launched a major offensive, confronting the German army on a front of about one hundred miles long from Uman to the northwest of Kirovograd. The entire line of about four hundred miles from Ternopol in the north to Nikolaev port on the Black Sea in the south has become a major battlefield for the Soviet and German armies. It is also said that the left wing of Yegorov's army is moving south along the railway line from Starokostiantyniv to the city of Proskurov, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near the Kurashirov station, thirteen miles north of the city. The German army is using electric machine guns and other new weapons to launch a fierce counterattack.

A Soldier's Account of the Great London Air Raid

The German Air Force began to bomb London fiercely from January 22nd. The scale of the bombing far exceeded the Great London Air Raid of 1941, totaling eight times and dropping 6,000 tons of bombs. The residents of London were greatly panicked. German correspondent Hart, Mr. Jansen, participated in the air raid and published a report entitled "A Soldier's Account of the Great London Air Raid" as follows:

Advancing in the Dark Night

In the dark night sky where nothing can be seen, bombers formed a battle formation, turned off their lights, and flew empty. Below, on the dark sea, red buoys could be vaguely recognized. Steering towards the west, the buoys were the enemy capital, London. The English Channel was passed safely and uneventfully. Soon, we approached the coast of the British mainland. Fierce anti-aircraft artillery shells exploded; searchlight beams shone like lightning, blinding the eyes; and British fighter squadrons came to intercept us, using direction finders to detect our squadron's location. —A silent battle began. However, this was only a silent battle in the eyes of the pilots, because the noisy engine sounds drowned out all other sounds. We safely broke through the enemy's first line of defense. We were already over London. Below was the enemy capital.

London that night was completely different from before. The intensity of the anti-aircraft fire was far greater than during previous air raids on London. Countless searchlight beams shone on us. But all the bomber crew members who came together were young men full of vigor, and they all had experience bombing London seven times, so they ignored the fierce ground fire, stared ahead, and advanced towards their intended target.

London Ablaze

Our bomber squadron arrived over the bombing target on time, within one minute of the order. An order was given, and all the high-performance large bombs were dropped one after another. We saw flames soaring into the sky everywhere in London, turning into a sea of fire. Some of the bombs dropped by my plane seemed to hit oil depots, causing pillars of fire 1,500 meters high, scorching the black night sky red. "London Ablaze," "Burning London Hell," we cursed as we danced in the sky above the burning field.

Engaging with the Fire Net

The heavy bomber we were on flew over the firing West City, continuing to its original target, a ship. Suddenly, a bright flash of money shone into the plane. Failure, we were hit by a searchlight. Bright searchlight beams chased us closely from the left and right. My plane was like being in the daytime, unable to hide. Anti-aircraft shells exploded in front, behind, left, and right, turning into a brown black, flowing behind. Now, the driver's skills and courage hold the key to engaging with the ground fire. Soon, we still returned to our German home port at the original scheduled time. We returned safely to the base. The expression of the warrior who reported to the headquarters was also very bright and happy. Soon, friendly planes also arrived one after another. The roar of the engine and the laughter rose together. (Note: From the March 2nd Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

Rome Water Supply Cut Off After Repeated Air Raids

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the enemy planes carried out the twenty-second and twenty-third air raids on Rome, the water supply in Rome was cut off on the 11th. Three of the four major pumping stations were hit by bombs. Long queues of people lined up to collect water next to the faucets where the tap water had not yet stopped.

Situation in Southern Italy

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - This afternoon's German war report stated: Enemy outposts in Italy are becoming active again. South and southwest of Cassino and north of Ciesina, the enemy launched an attack under the cover of heavy artillery. Our planes bombed the port of Anzio, heavily damaging a 1,000-ton transport ship.

The Pope Broadcasts Yesterday

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United Press reported: The Pope is scheduled to deliver a speech in St. Peter's Square in Rome at 3:00 PM today. Twenty-two loudspeakers have been set up. Four hundred churches will ring their bells at the same time before the speech begins. The German military authorities and the Italian municipal authorities have taken various preventive measures and dispatched cars to transport refugees to the square to participate in the grand ceremony.

Anglo-American Diplomatic Offensive Shows Failure

German Commentary on Irish Incident

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Regarding the Irish government's resolute rejection of the American request, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement yesterday, stating that due to the pressure from the anti-Axis countries, we were reminded of the recent pressures on Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Argentina, Finland, and other countries. However, up to now, the diplomatic efforts of the anti-Axis countries can be said to have been completely frustrated. Judging from the recent attitude of the Turkish people and media, one can understand that the results of their offensive against Turkey have not achieved any results. At the same time, the Argentine nationalists who cannot tolerate the oppression of the United States have risen up to establish a new government. Spain is also unwilling to succumb to the oppression of Britain and the United States and continues to adhere to neutrality. At the same time, Finland's refusal to succumb to the anti-Axis camp can also be seen from recent facts.

Meeting to Be Held Soon for Anglo-American Adjustment of Relations

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuter reported: Well-informed sources in London said that negotiations on Anglo-American mutual relations will begin soon. These negotiations will be initiated by the US Undersecretary of State Stettinius. Stettinius will represent the US government in London. Stettinius recently told reporters that the anti-Axis countries must not abandon the principle of mutual assistance.

Turkish Parliamentarians Hold Secret Meeting

Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Turkish Republican People's Party members suddenly held a secret meeting here on the 10th, drawing various discussions. The reason for the meeting is unknown.

### Solemn Commemoration of the 19th Anniversary of the Passing of the Founding Father Yesterday, Municipal Government Held Tree Planting Ceremony to Pay Respects to Mausoleum from Afar

Yesterday marked the anniversary of the passing of the Founding Father. All circles in Shanghai flew flags at half-mast in commemoration. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government also held a solemn tree-planting ceremony yesterday morning. Present were the heads of various bureaus and departments under the municipal government. Secretary-General Zhao, on behalf of Mayor Chen, performed the rituals. After silently praying and paying respects to the Founding Father's mausoleum, a report was given, elaborating in detail on the teachings of the Founding Father and the significance of the commemoration. At around 11 o'clock, everyone went to the open space in front of the Economic Bureau to plant trees. After taking a photo, the ceremony concluded with the uplifting sound of military music.

Municipal Party Headquarters Issues Proclamation to the Public

The Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special Municipality, in commemoration of the 19th anniversary of the Founding Father's passing, held a solemn memorial ceremony at 10 a.m. yesterday, jointly with all working comrades of the China Youth Model Corps' 4th Detachment, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League General Association of China, etc. Chairman Liu Shanyang personally presided over the ceremony. In the afternoon, personnel were dispatched to various public places to distribute a proclamation to the public, the original text of which is recorded below:

Refine Resolve and Vigilance to Fulfill the Legacy

Today, in the 14th year of the Republic (1925), is the day the Founding Father passed away in Beijing. It has been exactly nineteen years now. Looking back over this long period, what have we accomplished in fulfilling the Founding Father's legacy? We should constantly refine our resolve and vigilance to fulfill the Founding Father's legacy.

Today, on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of his passing, coincides with the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. At this moment, we deeply feel the greatness of the Founding Father, with his foresight and long-range vision, having foreseen the arrival of this era. Therefore, he earnestly instructed us with "Asia is the Asia of Asians," and gave a detailed description of the Eastern way of benevolent governance and the Western way of hegemonic governance, saying, "Advocating the way of benevolent governance is to promote benevolence, righteousness, morality, and to influence people with justice and reason. Advocating the way of hegemonic governance is to coerce people with guns and cannons..." Now, Europe and America are using their hegemonic power, arrogantly and recklessly, to harm our Asia. Taking China alone, the oppression and suffering we have endured since the Opium War are too numerous to record, nearly a century. Even our friendly nation, Japan, was the same as China before the Meiji Restoration. However, after the Restoration, it strived for strength and abolished unequal treaties. Therefore, the Founding Father regarded the Meiji Restoration in Japan as the starting point for the rejuvenation of the entire Asia. Later, Japan's victory over Russia greatly shook the Asian nations. In the twenty years since then, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Arabia successively achieved independence, and all Asian nations united.

Strive for the Final Victory in East Asia

The era that the Founding Father hoped for has finally arrived, and it has reached the final, crucial juncture. How should we accomplish this great mission? What is gratifying is that the unequal treaties, which the Founding Father never forgot, have been abolished with the assistance of our allied nation Japan, which treats us as equals, and the concessions were returned last year. Extraterritoriality has been abolished, and all unequal treaties have been eliminated. This can comfort the spirit of the Founding Father in heaven. In the future, we should work harder, follow his teachings, and cooperate with our allied nations to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

The Greater East Asia War is a conflict between European and American hegemony and the Eastern way of benevolent governance. Therefore, our country's participation in the war is not using violence to assist violence. The Founding Father explained this reason most clearly: "To influence Europeans with benevolence and righteousness and to ask the Europeans in Asia to peacefully return our rights is like seeking the skin of a tiger, which is impossible. To completely recover our rights, we must resort to force." Therefore, this war is to use force to recover our rights, not to invade others. The Founding Father also said: "Hegemony must submit to the way of benevolent governance." Therefore, our entire Asian nation, with hundreds of millions of people, uniting and fighting against the hegemonic Britain and America, will surely make them submit.

The Greater East Asia War has now reached the decisive stage. Our allied nation, Japan, is shouldering the responsibility at the front lines, and we have an unshirkable responsibility in the rear. However, Chongqing's blind resistance war has dragged on until now, destroying almost all of the existing resources and the budding industry. Now we must rebuild, which requires redoubled hard work and diligence. Moreover, the economy is a crucial part of the total war. Therefore, the most urgent task in the rear is to increase production. From this, we ask all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and the industry, as well as our party comrades, to unite and shoulder this major mission to fulfill the responsibility of the rear.

Hope the Public will Rise up Unitedly

The Chongqing government's resistance war is using violence to assist violence. The suffering we have endured from the resistance war in recent years is countless. This disastrous measure that harms the country and the people not only violates the teachings of the Founding Father, it is a betrayal of the Founding Father and a betrayal of the entire Asian nation. Recalling that when the Founding Father entered Beijing in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the Beijing government sent two representatives to welcome him. At that time, Duan Qirui had just sent documents respecting treaties to the foreign ambassadors. When the Founding Father learned of this, he sternly said to the two representatives: "I am outside to abolish the unequal treaties, but you in Beijing insist on respecting those unequal treaties. Why is this? If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, and you are afraid of those foreigners and want to respect them, then why are you here to welcome me?" Think about it, isn't the current Chongqing government exactly the same as the Beijing government at that time? They want to rely on Europeans and Americans to fight for independence and autonomy, which is like seeking the skin of a tiger. Look around at reality again, and the right and wrong, gains and losses, are self-evident. Since we admire the Founding Father, we hope that all the people of the country, starting from today, will rise up unitedly and awaken the Chongqing government, turning around and realizing their errors, and jointly march towards the bright path indicated by the Founding Father, in order to defend East Asia and complete the rejuvenation of China.

### Smallpox Discovered in the Xinzha Road Area

Following the discovery of smallpox in the Western District, several households in the Xinzha Road area of District One have recently also been found with smallpox. It is understood that this phenomenon has already attracted the attention of the Hygiene Bureau. In addition to instructing some hygiene branch offices to increase the time for vaccinations, mobile vehicles have been dispatched to check vaccination certificates along the road, and those without certificates are forcibly vaccinated. At the same time, the Industry Bureau believes that the Xinzha Road area and its neighboring roads are areas with a concentration of factories, and the prevalence of smallpox poses a threat to the hygiene of the factories. Therefore, it has been decided to start this week to vaccinate all workers in factories in the area.

Preventive Injections for Meningitis

Recently, the prevalence of meningitis in the city has become increasingly active. The health authorities have formulated measures to deal with it. In addition to instructing residents to pay attention to cleanliness, they have also designated health branches to inject preventive vaccines. Since the population of Shanghai exceeds four million, it is difficult for the health authorities alone to carry out injections universally. Therefore, it is best for various industrial and commercial organizations to carry out preventive injections for their employees and their families within the possible range.

### Rice Control Committee Rectifies Internal Personnel

Since the Rice Control Committee held its first joint meeting, it has planned to rectify the soundness of internal personnel. Recently, internal personnel have been reorganized. It is reported that fifteen members of the preparatory committee will resign. Regarding the procurement plan for this year, the Rice Control Committee will adopt a policy of emphasizing quality over quantity. In other words, the number of procurement merchants in Areas A and B this year will be reduced from more than three hundred to about one hundred.

### Motor Vehicles to Reissue New Permits

The current twelfth term of motor vehicle operating permits in this city will expire at the end of this month. Car owners who wish to continue to use their cars must obtain an application form before the 18th of this month (those who obtained licenses from the Public Works Bureau should obtain the form directly from the Bureau; those who obtained licenses from District One should obtain the form from the Taishan Road Central District Office of the Bureau), fill in the reasons, and request the issuance of the thirteenth term of the permit. It is learned that the Municipal Public Works Bureau and its Central District Office are actively carrying out the review procedures and preparing to reissue the new permits starting from the 21st of this month.

### Vegetable Sales Must Comply with Price Limits

Recently, various vegetables have continued to be transported to Shanghai. Moreover, during the Spring Festival period, vegetables grow particularly quickly. In addition to the Central Market continuously transporting vegetables, farmers from the suburbs are also carrying vegetables to Shanghai to sell at stalls in various small vegetable markets. Therefore, the supply of vegetables is very plentiful, but the market price is rising steadily. It is reported that the relevant authorities will strictly control the price increases. In the future, the market price of any vegetable sold must comply with the prices posted in the market. Deceptive practices are prohibited, otherwise, punishment will be meted out.

Singers Respond to Aircraft Donation Campaign by Holding Singing Competition

### Friendly Society Suffers Bitter Defeat to Overseas Chinese Football Team

3-5 action deviates from the course of the Shanghai League A football match. In a brilliant game between the Friendly Society and the Overseas Chinese, which occurred yesterday morning at ten thirty at the Yiyuan Field, ten thousand people were present and it was incredibly packed, with fans overflowing everywhere, reflecting the great appeal. Yesterday, the course of battle, due to excessive tension, resulted in a small number of players acting erratically and almost causing an unpleasant ending. Luckily, the organizers made every effort to mediate, and the battle hastily concluded, which was a blemish on an otherwise good event. The Friendly Society, due to insufficient strength in the later stages, lost to the Overseas Chinese by three goals to five, and from now on, the Friendly Society's hope for the championship is slim. The first half was a draw. The referee was He Chunhui.

Each Team Ties with One Goal

The Friendly Society kicked off, with the Overseas Chinese playing with the wind. The Friendly Society's entire army advanced, and Overseas Chinese's Maicheti inadvertently touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui took the shot, and the ball hit the right corner, and the Overseas Chinese's first gate was broken. After five minutes, the Overseas Chinese launched a major counterattack, with fierce momentum. Zheng Yingquan made a strong save, almost causing a comic own goal. At the 30-minute mark, Overseas Chinese's Kapaiwei broke through the center, pulled his leg and fiercely kicked, but Liu Xianhan got the ball and then lost it again, resulting in a one-on-one tie. The first half temporarily came to an end.

Launch Fierce Battle In the sound of renewed battle, the game still unfolded as a fierce struggle. Qu Yongfu intercepted the ball and accidentally hit his arm, resulting in a free kick. Overseas Chinese's Bao Jie took the kick and hit the target in one go. In the ninth minute, Friendly Society's Wu Qixiang took advantage of the enemy's internal weakness, alone and unaided, and snatched back a goal in the chaos, again making it two to two. Overseas Chinese's Mainiti once used an excellent move to grab Xu Wenkui's penalty area kick. Fei Chunhua diagonally shot from the border, and the Friendly Society instead took the lead with three to two. Good fortune does not last long, and Gao Baozheng fouled, resulting in a free kick. Liu Xianhan strongly blocked a corner kick, but unexpectedly disaster struck, and Li Tiansheng headed the ball poorly, and Bao Jie made it three goals each. Later, misfortune befell the Friendly Society, and Kapaiwei struck a decisive blow, contributing to the victory, causing the Friendly Society players' tempers to rise. Tuoshalini scored another goal, adding fuel to the fire, and the battle gradually deviated from the right track, and the fighting became incongruous. Later, it hastily ended. Overseas Chinese finally defeated the Friendly Society with five to three. Overseas Chinese: Mainiti, Luo Xulai, Maicheti, Pai Jiani, Xiladi, Xuewei, Taibili, Aotuoshalini, Taike Nike, Kapaiwei, Baojie, Weilalianyi: Liu Xianhan, Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng, Qu Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Zhou Qilin, Fang Jin Wenkui, Wu Qixiang, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in the City Stabilized Last Week, Hoarders Sold Off Stocks at Reduced Prices

The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in this city have stabilized last week after a period of turmoil. In the past two months, large-scale hoarding of goods and soaring prices have caused unrest in society and the people's livelihood. Most of the funds have accumulated on domestic goods. Therefore, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, the government suddenly took severe measures. In addition to intensifying investigations into hoarding and cracking down on it, the Central Bank of China tightened interbank lending. That is, any applications for lending from firms used for hoarding major commodities or for making major commodity mortgage loans are strictly rejected. At the same time, restrictions were placed on firms using their own funds to underwrite major commodity mortgage loans. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has also begun to implement inspections of financial institutions' loan businesses. If it is found that funds are being used to underwrite major commodity mortgage loans, which may encourage hoarding, the authorities will be notified immediately for strict action.

Therefore, starting last week, several firms were unable to sell off their hoarded goods, and their funds suddenly felt the strain of being unable to turn over, resulting in a stranded situation. Fortunately, the Silver and Money Trade Association devised a way to help them sell off the hoarded goods at reduced prices to compensate for the losses, and they were able to overcome this difficulty. After the Central Bank of China continued to maintain the proper interbank lending business, the financial institutions' rocking wind was finally calmed, and credit gradually eased. Most hoarders, fearing that the authorities would find out, confiscate, and punish them, sold off their stocks at reduced prices, and prices continued to fall. Therefore, in the past week, stock prices continued to fall, and rice, coal, and all daily necessities saw a decline of more than 20%. If the authorities can continue to enforce restrictions on mortgage loans and investigate hoarding, prices will continue to fall.

### All Commercial Trades Open as Usual Today

The Silver and Money Trade Association requires that all businesses, in accordance with the association's holiday schedule, will not be closed for the anniversary of the Founding Father's death. Therefore, today (Monday), all businesses will be operating as usual, except for national banks.

### Various Silk Weaving Factories in the City Seek to Increase Production

Cloth stores in the city have stopped selling cotton cloth for half a year, making it difficult for people to purchase clothing. The reporter recently learned from the silk industry that due to the inability to purchase cotton cloth, the demand for silk in the market has greatly increased, and various silk reeling factories and weaving mills are now striving to increase production. According to reports, the silk weaving factories in the city once suffered a setback after the incident, but now the factories that have been shut down have resumed production one after another. At the same time, due to the good harvest, raw materials can also be continuously obtained. However, production is currently limited by electricity restrictions, so production has not yet reached its highest level. It is also learned that the stock of silk in this city is quite sufficient, and the factories are continuously delivering goods. Therefore, the large quantities are gradually flowing downstream, but the retail prices in the retail stores have not fallen.
