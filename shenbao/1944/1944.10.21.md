### A Public Letter to Mr. Yujie:

It is a great pleasure to learn of your visit to China for inspection. Confucius said: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" We share the same joy as Confucius in your tireless efforts and long journey. What we are delighted about, what we welcome, is that your visit is out of concern for China, especially concern for the Chinese people.

Within China, besides the Nationalist Government in Nanjing, there are also the Chongqing government entrenched in the southwest and the Yan'an government entrenched in the northwest. These two political forces are undeniable facts. Therefore, objectively strengthening the Nationalist Government to create a national political center is indeed necessary. However, it is also necessary for the Nationalist Government to grant the people the minimum political demands. Otherwise, the people's tendencies will inevitably become more dispersed, and the Nationalist Government's power will inevitably be further reduced. There are two ways to strengthen the national government. One is internal, using talent only. It is undeniable that the current weakness of the national government is the lack of talent. The lack of central talent makes it difficult to exert leadership, which affects provincial and county-level politics. Because of the lack of talent, people generally lack political beliefs, and politics is not on track. The second is external. China's closest international relationship is naturally with Japan. Therefore, the national government's desire to strengthen itself is deeply connected to Japan's cooperation. We believe that since China and Japan are allies and have confidence in winning the Great East Asia War, after Japan implements its new policy toward China, and since the nation expects China to be independent and autonomous, the Chinese authorities should assume full responsibility for independence and autonomy. Except for military affairs and materials closely related to military affairs, which should be handled by Japan, the Chinese authorities should independently manage all political and economic measures that the Chinese authorities can manage. At the same time, the Japanese authorities should fully trust the Chinese government's ability to manage independently. In this regard, we have always believed that, except for military affairs, the less direct contact Japan has with the Chinese people, the better. In other words, the mission of the Nationalist Government should be to enable the people in the peaceful areas to improve their feelings towards Japan day by day, and thereby extend it to the whole country.

The current economic crisis in China has reached an extremely serious level. The Chinese people have always been accustomed to hard work and endurance, and they do not have excessive expectations. The past thirty years have been plagued by internal strife, and they have always endured it with forbearance. Especially in this war to liberate the East Asian nations and eliminate the Anglo-Americans, the people can endure all the pain that should be endured in wartime. However, in the past two years, the most contradictory phenomenon has been the disparity between the rich and the poor. The extremely wealthy have become wealthier, and the extremely poor have become poorer. The difference is too great, and both the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor cannot support the war. Those who can cooperate in the war are the general salaried class and intellectuals, but the lives of the salaried class and intellectuals have reached an extremely dangerous point. How to enable those who cooperate in the war to obtain the minimum living requirements is indeed the most important issue for the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

Cooperating in the war, at the current stage in China, only means contributing materials, and the source of materials depends on production. If there is no production, the materials will inevitably run out. The Chinese people are not lazy. For the sake of life and to cooperate in the war, they are willing to work hard to produce. However, the essential elements of production are security, raw materials, power, and transportation. These items cannot be resolved at the current stage in China without Japan's genuine cooperation.

We have carefully observed that in the past two years, China has only regressed and not progressed in both politics and economics. From the people's perspective, we hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will earnestly reflect. If they cannot examine the failures and shortcomings of the past and seek a path to innovation, then we cannot ignore the greatest hidden crisis at present, which is the spread of the poisonous flames of communism. Therefore, to eliminate the poisonous bacteria of communism and reverse past policies, the most important thing is to ensure that political and economic measures take into account China's national conditions and the people's sentiments, so that we can gain the central support of the people.

You are a veteran of the political circles and an authority in the economic circles. This time you come to China, the expectations of the Chinese people are particularly deep. Standing in the position of the people, I dare to express my accumulated feelings and present them to you. I respectfully ask for your attention. I am very fortunate.

Chen Bin, October 21, 1944

### Fierce Bombing of British Fleet by Japanese Aircraft off Nicobar Island; Four Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, and Destroyers Sunk

O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 20th: On October 19, Japanese air units intercepted enemy British mobile forces attacking Car Nicobar Island in the Nicobar Islands. In the sea area south of the island, they sank one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaged one battleship and one destroyer.

O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The mobile force under Vice Admiral Ozawa, which arrived in the Indian Ocean, attacked the western sea area of Car Nicobar Island in the Eastern Nicobar Islands on the 7th (the day the Halsey Force invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines). On the 17th, 18th, and 19th, they repeatedly attacked with carrier-based aircraft and artillery fire. The Japanese air force immediately launched a fierce attack, sinking one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaging one battleship and one destroyer. The progress of the battle is as follows: At around 9:00 AM on the 17th, more than 20 enemy aircraft attacked. At the same time, three enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and several destroyers appeared in the sea west of Nicobar Island. At 10:30 AM, they bombarded the Japanese airfield and harbor for more than two hours. After a fierce battle, the Japanese side shot down three of their ships. They appeared in the sea west of Nicobar Island and began bombarding the western coast of Nicobar Island for about an hour at 2:00 PM. At 9:30 AM on the 19th, enemy carrier-based aircraft and two battleships, two aircraft carriers, and three cruisers began bombarding Nicobar Island. They stopped the bombardment at around 12:00 PM and headed south. At around 12:00 PM, the Japanese air force launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet, resulting in the sinking of one enemy destroyer and one aircraft carrier. The Japanese air force hovered over the enemy aircraft carrier for a week and dropped more than ten bombs, all of which hit. The enemy aircraft carrier immediately emitted black smoke. At the same time, the middle of the ship was hit by two torpedoes launched by Japanese torpedo planes, so it was instantly surrounded by thick smoke and sank. In addition, Japanese aircraft damaged one battleship and one destroyer in the sea west of Nicobar Island. In the air battle, the enemy lost more than four aircraft.

### At the Tokyo National Convention, the Japanese Prime Minister Delivered a Speech Proclaiming to China and the World the Unwavering Belief in Destroying Britain and the United States

O Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government and the Aid-the-War Society, in order to launch a major national movement to ensure victory in the decisive battle, aim to form a central headquarters for the national movement in the center. This is the first strategy of the powerful decisive victory movement, and in order to universally launch the movement to eliminate Britain and the United States, a national convention to destroy Britain and the United States was held by the central headquarters at the Tokyo Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM on the 20th. The meeting began at 1:00 PM, with Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of Home Affairs Odate, Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu, Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, Minister of the Navy Yonai, Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose, Minister of Finance Ishiwata, Secretary-General Ando, and other members from the government side, as well as Kobayashi, the head of the National Political Association, and other members in attendance. The meeting was presided over by Ando, the head of the Aid-the-War Society's group department. After the formalities were completed, Kinmitsu, the director-general of the Aid-the-War Society, delivered the opening address, followed by a speech by Koiso, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and President of the Aid-the-War Society. The content was full of the spirit of decisive victory and unwavering determination, and proclaimed to China and the world the steadfast belief in destroying the United States and Britain. Next, General Kobayashi Seizo, the President of the Aid-the-War Society, and Okada, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, successively delivered passionate speeches, revealing their firm belief in victory in the war. The meeting concluded at 3:00 PM. Seize the Initiative in the War

O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the National Convention are as follows: The decisive battle that the people have been waiting for has finally begun. The battle that will determine the future destiny of the country has begun. The great results obtained in the extremely short period of three or four days are rare examples in the history of warfare. No matter how much Britain and the United States boast about their wealth in material resources, they must feel deep pain from this damage. It goes without saying that many neutral countries and small countries in the Axis camp that are collapsing will find it difficult to quickly determine the disadvantage of the Axis side in the future development of the international political situation, given Japan's strength. In particular, the countries and peoples of Greater Asia will, due to this great victory, be even more aware of Japan's inevitable victory and the inevitable completion of Greater East Asia's construction. However, we compatriots must remember that this victory is the result of the prelude to the decisive battle. The real decisive battle begins from here. We can only respond to this fierce battle with an even more fierce battle, fighting directly until the enemy forces surrender. Only in this way can we seize the initiative in the war. Burma and the Philippines have both achieved independence and have been liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States. As for East India, it will also achieve its long-awaited independence in the near future. In addition, we will provide full support, both materially and mentally, to the Provisional Government of Free India led by Chandra Bose, with the hope that the independence of India, which has been lost, can be restored in the near future. All these are manifestations of Japan's external spirit. Chinese and Japanese People Should Understand Each Other

Among the two major countries in East Asia, one is Japan and the other is the Republic of China. The fact that incidents have occurred between these two countries is due to the conspiracies of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese Incident can be said to be an unfortunate event on the road to establishing peace in East Asia. However, in China, due to the efforts of enlightened people such as Wang Jingwei, Japan's true intentions have been understood by the general public. Since the conclusion of a firm alliance with the National Government, the past temporary conflicts have instead made Sino-Japanese relations even stronger. Today, the two countries can cooperate with each other under the covenant of sharing life and death, and complete the Greater East Asia War. I am one who has a full understanding of the Chinese people's desire to achieve independence. The Japanese people may not have fully sympathized and understood the Chinese people. Although this is a difficult fact to deny, the Chinese people should also understand Japan and the Japanese people, and understand what the real obstacles to the revival of East Asia are. What Japan seeks from China is neither rights and interests, nor economic monopoly, nor the expansion of territory. What we hope for from China is that China will regain its due awareness as an East Asian nation, build an autonomous, independent, and truly powerful country, and become the core of East Asia alongside Japan, coexisting and co-prosperity, and contribute to the progress of East Asia. Therefore, Japan has first returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights to fulfill the Republic of China's long-standing wishes. Although Japanese troops are still fighting in China this month, this decisive battle is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army. Even the Chongqing army, which does not rely on British and American forces, is not regarded as an enemy. The Chongqing side not only failed to recognize the true enemy of China itself, but was instead manipulated by the true enemy, and launched a futile resistance against Japan, causing the true enemy to become more and more rampant. Regarding this point, I deeply regret it. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will quickly awaken from their dreams, think deeply about the true nature of the various incidents that have occurred continuously in East Asia, and immediately restore their awareness of reviving East Asia. The Will of the People in the Rear is Clear

The enemy is very anxious because the foundation of our revival of East Asia is becoming increasingly solid. They are pouring all their efforts into quickly defeating Japan and eliminating East Asia, and are taking murderous actions, disregarding justice and humanity, and resorting to all means to inflict tyranny and abuse. As a result, the Philippines finally declared war, because only by expelling them from East Asia and expelling them from the world can the world peace be expected to be realized. In addition, the will of the people in the rear has recently become clearer, and the desire for production is also increasing day by day. The people's genuine efforts to increase production have promoted the increase in the value of military production. If the people in the rear can have this kind of spirit and effort, the production of aircraft and other weapons will naturally achieve a leap forward increase, and as a result, they will be able to achieve the great result of eliminating the violent enemy. If we only compare the quantity with the enemy, the strength of the enemy is several times greater than that of Japan. However, quantity cannot determine everything in the war, because the tactic of fighting the few against the many is Japan's specialty and unique skill. If we can plan well, we can still win even if we are at a disadvantage in quantity. There are countless examples of this. Moreover, in today's Japan, where technological innovation is changing with each passing day, we should not be pessimistic even in terms of quantity. Defend the Last Line of Defense of the Homeland

Today, the enemy has attacked the last line of defense for defending the Japanese homeland, but from our standpoint, we are now in an advantageous position. The closer the enemy gets to our strong position, the more we can use aircraft from mobile bases to encircle the enemy from all sides and defeat them one by one. Conversely, the enemy is suffering from double obstacles. However, our strategic posture must wait until the aircraft and other weapons have been enriched to a considerable extent in terms of quality and quantity before we can achieve full results. Today is the time for us to look up to Kusonoki Masashige's expedition to Minatogawa and seize the moment of divine assistance. Today is the time for us to arouse the fighting spirit of our predecessors to overcome difficulties, and for 100 million people to do their duty faithfully.

### The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the United States in the Philippines Has Begun; More Than 20 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

O Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the US military invaded Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines on the 17th, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines began. Before the US Third Fleet began its attack on the southwestern Japanese islands and Taiwan, it declared that this attack was a preliminary operation for the invasion of the Philippines. Its main purpose was to weaken Taiwan's strength and avoid it exerting its power as the first-line fortress in the Pacific and an important aviation base in the southwestern Pacific. However, the US military underestimated the power of the Japanese air force and the air force strength of the army and navy bases, and suffered unexpected heavy losses in the attack on Taiwan. However, the US military still mistakenly believes that half of its operational objectives have been achieved, which is what we should pay attention to. The power of this annihilation is a mobile air fortress. Its greatest advantage is that it can use the tactical principle of defeating fleets or bases one by one. After the Japanese army lost [partial air control] over the Pacific islands, the US military used it as the greatest tactical reason. However, after most of its 58th Task Force was annihilated, the US military's greatest strategic and tactical advantage in offensive operations in the Pacific was largely lost. The US military's strategic advantage has been sacrificed. In fact, before the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines was decided, the US military's strategic mobility advantage had already been lost. Therefore, the elite of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in the Philippine fortress have been completely assembled and have unparalleled combat strength in the Pacific. Whether the United States launches a frontal attack or Roosevelt launches an attack before the election, the Japanese army has long been prepared. The US military consumed 115,000 tons of shells and bombs in capturing the Marshalls, and sacrificed 45 ships in attacking Taiwan. Looking at the Philippine fortress, which has a large number of air bases, a large number of army and navy elites, and 110,000 square kilometers of land, how huge a sacrifice will the US military have to make if it wants to attack? Today, it seems that they should be aware of this. O Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft's attacks on the Philippines are still extremely stubborn. On the 19th, a total of 260 carrier-based aircraft attacked the Manila area, as well as Clark Field, Corregidor, Bakyet, Iloilo, and other places. The Japanese base units fiercely attacked them, shooting down 19 (including 7 unconfirmed) and damaging 5. Japanese losses were minimal.

### The Value of the Taiwan Sea Battle is Comparable to the Pearl Harbor Sea Battle – Talk by Japanese Military Expert Ito

O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The well-known Japanese military expert Ito Masanori recently gave a speech on the results of the sea battle off Taiwan, the gist of which was that the Japanese navy's achievements in the sea area east of Taiwan, no matter what stage the battle situation is in, are unprecedented and worthy of commemoration. The enemy's formation of the mobile force this time was centered on aircraft carriers and protected by battleships. After the aircraft carriers were sunk by the Japanese army, the enemy naval force lost its central main force. According to the enemy's use of aircraft carriers as the main battleship, which began in 1942 in the Solomon Sea battle, it has recently become more obvious to station aircraft carriers in the center of each battleship and use battleships to protect the periphery. This time, in the waters off Taiwan, the enemy aircraft carriers were severely damaged, and their value and results are comparable to the Pearl Harbor sea battle. Secondly, from the perspective of the eventuality of the operation, the former gave the enemy a head-on blow at the beginning of the war, and the latter thoroughly struck the enemy's main force when the people's desire to win the war reached its climax. Therefore, its timeliness can also be compared with its value. In addition, in the former, the Japanese army used the Shanghai air force and carrier-based aircraft to create a world record. The latter used the aviation base to complete its great record. Secondly, in terms of rationality, it can also prove that Japan is capable of tactical and strategic warfare. With Japan's current production and the mutual cooperation and concentration of forces between the Japanese army and navy, the fact that this great result was achieved makes the author very happy. The conditions for future victory are already in our possession. If we can maintain these conditions in the future, we can naturally be sure of victory. Although the enemy boasts of its material quantity, its soldiers are extremely limited. A sea battle can lose tens of thousands of trained soldiers, which is of course no small matter for the enemy. Due to space limitations, I cannot review the reasons for the enemy's defeat here, which is a pity, but the most obvious thing is that the enemy's intentions in both strategy and tactics were wrong. They have forgotten the inherent weakness of aircraft carriers, and when they exceed their limits of use, they will inevitably be exposed, and they will encounter many failures. The enemy wants to cover up these weaknesses and can re-launch an attack on the Philippines, because its aircraft carrier power still retains two-thirds, but if it continues to launch an offensive, the inherent risk is extremely high. Since the conditions for victory have been grasped by the Japanese people, we must promote them and wait for the opportunity for a decisive battle to come with a firm belief.

### Wang Kemin Broadcasts for the Great Victory in Taiwan

O Beiping, 20th (Central News Agency) – Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave a radio speech at 7:40 PM yesterday (the 19th) because the Allied forces in Taiwan had achieved great results. The gist of the speech was: This time, the navy in the eastern sea of Taiwan, with its large mobile force, attempted to disrupt the peace and order of the Pacific. After being thoroughly attacked by the Allied forces, it was frustrated and collapsed. The Japanese army has achieved unprecedented results in this naval battle against the United States. We are delighted to hear the news of the victory in the front and, in addition to expressing our respect to the officers and soldiers in the front, we are more determined in our belief in victory. The enemy United States has suffered heavy losses this time, and its will to fight has been completely lost. In the future, it may be even more helpless. Therefore, this victory of the Allied forces not only destroyed the fleet of the enemy United States, but also made the enemy United States lose its will to fight, and won a double victory. In this year of decisive battle, the great and glorious results of the Allied forces and the good news have shown signs of completing the war, which is a matter of celebration for us.

### The Ministry of Finance Adopts Reasonable Countermeasures to Stabilize Finance and Commodity Prices Among Financial Institutions

○Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The National Government's financial authorities, in order to curb commodity prices and stabilize finance as urgent wartime measures, have been actively working and repeatedly adjusting for several years. Recently, however, the rise in various commodity prices has been fierce, leading to unstable financial fluctuations, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. The Ministry of Finance authorities, recognizing this, have adopted reasonable countermeasures. Given that Shanghai is the center of our country's finance, they will start with Shanghai to clear its source. In accordance with Article 12 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions by the Ministry of Finance, a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality has been specifically defined. It is predicted that after the implementation of this framework, Shanghai's finance will move onto the right track and become stable. At the same time, general speculative trading can also be eliminated, and commodity prices will not be unduly stimulated, leading to endless increases. Commodity prices in various regions can also be curbed as a result, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. The remarks of Finance Minister Zhou and the framework for the operations of financial institutions are recorded below: [L Finance Minister Zhou's Remarks>

The Minister of Finance made the following remarks regarding the formulation of a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality: [An investigation into curbing commodity prices and stabilizing finance reveals that these are urgent wartime policy measures. The Ministry has been working hard and adjusting its efforts in stages. Recently, commodity prices have been rising more rapidly. Shanghai is the center of our country's finance. To implement the above-mentioned countermeasures, it is necessary to start with Shanghai to clear its source. Therefore, fifteen articles of a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality have been specifically formulated for implementation. The main points of this framework are as follows: 1. Regulations are established to distinguish the amount of deposits of financial institutions and set standards. Those who fail to meet the prescribed amount will be allowed to increase capital or merge, so that both their own interests and the strengthening of policy implementation can be taken into consideration. 2. Regulations stipulate that the deposit payment reserve shall be 30% to ensure their payment ability. 3. Restrictions on loans are imposed to prevent speculation or hoarding. All accounting books should also be handled in accordance with regulations. Important staff must have considerable qualifications. After the promulgation of this framework, it is hoped that all financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality will understand the content and earnestly comply with it to assist the government and fulfill their respective responsibilities, so that the use of funds can be brought onto the right track. In this way, even if commodity prices rise due to wartime supply shortages, they will not be unduly stimulated and rise endlessly, and finance will also be stabilized. The benefits will be significant, and all relevant parties will be optimistic about its success. As for financial institutions in other regions, the Ministry will consider the situation and stipulate procedures for implementation at any time, in order to strengthen them consistently and achieve complete success through one trend.

### The Negro Problem in the United States Has Erupted

— He Ling

[According to reports from Washington, a conflict between whites and blacks suddenly occurred in Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry. The conflict lasted for more than 24 hours, resulting in a bloody scene resembling a civil war. Finally, the army was dispatched, using tear gas and tanks, and the situation was only subdued on the morning of the 22nd. According to the police authorities' investigation, 25 people died (including 20 blacks), more than 700 people were injured, and more than 1,300 people were arrested for allegedly participating in the riot (mostly blacks).] (Asahi Shimbun, Lisbon Special Dispatch, June 22) Cases of Riot

Detroit has a population of 1.6 million, including more than 120,000 blacks. It is the fourth largest metropolis in the United States, with major automobile factories such as Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler located there. A considerable number of black laborers in these factories are now manufacturing airplanes and tanks for the war. In the past, disputes between blacks and whites have continuously occurred due to housing problems and other issues. The famous Swift incident also originated here. It began when a black doctor, Swift, spent 18,500 yuan to purchase a beautiful house in a residential area of Detroit. When Dr. and Mrs. Swift moved into their new home and furnished it with new furniture, both inside and out, the whites demanded the Swifts moved out. When Swift refused, the whites resorted to violence to achieve their goals. Hundreds of rioters gathered in a square near the Swift's home at the appointed time, shouting curses at blacks and throwing rubble at the house, damaging doors and windows. Not satisfied with this, the rioters broke into the house, destroying furniture and tearing curtains. In the midst of the chaos, gunshots suddenly rang out, killing one rioter and wounding another. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the patrolling police officers arrested Dr. and Mrs. Swift separately and detained them in the army camp. After strict interrogation at the police station, they were eventually charged with murder. After this incident, thanks to the pro bono defense of Clarence Darrow, a famous lawyer from Chicago, Dr. and Mrs. Swift were declared innocent. However, incidents of oppression, discrimination, and insult against blacks have continued to occur. Racial Animosity

The racial animosity of Americans toward blacks originated in the so-called Reconstruction Era in the United States. During the Civil War, the Northerners, angered by the South's stubborn resistance and the assassination of President Lincoln, took advantage of their victory to grant blacks the same voting rights as whites. As a result, the political power of blacks in the South increased sharply, and the Southern whites rose up in opposition. Taking advantage of the chaotic state of the South, some troublemaking whites, mostly from the North, entered the South. As a result, the southern states became increasingly chaotic after the defeat, falling into a completely unmanageable state. The government then dispatched troops to restore order. The whites in the South still vehemently oppose treating the blacks they used as slaves as equals, and this animosity toward blacks has since led to various inhumane incidents. Therefore, the persecution suffered by blacks seems to be even more severe than in the slave era. The Ku Klux Klan's uprising is one example, and the uniquely American act of atrocity known as lynching is another. Due to the self-reflection of the Americans themselves, the number of these violent and heinous acts has decreased significantly in recent years, but even in the most frequent years, there were only about 200 cases a year. From 1885 to 1932, over 48 years, a total of 3,161 lynchings were carried out against blacks and 985 against whites, for a total of 4,146 cases. These inhumane acts that disregarded the law were carried out openly. In cases of lynching by the mob, after the offender was arrested and awaiting legal sanctions in the detention center, the mob would destroy the detention center, drag the offender out, or seize the offender during the escort and carry out the lynching. Therefore, even if it was not decided whether the offender was a true offender, the mob acted on mob psychology. Recently, there have even been cases of people being tied to large trees and strangled to death. In the past, blacks were tied to trees, and the crowd, partly for amusement, would shoot at them with shotguns and pistols, taking pleasure in the victim's groans. After death, the body was untied, and hands, feet, and other essential parts were cut off for sport. In some cases, the offender was burned alive, and the crowd cheered at their suffering. In the past, blacks who were lynched were mostly accused of raping white women or other crimes.

The KKK, or Ku Klux Klan, is a secret organization founded in 1866 in Tennessee, in the southern United States. Its members are spread throughout the United States. It was initially organized with the purpose of preventing blacks from advancing politically and socially, but later it extended its reach to whites, carrying out violent sanctions. In recent years, its activities have tended to be quiescent. The KKK was originally anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish.

### Soviet Troops Penetrate East Prussian Territory, Street Battles Underway in Belgrade

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: After the Moscow anti-Axis staff talks were held, the Soviet forces launching the offensive have indeed greatly increased. Soviet tanks and troops from the Puszta plains are continuously arriving at the East Prussian border, and the enemy's numerical advantage is also gradually increasing. The fighting in the Mēmelė and Raseiniai regions on the northern edge has temporarily stalled, while fierce battles are raging on both sides of the Kaunas-Stalobolonaya highway. The German front line between Kalvarija and Širvintos extends north and south, from Mēmelė to Suwałki. The German troops defending East Prussia have repeatedly repelled Soviet attacks, and the enemy has consistently failed to penetrate deeply into the German echeloned defenses. Although Soviet troops from Virbalis have entered Prussian territory and occupied Eitkūnai, the main German defense line remains intact, and German reinforcements have been dispatched to encircle the penetrating Soviet troops. On the southern Puszta plains, tank battles are ongoing in the Satornoujhely-Trebišov-Grossewardein triangle. Although the outcome is unclear, the enemy's original plan to penetrate the north has failed. The German retreat in the Carpathian region is continuing.

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues in the Belgrade area. Soviet troops are attempting to crush the German counterattack, and the focus of the fighting has now shifted to the south. There are street battles in the city, and communist guerrillas, after their failed insurrection, are now also participating in the street battles. The Soviet attempts to break through the German bridgehead have all been repelled. Fierce fighting is raging in certain parts of the city, with every inch of territory being fiercely contested.

### Germany's War Aims Are to Fight for Freedom, Goebbels Publishes Essay

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the German magazine "Die Woche" that we are sparing no effort to strive for victory, for the sake of our descendants. The war of today must have an end one day, and whether our nation can thereby gain freedom or become the slave of others depends on whether our country can win. If we unfortunately lose the war, we will never be able to raise our heads again, because sovereignty is a prerequisite for the survival of a country. The enemy makes no secret of its goals. Although the Soviet Union and the Anglo-Americans use different means, their purpose is the same: to enslave the German nation forever.

### Helmond Becomes the Focus of Western Front Fighting, German Counterattack Near Aachen

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out: If there is a focus of fighting on the Western Front, then the Helmond area is perhaps the closest. The American penetration into this area may be a prelude to a major battle. The situation in Aachen has changed little. German troops are defending houses on the outskirts of the city, and every plot of land is being defended with all their might. German troops are still launching counterattacks, attempting to break through the encirclement of Aachen.

Another report: Enemy troops in the Aachen area are slowly entering the city from three sides and have reached the main train station. However, German troops in the city center are still resisting. American troops in the northeast of the city were forced to retreat by a German counterattack.

### New British Landing Attempt in Dutch Territory

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues at the mouth of the Scheldt River. The First Canadian Army was unable to gain a favorable position on Wednesday, either in the Breskens area or on the Beveland Peninsula. On the Tholen-Tilburg highway, Canadian forces are also increasing pressure. The main force of the British Second Army is still in the Nijmegen area. Its extreme right wing, after occupying Venray, is advancing towards the German bridgehead on the Maas River. Looking at the Dutch battlefield, the enemy has been attacking Antwerp for a long time without success, and the general offensive of the British Second Army has been delayed for too long. With the imminent start of adverse weather conditions, the enemy may temporarily abandon the fighting at the mouth of the Scheldt River and land near Rotterdam or Amsterdam instead. At the same time, they will launch a general offensive on land to support each other. The American First Army will also participate in this general offensive. The American attack on Maastricht the day before yesterday may have been a warning.

### Moscow Conference Concludes, British Prime Minister on His Way Home

○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Moscow Conference may have concluded yesterday, and even Churchill is already on his way home. Regarding rumors that Churchill intends to return to Rome from Moscow, the spokesman believes that it is closer for Churchill to return directly to London, as Churchill will deliver a speech in the House of Commons this week on the Moscow Conference. The spokesman then answered a question regarding the relationship between the Anglo-Americans and the Soviet Union, stating that during the war, the internal disputes within the anti-Axis powers would certainly not become public. Given this statement, it seems that the Kremlin's position is not as solid as expected, so Stalin may have made some concessions. In short, the main goal of the anti-Axis powers is to weaken Germany, and their internal disputes will be postponed until after the war. At the current stage of the war, only military decisions are possible, and Germans know that this definition cannot be avoided.

### More Than 10,000 Indian Congress Party Members Released

### Detour for Vehicles During Air Defense Training, Air Defense Headquarters Issues Traffic Guidelines

The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command recently issued a statement regarding vehicles passing through air defense training sites, stating: [During repeated civilian air defense training exercises, vehicles with special traffic permits or vehicles belonging to various air defense teams have repeatedly rushed through the fire prevention, rescue, and evacuation sites at extremely high speeds, much to the regret of the civilian air defense workers. At this time, when military officers and civilians are working together to establish a winning posture, this situation should be deeply considered by those concerned. From now on, the following matters should not be carried out, and cooperation from the military is also hoped for. 1. Vehicles with special traffic permits and vehicles belonging to air defense teams should not rush through training sites directly but should detour. 2. Civilian air defense organizations should pre-mark white lines to allow pedestrians to know the training locations in advance. 3. If there is no detour, except for unavoidable events, passage should be waited for until after the end of training. ]

### The New Federation and Two Other Groups Pre-Celebrate the Lecture Convention, to Be Held Consecutively for Three Days Starting Today

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has exerted its martial prowess, repeatedly defeated the British and Americans, and advanced toward victory. However, the enemy Americans do not realize this and still hope to reverse the decline. Recently, in order to seek re-election as president, Roosevelt did not hesitate to mobilize troops and blindly attacked Taiwan. Fortunately, the bravery of the Japanese soldiers completely annihilated the main force of the American Pacific Fleet, thereby laying a foundation for certain victory. The news spread, and the entire nation was delighted. The Shanghai Press Federation, the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, and the Civic Welfare Association, in order to awaken the people of the country and concentrate their total strength to completely eliminate the British and Americans, have scheduled a "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention" to be held continuously for three days starting today (every afternoon at 2:50) at the Grand Theater. Three-Day Program

On the first day, Colonel Matsushima, head of the Fleet Reporting Department, and Chen Binhe, a standing member of the Municipal Advisory Committee, will speak, and the Chinese film "Reunion" will be shown. On the second day (22nd), Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Chinese Naval Academy, and Captain Iida of the Naval Attaché Office will be the main speakers, and "Reunion" will continue to be shown. On the third day (23rd), the lectures will be given by Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, head of the Army Reporting Department, and Huang Jingzhai, a director of the Press Federation and chairman of the month. Music and songs will be performed by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and famous Chinese and Japanese singers will sing. Admission tickets to the convention are all non-sale items. Institutions and organizations that wish to participate may prepare an official letter and request them from the Shanghai Press Federation at 160 Great Shanghai Road (from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM today). However, for the sake of limitation, each unit is limited to five tickets, until they are given out. Furthermore, the original name of the "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention" was "Civic Viewing and Celebrating the Great Victory on the Taiwan Sea Lecture Convention." Now, because the results of the war are gradually expanding and good news is constantly coming, the "Great Victory on the Taiwan Sea" numbers are not enough to express the meaning of its complete victory, so it has been specially renamed the "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention."

### Anniversary of the Establishment of the Indian Government, Overseas Indians Celebrate Today

Today (the 21st) is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India.

In addition to holding a grand flag-raising ceremony, Chatterjee, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, Captain Naren, a Free Indian Army trainer, and representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, and Germany will speak. There will be a grand parade along Nanjing Road to the Bund, across the Garden Bridge, along North Sichuan Road, and into Shanshan Road to the Free Indian Army training camp in the city. As for the 24th, the first anniversary of the Provisional Government of India's participation in the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, there will be a review ceremony of the Free Indian Army in the city at 3:00 PM. The branch has asked representatives from all walks of life in the city to participate.

### Security Command Captures Kidnappers

Recently, in the Datuan township area of Nanhui, under the jurisdiction of this city, the Special Task Force of the pseudo-bandit Zhu Yamin, led by Wang Ziying, has been hiding, specializing in kidnapping and extortion, harming the local area. In early September, Song Linmei, the owner of the Song Dingti pressing factory, a wealthy merchant in Datuan, was kidnapped by this bandit group. After being kidnapped, Zhu, within the bandit group, signed checks from Hongchang & Xie and United Shenzhuang in this city, totaling more than five million yuan in national currency, to be used as ransom. This matter was discovered by the investigation team of the Municipal Security Command, which immediately sent personnel to wait and investigate at Hongchang & Xie and United Shenzhuang. As expected, on September 25th, a pseudo-bandit named Zhang Jinfu went to Hongchang & Xie to cash four checks totaling 200,000 yuan. He was immediately arrested and interrogated. According to his confession, he was a soldier in the Special Task Force of the pseudo-bandit Zhu Yamin, and the checks were distributed by the leader Wang Ziying in the kidnapping case of Song Linmei. In addition to the suspect being sent to the military court for trial, orders have been given to continue secretly investigating and arresting the remaining fugitives to eliminate the harm to the people. Furthermore, there are still a large number of checks signed by the victim Song Linmei in this case (including amounts of 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000, but most are for 10,000 yuan), scattered around Datuan in Nanhui and Fengxian, being used as chips. It is hoped that merchants and residents in various places will refuse to use them to avoid being implicated.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Moves to Datong Road

The Police Consumer Cooperative of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has moved to the original site of the former Economic Security Office on Datong Road because the original location at the racecourse was insufficient. The cooperative is actively promoting the procurement and distribution of essential daily necessities. The first batch of rice has been distributed, and the second batch is being planned. Requests for assistance have been made to relevant authorities to improve the lives of police officers.

### Flour and Wheat Control Committee Selects 32 Flour Mills to Operate

The Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce Control Council believes that the mission of wartime industry is to gather all efforts with limited raw materials to achieve maximum efficiency and collaboratively complete group strategies. The flour milling facilities of its affiliated factories total 46,064 accumulating hours. According to this year's procurement plan, the required milling capacity is estimated at 25,323 accumulating hours, only 54.9% of the total capacity of all factories, indicating a significant surplus in factory capacity. After a thorough review of each factory's milling performance, electricity consumption, and geographical conditions, the committee has decided that starting in October, within four months, according to the adjustment plan, 32 factories will be selected to continue operating, while the remaining factories will temporarily cease operations to save resources and facilitate reorganization. The committee will provide maintenance fees to the closed factories to cover daily expenses. These factories should constantly maintain and improve their facilities to be ready for operation if designated. Factories that cannot operate due to various reasons or those with outstanding procurement performance exceeding the planned quantity may immediately resume operations without interruption. It is reported that the closed factories after the reorganization include: in the Shanghai area, Fuchang Old Factory, Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Dongfu Factory, Huayou Qiangshen Factory, and No. 32 and No. 4 Factories; in the Wuxi area, Anfu Factory, Huada Old Factory, Huada New Factory, and Huajiucheng Factory; in the Changzhou area, Zhaozhou Factory; and in the Hupou area, Gaoyou Factory and Xinfu Factory, totaling twelve factories.

### Shanghai Station of Songhu Long-Distance Bus Relocates

### Health Bureau Begins Clearing Garbage in Nanshi

The accumulation of garbage in Nanshi has been an extremely difficult problem to solve for several years, closely related to street sweepers, tools, garbage collection contractors, and management methods. It is reported that the Municipal Health Bureau, since the unification of the municipality, has decided to thoroughly clear the garbage in order to improve the city's appearance. In addition to increasing the wages of street sweepers to ensure they can work with peace of mind, yesterday morning (the 20th), the cleaning section chief Cao Zhiming led inspectors and foremen to clear garbage along Zhonghua Republic Road in Nanshi. They are scheduled to depart again at 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 22nd) to continue the work.

### Japanese Residents of This City Held a Lecture Yesterday Celebrating the Great Victory off Taiwan

Following the frequent reports of the triumphant victory of the valiant Japanese Navy in the waters east of Taiwan, annihilating the enemy's Pacific main fleet, the people of East Asia are all exhilarated. To reaffirm their determination to eliminate the enemy Anglo-Americans, the Japanese residents of this city, our allied nation, held a "Total Pursuit and Elimination of the Enemy Pacific Fleet" lecture at the Hongkou International Theater at 6:30 PM yesterday (the 20th). A large number of Japanese residents attended enthusiastically. Speakers included the head of the Matsushima Fleet Reporting Department and Consul General Yano, with the theme "The Divine Opportunity Has Arrived, the Time to Eliminate the Enemy." The audience was visibly inspired.

### The Enemy American Operation in the Pacific Has Fallen into a Dead End: Statement by Department Chief Matsushima Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon (the 20th) at 2:30 PM, Department Chief Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department of our allied nation Japan in Shanghai, made the following statement at the regular press conference regarding the perilous situation of the enemy American Pacific main force: The enemy American fleet's strength is greatly diminished.

The recent movements of the enemy Americans in the Pacific involved deploying forces from both the north and the south. The northern force was Halsey's Third Fleet main force, also known as Task Force 58, while the southern force was Spruance's Fifth Fleet, which also possessed a considerably strong transport fleet. Initially, Halsey's fleet aimed to lure the Japanese Combined Fleet into battle with its attacks on Okinawa and Taiwan, while the southern Spruance Fifth Fleet, after Halsey's fleet succeeded, attempted to advance to the Philippines in one fell swoop. Since the fighting from the 12th to the 18th, Halsey's fleet has suffered losses of over 57 ships and over 1,000 aircraft, with personnel losses exceeding 30,000. The enemy's southern force has also been attacked by the powerful Japanese air fleet and has suffered considerable damage. Moreover, the strength of the enemy's southern force is weaker than it was during the attack on Saipan, making it easy to defeat. The combined forces of the enemy in the north and south account for 85% of the entire American navy, with the remaining small portion stationed in Europe. This fleet is inferior to the one in the Pacific and even less capable. The maximum force that can be used in the Pacific is only 40% of the force used to attack Saipan at that time. The future war situation is extremely important.

It is imaginable how difficult it will be for part of the enemy American fleet to operate in Leyte Gulf in the future. The Americans, having learned from the Battle of Saipan, believe that air power based on aircraft carriers is more advantageous than air power based on land. However, the current shift in momentum is due to the fact that the enemy's air force has lost most of its aircraft carriers. Furthermore, the Philippines is many times larger than Saipan, and Japan's air power exceeds that of the enemy Americans by a considerable margin. Therefore, if the enemy Americans attempt to invade the Philippines, they will undoubtedly be sending themselves to their deaths. Additionally, the difficulty in replenishing the enemy's forward bases means that they cannot advance or retreat easily. The future war situation is extremely important. It is deeply hoped that the Chinese people will not be misled by the enemy Americans and should thoroughly cooperate to complete the war effort. Moreover, the enemy American propaganda is absurd and disorganized. If the American people could understand the true war situation, they would avoid battle and be unable to continue the war. According to an editorial in the New York Times on the 18th, India will become an important base for operations against Japan in the future, which shows that the enemy's war situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly desperate.

### Radio Subscription Fees and Reception Issues on National Radio Forums

— Cheng Wei

Recently, various newspapers have received letters regarding radio issues, mostly concerning subscription fees. As a professional radio repairman, I have seen more of the various problems that arise from radios. I will examine what I have seen and heard below: First, radio is a tool for education and entertainment. If used properly in peacetime, its function in modern culture can be comparable to that of movies, and this is no different during wartime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various private radio stations have been suspended, and uncouth language and market slang have been swept away. To strengthen the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, the Broadcasting Association was established. Its purpose is to awaken the public's awareness of the Greater East Asia War and confidence in victory. However, to this day, there has been no concrete propaganda or educational broadcasting, but rather some low-level, pointless entertainment programs have been produced. Second, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes. The Broadcasting Association can also be said to be a public utility, which can be regarded as the same as water, electricity, and postal services. However, other public utilities have never increased their fees tenfold within a year. Even as a form of taxation, it is rare to see such a huge difference within a year. Regardless of whether the people have the capacity to bear it, there should be room for discussion under the slogan of saving and increasing production. Third, incorrect reporting during wartime should be banned, as the authorities have stated in advance, and it is stipulated that the reception range should be 550 kHz to 1500 kHz as the legal reception band. However, some old-fashioned radios cannot receive all local stations, and wavebands outside of 550 kHz or 1500 kHz are often regarded as shortwave by the field personnel of the Broadcasting Association, who check and confiscate them. If you want to continue listening, they will have to take it away for modification. The modification fee is not the 25 yuan charged by the Broadcasting Association, and will certainly not be less than 25 yuan. Moreover, some field personnel have no radio knowledge at all. What can they find out? In short, this is all about using the convenience of public office to carry out illegal activities. The Broadcasting Association authorities certainly do not know this. I hope that they will pay close attention to this in the future and make practical improvements, which will be a great blessing to the people!

### Social Services: Anonymous Donors Respond to Various Initiatives of This Office; Small Education, Medical, and Aid Funds Urgently Needed

Yesterday, an anonymous person donated funds to support various projects of this office, including 10,000 yuan each for elementary school teacher medical assistance funds, poverty relief funds, orphans' assistance funds, and midwifery funds. Additionally, Mr. Zhong generously donated 10,000 yuan to the elementary school teacher medical assistance fund, benefiting the poor. We are deeply grateful. Recently, this office has frequently received applications from elementary school teachers, or their families, for medical assistance funds, often due to pulmonary diseases, requiring significant expenses and long-term hospitalization. The lives of elementary school teachers are originally the most difficult. How can we not offer assistance when they are suffering in bed? Especially since recent medical expenses are very high, the need for funds is particularly urgent. We hope that people from all walks of life will show compassion, enthusiastically contribute, and continuously donate, so that teachers will benefit. How small will the benefit be?

Shanghai Zheshao Hospital Donates Free Medical Vouchers.

The Shanghai Zheshao Hospital was established through donations from fellow Zhejiang and Shaoxing natives. It has been in operation for two years. Initially, it was intended to provide convenient medical treatment for fellow natives. This year, Western medicine has been added, and anyone can be admitted, regardless of their origin. Recently, in light of the high cost of Western medicine and the rising cost of living, which causes many poor families to delay medical treatment due to financial constraints, 20 free medical vouchers have been prepared and entrusted to this office to be donated to the poor and sick. We will certainly do so and express our gratitude. Midwifery Associations Plan to Establish a Civilian Obstetrics Hospital.

Since its establishment, the Midwives Association of this city has been making every effort to advance the work of the association. With the support of Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Boyuan, and Chu Gongzan, plans are underway to establish a civilian medical hospital, which will provide free delivery services to extremely poor women.

### Generous Donations to the Home for the Aged

○ Target: 5,000,000 yuan ○ Deadline: November 10th ○ Collection Point: This Newspaper's Social Services Department

The Shanghai Home for the Aged, due to financial difficulties, has launched a fundraising campaign with a one-month target. In the past ten days, it has received enthusiastic support from the community. As of yesterday, donations exceeding one million yuan have been received, benefiting the population, which is truly admirable.

However, the target for this fundraising is five million yuan, and only one-fifth has been reached so far, leaving a significant gap. Considering the recent surge in prices, assistance is even more urgent. Therefore, we sincerely hope that benevolent individuals in society will continue their efforts and expand their donations. If with the help of all sectors of society, the elderly can be spared from cold and hunger, it would be an immeasurable virtue. Donation Report:

— By Iwata Yu, Translated by Hong Yang

[Without notifying her family, she actually ran away.] Ryufu was greatly surprised when he heard his younger sister say this.

(This fellow is copying my old habits again. Really, I can't handle her.) [You want to go to dressmaking school? Or a women's university? Father and mother will definitely agree!] Ryufu said angrily, but his younger sister simply offered a lonely smile without answering.

Thinking of his parents' worries, Ryufu unhesitatingly took off his formal attire and rushed to the telegraph office to send a telegram to his parents. When he returned, he saw that his younger sister was already wearing mourning black. [I'm going to attend the memorial service for the martyrs. You wait here for a while!] After Ryufu said this, his younger sister quietly said: [You're going too.] [Yes.] His younger sister's voice had an irresistible strength. (Oh, there's no way around it!)

Ryufu was planning to attend the family seats as a true friend of the deceased. So what if he went with his younger sister? At the same time, letting his younger sister wander around the streets of Tokyo on her own was not a solution. [You're really impossible! In that case, let's both attend the general memorial service! Hurry and get ready!] Ryufu said angrily. [Yes, I'll get ready right away. Let's go then!] Zhimei took off her jewelry and readjusted her black mourning dress.

The two immediately left. Since they were attending the general public seating area, it would definitely be very crowded, so they had to get to Hibiya early. Zhimei lightly lifted her purse, her hips swaying as she followed behind her brother. You couldn't tell she was a girl from faraway Kagoshima; her Western clothes were quite fashionable. Looking at this, Ryufu felt even more irrationally angry.

He stormed onto the streetcar, got on the bus, and didn't say a word to his younger sister. When they arrived in Hibiya, people were just starting to gather. Because Ryufu had inquired about the procession route within the Navy, he went to the Sakaimon gate facing Uchisaiwaicho to find a spot, as the procession would pass there on its way to the cemetery inside the park.

Zhimei sat down on the cement pavement, and Ryufu stood behind her. In the warm and sunny weather, the number of people was increasing minute by minute. (153)
