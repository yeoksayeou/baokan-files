### Adjusting the Control Organization

The issue of adjusting the control organization has been widely publicized. Recently, it has been decided to: Revise the list of controlled commodities, limiting it to daily necessities for people's livelihood. Separately establish various control committees as implementing agencies. Use the National Commercial Control Association as a comprehensive supervisory, review, and liaison agency, no longer directly handling control work. On the 14th of this month, the government announced the reassignment of Mr. Wen Lanting as Chairman of the Commercial Control Association, and the transformation of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee into the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, marking the first step in implementing the adjustment. After this adjustment, the control organization will become more sound and comprehensive. We are truly happy for the future of control!

Control work is an innovation in our country. There are no established rules to follow, and it is not customary for the people. In the past year or so, the hardships and difficulties faced by the Commercial Control Association have been understood and sympathized with by those who are familiar with the Association's situation. Mr. Tang Shoumin shouldered heavy responsibilities for more than a year, strictly disciplined himself, and was courageous in taking responsibility, enabling the control work to take shape. His contribution is undeniable. What is regrettable is that the work of purchasing cotton cloth has not yet been completed, and the disposal methods for new products have not yet been stipulated, so that those who rely on allocation are eagerly waiting, and factory owners are idle, affecting economic circulation and reducing material production. This is one aspect. How to stipulate the reserved quantity has not been announced; the amount of the approved quantity also lacks an absolute standard. Even if there is no ulterior motive, the reason exists, and the unevenness inevitably leads to speculation. Regarding the employment of personnel, there may have been a failure to select the right people, and some may not have deeply understood the Association's service creed of "impartiality and integrity," thus inevitably giving society cause for criticism. This is the third aspect. What is most regrettable is that after the Association was established, due to the divergence of government orders and the lack of uniformity in affairs, most of the time had to be spent on political coordination work. Therefore, the failure of the control efficiency to fully achieve the expected goal was also half caused by the environment. Although the control organization will be adjusted in the future, if the government does not find ways to solve the actual difficulties, then how can the adjustment of the control organization alone be effective? Therefore, whether or not there are measures for future control still depends on whether the government's orders can be unified and whether the Allied authorities can provide further assistance. In addition, we have four hopes for the control authorities themselves:

The most serious problems at present are food panic in Shanghai and the panic over daily industrial goods in the interior, both of which are in imminent danger. Circulation adjustment can not only solve the suffering of people's livelihood but also promote financial circulation.

Purchasing and allocation ultimately rely on production. Without production, purchasing and allocation are empty words. Therefore, the most important task of the control agency is to cooperate closely with the economic and administrative agencies to solve the suffering of the industrial sector as much as possible in order to promote the increase of materials.

Personnel issues are the most important issues for any organization. The reason why various control agencies in the past could not avoid social criticism is that personnel issues accounted for the largest component. Therefore, various control agencies, in the future, regarding the employment of personnel, in addition to talent, should especially pay attention to integrity.

This adjustment further demonstrates that the government fully trusts the leaders of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles and gives them autonomy. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles will recognize that the current situation is wartime and that we are facing a decisive stage, which is by no means comparable to peacetime. Those who have prioritized personal interests in the past should give them up immediately, and "selflessness and dedication to public service" should be the spirit jointly adopted by the authorities and various industries in the future.

The new Chairman, Mr. Wen Lanting, is a respected elder. Following Mr. Tang Shoumin, he has taken on heavy responsibilities. His spirit of being courageous in his duties is truly admirable. It is hoped that after taking office, he will adjust the internal structure, closely supervise his subordinates, so that the control work will become more perfect day by day, and the social and people's livelihood will become more stable day by day. This will not only make the control methods gradually gain the trust of society but also be a great blessing for people's livelihood!

### The Path Forward for Chinese Youth

— Yu Song Yuanti

Lecture given at National Shanghai University on the 6th of this month

In the next ten years, Japan will likely control England and America and secure resources in the South. For those ten years and the fifty years thereafter, Japan will continue its economic war against England and America with its friendly nation, China. China will become a producer for its own needs and for the market of 500 million people in Asia. The gold of England and America must be completely extracted from "Greater East Asia." Therefore, Japan and China must cooperate in production. In terms of food, China and Manchuria, in particular, must drastically increase their efficiency. Processing industries and heavy industries must also be developed. Therefore, Chinese youth should learn science and technology from Japan in the future. I hope that you will work hard in physics, science, mathematics, and other natural sciences. Shanghai has a Japanese national natural science research institute, which you should utilize.

I have a friend who is related to the Shanghai Municipal Government who once told me this: "I used to collect butterflies, but because my Chinese friends kept sending them, I and the English collectors became like brothers." This saying applies to all academic research. There are no national borders or ethnicities in natural science. Two plus two equals four in any country. The chemical equation for the composition of water does not change in Japan or China. Chinese university students often experience unfortunate events because they are young and energetic and engage in political movements. Being incited by the verbal propaganda of a few politicians does not make one a university student. This is because of insufficient self-awareness and a lack of academic research. If Chinese and Japanese university students can cooperate in natural sciences and spiritual sciences, which have the most in common, it will surely improve the culture of Greater East Asia.

Speaking for myself, my area of specialization is Buddhist studies. In particular, I study the history of Buddhism, and I also research Buddhist economic thought. There are many temples near Shanghai, and the organization, economic system, and thought of those temples are very interesting. This is the same in China, Japan, and even its homeland, India. Therefore, I can have pleasant conversations with these Buddhist scholars and lay practitioners, and the conversations are very harmonious. As a result, in less than a week, we have become as close as brothers of ten years. Because Sun Yat-sen and the early Chinese politicians were all well-educated, they were able to promote cooperation between China and Japan even in politics. Why is it that Sun Yat-sen was able to achieve cooperation between China and Japan, but some of his disciples cannot? Who knows the reason? On this point, I think everyone should consider it carefully. I especially hope that Chinese youth will consider it deeply.

After enduring for ten years, Japan finally declared war on its old enemies, England and America, so the relationship between China and Japan has become even clearer. Originally, these two countries shared the same written language and the same racial destiny and should have been cooperating peacefully in all aspects long ago, but they were constantly provoked and alienated by England and America. However, because of this "Greater East Asia War Declaration," the common enemies of Greater East Asia are now clear, so the future of China and Japan is tied to this "Greater East Asia." Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the idea of ​​worshipping England and America, which is hidden in the heart of obstruction, can be eliminated. Naturally, among the youth in China, there are still those who are good at English, or like to eat Western food, or like to watch Western movies. They have not yet been able to get rid of their dependence on England and America. Such young people should be said to be going against the times.

Cooperate to Expel England and America

Among them, there may be more sophisticated and realistic young people who will say, "England and America are powerful countries, and they may come back to be the kings of Shanghai again, so we must not do anything rash." I want to say that such thinking is not unreasonable. But if we do not expel the powerful England and America this time, they will never be driven out. Therefore, if China and Japan miss this good opportunity to drive England and America out of Asia, I am afraid that there will never be another opportunity. In this great war, Chinese youth are also participating. But what form should they take to participate in the war? I think it is good to go to Japanese military factories to learn to work, or to engage in food production in Central China, or even to assist in the rural clearing work.

Today, Japan is fighting England and America for China's autonomy, and I hope that everyone can endure for ten years. I dare to assert that the spiritual strength of the British and American people cannot sustain a ten-year war.

Perhaps my statement gives an arbitrary impression because I am enthusiastic about the relationship between China and Japan. But I definitely do not want to express casual opinions based on a good relationship with Japan. I hope everyone will consider it carefully. Among the youth, there may be those who admire foreign countries and rely on England and America. Perhaps they overvalue Western thought because of the educational undertakings run by Christian churches in China. But being blinded by Western thought is China's misfortune and a cause of discord between China and Japan. You all know the name of Confucius, but you do not seem to cherish the "Analects" very much. But no matter what, you are Chinese, and no matter what, Chinese people cannot become Westerners. In the end, they are still the people of the "Analects." Now is the era of displaying this Eastern spirit. In the future, you must delve into scientific techniques, and at the same time, you must have a sense of self-respect for Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism—these Chinese cultures.

Today, I was at the cafeteria and shared a table with a young Chinese man, and I asked him: Suppose there are three kinds of people: "First, those with power; second, those with property; and third, those with high virtue." Which of these three do you think is great? What do you think he answered? If he said that one of the first two was great, then I would want to remain silent; but he pointed to the third. I was very happy and shouted, "The spirit of China has not perished!"

Although some people criticize Chinese youth for engaging in political movements and utilitarianism, that is only a part of the youth. The Chinese, who respect Confucius and admire the Analects, respect "virtue." This classical spirit of China is alive. Why is Sun Yat-sen respected by young people? Mr. Sun did not leave behind any property, nor did he ever become a dictator. Mr. Sun, who had none of those things, was respected by the Chinese youth because he was poor but did not lose his integrity. That is where Chinese thought lies.

Two or three days ago, I gave a lecture on "The Spirit of New China" at the Shanghai Radio Station. At that time, I advocated explaining the "Three Principles of the People" based on the concept of the kingly way of politics in China's five thousand years of classical spirit. Among the youth, there may be those who think that Western philosophy, politics, economics, and science are the best, and that China's past civilization has become an unusable antique today. And they regard the Three Principles of the People as economic thought. Since the Three Principles of the People are the way of the sages, there is no need to create new slogans outside of the Four Books and Five Classics. It is only if one is careless that the classics become conservative and formalized. That is just specially repainting the classical container with a new color. Only when the true spirit of China appears can the new China be born.

### Limiting National Banquets to be Implemented Next Month, Welfare Bureau Convenes a Discussion to Discuss Methods

In order to meet the wartime system, encourage thrift, reserve materials, and enhance national power, the Ministry of Social Welfare specially formulated the Outline for Limiting Wartime National Banquets, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Supreme National Defense Conference for approval, and was promulgated and implemented by the National Government. Now, in Shanghai, national banquets are the most extravagant. The materials consumed and wasted by banquets every day are truly alarming. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to implement restrictions on national banquets in Shanghai. Yesterday (the 15th), the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau specially invited representatives from relevant agencies, social organizations, newspapers, and restaurants in the city to hold a discussion in the conference room of the bureau at 3 pm to discuss implementation methods. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun was also invited to participate in the training because of official business in Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:

Discussion Meeting

In addition to Minister Ding Mocun and Director Chen Dongbai, the participants included Municipal Government representative Ku Jingzi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun Yishe, Chief Secretary Hu Shouqi, and the heads of various departments, representatives from the First District Office Wang Yiyi, representative from the Economic Bureau Wan Shuhuang, representative from the First Police Bureau Zou Qinming, representative from the Second Police Bureau Qian Xuan, and representatives from various social organizations, including Wu Jieyu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ren Yunpeng from the Thrift Association, Liu Songtao and Zou Huaqing from the Restaurant Industry Association, and Yang Rongwu from the Western Restaurant Industry Association. First, Director Sun chaired the meeting, reported the significance of the convocation, and expressed his hope that everyone would express their opinions and earnestly promote it. Then, Minister Ding Mocun delivered a speech, followed by Ren Yunpeng, the representative of the Thrift Association, who expressed his opinion that the government's promotion of restrictions on wartime national banquets should be strictly followed from the perspective of the people. He hoped that the bureau would strictly enforce it in the future to rectify the extravagant atmosphere in Shanghai. Then, Liu Songtao, the representative of the Restaurant Industry Association, said that he was deeply moved by the government's hard work and would follow the order in the future. Later, it was decided that the restriction on national banquets would be implemented starting from July 1. Next, the price limit for frugal dishes will be reviewed and approved by the Social Welfare Bureau and the Economic Bureau in the future before being submitted to the Municipal Government for implementation.

Minister Ding's Speech

Main points of Minister Ding's speech: Thrift is to promote frugality and simplicity. Frugality is a virtue for individuals, the so-called "frugality to cultivate integrity." For a country, it can enrich national power. It is necessary in peacetime, and it is even more urgent in wartime to reserve materials and cultivate combat power. The opposite of thrift is extravagance and waste. There are many things that are extravagant and wasteful in society. The most obvious is banquets, the so-called "vermilion doors smell of wine and meat, and the road has frozen bones," "a rich family's banquet is half a year's food for the poor." The extravagance and waste of banquets has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more fierce today. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Welfare started from the most common and wasteful banquets in society to implement thrift, and formulated and promulgated the Outline for Limiting National Banquets. Because Shanghai has the most unnecessary banquets of this kind, it attaches great importance to the implementation of banquet restrictions in Shanghai. Seeing grand banquets, one table costs ten thousand gold, has become a common phenomenon in Shanghai. It is not only a waste of materials and a waste of natural resources, but it is also not necessarily beneficial to personal hygiene. Some people even think that social banquets are fearful. Then what is the meaning of banquets? The reason is actually a reflection of the hypocritical psychology of the host, thinking that insufficient delicacies cannot show respect, and insufficient grand banquets cannot be called extravagance. The so-called show is very big, and they imitate each other, competing for luxury, and becoming a custom. Therefore, to implement frugal banquets, we must first break this psychology, and regard abundant delicacies and grand banquets as shameful and despicable. Everyone should abide by it, and slowly it can be changed. In this wartime, all countries attach importance to thrift. In particular, the Japanese people, their serious life and spirit of self-discipline, are admirable. Compared with our country's people's frivolity and extravagance, it is truly shameful. Therefore, the National Government lists the implementation of thrift as one of the important wartime social policies. It is hoped that the whole country will cooperate and implement it, starting from limiting banquets, in order to achieve universal realization. It is fortunate.

Limitation Outline

The Outline for Limiting Wartime National Banquets, which was approved by the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Executive Yuan, now lists its main points: Banquets are not allowed for birthdays, moving, engagements, funerals, and birthdays under the age of sixty. Wartime national banquet dishes should be as simple as possible, and luxury and noble items such as shark fins, bird's nests, bear paws, and abalone should not be used. In wartime banquets, each table should have 10 people as a principle. Each table of dishes, including large and small cold and hot soups, sweet and salty flavors, should not exceed eight dishes. However, if there are more than 10 people, one dish can be added for each additional person. If there are not enough eight people, the entire table of dishes cannot be used. In addition to the prescribed dishes, one snack can be added if no rice is provided, and no snacks can be provided if rice is provided. If it is Western food, each person should not exceed four colors except for coffee and fruit. The price of each table for Chinese food and each person for Western food shall be decided by the local Restaurant Industry Association and submitted to the Economic Bureau and the Social Welfare Bureau in special cities, and submitted to the county and municipal governments for approval and publication in counties and cities. It is absolutely forbidden to prepare foreign wine for guests to drink. If it is a lunch, tea should be used instead of wine, and any wine vessels are prohibited from being used.

### Applying for Rice Transportation Permits Exceeds Hundreds of Thousands of Stones, Shanghai's Future Food Supply is Gradually Booming

Since the authorities of this city approved the free transportation of food rice from five dou to ten shi, rice merchants have been enthusiastically requesting the Rice and Grain Control Committee to issue temporary permits, as well as rice merchants applying for permits to purchase food rice from various places. The quantity has exceeded hundreds of thousands of shi. The various parties involved in vegetable transportation and purchasing have been given extremely convenient conditions, and the food rice has already been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition, in order to accurately calculate the quantity of food rice transported into Shanghai, in order to provide a basis for studying future countermeasures, the association sends staff to various import ports every day to conduct on-site surveys and statistics. The daily quantity is about ten thousand shi, so the source is still considered to be booming.

### Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is Currently Being Closed

The Executive Yuan specially ordered Sun Zhongli to be the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Association, and Jing Shang Tai Zhong to be the deputy chairman. It is reported that the association is actively handling the closing of the previous affairs. The internal organization of the reorganized organization has been discussed and decided by the association, and it has also drafted a specific plan for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat this year, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is heard that in order to continue to promote the collection and distribution of flour and wheat, the association is proceeding with the purchase work as usual during this reorganization. In addition to sending staff to various regions to urge wheat firms and entrusted merchants to purchase barley and yuan wheat, as for the upcoming new wheat purchase business, as soon as the implementation plan for unified collection and distribution is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it will be implemented for purchase.

### Fundraising for Vagrant Labor Camp

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government of the Ministry of Social Welfare, in view of the fact that there are vagrants and hooligans everywhere in the city, which seriously damage the city's appearance and disrupt public order, has specially organized the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp to accommodate vagrants, educate and reform them, and force them to work, so as to engage in production. Now that the funding for the organization is huge, the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been asked to write to the industry associations, banks, money houses, factories, companies, and firms to donate generously. The fundraising methods are recorded below: All industry associations, banks, money houses, factories, companies, and firms in the city that donate 2,000 yuan at a time are Grade A, 1,000 yuan are Grade B, 500 yuan are Grade C, and those with capital of more than 10 million yuan donate 10,000 yuan to more than 100,000 yuan at a time. The donated funds are collected by the industry associations, and the receipts are distributed by the preparatory office. After receiving the funds, they are transferred to the designated bank every two days, and the deposit slip is sent to the office and forwarded to various newspapers for disclosure. All donations must be paid in full by the end of June.

### Enemy Aircraft Reconnoiters Shanghai, Citizens Should Step Up Air Defense

On the mornings of the 12th and 13th, enemy aircraft flew to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas for reconnaissance. However, the Japanese army was on strict alert, and the enemy aircraft did not move and fled. The Japanese defense authorities pointed out the following points yesterday in connection with this matter and urged the citizens to pay close attention.

The US Air Force in China has recently suffered a great blow from the Japanese Air Force, so it is currently trying its best to avoid a direct conflict with the Japanese army and is dedicated to conducting air guerrilla warfare behind the enemy. On the 12th and 13th, enemy aircraft sneaked into the surrounding areas of Shanghai, so an alarm was issued. At that time, the Shanghai citizens' air defense attitude was extremely calm and composed due to continuous training. This made the Chang Bureau feel at ease. At present, the enemy aircraft's activities are only reconnaissance flights, but in order to exert the effect of psychological warfare, the enemy aircraft may launch air guerrilla warfare in the future. Citizens must work harder on air defense, and should especially avoid being influenced by rumors and falling into the trap of enemy spies. Also, do not abandon the control of lights.

Short Commentary

### Coping with the Wartime Environment

Today there are two pieces of news that should be paid attention to: Enemy aircraft are coming to Shanghai for reconnaissance, and citizens should pay more attention to air defense. It is strictly forbidden for hotels to play mahjong late at night.

Although these two pieces of news are two different things, we believe that they have a related meaning.

First, enemy aircraft are coming to Shanghai for reconnaissance, and the authorities have pointed out the points that citizens should pay attention to. In this decisive battle stage, enemy aircraft activity is originally an expected thing and there is nothing to be surprised about. Special attention should be paid to the control of lights. Citizens must understand that the purpose of light control is to maintain their own safety. Since it is for their own safety, they should pay attention to it.

Second, we believe that it should have been thoroughly prohibited long ago to prohibit hotels from playing mahjong late at night. And its scope is not limited to hotels, it should also be extended to clubs and homes, etc. Mahjong is gambling, which wastes time and energy, wastes money and consumes electricity. From any point of view, whether it is light control, saving electricity, or practicing wartime life, it must be strictly prohibited. It is truly shameful to speak of wartime life if even this small matter cannot be thoroughly prohibited.

Shanghai is a wartime city and is currently facing a decisive battle stage. The Shanghai Municipal authorities and citizens should jointly cope with the wartime environment, pay attention to air defense, pay attention to light control, and the authorities should ban one by one all so-called "night entertainment" that violates the wartime environment and hinders air defense, and citizens should jointly restrain themselves.

### Lao Zha Sub-bureau Cracks Down on Small Gambling Den, All Offenders are Handed Over to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

In order to refresh the appearance of the Great Shanghai, the Municipal Bureau has the greatest determination to close the gambling dens in the South City on March 29. However, the general gamblers dared to sneak into the first district to secretly gamble and set up mobile gambling dens. The First Police Bureau had already paid attention and ordered the sub-bureaus to investigate. The Lao Zha sub-bureau received a report on the previous day (the 12th) that Zhang Weinan had set up a small gambling den in Lane 207 of Yunnan Road to gather people for gambling and draw profits. The sub-bureau chief He Dehui ordered Liu Junqing, the director of the judicial section, to send detectives to arrest them. The suspects were in the midst of calling out numbers, and the boss Zhang Weinan and gamblers Jia Fugen, Chen Xirong, Guo Guanliu, Zhong Qiurong, Su Fang, Lu Jueying, Liu Wenqing, Tan Xiao, Ju Deshou, Luo Lifen, Xu Jia, Luo Hua, Zhou Daqi, and Li Guohua and other fifteen people were arrested on the spot. After being brought to the bureau for interrogation, they all confessed to gathering for gambling. They were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and then transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law.

Strictly Prohibit Hotels from Playing Mahjong Late at Night

In addition, in order to earnestly maintain public order, the sub-bureau strictly prohibits hotels and inns from playing mahjong and singing loudly late at night in order to maintain peace. It has formally notified all hotels that during this long period of light control, passengers are restricted from engaging in any behavior that disturbs the peace after midnight (such as playing bamboo mahjong and other gatherings that cause noise, loud singing that is sufficient to disturb the peace of others, etc.). If passengers refuse to listen, the person in charge of each hotel shall report to the bureau and be punished with five days of detention in accordance with Article 35 of the Distant Police Penalty Law as a warning. If the person in charge of the hotel does not report it and is found out, the person in charge of each hotel will also be severely responsible and punished according to the law.

### Unlawful Merchants Detained are Temporarily Released on Bail

Since the establishment of the Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city, it has actively promoted economic security matters and has conducted strict investigations into the unlawful acts of merchants in various industries, such as hoarding and speculation, manipulating prices, and the unauthorized price increases and illegal profiteering of various stores. In recent days, it has detained more than 250 unlawful merchants of oil, fodder, rice, southern goods, northern goods, and various essential daily necessities. After investigation, it was found that some of the relationships were minor, and they were temporarily released on bail after finding a guarantor and issuing a guarantee. However, the office is still investigating the business behavior of each person. In addition, the office is continuing to conduct close investigations into whether there are any villains in various industries, and those who have them will be arrested and investigated in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood.

### Health Movement Conference Ends Successfully Yesterday, Director Yuan Expresses Thoughts

The Health Movement Conference in this city was planned by the health authorities and started activities on the first day of this month. The various tasks have been promoted by the guidance of the service personnel and the citizens on schedule, and the results are very good. In terms of the exhibition, the experience meeting, the election race, the horse race, and the ball game have failed to allow the citizens to visit extensively. The bureau has approved the extension of the exhibition until the 15th of this month. The exhibition has been held for half a month, and it is estimated that more than 300,000 citizens have visited it, which has achieved great results. Director Yuan of the Health Bureau expressed his thoughts on this Health Movement Conference as follows:

The purpose of the Health Movement Conference is to arouse the general citizens' concept of cleanliness and attach importance to public health, which is a concrete manifestation of health education. The Health Movement Conference held in this city was originally scheduled to be held on May 15. Later, the bureau believed that the Health Movement Conference held in this city in the past was limited to the old urban area. Now that the concession has been recovered and the municipal administration has been unified, it should be unified. It was decided to hold it jointly with the first district. The Health Movement Conference had to be postponed, and the various activities of the Health Movement in this city were promoted simultaneously in the first district, which is an unprecedented initiative in history. Although the various activities are related to the weather, they are still satisfactory. In terms of the exhibition, during this extraordinary period, financial resources and materials are insufficient, and there are still models and specimens of various public health matters, some of which have been lost due to the war and have not been made in time, so it is inevitable that they are incomplete. As for the health facilities in each district of this area, they are only introduced to the citizens for understanding by taking this opportunity, and it is hoped that the citizens will cooperate. In the future, no matter what is related to epidemic prevention measures and item inspection, they can be handled according to the law without hesitation, in order to protect the health of the citizens. However, the health movement in this city has been held more than ten times, and the citizens' actions that hinder health are still common, which shows that the purpose of health education has not been achieved. Therefore, the director of this bureau will supervise the responsible departments to actively promote health education in the future. As for the Winter Health Movement Conference, it will be held on December 15 in accordance with the regulations of the Military Central Government. The exhibition and various activities will be prepared regularly in the future, so the next conference will be more substantial. This Health Movement Conference has been assisted by the heads of various agencies and all walks of life. The association expresses its deep gratitude, and hopes that all walks of life will cooperate at any time in the future to make the health of this city even better and the health of the citizens can be protected. This is what I sincerely hope for.

### Welfare Football Game - Account Statement Published

The Social Welfare Department sponsors various welfare initiatives, which are subsidized by the department to maintain operations. Recently, due to rising prices, expenditures have increased sharply, making it more difficult to sustain these initiatives. Various welfare organizations have requested increased funding from the department. Therefore, Minister Ding of the department requested Shen Siliang, chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, and Pan Sanxing, vice-chairman, to take advantage of the Jin-Lian football team's visit to Shanghai to hold a welfare football game to raise funds for welfare. On June 3rd, the Football Association invited the Jin Lian team and the Donghua team to play at the racetrack. People from all walks of life in Shanghai enthusiastically supported the event. The number of spectators on that day was unprecedented. It was generally estimated that the number of 200-yuan seat ticket holders would be over 20,000, but the actual number of 200-yuan seat tickets sold was only 9,318, which was far from the actual number of people present. The reason for this was that the audience was overly enthusiastic that day, and there were too many people. Although the police cooperated, maintaining order was still difficult. Some people wanted to buy tickets but couldn't, and others seized the opportunity to enter without tickets, resulting in more than half of the audience being without tickets. The summary of income and expenditure for this welfare game is eight sheets, totaling 1,863,600 yuan. 203 1,000-yuan tickets were sold, totaling 203,000 yuan. 40 20,000-yuan honorary tickets were sold, totaling 800,000 yuan. In addition, 30,000 yuan was donated voluntarily, for a total of 2,896,600 yuan in ticket revenue and voluntary donations. However, 260,000 yuan of the honorary tickets have not yet been collected and are being urged. The names of those who donated voluntarily and purchased 20,000-yuan tickets will be disclosed in various newspapers in the coming days to express our gratitude. The allocation of funds will also be announced in the coming days after it has been decided. According to the person in charge of the Social Welfare Department, although the income of this welfare football game was greatly affected by the fact that more than half of the audience did not have tickets, the enthusiasm of the audience and the importance attached to sports, as well as the utmost efforts of the police to maintain order, and the wonderful skills of the Donghua team and the Jin Lian team, and the assistance of all the staff of the racetrack and the Football Association, are all deeply appreciated.

Yesterday's newspaper release time: 6:50 PM.

### Characteristics of the Air War in India and Burma

One of the characteristics of the recent air war in India and Burma is that the enemy uses fighter planes as the main force of combat. The reason for the change in the elements of naval warfare can be considered that after entering today's era of aerial fortresses, although the enemy used the so-called most excellent bombers, unified Type B24 and Boeing 17B class, to carry out air raids, the bombing effect and the expected damage were minimal due to the strong Japanese air defense. If this is the case, then today's phenomenon can be regarded as a temporary phenomenon before their bombers have further progress than today.

Fear of Japanese Aircraft Power

Although it is not known what kind of attacks the enemy will try to make in the coming rainy season, their fighter era itself has important operational significance and value for them. This can be seen in their current and future aerial tactical thinking and operational. The B24, the main force of the air raids, with the air raid on Yangon on December 1 of last year as the last, had already completely withdrawn from the stage of daytime air raids, except for using night or cloudy days to attack. As for the reasons, they are as follows:

If the bombers currently used by the enemy have a cruising speed of less than 500 kilometers and a practical altitude limit of less than 12,000 meters, then no matter how thick their armor or how strong their armament, they are definitely not the match for Japanese fighter planes. This is the limit of their performance.

Even with fighter escorts, the power of the Japanese interceptor fighters is much greater, which will hinder the movement of the escort fighters and make them fear that they will all perish together.

Even at the cost of sacrifice, not much effect can be expected on heavily defended targets.

Due to the advent of radio wave detectors, surprise attacks are almost impossible. The above is the tactical limit. In short, even if P31 and P38 are used to cover B24, it is difficult to break through the dense air defense line of Yangon and other places.

Performance of American and British Fighters

In this way, the so-called fighter era has appeared. Especially since the beginning of March this year, it has been nothing short of an era of fighter supremacy. From the ideal of carrying a large number of bombs to attack distant places and destroy key locations in one fell swoop, fighters are inferior to bombers, but in today's world, where interceptor fighters are the main force and various air defense weapons are mobilized, if you want to break into the aerial fortress circle, you cannot expect too much from existing models other than fighters. Because fighters have relatively superior speed and maneuverability, it is possible to intercept or fight against enemy fighters; furthermore, they can split up and find scattered individual targets and break them one by one. Looking at the actual situation of recent enemy aircraft attacks, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking the entire combat zone of the Fogon area and the Arakan area is about one hundred and several dozens per day, of which 90% are fighter planes. These fighters, which replace bombers and become the main force of long-range hammer attacks, are mostly American Lockheed P38 and North American P51, followed by British Spitfires and Buffaloes.

These are all enemy fighters that are said to be excellent. The P38 has a total load of more than one ton, a maximum speed of five hundred kilometers per hour, a practical rate of climb of more than nine kilometers, and is equipped with four 12.7mm machine guns and one 37mm cannon. It has a range of 1,400 kilometers (up to 3,500 kilometers) and is equipped with two 1,150 horsepower engines. It is a twin-engine aircraft. The P51 has a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a practical rate of climb of 11,400 meters, a range of 1,400 kilometers, and is equipped with six 12.7mm machine guns and one Allison liquid-cooled 1,160 horsepower engine. The Spitfire IX fighter has a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a climbing altitude of 12,000 meters, a range of 800 kilometers, and weapons include four 7.7mm machine guns and two 20mm cannons. The engine is a Rolls-Royce liquid-cooled engine. It is a high-altitude fighter with 10,000 meters. (The performance of the above aircraft is based on enemy announcements.)

Change in Formation

As mentioned above, the speed and firepower of these fighters have increased, and their climbing and high-altitude performance are also excellent, but their range is extremely short, so they must use the front-line bases where bombers are not easy to stay. Chittagong, Sylhet, Imphal, and Tinsukia seem to be their most powerful bases for invading operations, and their targets are mainly Japanese air bases. Until around March and April, they usually attacked in batches with formations of about ten P38s or P51s. The P51 intruded in ultra-low altitude flight, spraying the ground with machine guns, like a sprinkler. The attack is usually once a day. However, since May, there seems to be some change in the battle clouds.

This is because the damage caused by Japanese interception is more than they expected, and due to the rapid strengthening of Japanese aircraft production and the smooth supply, the Japanese military strength is becoming more and more abundant, and the damage they inflict on the Japanese side is too light. When they noticed this result, they believed that if they wanted to reduce the Japanese air power, they had to make it their first priority to shoot down Japanese aircraft and launch an air battle. Therefore, in addition to the same formation of about ten fighters attacking the ground, they also adopted the tactic of forming mixed formations of several types of fighters, with the fighters in the upper layer specializing in air combat. The air raid on the Middle Burma area 00 area on May 11 was divided into three layers, consisting of dozens of P38 (low altitude), P51 (high altitude), and British Spitfire (medium altitude) fighters. And their attack must be done at once, and they often come to air raid again in a short time, using the so-called wave attack. Also, due to the popularity of radio wave weapons and the lightness of fighters, they seem to want to respond to the firepower and Japanese situation and implement ad hoc attacks. However, such attempts have become futile due to the Japanese military's ever-changing and wonderful tactics.

Japanese New Aircraft Active

The above is a summary of the enemy air force's counter-attack tactics after entering the so-called fighter era, but looking back at the operations of the Japanese air force in Burma, the bombers have not withdrawn from the attack force, and they are still fighting bravely, giving full play to the original face of the bombers. This is due to the Japanese air force's prudent and subtle operations, the Japanese aircraft's strong offensive spirit, and excellent combat skills. However, it must also be admitted that the Japanese bombers' attack is not as easy as it used to be, and it is also a fact that the tasks expected of fighter planes are greater than in the past. In the past operations in Mayu, as well as in the current Imphal operation and the operation against the airborne troops, the great activities of the Japanese new fighter squadron are something that we should pay special attention to.

Furthermore, in today's world where the rear is constantly producing and replenishing, it is an absolute necessity for aerial annihilation warfare to make the aircraft and crew of the British and Americans perish together in aerial operations. In this sense, the significance of aerial annihilation warfare launched by attack and interception is obviously increasing. Recently, the war reports from various places in Burma that the air force's intercepting operations have protected and defeated many enemy aircraft are not inferior to the offensive and must be recognized.

Finally, in the current fierce aerial decisive battle, the importance of quantity is undoubtedly important, but what determines the final victory or defeat, no matter what, is always the quality of the crew and the performance of the aircraft. This must be kept in mind. (Tait special correspondent) Translated from the May 21st "Asahi Shimbun")

### Inspection Report of the English Channel

The atmosphere in the English Channel has suddenly become tense due to the Anglo-American preparations for the invasion of Europe. The starting point for the Anglo-American invasion force is on the opposite shore, separated by a narrow strip of water. One type of high-speed torpedo boat plays an important role in this narrow sea area. It can be said to be a tank in the sea, fully armored and with sophisticated machinery. It has a speed of 00 knots, cuts through the waves like flying, and carries huge torpedoes on both sides. Even when approaching the enemy, it is not easy to be detected.

The English Channel is only 50 to 60 meters deep, and submarines cannot operate, so this type of high-speed torpedo boat has emerged. From July 1942 to the end of last year, in less than two years, 176 merchant ships (514,000 tons), 4 destroyers, 6 patrol boats, 1 floating dock, and 1 auxiliary ship have been sunk.

Recently, the situation of the offensive and defensive battles in the English Channel has been extremely tense amid the landing announcements of the Anglo-American forces. The most powerful enemy bases, such as Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, and London, have strictly defended coastlines. Every three days, a convoy of ships emerges from the Thames River, guarded by two to four destroyers and about ten gunboats. Five or six patrol boats and three or four minesweepers clear the way in front. Recently, in order to counter German high-speed torpedo boats, internal combustion engine gunboats and steam engine gunboats have been moored in the center of the channel to block their attack routes.

These internal combustion engine gunboats are 35 meters long and have a displacement of only 100 tons. They have a speed of 30 knots and are equipped with two 40mm cannons, one 20mm cannon, and two 1.5cm twin-mounted machine guns. The steam engine gunboats are about 50 meters long, have a displacement of 200 tons, and a speed of 39 knots. The main armament is two 8.8cm caliber guns. They are completely destroyer-style. These are the great enemies of the Japanese torpedo boats. Moreover, in actual warfare, their firepower and firepower are said to be superior.

Recently, five of these types of ships have been sunk by German torpedo boats, while German torpedo boats have only been damaged by bombing at their bases. This is enough to explain the superiority of the German navy's warriors' eyesight when attacking at night. In short, this is the result of a forward-thinking offensive spirit and a daring surprise attack.

The Impregnable Atlantic Fortress

The land-based intercepting posture that echoes the maritime offensive is now almost complete. The famous "Atlantic Wall" has countless fortresses that meander endlessly. In each fortress, the sound of intense training can be heard, and the protruding mouths of the giant cannons can be moved at any time. The machine gun positions and barracks centered on the fortress are all built underground, with green meadows and flowering gardens on top. In addition, there are layers of barbed wire and minefields, and giant cannons are installed on the rear and sides to prevent paratroopers from attacking the fortress.

The enemy fears this unshakable spirit and knows that the attack is ineffective, so even if enemy aircraft fly in the high sky, they will never dare to fight. Although the distance closest to the British mainland is only a dozen minutes by air, no aerial decisive battle has occurred at this protruding point of the Western European fortress. However, the enemy aircraft flying in the invisible high sky were shot down by German coastal anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were repelled.

The enemy saw this iron-clad German defense and felt a peaceful atmosphere that was not invaded and not threatened. The maritime warriors who stood guard judged from their two years of reconnaissance that they did not believe that the enemy had gathered hundreds of divisions, and that the maritime power had absolutely not gathered to the extent that they could land and fight a decisive battle.

Of course, it only takes five and a half hours to cross the strait, but the preparation before the operation takes four and a half hours. Germany is always preparing for this type of attack. The land is closely monitoring the enemy, covering the coast with a network of giant shells. No matter how secretly the enemy ships act on the other side of the strait, they cannot escape the eyes and ears of the electronic detectors. This new weapon is becoming more and more advanced today. The British navy cannot escape the perspective of this ultra-short wave even if it sticks cork pieces on the sides of ships or pours in artificial fog before landing.

The power of the parachutes also seems to be overestimated. At most, there are only four or five divisions. With this force, even if they can disrupt the rear, if they cannot establish contact with the sea, annihilation can be said to be a matter of time. In short, even if the enemy can invade France, the principle is to annihilate them within 24 hours. And in fact, it is absolutely impossible to carry out a surprise landing operation in the English Channel.

The strategy and propaganda planned by the British and Americans based on the quantity of their aircraft, weapons, and military power are not just fantasies, they are dangerous. Since the failure of the Dieppe landing operation, through the North African landing operation, the Italian operation, and other battles, the Anglo-American landing operation has accumulated a considerable number of years and paid a great sacrifice. They are eager to invade Europe to end the war, so they are actively preparing for the invasion. (Xiang: Translated from the May 28th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Increased Production Movement Implemented in Malaya

Tokyo, 15th, Xiaoyang News Agency Telegram: The Japanese military government of Malaya met with a group of reporters here. On the issue of responding to the recent operations and strengthening military measures, they spoke as follows: Regarding the Malayan food problem, the goal for this year is to achieve complete self-sufficiency, and a comprehensive increase production movement will be launched, opening up wasteland and utilizing open spaces. The indigenous people can deeply understand the intentions of the authorities and enthusiastically cooperate. Regarding the import of rice, it has also been quite active recently, and the indigenous people have no sense of unease. At the current stage of rebuilding Malaya, the problem of insufficient labor has already become an extremely important issue. The lack of labor is one of the proofs that the overall construction cannot be progressed. On the other hand, the large-scale increase in volunteers is also one of the reasons for the lack of labor. Therefore, this year, it has been decided that in addition to transferring thousands of laborers from Java, it is necessary to promote a comprehensive labor mobilization plan. Regarding the fundamental policy towards the overseas Chinese, it has already been decided that they will first be actively supported and cooperated, because their economic strength has the potential to develop further. Assistance has now been provided for their free activities, so that they can move freely in the economic field, and the authorities will actively guide them in this regard. Regarding the price issue, it is planned to lend out hundreds of millions of yuan this year, but at present, in order to prevent inflation, various controls are being implemented in the financial field, stipulating the lending of funds and excessive purchasing methods. Also, recently, bank deposits and postal savings have increased sharply, which is a gratifying phenomenon, and can be said to be a major proof that the residents trust Japan.

### Pigeon Shadows in Front of the Window

— Liu Jiagan

Every day, there is always a flock of pigeons flying in the sky, flying. They appear from behind the opposite alleyway, pass over the narrow alleyway, sweep over the ridge of my house, make a circle on the nearby roof, and then appear again in the opposite alleyway. They circle around tirelessly all day long... Now, every time they sweep past my window, I see a few flexible black shadows, and my heart feels as heavy as if a lead weight has been added!

I remember that a month ago, the situation was completely different, and the pigeons gave me infinite joy. At that time, a friend of mine lived in the front building, and we both read and wrote silently all day long. What a monotonous life this was! Our spirits were so eager to be tempered by external things. But where could we find such things? There were no trees or flowers outside the window. It was impossible to find even a small grass. The patio was very small and piled high with stale and dilapidated sundries. There was not even room for one person to stroll. So we found the flock of pigeons, although their flight was silent and inconspicuous. Every day, there was always a time when the two of us sat side by side in front of the window, raised our heads, and watched the flock of pigeons soar back and forth. The fatigue of the day would be swept away from my body and mind, and there would be a kind of natural feeling.

One day, my friend suddenly jumped up. He said firmly:

"I can't be trapped in this cage-like place anymore, just watching them!"

A few days later, he left the front building with simple luggage, probably soaring freely. Only I was left behind, raising my head and staring foolishly at the flock of pigeons, sighing to myself!

"Oh! How much of a man's ambition have they awakened!"

But my ambition was never able to be aroused, and a sense of shame made me unwilling to see them again. I longed for them to disappear from in front of the window forever. But this made me recall the past again: just a few months ago, there were two children on the opposite side of the alleyway, holding slingshots made of rubber bands and shooting small pebbles at the flock of pigeons, startling them and causing them to fly around in chaos. For a long time, they did not dare to fly low, and even changed their flight paths. We were extremely angry at that time and, using the reason of a stone that accidentally fell in, started negotiations. Later, the flight of the pigeons returned to normal – flying low past the window. At this time, both of us felt a sense of satisfaction. Who knew that after a few months, I would not want to see them anymore.

Heaven seemed to be showing off its beauty, and for several days in a row, there was heavy rain, and they had to disappear from the sky. I should have been satisfied, but my heart began to feel empty. Not a single person was willing to talk to someone with such a strange temperament as me; although there were a few books on the shelf, looking at them on such a dark and gloomy day only made people feel bored. There were also pens and ink on the table, but as soon as I picked up the pen, I felt my brain become dull, and I put it down again after writing less than a line. So I stood up and paced back and forth. Life in Shanghai was complicated, but every two days were different scenes. The door to the front building was closed, and the sound of the heavy rain drowned out the sound of the back cards. The dripping sound of the rain had become so habitual to my ears that I was almost indifferent to it. My friend's bunk was still placed in the corner of the room, and I dared not look at it directly. I could only stare at the gray sky in a daze. I walked closer to the window. The narrow alleyway and the dilapidated houses were quietly in front of my eyes. The ugly and strange appearance of the past had disappeared in the vastness, and everything was as silent as death. This silence pierced my heart, and the emptiness in my chest gradually expanded, forming a bottomless and boundless abyss.

— I couldn't help but think of the flock of pigeons.

Finally, they reappeared in the sky, and I couldn't help but jump up from my chair, walk closer to the window, and silently pray for them:

May they always fly freely and incessantly. They are messengers of God; they give hope and comfort to the timid; at the same time, they also give ambition and courage to the strong. May they always soar in the free sky, and may their lively姿態 bestow wisdom and purity of the soul on people.

Until now, they are still the same, flying every day, day after day, along their usual route. And I, too, will never say that I don't want to see them anymore!

But now, my mood is finally different from before. Every day, when I sit in front of the window and watch them sweep past me – the black shadows flashing one after another – a bitter smile spreads across my face, and my heart feels as if a lead weight has been added, so heavy! -.

### The Revelation of Sea Waves

— Cheng Jusun

Don't you see -

The surging sea waves,

Swishing and swashing:

Are rushing forward mightily

Regardless of day and night,

Undaunted by hardship.

Rows upon rows of giant waves,

Freely;

Rushing farther and farther,

Rolling higher and higher!

Sections of it roll beyond the horizon,

But behind, they come incessantly

It is with such perseverance,

That they rush towards a vast future! Don't you hear -

The surging sea waves,

Swishing and swashing:

Are shouting loudly.

Regardless of day and night,

Undaunted by hardship.

Waves upon waves of roaring,

Powerfully:

Louder and louder,

Shouting higher and higher.

The front ones have only their fading echoes left,

But the ones behind raise their voices again

It is with such vigilance,

That they shout towards this chaotic society

These surging sea waves,

Give us a profound revelation

We must emulate them by shouting loudly,

Shouting out the injustices against humanity.

Shout out the suffering of the universe.

Powerfully!

Vigilantly!

Raising our voices!

We must also be like them

Rushing forward,

Rushing out of the circle of sin,

Running onto the track of salvation. Freely!

Perseveringly!

Do not fear the long journey! Friends:

We must make this chaotic society bright

And clear,

We must make the vast future grand

And magnificent! Only by letting each of us become a sea wave of humanity!

### Father is Old

— Yi Xuan

Is father old? I dare not believe it; if forty is said to be the beginning of a person's life's work, then fifty is like the sun at its zenith. I leaf through father's past photos and diaries, that handsome appearance, that striving life, all make me deny that father is old.

However, the facts tell me that whether it is his appearance, his thoughts, his will, everything is like the setting sun's fading glow.

Who caused him to be like this? Difficult years? No, the times can create heroes, and heroes can create the times, can't they? I think it is father's decadence that has aged himself.

When the first white hair appeared on his head, he sighed with sorrow, "I am old, I am useless!" So the second and third... quickly filled his temples; he sighed with even more sorrow, "I am old! I am useless! I have struggled all my life, it is time for me to put down the flag and silence the drums!"

It was an air-raid night, a red cloth with a black cloth lining was hung over the lamp, only the tabletop could receive the light, and father started playing the old tune again; I said:

"You are not old, if I reach father's age..." I stood up and pulled off the lamp cover: "Then, I will rely on my knowledge and experience, like this light illuminating the entire room."

He smiled and sighed weakly: "Ah, child's talk, if you were to reach my age, maybe you would be worse than me!"

"No, even if I live to be twice as old as father, I will never admit to being old, maybe my body will be hunched over, my head will be bald; but I will never let my spirit, my thoughts add ten years of age."

"Have you ever seen a body that does not age; youth that does not pass away? Father! You should perk up, you are still a champion of the three armies, now you are surrendering, not gloriously ceasing hostilities."

But my eloquent argument earned me the same answer: "I am old! I am useless!"

Who can tell me where the Queen Mother of the West's spiritual mountain is? Let me go and beg for a dose of immortality pills, and offer it to my father so he can have a youthful face and a youthful heart.

### Dusk

— Fu Baosheng

A pile of yellow earth,

A bunch of fresh flowers,

Dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, recalling the mentor's demeanor, floating in the phantom, talking softly, reciting the past. If one contracted tuberculosis - my destruction is the remaining days of my life, the leaf inside exceeds the extreme amount - is the poison element, the suicide medium. Listen! Who is groaning in this dusk like a cuckoo crying, it is the mourner before the grave,

Reciting the past of the one destroyed by dusk.

A pile of yellow earth,

A bunch of fresh flowers,

Dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping over the outline of the tragedy!

Loss, raid, pacification, sorrow...

The elderly father suffered the raid, the bribes all became bubbles, thinking of years of cultivation, the one who repays! A pile of yellow earth, carrying the hopes of the second half of life, the one who obtains - a pile of yellow earth, the destroyer soon equally economically gives to the loving mother - is sick,

Sorrow - forging the weak younger sister.

A pile of yellow earth, a bunch of fresh flowers, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping over a certain dusk, he vanished completely with the setting sun, one day dawn reappears the setting sun in the east, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave. A pile of yellow earth, a bunch of fresh flowers, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping as dusk passes by like flowing water,

He vanished in a certain dusk of the past,

Fading away in a certain dusk of the future. The dusk of the past, the dusk of the future,

The destroyer of the past and future is in the dusk.

Film Review

### "Dream of the Red Chamber" from Novel to Film

— Gu Xin

...“Dream of the Red Chamber” has finally come to the silver screen. It is said that “China Film” spent a lot of manpower and material resources to produce this film. They not only advertised it heavily beforehand, but also published many special issues after its public release.

...“Dream of the Red Chamber” is a lengthy novel with the theme of exposing the extravagance and licentiousness of feudal aristocratic families, ultimately leading to their decline. Although limited by the times, the writing style inevitably falls into clichés, its strengths are in its delicate and refined descriptions, and its vivid portrayal of characters. Various European and American countries often bring famous works to the stage or screen. From an artistic point of view, introducing this work to movie audiences is not a completely worthless endeavor.

...However, the adaptation work is not easy. It must not only avoid harming the original work, but also possess a proper and unique artistic skill. This time's "Dream of the Red Chamber" film, I dare not flatter, is a complete failure.

...The "Dream of the Red Chamber" film only adopted a long thread of triangular love between Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai from the original work, and crowned it with the slogan of "giving a head-on blow to the old marriage system," which is the first trick. But a loophole was forgotten: the original author's era did not have the so-called "old marriage" and "new marriage" at all; and even if Baoyu and Daiyu truly reunited, it would not necessarily represent a bright and beautiful union. The entire film's plot tries to incorporate lively and relatively well-known episodes, which is the second trick. However, the director's skills are indeed pitifully poor, and the joining of each section appears so stiff and unnatural. The abruptness of the camera shots, and the forced manner of the characters' entrances and exits, all make the audience feel that they cannot understand it without rereading the "Dream of the Red Chamber"! Most of the lines are based on the original work with slight "modernization," but when there is nothing to refer to in the original work, the poverty of ideas is revealed. The characters' personalities are all distorted, and there is no emotion to speak of.

...In fact, even if you put in a little more effort to make this novel into a film with some artistic value, you would not lose a few audience members.

### Sports Basketball Charity Tournament Final Match Central China Youth vs. Western China Youth Decisive Battle Tonight There Will Also Be a Performance by All-Shanghai Healthy and Beautiful Standard Men The Program Starts at 8 PM Followed by the Award Ceremony

This newspaper's scholarship fund's basketball charity tournament will soon come to a successful conclusion after the final match begins tonight at 8 PM. This event was made possible by the Basketball Association, the Youth Association, and the cooperation of various teams, the generosity of General Manager Zhang Zixiang of China-United Pharmaceutical Factory in covering the expenses of the Central China Youth and Western China Youth teams, and the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life. The scholarship fund of this newspaper has benefited greatly, and the benefits to students in the future are also the blessings of people from all walks of life. Tonight's basketball final, along with the performance by healthy and beautiful men and the award ceremony, will undoubtedly be even more lively.

Central China and Western China Each Win Once Tonight's Final Decisive Battle

According to the rules of this basketball charity tournament, the Central China Youth and Western China Youth teams were invited to play a best-of-three series. The Central China team includes generals such as those from the China-United Pharmaceutical Team and He Jingui from South China. The Western China Youth team is a mixed team led by the giant Monroe, and both sides have strong players. In the first game (12th), the Central China Youth team fought alone with the China-United Pharmaceutical Team, and thanks to the efforts of the generals and the correct strategy, they achieved victory (23-18). In the second game (14th), the Central China Youth team was mainly composed of the Renyu team, supplemented by Zhang Jinzhen and He Jingui. Unfortunately, they were unlucky with the ball, and Lin Weiting also left the field due to a sprained ankle. In the end, Zhuo Guorong was fouled out four times, leading to a complete collapse and a crushing defeat (29-11). Now that each side has won once, tonight's battle is a matter of life and death, and both sides will certainly exert their full strength. It is heard that Zhang Zhixiang and Yu Junzi are studying the distribution of the lineup and the method of combat in order to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy, and the writer, being untalented, humbly offers his views.

Observing the Situation of the Foreign Generals My Views on Lineup Distribution

Observing the Western China Youth team's combat, their offensive method uses a V-shape. That is, after one person gets the ball, there are two people about five steps in front of him blocking the opponent's players, and these two people are also inevitably noticed by the opponent. The person with the ball then takes this opportunity to shoot from a distance, and uses the tall men Flunik and Yalong to follow up if the shot misses. Their defensive method adopts a strict man-to-man system. Relying on their sufficient strength and several years of experience, it is extremely effective. Understanding this, we should be able to know how to use our own strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. However, since the Central China Youth team has players from various teams, it is difficult to distribute the lineup. Moreover, basketball combat now tends to absolutely emphasize team cooperation, and it is impossible to dominate solely based on individual skills. The writer now believes that four generals from China-United should be used, supplemented by Ma Canxi or Yu Junzi from the Renyu team. If Ma Canxi is used, then Ma and Xi Lin should be guards, and Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xianlun, and Kong Guangyi should be forwards. The reason is that only one general in the five is a member of another team, which should not affect communication. However, some say that Ah Kong's position as a forward may not be satisfactory, and Mr. Zhang Zhixiang also has this view, which is reasonable. Ah Kong has been stationed in the backcourt for a long time, and if he is forced to serve as a forward, his position will inevitably be unfamiliar. However, I believe that Ah Kong can shoot, and is extremely steady, and since Canxi is quite capable of seizing opportunities to advance, then at that time Ah Kong can retreat as needed, so that there are no loopholes. If Ah Kong is really not accustomed to the front line, then Yu Junzi can serve as a forward, and Lao should be the guard, and Ah Kong and Xi Lin should team up. Yu Junzi can supply the ball on the front line, using his alertness to give Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xian or Xi Lin the achievement of advancing. I wonder if Zhang and Yu also agree with my words? Therefore, some believe that the way for the Central China Youth team to defend should also be man-to-man, at least for a tactical system that raises the level of play. However, observing the strength of each individual and the very short practice time, I believe that in today's battle, they can only continue to use the more skilled (Zone). If they can stand in the correct position and pay attention to their V-shaped offensive tactics, and block their tall men from following up, I can guarantee that the foreign generals will lack development and have no recourse.

The Healthy and Beautiful Men's Performance is Worth Visiting

Tonight's basketball game is scheduled to start at 8 PM in the gymnasium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, and in the middle there will be a human body performance by the winners of the Healthy and Beautiful Men's Competition organized by the Youth Association: Liu Ke, the first place winner, Huang Hui, the second place winner, and Mao Guanqing, the third place winner. In the past, there has never been such a competition in Shanghai, only the president and queen of flower countries and the school flowers of various schools. The focus is on eroticism, which is not enough to be a model. The one organized by the Youth Association this time is in line with science, combining the evaluations of medical scientists, the observations of artists, and the judgments of sports experts. According to Mr. Liang Zhaoan of the association: Overseas, this kind of performance is considered normal and is also very eye-catching, and the authorities give awards. And in fact, it is indeed very beneficial for arousing public interest, enhancing the national physique, and the nation. This is the first attempt in Shanghai, and the results are quite good. The selected winners certainly possess healthy beauty and a moral character with inner beauty. It allows people to know the standard of healthy beauty, and women can also understand how men can be called healthy and beautiful. Therefore, those who did not go to visit the previous competition should go to visit tonight. One trip can give you two kinds of artistic appreciation, which is a truly rare opportunity. It is predicted that tonight's grand occasion will undoubtedly surpass the previous two games. I hope people from all walks of life will go early so as not to regret missing it!

### Commentary on the Skill of the Tung Wah Football Team in the Scholarship Charity Football Match

The Tung Wah vs. Overseas Chinese United football charity match for the scholarship fund was held last Friday (9th) at the racecourse football field. Because the audience admired the skills of the Tung Wah team, and the Overseas Chinese United team had four Tianjin generals to help, they rushed to the scene and the streets were deserted. The stands were packed, which was fortunate for the scholarship fund of this newspaper. In this game, Mr. Ru Lin Kanghou performed the opening ceremony, and Misses Li Xiangguan and Li Guihua presented the awards. Sincere gratitude is expressed to Tan Jing, Pan Sansheng, Shen Siliang, Zhou Wenrui, Zhou Jiaqi, Shen Jiongchun, all gentlemen, as well as the sports association, the football association, the police bureau, and other related people for their enthusiastic assistance.

Brief Account of the Battle

After the start of the match, the Overseas Chinese United team relied on the strength of their morale and attacked fiercely, constantly attacking the Tung Wah team. Fortunately, the rear defense of Zhuang and Li was tight, and they were spared from disaster. The Overseas Chinese United team only had attacks, but could not find their way in, and could only sigh in frustration. The Tung Wah generals, had a plan in mind, and remained quiet for a long time before acting. Han Chonghai went deep into the hinterland, and the opposing Luo Xulai tripped him and fouled, and a twelve-yard penalty kick was awarded, which was kicked in by Sun Jinshun. Less than two minutes later, the Tung Wah team, riding high on momentum, You Liang kicked a corner kick, which was headed by Zhang Lingen, and Li Kui headed it again, breaking the enemy's goal. One penalty and one header, double happiness came to the door. The Overseas Chinese United team, before the end of the first half, was awarded a twelve-yard penalty kick due to Zhang Banglun's foul, which was scored by Bao Jie. In the first half, the Tung Wah team won with a score of two to one. In the second half, the Overseas Chinese United team made a desperate gamble and launched a full-scale counterattack. In the end, they lacked shooting generals, and the number of offside balls was countless. Instead, Sun Jinshun of the Tung Wah team scored an empty goal. They overwhelmed the Overseas Chinese United team with generals with a score of three to one, maintaining the honorary title of this session, which was truly a masterpiece.

Commentary on Football Skills

The Tung Wah team was on the defensive for most of the match. Therefore, their defensive performance was measured and rhythmical. Their roundabout tactics were well-applied and had no gaps. Tan Fuji and Zhuang Youren were especially methodical. Only Zhang Lingen seemed to be out of sorts. Banglun's goalkeeping is gradually becoming miraculous, bold and meticulous, combining both. Little Zhang can humbly improve, and will definitely have achievements in the future. Some say that judging from his recent situation, he can surpass Liu Xianjue, which is no exaggeration. On this day, Tung Wah's attack was not seen as particularly brilliant. This is because Longhai ran too much, while Lao Sun was slightly lazy. For this reason, the front line failed to have the ideal connection. However, because they were aware of the agility of the opponent's goalkeeper, they never attacked the goal lightly. They used the best opportunity to break the enemy's goal lightly. The enemy's goalkeeper was left with no place to use his heroism, and regretted it endlessly. This was the success of wisdom and experience.

To discuss the Overseas Chinese United team's offensive strategy again, they only used the central breakthrough method, and did not know how to change. Especially since they lacked shooting generals. The reason why they could not get the ball is this. If they could make more use of the two wings and lengthen the front line, then the Tung Wah team's defense might not be able to last to the end and would have revealed fatigue early. Their willingness to run in their defensive tactics, and the briskness of their footwork, were admired by everyone. However, their position was rigid, and they only used positional play zone defense, which led to the hard work not being worth the effort. The Tung Wah team knew their weakness, and used the two wings to lure them, so that they had to show the shortcoming of losing sight of one thing while attending to another. The central defensive line could not give too much thought to the rear. This was truly undesirable.
