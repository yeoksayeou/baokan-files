### The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be Unified: Declaration Issued by the Sixth Central Executive Committee Provisional Meeting

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Nationalist Party held its sixth Central Executive Committee provisional plenary meeting yesterday, and the conference finally resolved to issue a declaration on the passing of Chairman Wang. The original text is as follows:

"Declaration of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party on the Passing of Chairman Wang"

Advance Bravely and Fulfill the Legacy

In the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], the foundation of the revolution had just been established, and the revolutionary forces had not yet crossed Guangdong. Unfortunately, the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, departed from his comrades and passed away. Today, the country's difficulties and the seriousness of the situation are even greater than in the fourteenth year, and unfortunately, Chairman Wang also departed from his comrades and passed away at this time. This is truly an unfortunate event in the history of our party, and a cause for weeping and heartbreak for all comrades. The passing of the Father of the Nation caused immense grief to the comrades. With sorrowful troops, they bravely advanced, and the whole country followed. This led to the success of the Northern Expedition from the fifteenth to the seventeenth years [1926-1928]. With the passing of Mr. Wang, all party comrades should also transform their sorrow and grief into courage to sacrifice themselves, enduring hardship and toil, in order to complete the unfinished will of the deceased. The great task of nation-building is what those who survive should bear, and the brilliance of the revolutionary future may even surpass the era of the Northern Expedition.

Building a Country Based on the Three Principles of the People

In his will, the Father of the Nation instructed the people of the country, first, to "seek freedom and equality for China," and second, to "abolish unequal treaties." In recent years, under the leadership of Mr. Wang, the comrades of our party have been united in their efforts to realize this sacred goal. Since declaring war on Britain and the United States in January of last year, and concluding the alliance treaty with Japan, the unequal treaties imposed on China by Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated. Japan, fighting together with us, has also voluntarily renounced extraterritorial rights, returned concessions, and abolished the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol, and has agreed that once full peace is achieved, Japanese troops will be completely withdrawn. The responsibilities left to us by the Father of the Nation have been gradually completed by the comrades of our party under the leadership of Mr. Wang. This is something that the comrades of our party can use to comfort the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven, and to declare to the people of the country. However, the ultimate goal of the Father of the Nation is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Now that full peace has not yet been achieved, and the world war is about to enter its final decisive stage, the position of the Chinese nation is in the midst of the turbulent currents of war, and the promotion of civil rights and the improvement of people's livelihoods cannot be accelerated. The goals of the revolution have not been fully realized, and the ideals of nation-building have not been completed. How should the comrades of our party be united in heart and mind, and united in purpose, to work hard to remove the obstacles to the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and build a new China of the people, by the people, and for the people?

Anti-Communist Policy: Nanjing and Chongqing are the Same

Unfortunately, due to temporary differences in opinions, the comrades of our party have been divided into Nanjing and Chongqing, and as a result, the country has not been unified and the pace has not been consistent. This is an undeniable fact, and our party feels deeply indebted to the people. Since the Sixth National Congress, we have shared the same doctrine, the same history, and the same destiny with our comrades. Although separated by two places, we have never ceased to think of them. We fully understand the arduous struggles of our comrades in Chongqing, and we have deep sympathy and infinite indignation for their inner pain and our own dangers. Whether comrades are in Nanjing or Chongqing, the coercion and difficulties they have suffered from the communists are not only the same, but even greater in the latter. At the beginning of our return to the capital, we raised the banner of anti-communism and diligently implemented it. The comrades in Chongqing are constrained by their environment and cannot act freely. If they slightly impose sanctions, they will be accused of undermining the united front. If they sincerely cooperate, the communists will secretly usurp political power, plunder military equipment, and use the momentum of invasion to satisfy their desire for annexation, leaving people helpless and in a dilemma. Anti-communism is the basic policy of our party, and anti-communism is the consistent spirit of our party. Now, due to the changing circumstances, it has been hijacked by the communists. In this environment, we express our deep sympathy and indignation. Although the comrades of our party may have temporary differences in opinions, their fundamental intentions are the same. The comrades in Nanjing are committed to anti-communism and national salvation, and the comrades in Chongqing should also be committed to this. Although the time and place may be different, the original intentions are the same. This is something that all comrades of our party can believe in and trust each other.

Breaking Away from Britain and the United States to Achieve Peace

The comrades in Nanjing are cooperating with Japan, while the comrades in Chongqing are held hostage by Britain and the United States. This is also an undeniable fact and the most unfortunate phenomenon for the country. Our party's struggle against British and American imperialism to break free from the shackles of unequal treaties has been a consistent revolutionary proposition for sixty years. The Father of the Nation's instructions have repeatedly reminded us of this. When the comrades in Nanjing declared war on Britain and the United States last year, the traditional policy of our party was able to be realized, and the power of Britain and the United States in China was eliminated. With the removal of the century-old enemy, China's freedom was obtained. This is truly a sacred undertaking achieved by our party after completing the great cause of the Northern Expedition. However, the aggressive policies of Britain and the United States in Chongqing have become even more intensified, colluding with the communists to interfere in internal affairs, ostensibly providing assistance, but secretly plotting to control us. The revolutionary comrades of the Chinese Nationalist Party are being coerced day and night by their congenital enemies, and the pain and regret in their hearts are self-evident. We firmly believe that the comrades in Chongqing will one day rise up and break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and join hands with us to achieve full peace. Those imperialists may denigrate the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty as empty words on paper, but they do not know that as the world situation evolves to this point, the Japanese people and government, whether in terms of morality or interests, will never allow themselves to be enemies with China again. Once full peace is established, there is no doubt that Japan will withdraw its troops in accordance with reason and the situation. Although they are intelligent, it is better to take advantage of the situation. The comrades in Chongqing should already be familiar with this.

Unite and Rebuild China

The party must not be divided, and the country must be unified. Mr. Wang made this clear to his comrades and announced it to the people when he left Chongqing. For six years, our arduous and determined struggle has been aimed at this goal. All party comrades, whether in Nanjing or Chongqing, whether for peace or war, should understand this sincerity. Now that Mr. Wang has passed away, we are not worried that the communists cannot be eradicated, but we are afraid that the comrades of our party cannot unite. We are not worried that the aggressive policies of imperialism cannot be resisted, but we are afraid that the revolutionary efforts will be gradually dispersed. We firmly believe that the peace movement led by Mr. Wang for six years has achieved great results and laid a solid foundation. The success or failure from now on depends only on whether the comrades can work hard. Looking back twenty years, with just Guangzhou, it unified the whole country in a few years. Looking at the present and recalling the past, the expansion of the situation from now on can only move forward and cannot hesitate. Today, we should urgently refine ourselves, unite, and fight against the communists and imperialism to rebuild China and unify our party. We must not harbor hopes of complacency or rely on others. The difficulty and danger of the current situation is greater than ever before. Only through struggle can we survive, and only through self-help can we receive divine assistance. May all comrades of our party and the people of the country strive together.

Editorial

### The Spirit of Toyama

Yesterday, we mourned Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, "Friend of the Chinese Revolution," in the midst of a dismal rain. Why did we mourn him? The meaning of mourning him and the reasons why he is worthy of our mourning have already been discussed in the article "Mourning Mr. Mitsuru Toyama." However, after the mourning, thinking of our country and our current politics, we feel deeply moved and increasingly appreciate the preciousness and respectability of Mr. Toyama's spirit! We cannot help but express our thoughts.

Since the passing of Chairman Wang, "the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may face more difficulties" (see the remarks of Prince Konoe in this newspaper on the 13th). First, in terms of leadership, Mr. Chen Gongbo has now taken over. Mr. Chen has a deep understanding of Mr. Wang's loyalty to the country during his lifetime, his diligence in governance, and his ideals, and he is also the most capable of implementing them. The entire country unanimously supports him. At the same time, taking advantage of the presence of local officials in the capital, a national military and political conference was convened. The focus of the conference was to review the past and improve the future, so that the government and the people could be united as one to strengthen political and military power and assist in the Greater East Asia War. The importance of this conference is as Allied General Staff Officer Matsui said: "After the passing of Chairman Wang, the future of China depends entirely on this conference." What is most gratifying about this conference is that acting Chairman Chen was able to seriously and frankly review the past political shortcomings in his opening address. This can tell everyone that we do not need to worry too much about the difficulties in leadership. What we are worried about is whether the resolutions of this conference can be implemented thoroughly and realistically. This is the motivation for us to talk about the spirit of Toyama.

Mr. Toyama's spirit is most prominently manifested in his patriotism and nationalism. At the age of twenty-one, he was already engaged in patriotic movements. In his hometown of Fukuoka Prefecture, he gathered like-minded comrades to form the Genyosha, with the aim of cultivating knowledge and exercising the body, hoping to be able to dedicate himself to the country in times of need. Many talented people emerged from his ranks and were very active during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. Later, he published the Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun, advocating Pan-Asianism and engaging in practical guidance, dedicating his life to national affairs, and his contributions were very great. However, he remained uncrowned and unranked until his death. In terms of his life's achievements, he was the creator of the Japanese nationalist movement, the unifier of general social forces, and the promoter of Pan-Asianism. From his life's activities, we can understand that his patriotic thought has three characteristics: first, he consistently practiced patriotism without discouragement or rest; second, he organized societies and united comrades to cultivate talents for the country; third, he had no profit-seeking concepts and was loyal to the country. This is the foundation of Mr. Toyama's patriotic spirit.

A patriot who only cares about the interests of his own country and the development of his own nation will inevitably fall into narrow patriotism. Mr. Toyama was well aware of this and advocated Pan-Asianism, and in Sino-Japanese relations, he exclaimed: "Japan and China are one and the same country." After our Father of the Nation suffered adversity in London, he went to Japan and interacted with Mr. Toyama. Later, the Tongmenghui was established in Tokyo, and Mr. Toyama gave his full support. When the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the Father of the Nation returned from overseas, and Mr. Toyama rushed to Shanghai to greet him. Almost all of our patriots who went to Japan to visit Mr. Toyama listened to his teachings and received his guidance. China is the second force in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so the Father of the Nation said: "Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." Mr. Toyama's "sincere" support for the Chinese revolution was due to his love for Japan, and therefore his love for China, and even his love for East Asia, without any intention of exploiting China. This is because he thoroughly understood the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation that he was able to have a spirit of sincere good neighborliness.

The greatness of Mr. Toyama's spirit has been described above, but his success lies in his "perseverance" and "determination." Today, our country needs our rulers and people to have correct patriotic thought and pure nationalism, and at the same time cultivate our perseverance and determination to shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and guiding politics on the right track, taking Mr. Toyama's spirit as an example.

Finally, acting Chairman Chen said in his address to the National Military and Political Conference: "What we lack today is not theory, not policy, but only perseverance and determination." These are truly incisive words that have identified the root causes of the political problems of the past. In the future, we must prescribe the right medicine for the disease. Therefore, we hope that the government will show "perseverance" and "determination" to perform surgery on the chronic diseases of politics and first see the spirit of Mr. Toyama in administrative facilities.

### Five Enemy Ships Sunk in the Eastern Sea off Luzon Island

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 26th: (1) Since the morning of November 25th, the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps has launched a fierce attack on the enemy mobile forces that attacked the eastern sea off Luzon Island in northern Philippines. As of now, the confirmed results are as follows: one large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one large cruiser sunk. (2) On November 25th, Japanese submarines launched a fierce attack on the enemy mobile forces in the eastern sea off Luzon Island, sinking one medium aircraft carrier and one destroyer each.

### Japanese Aircraft Surprise Attack on Morotai Island Inflicts Heavy Losses on the Enemy

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy Americans landed on Morotai Island on September 15th, they have built six airfields on the eastern end of the island, and there are two or three others, trying to build a large air force base to cooperate with the operations in the Philippines. The five airfields at the southern end bridgehead have all been completed, but they have been heavily damaged by the destructive operations of the Japanese troops on the island and the recent reinforcements. Currently, only the north and south airfields attached to the southern end bridgehead are usable. In order to strengthen the operations in the Philippines, the enemy Americans recently concentrated 300 to 400 aircraft at this airfield, but unexpectedly, they were subjected to surprise attacks by the Japanese air force on the 22nd and 13th, and were almost completely destroyed. According to the results of a reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft on the 24th, 15 large aircraft and 2 small aircraft were burned at the north guidance route, 4 large aircraft were heavily damaged, 12 large aircraft and 10 small aircraft were burned at the airfield, 1 large aircraft and 3 small aircraft were burned, 9 large aircraft and 8 small aircraft were burned at the west guidance route, and 16 large aircraft were burned at the south guidance route, totaling 79 aircraft. The losses suffered by the enemy American air force in this battle will have a great impact on future operations in the Philippines.

### Enemy Aircraft Reconnaissance Over Tokyo

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Around 1:00 PM on the 26th, one enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base invaded the high altitude near Tokyo at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, and after reconnaissance for about 30 minutes, it fled. The Japanese air force is still in pursuit, and the results have not yet been determined.

### The Fall of Nanning

South China Line Base, 26th (Central News Agency) - Nanning, the last base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing in South China, was captured by the Japanese army on the 24th. This Nanning operation started on the 19th, and the attack only took five days, advancing from Guixian to Nanning, which is 200 kilometers away. The speed of the advance has broken all previous records. When the Japanese army occupied Guiping on October 12th, the Chongqing army had already predicted that the Japanese army would attack Nanning. They immediately transferred the Guangxi army's 46th, 14th, and 21st armies from near Guilin and Liuzhou. In the afternoon, three divisions of the Guangdong army's 35th Army Group near Guixian also attempted to recapture Guiping, Danzhu, and Pingnan with a force of twelve divisions, while also trying to prevent the Japanese army from attacking Nanning. On the other hand, the Japanese army immediately broke into Guixian from the mountainous area southwest of Guiping, cutting off its retreat. The 9th Division of the Chongqing army was shaken and retreated from Nanning to Yishan, Du'an, and Jiangshan in the north. From then on, the Japanese army units waiting for an opportunity in the Guixian area believed that the opportunity had ripened and advanced along the Gui-Ning Highway, starting the attack. They occupied Binyang, the vanguard to Nanning, on the afternoon of the 21st, and in the mountainous area northeast of Nanning, they defeated about 1,000 Guangxi security guards. After communicating with the Japanese army that had advanced to the north of Binyang on the morning of the 24th, they finally broke into the city of Nanning at 9:00 AM, launching a mopping-up operation in the city and attacking the airfield west of the city, completely occupying it.

After the Chinese and Japanese monks left the hall, Mr. Takashi Aoki, representing Mr. Toyama's family, gave a speech of thanks to the guests. With this, the solemn memorial ceremony came to an end. The participants from all walks of life silently left the hall amidst mournful music. It was already half past twelve. The original texts of the speeches are recorded as follows:

Chairman's Eulogy

Eulogy by Mr. Wen Lantao, Chairman of the Memorial Service: "Distinguished guests, today, various Chinese and Japanese circles in Shanghai are holding a memorial service for Elder Toyama. Your enthusiastic participation must make you all feel a layer of sorrow in your hearts, and pay tribute to this giant of East Asia. Elder Toyama's lifelong career has contributed to society and the country, and also to neighboring countries and even East Asia. He particularly supported China's revolutionary movement, so we, standing in the position of Chinese people, miss him even more. Elder Toyama's characteristics are his extraordinary courage, far-sightedness, firm will, and grand spirit. These characteristics are the factors that built his achievements and made him a giant of East Asia. However, although Elder Toyama has made great contributions to the country and society, he has never entered the officialdom, and has always assisted the government in the capacity of the people. This is even more commendable. We, standing in the position of the people, are even more respectful and admiring. Today, as we mourn Mr. Toyama, we should emulate his spirit, admire his deeds, and especially promote his far-sightedness to serve as the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Secondly, my personal admiration for Mr. Toyama has been briefly expressed in a short article I wrote for today's (26th) memorial special issue of the newspaper. I won't repeat it here."

Speech of Thanks by the Representative of the Bereaved Family

Briefly stated: "Today, representatives and celebrities from various Chinese agencies and organizations have initiated and held such a grand and solemn memorial service for Elder Toyama, and representatives and celebrities from various Chinese and Japanese circles have participated. First of all, in the capacity of a member of Japan, I express my deep gratitude, and at the same time, I express my solemn gratitude to the Chinese preparatory committee. The Toyama family originally planned to come to Shanghai from Tokyo, Japan, to attend this memorial service and thank everyone, but unfortunately, due to circumstances, they were unable to come to Shanghai as scheduled. I am temporarily representing them to express my gratitude to you all. I must also convey today's enthusiasm to the Toyama family to leave a lasting expression of gratitude."

### Tram Lines 1, 2, 7, and 8 Resume All-Day Service, Trolleybuses Will Also Resume Soon

The Shanghai Urban Transportation Company (i.e., the Tram Company) has restricted tram service hours to conserve electricity. It has been learned that the Urban Transportation Company has decided to resume all-day service for trams (Lines 1, 2, 7, and 8) starting today (27th) due to the increased electricity supply in the city. Trolleybus services will also resume all-day service as soon as the electricity supply increases further.

### Strengthening Financial Work, Strict Enforcement

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the "Outline and Implementation Measures for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, has issued circulars to various banks, money shops, and trust companies, requiring them to report on schedule their payment reserve ratios, daily average total deposits, and loan application procedures. All financial institutions have complied with the order to report, and the first round of business reports has been submitted completely. It is reported that the office's review shows that very few financial institutions' first-round business reports meet the provisions of the outline. More than 70% of the deposits do not comply with laws and regulations. If financial institutions cannot improve their organizational structure and increase their deposit strength within three months, they will inevitably be eliminated, reorganized voluntarily, or cease operations. It is said that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office is determined to strictly enforce the strengthening work to ensure that Shanghai's financial institutions move towards normalcy and soundness.

### Household Soap to Be Distributed Next Month

The distribution of household necessities in the city is being handled by the Shanghai Urban Soap and Match Unified Distribution Office, organized by the National Commercial Control Association's Necessities Control Committee.

### Speeches by Chinese and Japanese Civilian Representatives at the Memorial Service for Elder Toyama
### Eulogy by Mr. Chen Zhongfu, Representative of the Chinese People

Today, the Chinese and Japanese residents of Shanghai have initiated a memorial service for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, to mourn the giant of our neighboring country, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was born in Fukuoka Prefecture. The people of Fukuoka Prefecture have always produced many generous and patriotic individuals who have particularly supported our country's revolutionary comrades. Other parts of Japan, in all prefectures, have also supported revolutionary comrades, especially Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, who was a leader of the royalist movement among the people during the Meiji Restoration and made great efforts. When the Meiji Restoration was successful, many comrades and friends went to the government to take official positions. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, although his students were all over the world, was determined not to enter public service or accept official positions. For seventy or eighty years, he stood firmly among the people, fighting for national affairs. His will was firm and immovable as a mountain, and his character was extremely great. When our people heard of Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's firm will, they all straightened their clothes, admired and looked up to him.

Shared Ideals with Premier Sun

When Mr. Sun Zhongshan, the Premier of our Party, advocated the Chinese revolution, he first went to Japan and, before the establishment of the Tongmenghui, went to Fukuoka Prefecture to discuss the basic plan for the revolution with his comrades. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama provided assistance in many ways. The Premier advocated Pan-Asianism. At that time, Japan had not yet achieved racial integration, and unequal treaties had not yet been completely abolished. Therefore, those who shared the same ideals with the Premier and were sincere friends were united by the Premier's advocacy of Pan-Asianism, which did not blindly exclude white people, only because white people in China insisted on their superior rights and arrogant attitude, backed by unequal treaties. Therefore, Pan-Asianism was advocated to seek an equal international position. Therefore, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama strongly supported the Premier's proposal, which was the international righteousness. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama also advocated that in order to achieve Pan-Asianism and an equal international position, the Chinese revolution must first succeed. Therefore, the two gentlemen were always friends who shared the same ideals. From the beginning of the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the Premier traveled for the revolution and created the Republic of China. Whenever he encountered difficulties, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama always did his best to help him. Decades ago, there were very few who knew that revolution was the only way to save China. Even among our Chinese people, not many knew, believed, and acted. How much more difficult it was for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, who was Japanese, to deeply understand this principle. He was truly worthy of being called a pioneer. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama also came to China in 1911 to support everything. After the failure of the Second Revolution, the Premier and his comrades went to Japan. At that time, Yuan Shikai's power was at its peak. He asked the Japanese authorities to refuse the Premier to land. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama clarified justice and explained to the authorities that Japan's international position was of great importance and should not be agreed to. He refused to allow the political revolutionaries to land. After all, the Japanese authorities, based on the words of Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, and Dr. Terao, believed that the reasons were justified, so the Premier was able to land safely. Later, he went to Tokyo and lived next door to Mr. Mitsuru Toyama in Reianzaka. They met every day, and from 1913 to 1916, they often discussed matters related to the revolutionary cause or private matters with Mr. Mitsuru Toyama.

Mr. Toyama's Personal Relationship with the Premier Was Very Strong

Zhongfu remembers that in 1917, after the Premier returned to China and went to Guangdong, he made another effort to carry out the revolution and prepared for the Northern Expedition. However, at that time, the remnants of the imperial system in the southwestern provinces were stubbornly entrenched and had not yet been eliminated. The progress was slow and difficult. The Premier personally led the three armies, fighting in the East River today and rushing to the North River tomorrow, regardless of his own safety, and fought with the remnants of the imperial system. The Premier was still risking his life on the front line, directing his comrades. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama specially sent comrades to Guangdong to tell the Premier that the Chinese revolution and the Northern Expedition would undoubtedly succeed sooner or later. Please do not be too adventurous on the front line. If there is an accident, it will really hinder the future of the Chinese revolution. From this point, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama can be called the Premier's true friend in both public and private matters. Later, the Premier went north and fell ill on the way. Unfortunately, he passed away. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was deeply saddened. When the Premier was buried, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was already over seventy years old, but he came to China across the ocean and personally assisted in the burial. Zhongfu felt that Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's sincerity was particularly grand. Now, I will briefly talk about Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's life and other situations.

Frugal in Self-Discipline and Generous in Forgiveness

Mr. Mitsuru Toyama looked serious, was frugal in self-discipline, and was kind and forgiving to others. He had a high and far-sighted understanding of the relations between China and Japan. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama believed that to revitalize East Asia, we must help China and Japan prosper in order to achieve the prosperity of Asia. This point has already been proven by facts today, and it is indeed the correct path without any deviation. The Premier and Mr. Mitsuru Toyama believed in it many years ago, which is truly rare. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was an absolute royalist to Japan. He was absolutely respectful and loyal to the imperial family, but he also absolutely supported the Chinese revolutionary cause, because he believed that the Chinese revolution was a righteous cause arising from patriotism, so he absolutely supported it. Moreover, he not only made every effort to support the Chinese revolution, but also provided assistance to the Indian revolution and the Philippine revolution in many ways. Zhongfu remembers that in Tokyo, one year, when Indian comrades were at a loss in Tokyo, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, in his capacity as a civilian, sincerely rescued them. This is Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's clear-minded, open-minded, and generous expression. As for being silent all his life, he had the great power of subtle influence. In a word, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was a great man. As long as he believed it was righteous for the country, he would eventually protect this person.

When war broke out between China and Japan, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was deeply saddened. Many people persuaded Mr. Mitsuru Toyama to go to Chongqing to mediate and turn the two countries from enemies into friends. However, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's intention was to travel across mountains and rivers for the two countries, regardless of the dangers along the way, as long as he could find a solution, he would not care about anything. We should admire the 90-year-old man for having such great courage. At Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's 88th birthday two years ago, tens of thousands of guests came to celebrate at the Kokugikan in Ryogoku, Tokyo, and people came from home and abroad. This year was his 90th birthday, and it was originally planned to celebrate it, but unfortunately, he fell ill at the foot of Mount Fuji and passed away suddenly, which was a great loss for Asia. It is a pity and regrettable. It is said that after Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's death, the mourners from all over the world went to Zojoji Temple in Shiba Park for more than a month, from morning to night, regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy. Japan respects Shintoism, and the Japanese imperial family specially sent an imperial messenger to present a sakaki tree. It is said that the imperial family only bestows sakaki to national heroes at state funerals. Sakaki is unique to Japan, and I am afraid that many of our people do not understand it very well. It is a wooden object, but it is a rare honor to be specially bestowed by the emperor after death. If a duke or minister has made great contributions to the country, the Ministry of the Imperial Household can request the Emperor to bestow it as a favor, which is already rare. As I said before, there are only a few people who have received it. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama is different from this, because he is a commoner and has no noble title or official position, so the Ministry of the Imperial Household cannot request it as usual. This time, it was specially granted by the Emperor, and the favor was indeed more difficult to obtain than before. It was the first time that a commoner was bestowed sakaki. Or compare it to the posthumous titles bestowed to high officials in the Qing Dynasty, but it is not very similar. In the Qing Dynasty, only high officials of the first or second rank were required to obtain posthumous titles after death, and many people obtained them. Although it was said to be an honor, it was not comparable to the rarity of the Japanese bestowal of sakaki. Moreover, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, as a commoner, obtained this, which was even more rare and commendable. It was the greatest honor.

Great in Life and Mourned After Death

What Zhongfu has said today at the memorial service about Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's life is less than one ten-thousandth, but I would like to ask everyone to pay attention to: (1) Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's personality, behavior, and the greatness of his public loyalty, especially his kindness and enthusiasm towards China; (2) Today, the people of various East Asian countries in Shanghai are mourning Mr. Mitsuru Toyama. We are expressing our sincere condolences from the standpoint of the people. It can be said that it is the true public opinion of the people. All politics, the most sublime purpose, can be included in one sentence, but it is only to promote the public opinion of the people. Unexpectedly, under the current situation, the memorial service for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama has achieved a truly complete expression. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama spent his life as a commoner, loyal to the emperor and loving the country, supporting the weak and suppressing the strong. His will was also to seek political clarity and the prosperity of East Asia. The expression of public opinion is the foundation. I think that if Mr. Mitsuru Toyama knew in the afterlife, he would surely regard today's grand gathering as the most in line with his will and the most glorious.

### Speech by Mr. Junzaburo Yamada, Representative of the Japanese People

The smoke of war covers the sky over the continent, and the autumn orchids at the riverbank turn the scenery into desolation. On this 26th day of November, Showa 19, with the participation of many representatives of Japanese and Chinese civilian organizations and like-minded people in Shanghai, as well as representatives of various ethnic groups in the Great East Asian Allied nations, I respectfully offer this clear wine and delicious food to the spirit of the late Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, Grand Light Court Hall, Prosperity, Compassionate Mountain, Standing Cloud Layman. I, Junzaburo, am honored to be in the last seat, representing Japanese comrades to express our condolences from afar, to express our meager sincerity.

At this time, when our motherland Japan is working hard to fight for the liberation of the ten billion peoples of Great East Asia, the guiding spirit of Mr. Toyama, who devoted his entire life to this keynote, passed away on October 5 at the age of ninety. When the bad news came, we were all saddened. In the past, when Mr. Sun Zhongshan and comrades from Japan and China advocated the Chinese revolution with the Kuomintang, Mr. Toyama and the late Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi gave their support, encouragement, assistance, and guidance with a sea-like sincerity and a consistent spirit, until the Wuchang Uprising and the Xinhai Revolution finally succeeded. In January of Meiji 45, when Mr. Zhongshan took office as President in Nanjing, Mr. Toyama and Mr. Inukai visited Nanjing in person to celebrate and encourage him. In June of Showa 4, when the remains of the Father of the Nation were enshrined in Nanjing, the two gentlemen participated again and continued to assist in the revolution. We are grateful for the virtue of the two gentlemen. After the death of the two gentlemen, the revolution succeeded, Mr. Inukai was abandoned midway, and now we have received the obituary of Mr. Toyama. How can our feelings be merely sad! However, the current situation is changing with the times and the development of the world situation. The implementation of Mr. Zhongshan's legacy and Mr. Inukai's martyrdom have also contributed to the promotion of the Japanese Restoration. Mr. Toyama's lifelong advocacy and assistance for the independence and liberation of the ten billion peoples of Asia, the three gentlemen should look at each other and smile in the afterlife. However, looking at the current situation as a whole, there is still a dark shadow in one corner of the continent. Mr. Toyama's death is bound to be a great regret. He advocated for the full harmony and true cooperation between Japan and China during his lifetime, but the Chongqing side is entrenched in Chongqing, rebelling against the teachings of the Father of the Nation. If they abandon the dream of resisting Japan, they will not be dogs of the United States and Britain. Many of the Chongqing gentlemen have been taught by Mr. Toyama in Tokyo for many years. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly severe, the Imperial Army is fighting bravely, and the great victories that are won in every battle are frequently reported, how will the Chongqing gentlemen feel when they hear the news of Mr. Toyama's death?

Now that Mr. Toyama is resting in peace forever, when will we be able to lay bare the current situation in East Asia and the courage and sincerity to restore the revolutionary tradition, and we are willing to join hands with you to offer sacrifices to Mr. Toyama's spirit? I hope that Mr. Toyama's spirit, as it was in Japan, will guide us in our actions and bestow blessings and protection. Showa 19, November 26th, Yamada Junzaburo."
