### Aftermath of the Special Tax Embezzlement Case

The embezzlement case involving former staff of the Special Tax Office of the First District Public Office has aroused serious attention from all walks of life since its exposure. We briefly discussed it in a short commentary on the 15th. It is now heard that the municipal authorities and the responsible departments have decided to conduct a thorough investigation into the principal and accessory offenders in the case and punish them according to the law. The head of the Special Tax Section has been detained yesterday, and it is expected that the full details of the case will be announced to the public soon.

Financial needs require consolidation, and tax revenues require rectification. These are the most urgent needs in the municipal revitalization work because finance is the mother of all administrations. The advancement of various administrative tasks requires financial impetus. Regarding the aftermath of this embezzlement case, we offer a few more humble opinions as follows:

First, this embezzlement case has been going on for a long time and is deeply rooted. It is said that the internal organization is also quite strict. Therefore, a wide range of aspects are involved, and the investigation must be conducted impartially. After the entire case is thoroughly investigated, in addition to punishing the principal and accessory offenders with the crimes they deserve, all the property of the principal offenders must be confiscated to warn other embezzlers.

Second, while conducting a fair investigation of the case, the responsible authorities should also actively compile a comprehensive reform plan for the collection of special taxes. The key to this plan is not to focus on trivial problems or partial reforms but to pay attention to overall planning, so that taxpayers cannot evade taxes and to reduce opportunities for fraud, making it impossible for the personnel involved to operate. The more transparent the tax collection method, the better, and the simpler the tax collection procedure, the better. Transparency allows taxpayers to fully understand, and collectors have no way to conceal. Simple procedures make it difficult for collectors to take advantage of fraud.

Third, the personnel of the tax collection agency should be given the utmost importance. The selection of the person in charge should not be based on the experience of handling tax collection, but should be based on reliable candidates recognized by the society, or the most reliable candidates recommended by well-established industrial and commercial groups. The treatment of general staff must be improved to reduce the motivation for illegal activities.

Fourth, the audit work has a transcendent and sacred nature. In addition to the person in charge of the competent authority, all relevant agencies, such as the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Advisory Committee, and secondly, the industrial and commercial sectors, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silver Money Association, should send personnel to participate in the joint audit.

Fifth, the industrial and commercial sectors should also exercise self-discipline. The embezzlement of some special tax office staff is mostly colluded with shops. Often, shop owners are unwilling to increase the wages of shop assistants in order to reduce their burden, so they take advantage of the ease of evasion of consumption special taxes, deliberately allowing shop assistants to collude with tax collectors to evade taxes and subsidize the living expenses of shop assistants. In the future, severe penalties should also be prescribed for tax evasion by the industrial and commercial sectors.

Finally, it is hoped that taxpayers will cooperate with the authorities to help prevent shop fraud. In the past, some small-scale shops did not issue invoices for the goods sold, but the taxes were collected as usual. If asked, they would say that the special tax had been included, which was obviously fraudulent tax evasion. The authorities should strictly order shops to issue invoices for the goods sold, stating the tax amount. Taxpayers should refuse or report shops that collect taxes without issuing invoices stating the tax amount.

### Japanese Troops on Tinian and Guam Islands Fight Courageously, Launching Repeated Surprise Attacks That Leave the Enemy With No Chance to Breathe

Central News Agency, Central Pacific, 20th—The Japanese troops on Tinian and Guam Islands are inflicting heavy losses on the enemy with their natural defenses and are continuing to fight. On the night of the 18th, about fifty flares were seen over Tinian Island and about ten over Guam Island, crisscrossing each other, indicating the intensity of the battle.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th—It has been a month since the Japanese troops on Guam Island have been fighting bravely against the enemy with a small number of troops since the US troops landed on July 21. At present, the battle lines between the Japanese and US troops are still extremely intertwined, and chaotic battles are taking place everywhere. A correspondent for the Times magazine broadcast from the radio station on the 17th about the fierce resistance of the Japanese troops to the US troops who landed on the island, saying that it was even more intense than on Saipan Island. The main points are as follows: The difficulty of the battle on Guam Island was beyond expectation. In this landing operation, most of the US Pacific Fifth Fleet commanded by Halsey and the Third Amphibious Force participated. At the same time, the US Navy Third Division also landed from the middle of Asan Piatep Bay, north of Orote Port, to participate in the battle. The Japanese troops launched a fierce counterattack, especially the night raids, so the US troops killed in action and missing in action are about 150 or more every day, which is no less than the battle on Saipan Island. In order to relieve this difficult situation, the Army 77th Division had to be landed to support the battle, which is still continuing. The resistance of the Japanese troops has not weakened, and the US troops cannot afford to relax. The US Navy and small units of Japanese troops who are stubbornly resisting everywhere with strong positions have to engage in a battle without rest.

Japanese Submarine Results in the Mariana Sea

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base in the Pacific, 20th—

Japanese submarines in the Mariana Islands area have overcome all difficulties in battle and have sunk many enemy ships by virtue of their stealth. On June 16, a new 45,000-ton enemy battleship that was firing on land 25,000 meters from Guam Island was sunk instantly by a Japanese submarine's surprise attack in broad daylight.

When enemy ships invaded the Mariana Islands, a Japanese submarine discovered a mobile unit composed of enemy battleship groups and aircraft carrier groups about 100 kilometers west of Rota Island. Due to the recent development of "radio wave detectors" and "underwater listening devices," it was difficult to approach enemy ships. However, the Japanese submarine disregarded everything and rushed towards a mother ship in the center of the enemy fleet, breaking through the enemy fleet's heaviest defenses. However, the Japanese submarine wanted to use close combat when it reached a considerable distance, and only grasped the target with a periscope, and fired several torpedoes at the enemy's "Wasp" type large aircraft carrier (Note: The Wasp was sunk by the Japanese submarine Gakuen on August 15, 1942, this should be the Wasp II or III). At that time, the Japanese submarine had dived deep and listened for the sound of the hit, but soon it was attacked by enemy mines, so it was not possible to know in detail how the enemy ship sank. Also, a submarine squadron in the Mariana waters discovered an enemy ship resembling an aircraft carrier on the eastern sea of Saipan Island at about 8:00 p.m. on June 30. The Japanese army immediately fired torpedoes, hitting the ship and causing a big fire. The Japanese army on Saipan Island strictly monitored the burning enemy ship. As a result, the enemy ship tilted sharply and was swallowed by the waves. In this battle, the Japanese submarine squadron also suffered fierce attacks from the enemy and has not yet returned to base. Recently, radio wave detectors have become increasingly developed, and activities have become extremely difficult, but enemy ships still cannot avoid the attacks of Japanese submarines. The larger the enemy ship and the stricter the alert, the easier it is to sink it with the vigorous fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers.

### Pacific Japanese Army Situation in One Week

(Continued from yesterday)

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th

In the South Pacific, since July 27, enemy troops with mortars have attacked the Japanese army positions near Galakoba, about 20 kilometers north of Torokina, Solomon Islands, but they were completely repelled by the Japanese army on August 2. In addition, enemy troops near the Larma River (7.5 kilometers west of Torokina) have also attacked the Japanese army positions for days since the end of July. After the Japanese army surrounded and attacked at dawn on August 7, as of now, the confirmed results include 68 enemy corpses and 3 destroyed heavy machine guns. In the Rabaul area, the enemy US army repeatedly used the workers in the area to arm themselves, while they stayed behind to guard the rear, doing everything they could to be cunning.

In the area west of New Guinea Island, enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese army base on the Bird's Head Peninsula. The bombing of Manokwari on August 13 was the most intense, with as many as 58 fighter-bombers attacking. No enemy aircraft were seen in Sorong and Fakfak, etc. At present, Japanese troops in various places are fiercely intercepting from the sea, land, and air. In the North Pacific, several enemy aircraft attacked twice during the day on August 12. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, one aircraft was shot down. At dawn on the 15th, three more enemy aircraft attacked, but the Japanese side did not suffer any losses. (End)

### Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns Home to Report on His Duties

Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th—Goro Shigemitsu, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, left Moscow on the afternoon of the 18th to return home to report on the situation in various aspects.

### North China Rapidly Increases Production

Responding to the bloody battles of the soldiers at the front, North China, the logistics base of the Greater East Asia, is also rapidly increasing production, in line with the overall mobilization of the rear production base in Japan. Especially since the announcement of the news of the complete annihilation of the army on Saipan Island, the entire Japanese population, including students, led by the North China Army's production volunteer team, have been mobilized and struggling in the sweltering heat. The task of North China's contribution to strengthening the decisive battle power is becoming increasingly important as the war situation deepens, because how much production and transportation there is can be said to have become an important basis for completing the war.

Raw Material Supply

Southern

War Material

Transportation

Will inevitably become

More difficult. On the other hand, the supply of war necessary materials undertaken by North China is also increasing. The amount of iron, coal, and antimony, cotton, and alunite shale, etc., which are important materials that replace aluminum, supplied by North China to Japan accounts for 0% of the entire Greater East Asia region. This amount is not enough to counter the enemy's material offensive, and more production and transportation than the current amount is an inevitable requirement. In recent years, North China has not only been a raw material supply base but has also developed into a task of supplying products made on the spot. Therefore, from the new perspective of industrial form that prepares for the supply of raw materials and the transportation of products, the construction of the North China industrial zone has begun. The construction of large and small smelting furnaces and the establishment of light metal factories are proceeding step by step, and the lively engine sounds are moving again.

Transportation Guarantee

As for transportation

Due to

Insufficient ships

Sea transport is difficult

Therefore, land transport is used instead. The guarantee of transportation capacity centered on the North China Transportation Company and the establishment of transportation connecting Manchuria, Korea, Mengjiang, etc. are expected to greatly improve the transportation of wartime materials. In addition, the food problem and labor problem, etc., which are necessary for the increase in production and transportation of these important materials, are also being planned to improve the production increase measures, rice collection measures, and because of the smooth transaction with Central China, Manchuria, Mengjiang, Korea, etc., the difficult food rice problem in North China has been eliminated.

Labor Needs

As for labor

Problems, because

Of the need

For labor, the Communist

Army's disruption of labor work, and

The evacuation situation has fundamentally revised

The previous labor measures and

Forcibly promote labor management. However

Due to rising prices, changes in the security situation, etc.,

There are still many hidden difficulties in increasing production

and transportation. The embassy authorities in

April of this year requested that Yamamoto

Vice Minister of Greater East Asia lead the North China

Industry Inspection Group to visit. According

To the results of the inspection, examine and open

Various difficulties between the Japanese mainland and North China,

Following the investigation by Fujiwara

Former Minister without Portfolio,

It was pointed out that the current problems in North China

Are not only the difficulty in obtaining materials,

The incomplete facilities, the unfavorable conditions, etc.,

And the urgent task is actually

To reorganize the industrial form into wartime

Form.

Overcoming Difficulties

From Fujiwara

Former Minister without Portfolio's

Words,

The current situation in North China,

Whether it is the bottleneck in production or the bottleneck in transportation,

Must be overcome with further efforts and

Research. The Standing Bureau then

Convened a meeting of the heads of the various public halls on the 14th of last month,

Based on Fujiwara's

Inspection results, in order to promote the great development of North China's industry,

Establish a grand policy of "tripling production,"

Based on this, decide to increase production, the

Specific methods of promoting transportation,

Unfold

The North China Army's production volunteer team and

Comprehensive activities in various aspects.

But on the other hand, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is gradually

Intensifying the guerrilla warfare in North China.

In response, both the military and the people

Have established foolproof measures, plus

The cooperation and decisive battle of the North China people,

Breaking through the enemy's air raids, aiming at the two major goals of

Increased production and transportation, which North China currently regards as urgent,

And together with the rapid rise of the mainland's production capacity,

The shift of North China's material offensive, not crushing the United States' ambition, will not stop. (Translated from the Yomiuri Shimbun of August 2)

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Kyushu and Other Places, More Than Ten Aircraft Shot Down, Proving the Strictness of the Japanese Air Defense Array

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th—The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 8:00 p.m. on August 20: At 5:00 p.m. today, about 60 U.S. Air Force aircraft stationed in Chongqing, organized into several echelons, attacked Kyushu and western China (western part of the Japanese mainland) for about an hour. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down more than ten of them. Among them, three were shot down by aircraft colliding with each other. Several American pilots parachuted from the downed aircraft and were captured. There was some damage on the Japanese side.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th—The mobile unit of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has invaded the Japanese mainland at about 5:00 p.m. on the 20th after attacking Japan three times at night since June of this year. The Japanese air force launched a fierce attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. On that day, the U.S. Air Force formed several formations, attempting to invade simultaneously the northwestern part of northern Kyushu and the western part of the Chugoku region. The Japanese air force, which was ready to go, launched a joint attack, and land artillery also bombarded fiercely, immediately shooting down more than ten of them. The enemy aircraft that were not shot down also failed to achieve their goals, blindly bombed, and fled. In particular, the enemy aircraft in western China were chased by the Japanese air force and fled without dropping bombs, so there were no losses. The detailed battle results are still being investigated, and the Japanese General Headquarters will continue to announce them. It is now clear that at least more than ten enemy aircraft were shot down, about one-third of the attacking enemy aircraft. Among them, three were shot down by Japanese aircraft colliding with them. In addition, several American pilots shot down in the northern Kyushu area parachuted and were immediately captured by the Japanese army. In addition, several places on land in the northern Kyushu area suffered some damage, but it has now been determined that they are all very minor.

Nanjing Briefs

### Glimpses of the Capital

— Min Xian

Reporters and others came to Nanjing to investigate the rural economy in the suburbs. It happened that the city suburbs were heavily guarded, making it inconvenient to travel around. We had to walk around the city and take a cursory look. We didn't see much, so we only report a few trivial matters to the readers:

There are many open spaces in Nanjing City. In the past, there were people who used them to grow vegetables and plant flowers, but they didn't try their best to use them. What we saw this time was that almost all of the former useless mountain depressions were filled with vegetables. The garden city is a great sight. Based on the rising cost of living, everyone is thinking about adapting to the environment and turning the useless into the useful. In recent years, the authorities have actively promoted increased production, and the capital city circle is close at hand, so it should be the first to promote it.

When the National Government returned to Nanjing, the population of Nanjing was only more than 100,000. Now, according to the June survey report of the Nanjing Municipal Government Baojia Committee, it has reached 696,403 people, including 296,569 "adult" men, 241,356 women, 82,753 "children" men, and 75,725 women. The rapid increase in population reflects the prosperity of society.

Since Hu Hou was executed in Yuhuatai in Beijing, followed by Gu Zhou's detention, and other judicial assistants, section chiefs, court judges, prosecutors, etc., have been arrested one after another, so that the capital detention center may be changed into a dormitory for criminal officials. For a time, the trend seemed to be gradually becoming clearer. Almost all of the conversation materials of the old people in Beijing are about this matter, and the national interest and people's welfare are worthy of expectation. However, it is heard that the second salary increase and rice distribution for civil servants have not been fully realized, and the cost of living has continued to rise, so those who abide by the law are still inevitably among the hungry. The ancient Confucian saying that the granary is full and then knows etiquette and justice seems to be adjusted by the wise authorities at any time.

Nanjing is vast, and transportation is extremely lacking, which is very inconvenient. Now, the only small train that runs from Xiaguan to Zhonghua Gate and runs through the city is even more crowded due to the reduction in the number of trains. The price of rickshaws is often dozens or hundreds of yuan. The charcoal cars that run from Xiaguan to Xinjiangkou Sanshan Street carry at least ten passengers each time, which is extremely crowded, but because of their speed and low cost, each person is charged 80 yuan each time, and people flock to ride them. It is said that Zhou Zheng plans to build an electric train from Fuzimiao to Xiaguan. If so, it will be much more convenient. The price of rice in Beijing is still around 4,000 yuan per stone, so that other foods are cheaper than in Shanghai.

### New Measures in the Philippines to Strengthen National Power, Evacuate Population, and Close Night Entertainment Venues

Central News Agency, Manila, 20th—How the new Philippines is strengthening its national power and coping with the decisive battle is of concern to all countries. The following is an introduction to the recent situation in Manila: Manila has completely closed dance halls, brothels, dance halls, and other night entertainment venues since August 1. American movies that were shown in the past have also been completely replaced by new Japanese products and local products. Night entertainment venues in the Philippines are mostly concentrated in Manila, with a total of 26, including 15 dance halls, 4 brothels, and 7 dance training centers. The reason for their closure is not only because they are traps for the moral degradation of young people, but also because they are of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood in this decisive battle period when food is scarce and prices are soaring. Moreover, the character of this kind of night entertainment venue is purely American, so it is hoped that foreigners and aspiring citizens will cooperate. In the past, the Philippines allowed the performance of unhealthy anti-war and erotic films from the United States, which was quite surprising. The Philippines currently has 1,600 American films. After re-examination, only 500 are allowed to be shown. In the future, when Japanese films are widely shown, American films can be gradually eliminated. In addition, the traffic restriction time in Manila has been changed from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. in the past to 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning, extending it by two hours. The number of pedestrians and drunkards late at night has gradually decreased. In addition, the plan to evacuate the population of Manila was decided earlier this year and will be evacuated every day. Because the citizens have realized that Manila has entered the radius of enemy aircraft, to prevent air disasters, and because the population of Manila is too large, to solve the three problems of food, transportation, and housing, it is necessary to evacuate. The Philippine government has decided to thoroughly take measures to ban gambling and horse racing among Manila citizens, and will completely evacuate unemployed citizens outside the city. An evacuation committee has now been formed. There are 800 to 900 restaurants in Manila, supporting the food and life of 90,000 citizens. Recently, due to the sudden increase in public canteens, first-class restaurants can also be closed.

### The Confrontation Between the Chongqing Nationalists and Communists is Becoming Increasingly Profound

Central News Agency News—In early May, Chongqing held a Xi'an preparatory conference on the Chongqing Communist issue, and formal Chongqing Communist adjustment negotiations were held in Chongqing. Recently, the negotiations between the two sides have been in a state of breakdown. Yan'an has requested the establishment of a special political zone, the import of foreign aid military supplies into Yan'an, and the participation of the Yan'an army in major operations. The democratic system advocated by Yan'an is far from it. Because Chongqing is receiving American aid, it supports its anti-war policy and has to implement the democratic politics required by the United States. Moreover, the democratic politics advocated by the Kuomintang is democratic politics that does not conflict with the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, while what Yan'an advocates is therefore, although Chongqing has promoted democratic politics to Britain and the United States, it has not been able to compromise with Yan'an. Although the adjustment negotiations between the two sides have stopped, no military conflict has occurred, in fact because Chongqing fears the United States. Whether the Nationalists and Communists will break down in the future, and whether they will immediately resort to force after the breakdown of negotiations, is still a question, but the confrontational relationship between the Nationalists and Communists will become more profound, which is a definite and unshakable trend.

### Nationalist Government Army Punishes Lu-Yu Faction Troops

Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th—The Nationalist Government's Second Army, led by Regiment Commander Ai Lansheng, with the support of the Japanese army, punished about 2,000 Yu faction troops in the northern part of Mengyin County, near Tangzhuang, on July 31. At dawn on the 31st, they encountered Yu troops near Xucun. The Yu troops counterattacked seven times, but were finally defeated by our side. In this battle, 265 corpses of Yu troops were recovered. In addition, the Japanese army punishment team attacked the First Regiment of the Yu faction Shandong Security Force (Regiment Commander Zhang Liyuan) of about 200 people in Ganlinggou (20 kilometers southeast of Ze County) at about 7:00 a.m. on July 9. In this battle, the Yu troops abandoned 15 corpses, and the Japanese army seized a large number of weapons and ammunition, etc.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Formulates Methods for Designated Tenants to Pay Grain

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 20th—Since this year, Jiangsu Province has changed the land tax to in-kind. The provincial government has convened a meeting of county magistrates, finance bureau chiefs, and tax administration office directors to decide to implement it according to the scheduled procedures. It is learned that the provincial authorities, in view of the habit of landowners in various counties of the province to rent out their fields to tenants for cultivation, calculate the annual rent income by converting the rice price into cash. Now, because of the collection of in-kind, it is inevitable that there will be difficulties in ordering them to pay rice. In order to take care of these landowners, they are allowed to designate tenants, and the collection agency directly collects from the tenants. This method of designated tenants to pay grain has a rent and grain comparison table, which requires landowners to fill in the form according to the format and submit it to the local collection agency before September 10 for processing.

### U.S. Troops Complete Decisive Battle Formation on the Banks of the Seine; Mechanized Units Advance Towards Paris

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency)

A Reuter's dispatch reports: The German authorities announced on the 19th that the vanguard of the American forces has finally reached the banks of the Seine River, northwest of Paris.

German Troops in Normandy Adopt Evasive Maneuvers

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency)

A Huitong News Agency dispatch reports: As American forces advance towards the central Seine River and the Trou-Argentan area, German troops in the Normandy region have begun large-scale evasive maneuvers. Evasive maneuvers are also taking place east of the mouth of the Dieppe River. Fierce battles have broken out as the Allied forces pursue, but their progress is slow. Canadian troops have reached Vicq in the central Dieppe River area. German troops west of Falaise-Argentan have retreated from the upper reaches of the Orne River to the upper reaches of the Dieppe River. Canadian troops advancing southwest from Falaise have reached Trun. After a German armored counterattack, German troops continued their eastward retreat. American forces attempted to break through the Gas-Leagl area but were repulsed. The American Third Army is encircling eastward, advancing from the Trou area towards Mantes and other places, resulting in fierce battles. German troops in the Etampes area are putting up strong resistance. The intention of the Allied forces is clearly to advance directly towards Paris.

### Integration of Science and Technology with Production Administration; New Organization Established in the Japanese Cabinet

The new Japanese cabinet considers a massive increase in war production as the most important priority. Recently, there are strong expectations among powerful scientists and technicians that, based on the requirements of the war and the current resource environment, science and technology should be integrated with military production administration. Establishing a new war production method that fully utilizes Japan's scientific and technological capabilities. The content of these expectations can be summarized as the following points:

Integration of Technical Administration

1.  Integration of Production Administration and Technical Administration: Modern warfare is a science war. Today's new weapons may not be tomorrow's new weapons. Therefore, production and science and technology must be integrated administratively. However, looking at the current situation, war production administration, centered on aircraft, has been centralized in the Ministry of Munitions. Recently, some have argued that the administration of army ordinance, naval ordinance, and fuel should also be integrated. In terms of technical administration, following the establishment of the Technology Institute, the cabinet also established the Research Mobilization Council. A unified system for research tasks and researcher decisions requested by the war has been provisionally completed. However, because important war production administration and scientific and technological administration are not directly linked, the intentions of the Technology Institute are not fully reflected in the production ministries. Furthermore, the Ministry of Munitions only manages the production administration of aircraft and related weapons. Technical relations still remain within the army and navy, which impedes smooth aircraft production.

Therefore, the strengthening of military power and the increase in production resulting from the collective efforts of scientists and technicians cannot be fully realized. Here, war production must be unified under the Ministry of Munitions, and technical administration should also be unified under the Ministry of Munitions, or strongly linked together.

Increasing Productivity

2.  Maintaining and Enhancing Existing Productivity: In order to maintain and enhance existing productivity, labor management must be refreshed, the level of production technology must be improved, and its application methods must be thoroughly characterized and made scientific for wartime. Furthermore, material and human resources in various aspects must be used efficiently through a unified national comprehensive plan.

For example, eliminating all-encompassing war production methods, adapting to the requirements of the war, and focusing all efforts on the production of aircraft and landing craft, while temporarily suspending the production of battleships, etc.

Establishing a Production System

3.  Establishment of a New War Production System: Looking at the state of production warfare in the Greater East Asia War, it is merely a confrontation between the mass production methods of the United States and Britain and similar Japanese production methods. Therefore, we cannot yield an inch to the enemy's rapid counterattack with its emphasis on quantity.

To break this situation, we must abandon the production methods of the United States and Britain and produce new war materials based on the characteristics of Japan, so that Japanese soldiers can fully utilize them. Needless to say, the production of new war materials has been steadily achieving results, but we cannot be satisfied at the present stage.

Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of producing new war materials, we must go beyond the scope of the army, navy, or the Ministry of Munitions and immediately summon and mobilize necessary scientists and technicians, organize them into units, and enforce special research tasks that proceed alongside warfare day and night, so that their results can be materialized and applied to the war effort.

Furthermore, in order to ensure appropriate and rapid adjustment, research, production, and application, we must combine the currently dispersed planning hubs—establish an agency with the nature of a wartime administrative staff headquarters in the cabinet, and address the accumulated issues from a national perspective. This is an indispensable condition.

### Equality and Justice

— Jia Ling

The Jiaotong University Tuition Fee Problem

I received a letter from the school, which contained a school opening schedule and a tuition fee bill. The tuition fee bill was printed with words like "Ministry of Education Directive", it turns out the tuition fee for the next semester has been approved by the Ministry of Education, and the directive number is specifically recorded as proof, fearing that students would not be clear about it. The result: Tuition fee 5,000 yuan, medical fee 100 yuan, miscellaneous fees are not included, and those who have chemical experiments have to pay extra experimental fees. The school, is the prestigious National Jiaotong University.

Not long ago, there were articles in the newspaper discussing the gains and losses of Jiaotong University's tuition fee rising to 1,000 yuan next semester. It was all very logical. But now it has become 5,000 yuan! If it is for the livelihood of the teachers and 5,000 yuan is a necessity, then the students, as long as they have the ability, will pay even if they have to pawn everything. We can't starve the teachers! Look! Aren't the private universities charging 6,000 or 7,000 yuan? Hujiang University charges 6,000. St. John's 7,000. But of course, we have to understand the "National" title. On August 12th, there was another piece of news in the newspaper: "...The tuition fee for National Central University is set at 800 yuan..." Another "National" university. But what about the tuition fee? 800 yuan.

One is 5,000 yuan, the other is 800 yuan. Is there a reason? Of course, there is a reason.

Rice in Nanjing costs 3,000 yuan per stone, and in Shanghai it costs 7,000 yuan per stone. But even with cheaper rent, etc., the maximum ratio is only one to three. And isn't cloth cheaper in Shanghai than in Nanjing? And... so at most three times 800, is 2,400. Are there other reasons? Yes! The Ministry of Education's subsidies are different! Why? The difference in the amount is so large? This needs an explanation. Well, everyone is "National", one is "Jiaotong", the other is "Central". Oh, because it is "Central"! But is this a reason? I am a little confused. We need an explanation.

In primary school, we learned about "equality", and in middle school, we learned about "justice", but now in university, we are getting more and more confused. Of course, we believe that our wise government must be very clear. It can explain to us, explain it very pleasantly. We are looking forward to seeing the explanation!

### Weekly Industrial and Commercial Market Conditions

The Shanghai market's surplus funds and industrial and commercial market conditions have become more stable in the past week. After the rampant black market calmed down, there was another price surge at the end of the week. Sycee silver also saw a slight rise in trading. Because the Central Bank is doing its best to regulate the head position, the money supply is still relaxed. The overnight loan interest rate of the money industry is listed at 3.7%, and has not changed. However, general speculative funds are converging on investing in enterprises, so the Hua share market has been rising steadily and the market trading is extremely prosperous. Among the various industrial and commercial sectors, domestic products have generally seen a slight decline, but the price increase of items related to industrial production is more obvious. This is because the production volume of the industry is reduced by a limit on power usage. As a result, items like cigarettes, matches, soap and candles have all risen from before. Among them, the price surge of cigarettes is the most severe. As for the flour related to people's livelihood, most flour mills are still operating as usual, and the authorities are supplying as much electricity as possible to the flour mills. Therefore, the amount of flour production has increased sharply, and the allocation of flour to household accounts has doubled compared to the past, so the price of flour is stable. Rice is also being supplied on a regular basis in the household rice program, and rice shipped from inland to Shanghai is continuously arriving. In addition, the new rice is about to be available, and there is no worry about the source being exhausted, and the people's food can be stable for a long time. For this reason, the price of rice continued to fall in the past week.

### Today's Match Schedule for the Fuhua Cup Small Ball Tournament

In the Fuhua Cup Small Ball League, in several matches last week, the Fu Group's Xuanjiong won against the Police Protection Team, while Huatong lost 3-0 to the Jews. In the Hua Group, Huanan's ball luck was extremely poor and shook hands with Sorkel for a draw. In another match, the result between Hequn and Jishe was related to the championship, so both sides concentrated their efforts. Hequn also had Tie Mengai from Tiemen come to help, making the game extremely tense. Hequn finally relied on the soldiers to exert their efforts and won over Jishe with a score of 3-2. There will still be two matches at the original location starting at 5:00 this afternoon, both in the Hua Group. In the first match, the German Merchants and the Portuguese Merchants will meet. Although the former's record has not been particularly good, its lineup is not weak. The latter is making its first appearance, so it is difficult to predict the outcome. In the second match, Jishe will meet Sorkel. Jishe has ample strength, and it should be able to win.
