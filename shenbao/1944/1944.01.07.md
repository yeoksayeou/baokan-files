### A Moment of Kindness!

Yesterday, I appealed to readers for educational assistance funds, hoping that everyone would contribute a moment of kindness to help the society and the nation achieve a century-long plan. Feeling that my intentions were not fully expressed, I sincerely appeal to all sectors again.

Since the establishment of the educational assistance fund movement by Xinwen Bao and this newspaper, it has only been a few sessions, but the actual results that can be reported to readers are: first, the number of young people receiving educational assistance funds is already quite considerable. Taking the last session of this newspaper as an example, it has reached more than four thousand. In other words, during the last semester, more than four thousand outstanding young people from poor families were able to enter school or continue their studies because of the generosity of enthusiastic people in society.

Second, according to our past investigations, the following conclusions can be drawn about the young people who receive educational assistance funds: They are indeed poor and unable to go to school but have noble aspirations. Among them, some are orphans and children from difficult children's shelters, and some have voluntarily requested to return the funds when there are other ways to receive assistance. It can be seen that the educational assistance fund is generally not wasted in any way. According to reports from various schools and individual investigations, almost all students who receive educational assistance funds are outstanding young people in terms of academic performance and character, and are respected by teachers and classmates. This is especially pleasing to donors.

Third, since the launch of the educational assistance fund movement, people from all walks of life have always responded enthusiastically. For example, the target for the last session was one million yuan, but the actual result reached more than 1.3 million yuan. On the one hand, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have generously donated, which can be described as "regardless of east, west, north, and south, regardless of men, women, old, and young," all enthusiastically participating. Moreover, on the other hand, many people who are not wealthy themselves have contributed their efforts with a year of kindness, such as the charity performances of several theater groups. Their spirit is equally admirable.

The past achievements encourage us to continue this most meaningful social service undertaking. It also makes us have greater expectations for this year's educational assistance fund movement. However, this year's problem is more serious than last year's, because, first, the general price level has increased several times compared to last year, and the ability of children from poor families to go to school has further decreased. In other words, a large group of out-of-school young people will be added to society! Second, due to the high prices, the cost of education will inevitably increase. A large number of young people who were barely in school this year will inevitably be excluded from the gates of the school! Third, if we do not raise enough tuition fees for the more than four thousand students who received educational assistance funds from this newspaper last semester, they will be in danger of dropping out of school! It can be seen that the current problem is that, on the one hand, the number of out-of-school young people will increase, and on the other hand, the amount of educational assistance funds needs to increase with prices. In short, this year's educational assistance fund needs more money than last year's.

For the above reasons, the amount of educational assistance fund for this year is tentatively set at three million yuan. We tirelessly hope that the gentlemen of the board of directors of industrial and commercial enterprises will set aside a small portion of their surplus to donate to the educational assistance fund. We also hope that people from all walks of life will set aside a small portion of their Spring Festival banquet and gift expenses to donate to the educational assistance fund. We firmly believe that this is the most meaningful act of kindness that goes beyond everything! We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will contribute a moment of kindness to help achieve this century-long plan, and strive to complete this semester's educational assistance fund movement. We have specially reserved the most glorious title page for you!

### Rabaul and Kavieng Air and Sea Battle Results: Imperial Headquarters Announces Downing of Large Numbers of Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 6th: On the morning of January 3rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted about 30 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 11 of them (4 of which were unconfirmed). Two of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial Destroyer Squadron and the Navy Air Force intercepted 76 enemy aircraft attacking Kavieng, shooting down 12 of them. Our side suffered no damage other than minor damage to one destroyer. On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted 22 enemy fighters attacking Rabaul, shooting down 18 of them (1 of which was unconfirmed). Three of our aircraft did not return to base.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 6th the results of the fierce enemy aircraft interception battles in the Rabaul and Kavieng areas on the 3rd and 4th. The details of the Japanese naval air squadron and destroyer squadron shooting down large numbers of enemy aircraft are as follows: In the Rabaul area, the US military attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 3rd with about 30 aircraft, including Vought F4U Corsairs and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters. The Japanese naval fighters immediately took to the air to intercept them, shooting down 10 F4U Corsairs and 1 F6F Hellcat fighter, for a total of 11 aircraft. On the morning of the 4th, the US military again used a total of 22 F4U Corsairs and F6F Hellcat fighters to repeatedly bomb Rabaul. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them in the air, shooting down 16 F4U Corsairs and 2 F6F fighters, for a total of 18 aircraft. Fully demonstrating the invincible spirit of the Japanese naval aircraft, the Japanese side lost two aircraft on the 3rd and three aircraft on the 4th, for a total loss of three aircraft. In the Kavieng area, the US military attacked Kavieng on New Ireland Island on the morning of the 4th with about 40 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, about 16 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, and about 20 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, for a total of about 76 aircraft. At that time, a Japanese destroyer squadron was on patrol in the Strait between New Ireland Island and New Hanover Island, so it was intercepted with the close cooperation of the Japanese naval fighter squadron. The Japanese destroyer squadron shot down 11 of them with anti-aircraft fire, and the Japanese naval aircraft shot down 1 of them, for a total of 12 aircraft. The reason why the air combat results were slightly lower was because the Japanese naval air squadron did not sortie to bomb enemy positions and enemy troops on that day, so only a few aircraft were guarding the Kavieng base. In this battle, the Japanese side suffered no losses except for slight damage to one destroyer, and the damaged destroyer was able to navigate very freely.

### Righteous Armies of Pingjin Pledge Allegiance to the Righteous Republican Government

Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese side had previously allowed the Italian expatriates in North China to regain their freedom. Now, because the Beijing Italian Guard and the Tianjin Marine Corps are willing to pledge allegiance to the Italian Fascist Republican Government and vow to cooperate with Japan and the Axis powers, it has been decided to release them. In Beijing, 39 people, including Major Qiobbani, held a swearing-in ceremony in the old Italian barracks in Dongjiaominxiang on the 29th of last month.

### Chongqing Officials Embezzle Relief Funds

[Location illegible], 6th (Central News Agency) - Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Chongqing Sixth War Zone, and the Hunan Provincial Government were defeated by the Japanese army in the recent Battle of Changde, so their prestige among the people has been swept away. Now, in order to try to restore it, they have requested Chongqing to allocate 30 million yuan as a recovery and relief fund. At the same time, they have widely publicized that they will provide relief to the general public, but the funds issued by Chongqing are only 2 million yuan, which is less than 10% of the requested amount. However, of this 2 million yuan, 1 million yuan has been embezzled by the provincial government and military circles, 500,000 yuan has been embezzled by the county magistrate, and 250,000 yuan has been embezzled by the bao chief and others. The actual amount used as relief funds is only 250,000 yuan. The corruption of the Chongqing military leaders and officials is truly astonishing. They widely publicized the relief of the people before the event, but after the event, they staged an ugly scene of embezzling public funds, so the people are full of complaints, and at the same time, the general public's sentiment is becoming more and more rebellious.

### Agreement on Vietnam's Supply of Rice and By-products to Japan Signed in Saigon Yesterday Afternoon

At the same time, an exchange of documents extending the validity of the exchange of official documents on the entry and residence of Japanese people in Vietnam, which was concluded on March 4 of last year, was also carried out. According to the contents of the agreement on Vietnam's supply to Japan, the contents are generally the same as last year. Regarding the supply price, it has been increased in accordance with the trend of other prices to stipulate a fair price. In the future, the lives of the farmers, who account for 95% of the Vietnamese population, can be stabilized as a result, and at the same time, the main food rice of the Japanese people can also be imported by several million tons every year, which will make a great contribution to the implementation of the Greater East Asia War.

### Winter Offensive Reaches Peak; Fierce Fighting in Western Ukraine; German Defense Battle at Dnipro Bend Wins Victory

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report: The Soviet winter offensive is currently in full swing and has achieved initial victories in many areas. In particular, in the Zhytomyr area, the Soviet army is still adopting its old strategy of constantly shifting its focus of attack. The enemy does not seem to intend to break through the main offensive strongholds. In addition to encountering fierce attacks southwest of Krychev, fierce battle areas are beginning to form in nearly two locations. Strong Soviet units are now pouring out of Kursk and concentrating along the highway. Soviet forces are also concentrated in the Perekop Isthmus, the gateway to Crimea, and in the Cherkassy area. This Soviet winter offensive does not have the appearance of a "Russian winter." Although there is frost at night, it melts during the day.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Captain Setorius, a Huitong News Agency correspondent: The Soviet offensive north of Nevel should not yet be regarded as the focus of the war shifting to that area. The situation in Vitebsk remained unchanged on Tuesday. Several Soviet infantry divisions, covered by large tank brigades, attacked west of Polotsk. The strategic value of this enemy action is still difficult to determine. At present, the Soviet pressure in the entire western Ukraine and the old border of Poland is still fierce. The German new defense line is located on the northern flank of the Vatutin Group. The Red Army has advanced west of Olyvuske and Novograd-Volynskyi. There has been fierce fighting in Berdychiv, and the German army has withdrawn from its eastern part.

South of Kazatin, the enemy vanguard is advancing towards the upper reaches of the Buh River and has been temporarily blocked. The enemy is currently in an unfavorable position because the left flank of the Vatutin Army is still 150 kilometers behind, fighting in the German positions at Belaya Tserkov. The German army there is a threat to the southern flank of General Vatutin.

The Soviet authorities are now preparing to attack from the east, west, and north. Because of this preparation, the fighting in the Dnipro bend has eased slightly in the past few days. The movement of large enemy forces is also taking place in the Nogai Steppe. As for whether this preparation is intended to cross the Dnipro River between Tokmak and Kherson, or whether it is to launch another attack on Crimea, it is not known. In any case, the purpose of the large army gathered by the enemy on the Perekop Isthmus is undoubtedly to attack Crimea.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, military news: After a long period of silence, the Soviet army suddenly used powerful units and tank formations in the Great Dnipro bend to attack north of Kryvyi Rih and east of Kirovograd yesterday, attempting to break through the German positions. The German army intercepted or repelled the enemy in fierce battles and counterattacks, and destroyed 149 Soviet tanks in this battle. The German army also won a complete victory in the defensive battle west of Pyatikhatki yesterday. The Soviet offensive was ineffective. The bridgeheads east of the Dnipro River are still entirely in German hands.

### German Defenses on the Atlantic Coast Consolidated; Landing Operations Will Inevitably Be Defeated

Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) - After the two meetings in Moscow and Tehran, the anti-Axis camp seems to have decided to launch an offensive operation on the European continent and established the anti-Axis army command for the invasion of Europe on December 24 of last year, using the British mainland as a base. The anti-Axis army command in the Mediterranean has also undergone major reforms to consolidate the formation for the conquest of Asia, and has declared 1944 as the year of decisive battle, striving to make people generally believe that the formation of the second front is imminent. However, from both military and political perspectives, there is an infinite sense of the time to form a second front. The German military authorities also know that while the Soviet army is continuing to launch a winter offensive, it is a good opportunity for the anti-Axis powers to carry out an offensive operation against Europe. However, the Zurich News reported from London that it fundamentally denied the possibility of a winter offensive, stating that the winter maritime climate is not suitable for landing operations and cannot be carried out according to the scheduled plan. Long nights and dense fog, although favorable for operations, the land is too muddy, and operations after landing cannot be carried out smoothly. The same is true in the Balkans. But if the anti-Axis powers abandon this opportunity, and the Soviet strength is limited, they will not be able to continue their offensive this spring. The German High Command sent Marshal Rommel to inspect the Atlantic defense line from the North Sea to the Bay of Biscay during the Tehran Conference, and actively reorganized the German defense forces along the European coast. It is reported that a part of General Dietel's corps has recently arrived in France. The German High Command has also added a large number of automatic artillery positions along the northern coast of France, and has also dispatched about a few new fighters and dive bombers. The Atlantic defense line will become stronger and stronger in the future. Even if the anti-Axis powers, fearing the prolongation of the war, take the risk of landing regardless of everything, they will inevitably be defeated by the German army.

### Fierce German Resistance on the Southern Italian Front; Commander of the British Eighth Army Replaced

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German news agency reports: The German army successfully prevented the anti-Axis forces from launching an offensive operation in various parts of the Southern Italian front on the 4th. The US Fifth Army sent reconnaissance aircraft to carry out reconnaissance in order to detect the German defenses, but was repelled when it reached the German forward positions. The German army also fiercely resisted the advance of the British and American forces north of Gatz Siripp on the morning of the 4th. Although the attack was extremely fierce, it ultimately failed to break through the German minefields. There was also fighting in various areas along the Adriatic coast. It is predicted that the anti-Axis forces will launch a large-scale offensive on the Southern Italian front in the next few days.

Stockholm, Sweden, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report from London: The Allied Headquarters in Algiers announced yesterday that Lieutenant General Leese has been appointed as the commander of the British Eighth Army, succeeding General Montgomery. At the end of 1942, Lieutenant General Leese was appointed as the commander of the 30th Regiment of the Eighth Army by Montgomery. Leese is currently 48 years old.

### New Commander of US Air Force in Mediterranean Region

Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the anti-Axis headquarters in the Mediterranean: Major General Twining has succeeded Major General Doolittle as the commander of the US Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean region. It was previously rumored that General Doolittle would be appointed as the commander of the US Air Force stationed in the UK.

### US Aircraft Lose Thousands in One Year

### German and French Western Cities Suffer Terrorist Air Raids; American Aircraft Lost Thousands in One Year

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday morning, a large formation of American bombers again invaded the German northern coastal area, fiercely bombing the Kiel city area. At the same time, multiple enemy aircraft also attacked western Germany, paying particular attention to the town of Dusseldorf. As in previous air raids, enemy aircraft flew high and dropped bombs under the cover of dark clouds. German anti-aircraft artillery and other air defense equipment engaged the enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage. Simultaneously, enemy aircraft also attacked occupied areas in western France. Over French territory alone, German anti-aircraft artillery shot down sixteen four-engine bombers and seven fighter planes. Reports of enemy aircraft being shot down continue to arrive, so the exact numbers are currently unknown. However, as far as is known, a total of over fifty British and American aircraft were shot down, with over four hundred aircrew lost.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to reports from London: The American Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleet carried out ninety-five bombing raids last year, reportedly losing a total of one thousand bombers and one hundred and fifty fighter planes. Furthermore, it is reported that in December alone, one hundred and sixty-eight heavy bombers were lost, and ninety-three were lost in the nine bombing raids in November.

### American Mortality Rate Increases Again

Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to reports from New York, the American Times weekly recently reported that the mortality rate of the American people has been declining since 1940, but has been increasing again since 1943. According to American statements, the main reasons are the increase in deaths among those over fifty years old, and the impact of the wartime emergency. Among them, the number of illnesses caused by overwork has increased, thus increasing the crisis in the mortality rate. Another reason is the decrease in marriage rates. Taking New York State as an example, the number of marriage licenses issued in 1943 broke the lowest record of the past four years, dropping from 93,085 in 1940 to 78,000 in 1943.

### American Authorities Warn Citizens that Japanese Military Strength is Extremely Powerful

Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the outbreak of this war, the American government has adopted a policy of concealment towards its citizens, only publishing false victory reports. According to reports from Washington, Rear Admiral Denfeld Ayers, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, recently broadcast a warning to the public, stating that the Japanese army still possesses enormous manpower and material resources. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, the American military has repeatedly attacked the Japanese army, but the Japanese fleet still maintains its original strength. Furthermore, the United States Office of War Information issued a statement on the night of the 4th, warning the American public, with the following main points: Anti-Axis forces have only recovered one-fiftieth of the area occupied by the German army and one-twentieth of the area occupied by the Japanese army. In the Pacific, they are still three thousand miles away from Tokyo. Moreover, the military power of the Japanese army is extremely powerful. The area occupied by the Japanese army is as vast as the United States. The American military will only be able to carry out an offensive using Pearl Harbor as a base. Conversely, the Japanese army is engaged in defense from various islands scattered throughout the Pacific, and these islands have all been built into solid naval and air force bases. Although there have been numerous fierce battles in the Pacific, the American military and anti-Axis forces have ultimately failed to engage the main forces of the Japanese army and navy. The strong morale of the Japanese soldiers is a well-known fact. Japan does not feel a lack of manpower and can mobilize 400 million laborers in the occupied territories, while the American military has only entered the outer corridors of the Japanese defense line and has not come into contact with the positions that the Japanese army must defend at any cost.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas reports from London: Marine Corps Commander Major General Adair of the Gilbert Islands stated: In the Pacific theater, the United States still has to go through many difficult and bloody battles. He hopes that the American people will not underestimate the Japanese.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas reports from London: Smith wrote in the "Daily Mail" yesterday, stating: If Japan has sufficient time to calmly adjust its war gains, there will be no hope of winning the war against Japan. The anti-Axis countries should not miss the opportunity to allow Japan to increase its strength, because the factor of time is in Japan's favor. Some people believe that Japan's industry is weak and will inevitably fail in the long term. This is a dangerous illusion. The land that Japan occupied in the early stages of the war has formed a great empire. If that country continues to possess this wealth of resources, Japan will inevitably become stronger day by day. If Japan can make good use of the natural resources in the occupied areas, Japan will become the world's leading power in a few years. Smith then called on the anti-Axis countries to change their strategy in the Pacific, because the anti-Axis countries' occupation of some islands and forests cannot weaken Japan's position. The Japanese main fleet has not yet been dispatched. If the anti-Axis countries want to defeat Japan, they must first destroy its navy. Therefore, the anti-Axis countries should force the Japanese navy to accept a major naval battle. Japan is also a strong power on land. The anti-Axis countries currently have little hope of defeating Japan on land. As for Chongqing, due to a lack of weapons, it is unable to launch a general offensive. Therefore, the long-rumored offensive in Burma will become a bubble.

### Conscription Ages of Various Belligerent Nations

With the aim of enhancing the combat strength of the army, Japan has reduced the conscription age by one year this time. Consequently, vigorous young men of nineteen years old are all taking up arms to serve on the frontiers. Since the outbreak of the China Incident seven years ago, up to and including this great war, the Japanese army, backed by its vast and unparalleled human resources, stands in stark contrast to the panicked British and Americans, who have reduced the conscription age to eighteen and are driving them onto the battlefield. Japan has consistently adhered to the conscription age of twenty. Now, in this decisive year of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, it is concentrating the abundant human resources accumulated over seven years on the decisive battle. The United Kingdom expanded the conscription age to eighteen two years ago in 1941, and the United States did so one year ago in 1942. Japan is only now gradually sending nineteen-year-old youths to the battlefield. By comparison, it is evident that Japan's human war strategy is robust. It has established a strategic posture as secure as a rock on the mainland and in the South Seas. At the same time, Japan's potential is also fully revealed here. Japan's sending of nineteen-year-old youths to the battlefield this time to cope with the armies composed of the exhausted eighteen-year-old youths of the enemy countries further consolidates the belief in victory. The conscription ages of the main belligerent nations in World War II are compared as follows:

United States

The United States boasts of having human resources of 130 million people, but according to President Roosevelt's fireside chat in 1942, it has been reduced to eighteen years old. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has simply been a mutual challenge in terms of age.

The United States implemented the Selective Service Act on September 16, 1940, one year before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thereby establishing the foundation for the current conscription law. According to that law, first, 16.5 million male citizens aged twenty-one to thirty-six were registered to receive one year of military training. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it was immediately cancelled, reducing twenty-one years old by three years to eighteen years old and increasing thirty-six years old to sixty-five years old. Men in this age range should be liable for conscription. However, President Roosevelt, fearing the individualism of the country, not only appealed to the people in a "fireside chat" on October 12, 1942, but also proposed to Congress, which, although passed by the House of Representatives, was ultimately opposed by the Senate (October 17).

Disregarding the opposition of the President and the military authorities, the Senate passed the following amendment by a vote of 39 to 31: "Young men aged eighteen and nineteen should undergo at least one year of military training in the United States before being sent overseas." Thus, at the joint meeting of the House and Senate on November 10, due to the efforts of the government, this amendment was removed and a temporary compromise was reached. On the 13th, the original proposal submitted by the President was finally signed. On November 18 of the same year, the President issued the following proclamation for those who reached the qualified age of eighteen to nineteen, and the current conscription law was established.

Male citizens who reach the age of eighteen after July 1, 1942, should complete their military registration from December 11 to 31.

Male citizens who reach the age of eighteen after January 1, 1943, should register on their birthday.

However, for students, limited to high school students, this conscription age is postponed until the end of the academic year, and they are free to enlist in most vocational schools and part of high school students. However, the United States also felt that this reduction in the conscription age had a great impact on the labor force in production. According to a statement by Paul McNutt, Chairman of the Wartime Human Resources Committee, the recruitment of 62.5 million human resources this year under the "Austin-Wadsworth Act" (compulsory registration and requisition of men aged eighteen to sixty-five and women aged eighteen to fifty) has also not been implemented due to strong opposition. Therefore, this current conscription law has a significant impact on the production sector. Currently, eighteen states in the United States have formulated regulations to employ teenagers from the age of sixteen to under eighteen in military factories, and seven other states are also discussing similar legislation. The labor force problem seems to be solved independently in various places. The Office of War Information report "Two Years of War in the United States," published in early December of this year, states that the current labor force in the United States, including those serving in the military, is 63.6 million people.

### Mayor Chen Discusses Suppressing Price of Goods in Shanghai: Strict Punishment for Unauthorized Price Increases by Various Industries

(Central News Agency) Recently, commodity prices in this city have been gradually rising, affecting the lives of citizens. Yesterday, reporters called on the Mayor to inquire about the municipal government's measures regarding the price issue. He kindly issued the following statement:

"Regarding the issue of commodity prices in this city, the municipal government is constantly planning countermeasures. Recently, it has made every effort to unify the price evaluation agencies in this city and establish a Price Evaluation Committee, thinking of using a unified evaluation agency to conduct a reasonable review of commodity prices in this city in order to achieve the goal of suppressing and stabilizing the price of goods throughout the city. Regarding rising prices, in addition to issuing repeated orders to strictly prohibit them, it has also ordered the Price Evaluation Committee to quickly draft measures to curb them. However, the wartime commodity price issue is certainly not simple. To seek a thorough suppression, it is difficult to succeed without the cooperation of officials and the people. Any policy of the government must rely on the assistance of the people, which is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. I have repeatedly reminded the citizens of this point. In the New Year's Day message to the citizens this year, I made a loud appeal to promote the awareness of all sectors. However, those who speak earnestly are ignored by those who listen. Recently, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, various industries have once again taken this opportunity to privately raise prices, causing prices to rise a lot, especially for daily necessities. Such illegal actions that only know private interests and disregard public justice are truly hateful. It must be known that raising commodity prices not only stimulates people's hearts and affects society, but is simply an act of endangering people's livelihood and disrupting social order. Since I bear the important responsibility of Mayor, I will never sit idly by. In addition to the municipal government reiterating the previous orders and strictly prohibiting it, I have now ordered the Economic Bureau and the 18 District Offices to send personnel to investigate, and ordered the First and Second Police Bureaus to assist in handling the matter. Any famous businesses in this city that dare to raise prices without authorization instead of selling goods at the limited price will be severely punished without leniency once verified. I also hope that the various trade associations will notify all member firms to uphold the government's aim of stabilizing people's livelihood, restrain themselves, and never try the law by themselves. I especially hope that the citizens will provide assistance. If they encounter stores that raise prices without authorization, they can directly report it to the Economic Bureau and the 18 District Offices of this city in secret, so that it can be investigated and punished. In short, the municipal government has already made the greatest determination to suppress and stabilize prices, and its words will be followed by actions. I hope that all sectors will pay attention."

### Household Rice Ration Restored to Two Sheng

Effective from November, in three installments per month

(Central News Agency) Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising daily, with no end in sight. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the general public is eagerly hoping for a drop in the price of rice. Especially the poor, at this time when the price of rice is soaring, their lives are extremely painful. If adjustments are not made quickly, the future of people's livelihood in Shanghai is truly worrying. Yesterday, our reporter visited Mr. Yuan Ludeng at the Rice and Grain Control Committee to inquire about the recent activities of the committee.

Good Results in Areas A and B

According to Mr. Yuan, the committee attaches great importance to its mission and is making every effort to carry out the procurement work in areas A and B. Currently, the procurement situation in both areas is very good. According to the two statistics from the offices in various places regarding the first phase of procurement, as of the end of December, the number of orders placed has reached 35% of the total planned procurement, with 2 million shi in area A and 1.1 million shi in area B. With the assistance of various Allied agencies, the first batch of over 300,000 shi of rice (enough to meet the needs of all citizens of Shanghai for more than one month) has arrived in Shanghai and will be used for special rations during the Lunar New Year.

Transportation Problems Can Be Solved

It is also reported that the committee expects many difficulties in the future of procurement, but we are determined to make our best efforts to eliminate them. The most concerning issue at present is the transportation problem, but we firmly believe that with the assistance of the relevant agencies, it will be resolved satisfactorily soon. After repeated discussions, it has been decided by the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee that the household rice ration in this city will be restored to the previous Public Works Department ration (two sheng per person per month, distributed in three installments, with each installment giving two sheng) from January 11, 33rd year (1944). Once this is realized, the need for black market rice will naturally decrease. With supply and demand gradually moving towards equilibrium, the price of rice will naturally fall, and the future of people's livelihood in the city will gradually become stable.

Share the City's Difficulties and Cooperate

It is also said that the committee's mission is to ensure the main food supply for the people during wartime, and the responsibility it bears is very significant. If anyone intentionally obstructs the committee's legitimate business or sabotages the procurement work, whether inside or outside the committee, they will be severely punished according to law for disrupting the wartime economy. I am willing to exert my humble efforts and go all out. I hope that all citizens will understand the difficulties of the times and cooperate.

Saying: "Today, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you here, thanks to the friendship of Minister Hirota. We do not need to hold a meeting every three months, nor do we need a propaganda tool. Our leaders and our people know the goals of the struggle, so we would rather let them talk more and hold more meetings, while we bury ourselves in work. Regarding the current major political and military issues, the military achievements of Europe and East Asia, and future plans, our leaders have all spoken about them. Apart from these, I don't feel there is anything important enough to report to you. However, what I want to tell you is that we Germans and our Japanese friends have a strong belief in the righteousness of today's common war and the victory in the future."

### Coal Balls in Areas 1 and 8 Rescheduled for Distribution on the 12th; Two Installments per Month, Seven Jin per Installment

The coal ball rationing was originally scheduled to be implemented today, but due to the large total amount of this distribution and insufficient production, it has been decided to officially implement it on the 12th. The quantity has also been completely determined: 14 jin (7 kilograms) per person per month, distributed in two installments, with the first 7 jin to be purchased on the 12th with the first installment coal ball purchase certificate, and the second 7 jin to be sold around the 20th.

### Mr. Zhou Fohai Donates Salary to Aid Education, Enthusiastically Advocates for Response from All Sectors

Mr. Zhou Fohai Guang-sheng, yesterday donated ten thousand yuan from his salary to serve as the newspaper's education aid fund. In the previous education aid fund, Mr. Zhou also donated a substantial sum of two hundred thousand yuan from his salary, which shows his enthusiasm for attaching importance to and sympathizing with the education aid movement. Mr. Zhou, in his early years, also diligently studied hard, so he can deeply understand the hardship of poor students who are out of school. The "Gu Jin Ban Yue Kan" once published Mr. Zhou's "Bitter Study Record," which detailed the difficulties he faced when studying in Japan in his early years. His conclusion stated: "…There are countless young people who are as impoverished as I was at that time. Everyone should not be discouraged, disheartened, or hopeless. Heaven never cuts off all paths; a blade of grass is nourished by a drop of dew. As long as we are willing to work hard, we can break through a bloody path from heavy encirclement, no matter what the circumstances!" His spirit of courageous struggle is evident in his words. It is hoped that the students who receive the education aid fund today will deeply understand this spirit, and that all can take Mr. Zhou as a model to aspire to hard study, so as not to disappoint Mr. Zhou and the expectations of people from all walks of life.

Teachers and Students of Tongde College Aid Education

Mr. Gu Hanyi, a professor at Tongde Medical College in this city, voluntarily teaches pharmacology to the students of the college every week, earnestly guiding them. The students are grateful for his enthusiasm, and collectively raised two thousand two hundred yuan in national currency. They presented it to Professor Gu, but Professor Gu firmly declined to accept it, instructing that the money be donated to this newspaper's education aid fund. The original letter is excerpted below: "Gentlemen, you are in the prime of your youth, with a fiery passion that touches the heart. I originally intended to firmly decline, but considering that you would definitely change it to other methods, I have now come up with a way, that is, to donate this money in the name of the third grade of Tongde, to the education aid fund organized by Shen Bao, for the benefit of all the students and Hanyi, and to set an example, inspiring other schools to promote this kind of good deed." Professor Gu is enthusiastic about education, and has put in a lot of effort. This newspaper would like to express its gratitude to him on behalf of the poor students, and deeply hopes that the education community will follow suit and work together to achieve this great undertaking.

Application Forms to be Issued Starting Tomorrow

Economic Circle Comments

### Taking Matches, Candles, and Soap as Examples

Since the New Year, the prices of daily necessities in the wood market have continued to rise, and this occurred before the Lunar New Year, so the threat to the lives of ordinary people is self-evident. Taking matches, candles, and soap as examples, the severity of the price increase is astonishing. If it is like this for three kinds of daily necessities, then it is the same for hundreds and thousands of kinds of daily necessities. As the price increase trend continues, all prices inevitably "rise with the tide," only making the value of goods and the value of money run in opposite directions, drifting further and further apart. Because the value of goods is rising endlessly, the value of money is also falling endlessly. This is the beginning of the people's psychology of despising the value of money, which should not only be actively suppressed by the ruling authorities, but also be remedied by the financial authorities.

From the perspective of materials control, once the rationing of daily necessities is implemented, prices only increase and never decrease, becoming even more serious. This is the case for rice, coal, sugar, oil, matches, soap, and even cigarettes. The crux of the matter is that the rationing system cannot satisfy people or allow them to live at the bare minimum. Therefore, the supply of daily necessities can only rely on the black market. Since it is the black market, there is no standard to follow for prices. Today it increases by one time, tomorrow it can increase by ten times, who will interfere?

As a result, those who seek exorbitant profits engage in hoarding every day, and those who worry about price increases also engage in hoarding every day. The more they hoard, the more prices rise, and the more prices rise, the more they hoard, thus causing prices to rise endlessly. Therefore, to stop the price increase trend, in the short term, the focus should still be on cracking down on hoarding and eliminating the black market, otherwise materials rationing will always become a "pie in the sky." Now the ruling authorities have recognized this point, so the Materials Investigation Committee has already ordered the separate investigation of the latest Shanghai inventory and production of matches, candles, and soap, in order to prevent the concealment of false reports. We believe that this is the initial work to streamline all materials rationing, and it should be expanded and promoted as soon as possible.

### Money Industry Sets the 20th as the Final Closing Date

The final closing of various industries and businesses is usually based on the lunar calendar. It is heard that the Money Industry Association has decided that the final closing date for the thirty-second year will be January 24th, which is Lunar New Year's Eve, and the closing period will be from the 25th to the 28th. The market will reopen on the 29th (Saturday) for trading. Regarding the business that each bank should handle during the final closing period, such as the collection and settlement of bills, the market interest rate, the last day of trading, interest on deposits and debts, and the market situation, will be decided by the association at a meeting. Recently, all industries have been preparing for the final closing, such as adjusting funds and repaying overdrafts from various banks with and without contractual agreements. In addition, the silver and money industries are preparing their treasuries to regulate the finance of the same industry. In accordance with the borrowing methods and the limits set, they will make every effort to accommodate and handle the lending and borrowing of various banks. B Type Grain Depot Vouchers Issued

### Chinese Stocks Rise Then Fall, Match Stocks Alone Show Their Edge

Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned sluggish. Those who expected the market to rise were disappointed and began to sell off, resulting in small losses in many cases. However, some stocks still progressed upwards, such as Da Zhonghua Matches, which rose by more than one hundred yuan due to news of a capital increase and seven shares. In the textile industry, China Silk stood out, breaking through the 400 yuan mark and rising by another 30 yuan. Ren Salt soared to six yuan. Mei Ya, Wu He, and China Underwear continued to rise. Among the industrial stocks, Li Ya, which is related to the silk industry, rose by three and a half yuan alone. San Le Industrial was firm. The trend of selling off real estate stocks has begun, and it is inferior to department stores and stationery. New pharmaceutical stocks rose and fell inconsistently. Public utility stocks were the most stable, and the rest suffered small losses. The closing price list for today is recorded below.

### Brief News

Aspiration (1)

When the summer vacation arrived, the students enthusiastically began swimming and ice bathing at Tenpozan Kaien and Yojiro Beach.

Zhenren also went to the beach, but he could only lie on the sand, sulking and biting his lower lip. Although he didn't swim very well, breaststroke was not a problem for him, but because he didn't have his mother's permission, he couldn't go into the water. He could only take off his clothes and sunbathe his back from morning to relieve his worries.

"Gentlemen, during the holidays, you must all become blacks. I dislike white faces the most. When the new semester starts, there will be a black race, and gentlemen, don't lose in this race." This was the instruction given by Major Kikuchi in pure Kumamoto dialect during the last class. Zhenren's refusal to admit defeat further aroused his determination to sunbathe his back. The reason was that he knew very well that he was a "white face."

At first, Longfu also accompanied him to sunbathe his back. When the heat became too high, he would dive into the transparent blue waves. Only Zhenren alone endured the dizziness, sunbathing his back and chest, turning over like roasted meat.

(I didn't know before that Mr. Nakahara Yukie was such a great man!)

The emotion of the principal's speech revived in his chest. According to the principal, Hiraga Gennai and Sakuma Shozan used scientific theory to experiment with electricity, while Nakahara Yukie applied it to military affairs. Although Yukie used the primitive method of oil paper to isolate the tyrant's breath, he eventually created batteries made of zinc, copper plates, and dilute sulfuric acid, and successfully experimented with using this current to explode electric motors and groundmines. His research science also benefited people's livelihoods, such as manufacturing glass, with the thick glass used for warships' windows being the first. The use of carbonated acid for disinfection was also for wounded soldiers.

(Should I become a scientist too?…)

Smelling the burning hot sand, Zhenren fainted and envisioned his future. According to the grades written on the report card, his scores in mathematics and language were close to one hundred, so this hope was not unreasonable. Especially being the first in his class to discover the existence of that monument seemed to be destined to emulate Nakahara Tesshin.

In an instant, his hope was pushed into the deep valley of a thousand depths. His elder sister Chunzi had married, and the business in the store had been booming recently, but his family's financial situation could not easily guarantee his student life from high school to university.

(After graduating from middle school, will I become a bank clerk?…)

He stared at the shadow of the islet on the sea with bored and tearful eyes,
