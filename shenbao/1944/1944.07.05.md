### Editorial: Advance

On the battlefield, in times of decisive battles, there must be no hesitation, no lingering, only advance. A step backward is a dead end, a step forward is the path to survival. In times of war for a nation, the soldiers at the front must advance, and the people in the rear must advance even more; with unity between front and rear, the nation can then achieve final victory.

Everyone must first make a resolute decision to advance, and strive for progress at all times. Whether in thought or in action, one must have a broad vision and absolutely not be complacent or self-satisfied, thereby hindering the path of development and progress. Present comforts are not permanent comforts, and the present is only a transitional phase. Whether the transition is good or bad depends entirely on one's own efforts. One must not harbor a psychology of dependence. External forces can at most help people advance, but there is no way to assist those who do not advance themselves. The time of decisive battle has arrived, and the world's nations are nearing the finish line in their race. At this critical moment, one must be most careful. A moment of slackness will undo all previous efforts. An effort made now is worth ten times the effort made in the past, and a step forward now is worth ten times the steps taken in the past. As the saying goes, Heaven helps those who help themselves. One must first help oneself, and then one can receive Heaven's help. For those who do not strive to advance, there is no second path besides retreating and perishing.

Everyone must also have the courage to work hard with their heads down and never give up, and at all times fear no difficulties and bravely move forward. There is no such thing as success through luck in the world, and any success that is achieved by luck is certainly not permanent success; this is a common example in history. The Greater East Asia War is a natural trend of resistance from the people under a century of oppression by Britain and the United States. Therefore, the success of the Greater East Asia War is inevitable and a logical certainty. However, because of the historical circumstances of the past century, the enemy will certainly use the greatest force to maintain the interests they have plundered. The greater our resistance, the greater the enemy's oppression will increase. Now that we are in the final five minutes, the enemy will use even greater force in a last-ditch effort. This is decisive, and in an instant, it can determine the future of our liberation and freedom. Therefore, the greater the force of oppression, the more resolute our fighting spirit will be; the more difficult the environment, the more high-spirited our spirit will be. We must calmly cope and advance steadily. We are enduring some hardship and suffering now. Is there anything in the world more worthwhile than this?

Everyone must also have a spirit of sharing the same boat and enduring hardships together, and at all times be selfless and fight together for the common good. Now is not the time to seek personal gain, and now is not the time to seek individual enjoyment. Everyone must first prioritize the entire nation, and absolutely not be limited by personal interests. Everyone must first prioritize relieving the suffering of the nation, and absolutely not only seek personal pleasure. Everything is part of a whole, and the individual is only a part of the whole. The survival of the whole is the highest guarantee of the individual's survival. At the same time, difficulties must be conquered with the common strength of everyone, and the revival of the nation is the result of the efforts of all citizens, and cannot be borne by one or two individuals. Therefore, everyone has a common "public" goal, and everyone fights together toward this goal. This is the only way to overcome the current difficulties, and it is the responsibility that all citizens should bear during wartime.

Correction: In the editorial on July 1st, in the article "After the Adjustment of the Business Association," in the final paragraph, the first item under the sentence "As for the important issues at present" was slightly misaligned. The correction is as follows: "The work of purchasing cotton cloth should be completed as soon as possible. There are occasional complexities and confusions in the temporary rationing work, which should be remedied. For this purpose, the liquidation committee of the Cotton Industry Administration should be adjusted and strengthened immediately to take responsibility."

Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency report: According to a report on the 3rd by a member of the Japanese military warship reporting team: The Battle of the Mariana Sea was actually

### A Preemptive Strike

A decisive naval battle for the rise and fall of Japan. The first attack was launched by the Japanese naval air force on the morning of June 19th, initially establishing the achievement of destroying several enemy aircraft carriers. Later, they carried out attacks and night raids at dusk, and submarines also came out to operate actively, thus increasing the results of the battle. On a certain day in June, a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet, believing that the time had come, prepared to enthusiastically set out. It is reported that the strength of the enemy forces attacked this time included more than a dozen battleships, about ten formal aircraft carriers, more than a dozen specially made aircraft carriers, plus cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., totaling more than a hundred ships. It can be said that most of the naval force in the Pacific was poured out to launch a large-scale attack. From the 11th to the 18th, they used over a thousand carrier-based aircraft, which they boasted about, frequently bombing the Japanese air force bases in the Mariana Islands. On the other hand, the naval vessels on the sea were also approaching step by step, advancing to the vicinity of the Mariana Islands to carry out naval bombardment. On the 15th, they even landed on Saipan Island. This reckless advance aroused the Japanese military's

### Combined Fleet

A desire to annihilate the enemy. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet then gathered in a certain place to actively prepare for battle. On the afternoon of a certain day, the commander of the fleet sent out by the Japanese Combined Fleet gave a profound instruction to his subordinates, saying: "Our forces will go to destroy the enemy's arrogance. Please use all your strength to fight." All the personnel of the fleet sent out were very excited upon receiving this instruction, from the captain to the soldiers. On the 18th, they majestically advanced towards the waters where the enemy fleet was active. The 19th was the day of the decisive battle. The sky was still dark and not yet bright when the enemy planes jointly set out. A moment later, the red sun slowly rose, and the enemy planes discovered the enemy mobile units. First, they reported that the enemy mobile units were now in the sea west of the Mariana Islands, divided into about three groups: the first group consisted of four formal aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than a dozen other ships; the second group consisted of three formal aircraft carriers, five battleships, and more than a dozen other ships; the third group consisted of one formal aircraft carrier, one specially made aircraft carrier, one battleship, and about ten other ships. Subsequently, more and more reports came about the situation of the enemy's rear mobile units. The Japanese

fleet continued to advance under heavy guard. Looking into the distance, the enemy mobile units were engaging in a very large number of dogfights. It was very difficult for the Japanese carrier-based aircraft to break through this layer upon layer of aircraft formation and pounce directly on the enemy ships. At a certain time and minute, under the command of the Japanese air force team, they launched a full-scale, desperate attack and reported that they were engaging in aerial combat in the sky above the enemy fleet. Then, they sent out the good news that they had hit an enemy aircraft carrier. Amidst the frequent reports of victory, they destroyed three enemy aircraft carriers. The first preemptive strike reaped great achievements. Before long, the attack aircraft teams returned one after another, while reconnaissance ships were completed. However, some were unable to land on the mother ship due to bad weather and enemy fire and crashed into the sea. On the 20th, reconnaissance planes set out again at dawn to search for the enemy, and surface ships launched fierce attacks. In the afternoon, at a considerable distance, they discovered a fleet composed of two enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The attack team immediately began

A dusk attack. At this time, the enemy fleet also sent carrier-based aircraft to attack the Japanese army. After receiving the report from the reconnaissance plane, the entire Japanese fleet immediately completed its anti-aircraft combat preparations. Japanese lookouts frequently reported on the enemy's firing situation. After receiving orders, the anti-aircraft gunners immediately opened their gun positions to prepare to meet the enemy. As soon as the enemy planes made contact with the Japanese fleet, the Japanese fleet immediately opened fire fiercely. Anti-aircraft shells exploded in the sky, making it impossible for the enemy planes to maneuver. Enemy planes that were hit continuously somersaulted down from thousands of meters in the sky. The first and second planes were shot down one after another, spewing black smoke and falling vertically until night. The enemy planes that had been severely defeated were almost routed. They blindly dropped countless bombs into the sea and fled in disarray. In addition, a part of the Japanese army's direct assault fighting planes unexpectedly launched a counterattack against the enemy with a small number of troops. One enemy plane after another was continuously shot down. The enemy's attack ended in vain. This aerial battle was still far behind the enemy carrier-based aircraft's air raid attack techniques on warships that the reporter had experienced in a certain place last year.

In this battle, the Japanese fleet was unharmed, and immediately completed the assault situation, preparing for a night battle. In this battle that began at dusk, one of the enemy's large "制空式" aircraft carriers, the "卡尔" (likely referring to the USS Card), was sunk. At this time, the enemy concentrated its attack on two oil tankers of the Japanese army with weak firepower. Therefore, two Japanese ships were also set on fire by bombs. In this kind of large fleet battle, the Japanese fleet only lost one aircraft carrier.

### Air Raids on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, Over 30 Enemy Planes Shot Down, Seven Enemy Submarines Sunk in the Central Pacific

Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 4th: The Japanese army on Saipan Island continues to engage in fierce battles with the superior enemy in the areas of Garapan City, Mount Tapochau, and Donnay. The enemy mobile units raided Iwo Jima on July 3rd, and then raided Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima on the 4th. The Japanese army intercepted them frequently, and fierce battles are still ongoing. So far, it has been confirmed that more than 30 enemy planes have been shot down.

Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported on the 4th that escort vessels and air force units have been constantly monitoring the activities of enemy submarines in the Pacific waters for days. On July 2nd, they sank four enemy submarines in the Central Pacific, and sank two other submarines in other waters. On the 3rd, they sank another one in the Central Pacific. On the 2nd and 3rd, they sank a total of seven enemy submarines, reaping great results.

Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported that the Japanese fighter plane team engaged with a formation of large enemy planes that attacked Yap Island on the morning of the 3rd, shooting down two of them and destroying ten of them. One Japanese plane did not return.

### Japanese Troops in South China Advance Northward Along the Canton-Hankow Railway, Capturing Longmen and Qingyuan Yesterday

Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base on the South China front reported that the Japanese troops in South China are advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, suppressing the areas on both sides. As of the morning of the 4th, the situation of the Japanese troops' offensive is as follows: In the areas on both sides of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the Japanese troops have crossed the North River and crushed the counterattacks of Yu's (Chongqing's) 156th Division. A part of the Japanese troops broke into Qingyuan (a key point along the North River) on the evening of the 3rd, and are now echoing with other troops, continuing to advance northward. In the area east of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the Japanese troops advancing northward have approached Longmen (120 kilometers northeast of Guangzhou) and finally captured the area on the morning of the 3rd, continuing to advance northward and pursue the Yu army. In addition, the Japanese army encircled the Yu army in the mountainous area south of Conghua and is still continuing the battle.

Japanese Front Line, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese air force in South China began operations at the same time as the Japanese army in South China launched its offensive. Closely linked with the land troops' offensive, they controlled the airspace over the battlefield. When the land troops were crossing the North River, the Japanese air force used its fierce power to suppress the Yu army's positions and cover the river-crossing troops. The bomber squadrons repeatedly and urgently attacked the Yu army's positions near Tingtou Ridge in the east of Qingyuan, blowing up ground military facilities and inflicting heavy losses on the Yu army in the area. Afterwards, they attacked about fifty Yu army boats and about three hundred soldiers gathered on the North River tributary west of Qingyuan. Another team of Japanese planes attacked the Yu army barracks north of Qingyuan County, setting four of them on fire. Although the Japanese army's offensive was so fierce, the US air force in Yu remained on the sidelines. It was not until noon on the 2nd, after the Japanese army had crossed the North River, that the Yu-US air force raided with a dozen fighter-bombers, blindly dropping bombs near Juntian, thirty kilometers north, and fled immediately after the Japanese planes took off in pursuit. The bombing by Yu-US planes only killed innocent civilians.

The Seventh War Zone of Yu is Under Heavy Pressure. Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in South China has remained silent for a long time since the fall of Hong Kong. This time, to respond to the Japanese army's southward operation in Hunan, they suddenly began to advance northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway on June 27th, and the Seventh War Zone of Yu was under heavy pressure. The 12th Army Group under the command of Yu Hanmou, commander of the war zone, had previously formed a horseshoe-shaped encirclement of Guangzhou, and its defensive focus was placed in the south. This time, the Japanese army attacked Changsha, and the war zone's army was moving north, so it had to shrink its forces and send the two most elite armies to rescue Changsha. However, it was too late, and Changsha eventually fell into the hands of the Japanese army, so the Yu army's attempt also became a pie in the sky. It is also said that Yu Hanmou, under the pretext of defending Shaoguan, planned to have the main force of the 30th Army Group move north, causing the situation in Deqing (west of Guangzhou), where the army's headquarters was located, to be extremely dangerous. According to Yu, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha the year before last, it was predicted that the Japanese army in South China would definitely move north, so it was planned to move the Yu Guangdong Provincial Government from Shaoguan to Lian County (west of Shaoguan). This time, it seems that they had already started fleeing from Shaoguan. At a time when the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li Hanmou (Guangxi faction), and Yu Hanmou, who was only trying to preserve his personal power, were increasingly opposed to each other, it is noteworthy what attitude they will take towards this northward operation of the Japanese South China Army.

Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: Guilin, Guangxi Province, is extremely shaken and in extreme chaos due to the Japanese army's attack. According to a US reporter in Chongqing, the chaos in Guilin is described as follows: Guilin is now in a complex state of chaos. Communication organs such as telegraph, telephone, and even railroads are completely cut off. Therefore, Guilin's communication with the outside world is completely cut off. It is impossible to determine where the Japanese army is attacking from. Rumors are spreading everywhere, and it is impossible to control the situation. The roads are congested with people carrying luggage to escape.

Comprehensive Battle Results of the Japanese Army in Southern Hunan. A Certain Japanese Base, July 4th, Central News Agency: After occupying Changsha, the Japanese army in southern Hunan occupied Hengyang Airport on the 26th of last month and began a general offensive against Hengyang City, which is expected to fall soon. The comprehensive results of the Japanese army's campaign in southern Hunan from May 27th to June 20th are as follows: 35,400 Yu army corpses were recovered, 11,300 prisoners were captured, 229 machine guns, 625 machine guns, 5,400 rifles, 20,400 shells, and many other landmines and bullets were seized. In addition, 32 Yu-US planes were shot down, and 1,503 Japanese soldiers were killed in action.

Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency: A telegram from Chongqing stated that the Yu army authorities announced the war situation in Hunan on the night of the 3rd as follows: After repeatedly attacking the defensive positions of Hengyang under the cover of artillery fire, the Japanese army has broken through a certain position in one place. A certain division commander of the Yu army defending the city personally commanded two companies of soldiers to fight with hand grenades. It is expected that the Japanese army will attack again after reinforcements arrive. On the other hand, the Japanese army advancing southward in the direction of Anren has turned towards Qinyang and has advanced to the area sixteen kilometers south of Qinyang, forcibly crossing the river, and has cut off the Canton-Hankow Railway through a westward flanking action. The battle in that area has unfolded thirteen to twenty kilometers south of Leiyang. In addition, the right wing of the Japanese army advanced south from Xiangxiang in two groups on the 1st, attacking Yongfeng, northwest of Hengyang. That night, they made contact with the Yu army twenty-six kilometers northeast of Yongfeng and engaged in fierce fighting.

The Yu-US Air Force is in Extreme Distress. Japanese Front Line, July 4th, Central News Agency: After the fall of Hengyang Airport, the most important forward base of the Yu-US Air Force in Central China, the pressure from the Japanese army in that area, corresponding to the rapid advance of the Japanese army in South China, has now trapped the area between Hengyang and Guangzhou and the areas east of it within the Japanese army's encirclement. It is said that the dozen or so Yu-US air force bases, large and small, scattered in Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong have now fallen into a suffocating predicament. It is reported that the Yu army has begun to destroy the airports in Hunan Province, such as Shiqing and Lingling, from which it can be seen how deep the Yu-US air force's unrest and anxiety are. Now, many bases built by the Yu-US air force in key points such as Guilin and Liuzhou in southwestern China have also entered the control of the Japanese air force's power, and the Wuzhou Airport along the West River cannot be used due to flooding. Therefore, the poverty of the Yu-US air force has reached its limit. Now that the advanced bases have been lost, they can only retreat to the depths of the interior.

Central News Agency report: The offensive launched by the Japanese army in various places this time has dealt a strong blow to Yu, and Yu's chaotic situation has been fully exposed in foreign news and telegrams. Yu is therefore anticipating that the Japanese army will dispatch landing troops as the war progresses, and is now vigorously seeking countermeasures. Chongqing, Central News Agency report: The Yu Aviation Commission recently issued a notice in conjunction with the Ministry of Military Administration, ordering various places to order the people that if they find Japanese landing troops landing, they should immediately shoot them. At the same time, Yu also issued a ban, warning the people and instructing them on how to distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft, to prevent accidental killing of friendly troops. Therefore, during air battles, if a parachute is captured and it has not yet been determined whether it is an enemy or friendly soldier, it is absolutely not allowed to kill him arbitrarily. He must be handed over to the military and political organs. If he resists with weapons, he must be captured alive as far as possible and not be killed. However, many people believe that the fundamental reason for Yu's adoption of this measure is actually because in the past, when Yu-US air force personnel were shot down by Japanese planes or landed due to mechanical damage, their property, clothes, or guns were often looted or killed by the local people. The authorities are deeply anxious about this, so they have issued the above report, and the discord between the US air force and the people of Yu can also be seen from this.

### German Troops in Minsk Retreat to New Defense Line, Popozik Falls into Soviet Hands

Berlin, July 4th, Central News Agency: The large-scale defense battle in the central sector of the front is particularly fierce. After cutting off the railway traffic from the southwest and northwest to Minsk, the Soviet army attacked and occupied the city with tank troops. In advance, the German garrison had retreated to a new defensive line outside the city, so there was no major battle. The Soviet army launched a fierce attack on the retreating German troops, but was repelled. The German army east of Minsk resisted the Soviet army and thwarted their encirclement attempt. When the German army in that area was turning westward to fight, the Soviet army suffered heavy casualties. The German army launched a counterattack and overcame Stolpce (southwest of Minsk). The Soviet army had cut off the railway from Baranovichi to Minsk near that area. There were particularly fierce battles west of Polotsk (adjacent to the northeastern corner of the old border) and within the city. The German army has withdrawn from the city to a prepared position at a certain salient point.

Berlin, July 4th, Central News Agency: The German authorities announced at noon on the 3rd that the focus of the Eastern Front is now in the Minsk area. The German army is now withdrawing from the Oshivyeki crossing, steaming the Sina River, towards the Minsk area, concentrating its forces to intercept the Soviet army. The front line extends for 400 kilometers and is about 200 kilometers wide, with the positions jagged and intertwined, entering a state of mixed war.

### Indian Independence Movement, Plans and Guidelines, Chairman Bose Clearly Elaborates

Rangoon, July 4th, Central News Agency: July 4th is the first anniversary of Mr. Bose's inauguration as the President of the Indian Independence League and Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army. It has been decided to designate from this day to the 10th as "Bose's Inauguration Celebration Memorial Week". During this week, all Indian households will hoist the Indian tricolor flag, and each branch will hold demonstrations and mass rallies. On this day, Bose issued a statement elaborating on the future plans and guidelines of the Indian independence movement, which are recorded as follows: The Indian National Army has crossed the Indian border to fight a holy war in various places to win freedom. Now, due to the progress of the new situation, new problems have arisen, namely, how to carry out administration and reconstruction in the various parts of India that have been liberated. In addition, there is the question of how to carry out military operations in India and how to complete the great cause of revolution. There are three areas of activity for us in the future: East Asia, which is still the base of our political and military activities; the liberated areas, where the current issues are administration and reconstruction, and preparing for future revolutionary struggles; and the Indian areas occupied by the British enemy, which are also revolutionary areas that must be completed. Since the scope of activities of the Provisional Government of India includes the above three places, the Provisional Government must, in terms of responsibility, assign key personnel and advisers of the government in the above three areas: the first group to pay attention to various activities in East Asia, the second group to be assigned to the liberated areas, and the third group to be assigned to the British enemy-occupied areas to engage in revolutionary work. The first group in East Asia is called the "East Asia Cabinet Committee", the second group in the liberated areas is called the "Cabinet Liberated Areas Committee", and the third group is called the "Cabinet Wartime Committee". However, in order to strengthen the overall mobilization of manpower, materials, and financial resources in East Asia, it is necessary to establish new administrative organs or expand existing organizations to implement new policies. The East Asia Committee is the guiding institution responsible for East Asia activities, formed by key personnel and advisors active in East Asia. The liberated areas have prepared for the implementation of administrative and reconstruction plans, which can be implemented at an appropriate time, and important personnel have been dispatched properly. They have now arrived in India and the border areas. The Liberated Areas Committee is composed of specially selected key personnel and advisers who meet the needs, as well as existing key personnel and advisors. The main task of the final Wartime Committee is related to military fortresses and propaganda in the areas occupied by the British enemy, and is composed of key personnel and advisors reviewed by those who specialize in revolutionary movements and administrators. The Provisional Government of India, in order to make the three committees closely connected, will concentrate future activities in the center, so as to achieve the greatest results and achieve the supreme goal of Indian independence.

Minister Lin Announces a Long Talk on the Meaning of Indian Independence. Nanjing, July 4th, Central News Agency: July 4th is the anniversary of the founding of the Indian Independence League. Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda met with Chinese and foreign journalists in the capital at 3:30 p.m. to explain the significance of the Indian independence movement and the East Asian war situation, pointing out that the defeat of Britain and the United States could not be saved. He also introduced Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency, and Zhang Ke, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Propaganda, to meet with the entire group, and the two men expressed their aspirations, and the situation was very enthusiastic.

### American Troops on Italian West Coast Reach Cecina

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency, German News Agency): According to the German News Agency, on the 3rd, the German army withdrew from Siena, sparing the Italian cultural center from the ravages of war. After the defending forces retreated to favorable positions north of the town, they repeatedly repelled fierce attacks by the Tegor troops. Currently, the focus of the Italian war is on the Volterra area (northwest of Siena) along the Tyrrhenian coast and southwest and southeast of Siena. As for the American troops along the coastal area, they have advanced to Cecina and several locations a few kilometers north of the town. Fierce fighting west of Lake Trasimeno continued late into the night. German divisions operating in the area repelled a strong enemy tank attack during the day and retreated to the surrounding highlands north of the lake in the evening. On the Adriatic coast, Polish divisions, under the cover of British tanks, continued to launch strong attacks at several key points. The German army had to retreat to the main front line. In the evening, the Polish army attempted to break into the German defenses, and fierce fighting resumed in the area. The enemy was finally repelled. German outposts retreated several kilometers.

### American Troops in Cotentin Launch New Offensive: German Outposts Retreat Several Kilometers

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency, German News Agency): According to various sources: On Monday, the British Second Army was relatively quiet on the European front, but in the afternoon, the American army intensified its offensive between the Carentan area and the west coast of Normandy. Several German outposts retreated several kilometers to allow for better German resistance. American casualties were extremely heavy.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): According to front-line reports: At about 5 a.m. on the 3rd, American troops on the Cotentin Peninsula launched an offensive from the area west of the coast from Barneville-sur-Mer southwest of Cherbourg to the area west of Carentan, a distance of about forty miles. After being intercepted by the German army, fierce fighting is now underway. It is reported that the American army plans to use Saint-Sauveur and the area south of La Vicomté as the center of the attack and attempt to advance south towards La Haye-du-Puits.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): Combined front-line reports: A fierce attack planned by the British army to destroy the most elite armored units under General Rommel has been completely thwarted. The British army, realizing the extent of the damage, temporarily abandoned this idea, and the situation on that front has become deadlocked. However, Montgomery is actively reinforcing troops and supplies, so the situation will soon become active again. At the same time, the German army is also preparing for the next operation. Reuters reported that General Rommel is currently reorganizing eleven divisions in the Tilly-sur-Seulles area to strengthen the defensive posture.

### Air Defense Training in This City Fails to Achieve Expected Results: Japanese Military Air Defense Headquarters Issues Statement

In view of the revision of the air defense traffic regulations in this city, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Air Defense Headquarters authorities, in order to understand whether the general public thoroughly abide by these regulations and to check whether the lighting control facilities are in good condition, suddenly conducted air defense training on the night of the 3rd. After on-site investigation, the expected good results were still not achieved. Even the Baojia (neighborhood watch) and self-defense members failed to correctly understand the above regulations, and there were many shortcomings in lighting control and sound control. The Naval Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued a statement on the 4th, hoping that the general public will improve in the future. The contents of the statement are recorded as follows:

### Shelter and Evacuation Training

The purpose of this air defense training is to review whether the general public can thoroughly implement the various points stipulated in Announcement No. 24 of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued on June 20, point out various shortcomings, and provide for future improvements. This training focuses on shelter and evacuation training, sound and traffic control, and various lighting controls. After reviewing the implementation in various districts, there are many points where the training is not proficient: In the two major parts of shelter and evacuation training, the public, not to mention the traffic police, also failed to fully understand the meaning of Announcement No. 24, which is considered extremely regrettable. According to the instructions of the Air Defense Headquarters for the guidance teams, there is no major fault, but in terms of the results of the shelter training, it is still not satisfactory.

### Sound and Traffic Control

Sound and traffic control: Sound and traffic must be stopped within five minutes after the issuance of the alarm, but most people do not understand this point, and many Baojia self-defense members are also unaware of it. For example, the majority of people run across the road when the guidance team or the police are not paying attention. In addition, even if the self-defense groups hear the alarm, they still do not stop traffic, or block traffic for 20 minutes, which is too long and should be avoided in the future. The situation is generally good for traffic passing five minutes after sheltering, and the sound of people is extremely quiet, but regarding sound control, it is inappropriate to still use loud speakers during the alarm. It is hoped that a sound control device will be added to the sound generators to avoid loud noises. Various lighting controls have gradually improved since the implementation of control, which is due to the efforts of various agencies. However, a considerable number of houses with poor lighting control still exist, especially houses that leak light when viewed from above. Generally, areas where Baojia and self-defense groups are active are mostly good, but on the contrary, they are indifferent and the results are extremely poor. In addition, a large number of vehicles have not completed the lighting control device and should make extra efforts in the future.

### Matters Needing Attention

Matters needing attention are as follows: (A) Lights that have not been equipped with a control device should be turned off immediately after the alarm is issued. (B) Even if lights are not used, if there is a risk of being accidentally turned on, a complete light-shielding device should be installed. (C) Vehicles should always carry control devices. (D) Skylights should be equipped with a complete control device. (E) All guidance agencies should thoroughly pay attention to the above points, and Baojia self-defense members should also supervise each other so that there are no poorly controlled houses within each Bao and Jia. In summary, although there are still many insufficient points, the general situation is still good. This training was completely unexpected, so most people did not know whether it was real lighting control or training lighting control. In the future, preparations should be made at all times and should not be neglected. Do not assume that it is training and simply perfunctorily do things in a formalistic manner. The Air Defense Training Day on the 9th of this month is approaching, and it is hoped that all citizens will thoroughly understand the purpose of the announcement in order to achieve exceptionally good results.

### Three Coolie Laborers Fall into the Huangpu River

A tragic incident occurred at the Yangshi Wharf in Pudong at about 7 a.m. on the 1st, in which three passengers on a sampan fell into the Huangpu River and drowned. The details are as follows: Mao Yongshun, a coolie laborer, 20 years old, from Ningbo, Xu Yueqing, 33 years old, and Xi Liangnian, 27 years old, each carrying fifty or sixty catties of lead, arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the Zisheng steamer, attempting to sell them for profit. After the steamer arrived at the Yangshi Wharf in Pudong at 7 a.m. on the 1st and stopped, Mao and the other two were lowered from the steamer onto a sampan to go ashore. Unexpectedly, Xu Jianye, nicknamed Xu Erxiazi, the so-called "insurance head" (i.e., sampan boss), discovered that Mao and the others were heavily loaded and knew that they were carrying goods, so when Mao was about to go ashore, he ordered him not to go ashore. Mao Yongshun was suddenly startled, panicked, and fell into the Huangpu River. Xu and Xi immediately tried to rescue him, but because their bodies were heavy, not only did they not save him, but they all fell into the river one after another. Mao had already disappeared. Xu and Xi, seeing the opportunity, immediately untied the lead so they could float up. They climbed onto another sampan parked next to the dock. At this critical moment, the sampan rower demanded 30,000 yuan for saving their lives. At the same time, Xu Jianye ordered them not to rescue, so the sampans were forced by Xu's power and dared not rescue them. Xu and Xi drowned one after another. After the port police learned of the incident, they salvaged the bodies and notified their families to come to Shanghai to collect them, and ordered the arrest of the suspect Xu.
