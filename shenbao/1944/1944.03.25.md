### Unification of Schools and Factories

On January 31 of this year, the Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee held a meeting to discuss the direction of schools, deciding on the facilities of industrial schools, striving to make full use of existing equipment, or utilizing the equipment of nearby industrial schools. On the 16th of this month, the Industrial Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan decided to move to factories for teaching. In mid-April, more than 40 students from the Department of Electrical Engineering of the university, under the guidance of Professor Nobuyoshi Kato, will stay in a certain factory of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, engage in the practice of weapons production during the day, and attend lectures by various professors at night. (See the 17th edition of this newspaper). This kind of student life that merges schools and factories into one, and the spirit of combining teaching, learning, and doing into one, and the new atmosphere of the Japanese authorities who "must decide on what is discussed, must act on what is decided, and must act quickly on what is implemented," is truly worthy of our admiration.

Increased production is needed in wartime, and the meaning of increased production is increased manpower and increased material resources. The increase of manpower is more important than the increase of material resources, and the increase of technical personnel is even more important than other talents. Only with manpower can we fully utilize existing material resources, supplement insufficient material resources, and create new material resources; and those who can come up with ideas and guide the work are technical personnel. The responsibility of technical personnel in the rear is no less than that of the soldiers on the front line. If the production in the rear cannot meet the quantity consumed on the front line, the war will inevitably decline and be exhausted. The importance of technical personnel is such that making full use of existing technical personnel and striving to cultivate future technical personnel is something that the government authorities should always pay attention to, especially in wartime, when no step can be relaxed and no moment can be wasted.

Our allied nation Japan has already solved this problem, and the solution is the unification of factories and schools. Existing technical personnel, whether factory technicians or school professors, bear two responsibilities: on the one hand, striving to increase national production, and on the other hand, striving to cultivate the next generation of talents. At the same time, students also bear two responsibilities: on the one hand, striving to study hard to become a technical talent in the future, and on the other hand, striving to work hard to increase national production now. Regardless of the effort in any aspect, whether it is teaching, learning, or doing, everything is centered on the war. This is the wartime system, this is the fighting spirit.

China's industry was originally backward, the number of factories is not large, and technical personnel are even more lacking. Therefore, a plan to make full use of these few manpower and material resources to seek future development is even more necessary and urgent. We have previously proposed the method of "on-the-job training," and also proposed the idea of using enemy-owned factories that have been returned to government management to cultivate talents. We now hope that entrepreneurs across the country, following the Japanese method, will voluntarily request the cooperation of university professors and students, formulate plans according to the nature of their own businesses, and assist in the advancement of technical talents in certain departments or parts. This is a beneficial work for the country, for themselves, for the present, and for the future. At the same time, the government should always strive to help the progress of enterprises, provide conveniences for enterprises, and reward the talents cultivated in this way.

### The Imperial Headquarters Officially Announced that the Japanese Army Has Entered India and is Fiercely Attacking Delhi with the Force of a Raging Tide

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 9:00 PM last night: Our army, currently fighting near the central Indo-Burmese border, is continuing its annihilation battle against the British-Indian 17th Division in the vicinity of Tonzang, and is supporting the advance of the Indian National Army. In mid-March, it broke through the Indo-Burmese border and has now entered India. Since March 5th, the enemy has invaded parts of northern Burma with airborne troops. Our army has been chasing and suppressing them everywhere and has annihilated some of them.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which is fighting near the central Burmese-Indian border, has further emphasized the annihilation battle against the British-Indian 17th Division around Tonzang and Tiddim, and has also supported the activities of the Indian National Army. Since mid-March, it has repeatedly broken through the Indian border line and is now continuing its valiant attack on Delhi with the force of a raging tide. On March 8th, the Japanese and Indian armies launched a preemptive attack in the central border area of the Kaderwan Valley and the Chin Hills area. They encircled a superior enemy force, mainly the British-Indian 17th Division, in Tonzang, Tiddim, and the Nyukte Mountain area to the north, resulting in an annihilation battle. Around March 15th, after putting the enemy in a desperate situation, they forced them to retreat to the border. The powerful Japanese troops and the elite troops of the Indian National Army near Mindat, northeast of the Chin Hills, responded together, destroying the British-Indian 23rd Division deployed in the area, and broke through the Indian border from the north and south of Dami. On the 17th, they had penetrated deep into Indian territory, destroying the enemy strongholds of Kongkang and Khampat on the western slope of the Patkai Mountains. The current situation on the Burmese border has changed from the traditional Burmese defense operation to an Indian offensive operation. The incomparably strong Japanese and Indian armies are fiercely attacking the core of the enemy's East Indian defense force.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain place on the Indo-Burmese border, the Japanese and Indian troops are still continuing their attack in the Kabaw Mountain area, threatening the enemy's 20th and 23rd Divisions and part of the 17th Division, and fiercely attacking the enemy's important southern stronghold of Wittku. The enemy army carried out counterattacks with tanks and planes, but the Japanese army repeatedly attacked them and finally captured the area on the 19th, and immediately headed north, fiercely pursuing the defeated enemy. At the same time, the dare-to-die squads of the Japanese and Indian armies, in order to cut off the enemy's retreat route in a certain area, advanced towards Indian territory and blew up a certain bridge on the night of the 19th, completely cutting off the retreat route of the enemy's 20th and 23rd Divisions. The enemy division in the Kabaw area also lost its retreat route as a result. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from the south, and the enemy army in that area is now in danger of being annihilated.

### Announcement by the Japanese Military Authorities: The Encirclement is Narrowed, and British Paratroopers are Annihilated Near Gaza

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, the Japanese army authorities announced on the 23rd that the Japanese army has launched a large-scale operation. The main points are as follows: Regarding Burma, the enemy's YU (Chongqing), British, and American forces are clamoring to retake Burma, eyeing it covetously, and have begun to move restlessly in the vicinity of the Indo-Burmese border. Therefore, since last autumn, we have strengthened our combat power and carried out preemptive attacks in all aspects. First, we annihilated the YU 36th Division in the Nujiang area, crushing its counterattack attempt. Also, since the end of October last year, the YU, British, and American forces have attempted to advance to the Dangong area. Our army severely damaged the enemy with clever operations. In February of this year, we inflicted great damage on the main force of the enemy's 15th Army Corps in the Arakan area. Then, in March, we chased and suppressed the main force of the enemy's 4th Army Corps in the Chin Hills area. In this way, we completely crushed the enemy's counterattack attempt and were able to ensure the stability of Burma, achieving the initial defense purpose within the scope of preventing the war from expanding further. However, the enemy army not only continues to send troops to various places to continue stubborn counterattacks, but also since March 5th, has dropped parachute troops near Gaza in a part of northern Burma, threatening the rear of our army, and again causing the area that has restored peace to fall into war, and carrying out various atrocities to bully innocent civilians. The Japanese army in Burma, in view of the above situation, decided to thoroughly destroy the enemy's counterattack base in eastern India. The Indian National Army has crossed the Indo-Burmese border after our army launched the annihilation battle in central Arakan Chin Hills, so our army is supporting the National Army in these advances. At the same time, we are also thoroughly supporting the independence and liberation battle of the Provisional Government of Free India. The purpose of our army's offensive operation is to destroy the enemy who intends to counterattack in East India and to defeat the British, American, and YU armies. We do not consider India and the Indian people as enemies. Japan has no territorial ambitions. Every inch of land occupied by our army is prepared to be returned to Free India. At present, the enemy in the Tonzang area has been annihilated, and we are continuing to rapidly advance against the enemy vanguard in various areas near Lium, Kabaw Creek. We have broken through the Burmese-Indian border. Also, the attack from Haka towards the key point of the Bay of Bengal is progressing according to the planned steps. Therefore, the enemy troops who landed near Gaza have been annihilated by several hundred as of today, and our encirclement is being narrowed at every moment. In short, our army's attack on India has not been hindered in any way, and the forces on the southwest coast are becoming more substantial, and a strong battle formation has been completed.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, the Japanese army bomber squadron in Burma departed from a certain base on the morning of the 16th and enthusiastically attacked the enemy's important strongholds on the central Burmese-Indian border and the enemy's airfield north of Imphal, using heavy bombs to fiercely bomb the runway and airfield facilities. Three locations were hit and caught fire, and a large fire occurred in one location. Another unit fiercely bombed a convoy of enemy vehicles speeding on the highway between Imphal and Palel, causing the enemy to be terrified. Also, several large formations of Japanese aircraft attacked the airfields of Imphal, Palel, and Itmiyu in a large-scale attack on the morning of the 17th, setting fire to three Douglas B-C3 aircraft and one small aircraft on the ground. At the same time, they engaged in fierce air combat with a dozen or so enemy P40 and Spitfire aircraft, shooting down five Spitfire aircraft, and inflicting annihilating damage on the enemy's Ang army in the area. One Japanese aircraft each was bombed and did not return, and one aircraft was damaged.

### Japanese Troops in Bougainville Continue Fierce Attacks; Enemy Aircraft Thwarted in Raids on Rabaul

### The Foundation for the Independence and Liberation of India has Been Laid; The Provisional Government Issued a Special Statement

Shonan, 24th (Central News Agency) – After Prime Minister Tojo clarified Japan's determination to fully support India's independence, the spokesman of the Provisional Government of Free India issued a special statement on the 23rd as follows: Prime Minister Tojo's speech is of profound significance in the current situation. When the Free Indian National Army and the Japanese army cooperated closely and began to attack their motherland India, Prime Minister Tojo clearly stated that Japan had no territorial or political ambitions for India. After the Japanese army defeated the enemy's forces, it would completely hand over India to the Indians. This statement has not only shattered Britain's anti-Japanese propaganda within India, but also made the people of India deeply aware of the agreement that the territory of India acquired by the National Army will be immediately placed under the administration of the Free Provisional Government. Therefore, the anti-British struggle is becoming more active, and it is believed that the Indian army in the country will automatically take a cooperative attitude. We are well aware that after Britain and the United States invaded Italy under the guise of liberating the country, they immediately promulgated military administration by their own troops, causing the Italian people to complain. Japan, on the other hand, adheres to the moral attitude of repaying love with love and friendship with friendship, so it is completely different from Britain and the United States. Japan's noble spirit will soon be fully rewarded by the Indian people. The statements of Prime Minister Tojo and Chairman Bose can further intensify the anti-British consciousness of the people in India. The union of the two peoples will become more and more consolidated, and it is believed that the foundation for independence and liberation has been laid firmly and will be realized soon.

Shonan, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 25,000 Indians residing in Shonan were extremely excited to learn that the Indian National Army had entered the territory of the Manipur princely state. On the evening of the 23rd, a mass rally was held, gathering about 6,000 Indians, who listened quietly to the report and speech by Minister Alagappan of the Department of Non-Intervention of the Provisional Government. Then, Lieutenant Colonel Nagar, on behalf of the masses, expressed his gratitude to the Japanese Tojo. Finally, the meeting was adjourned after chanting Chairman Bose's declaration of independence.

### Report on the Exploration Work of the Japanese-Manchukuo Resource Survey Team in Mengjiang: New Discovery on the Formation of Salt Lakes

Xinjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – After Manchuria organized a resource survey team composed of authorities in the Manchu scientific community last year, it carried out large-scale exploration work in Mengjiang Dabus and other places. The team held a research report meeting at the Continental Science Institute of Manchuria on the 19th of this month, during which Mr. Shigemitsu Okada of the Geological Research Institute and Mr. Jun Yamane of the Continental Science Institute respectively reported on the exploration results. Mr. Okada's report was entitled "On the Genesis of Salt Lakes," and Mr. Yamane's report was entitled "The Composition of the Water of Lake Dabus." According to reports, the captain of the resource survey team was Dr. Shinoo Itano, an agricultural scholar from the Continental Science Institute, and the team members were scientists dispatched by Manchukuo and the Japan Science Mobilization Association. They arrived at the site on May 29th last summer, and after detailed investigation for more than three months, they determined the essence of the lake water. In addition, other important resources were also discovered. Only trial excavation has been carried out on underground resources, and there is already full confidence in the future. Also, Mr. Okada's "On the Genesis of Salt Lakes" determined that Lake Dabus is a chlorine-only salt lake. Two hundred million years ago, the area was a large marsh. Later, due to crustal movement, mountains were formed. After the seawater flowing to the lowlands dried up, it evaporated into salt. Mr. Okada also collected fossils of fish and shellfish as proof. Regarding the composition of the water of Lake Dabus, Mr. Yamane has reported on the analysis of a part of the water quality and confirmed that the lake contains rare elements and other important resources. Dr. Itano, an agricultural scholar, said that Lake Dabus in Mengjiang is a large salt lake in Mengjiang, and its salt content is the highest in the world. The surface of the lake seems to be covered with a thick layer of salt water about one meter thick, and the entire lake surface is a crystal of salt. The density of the salt is also very high.

### Half a Year of Philippine Independence; The Belief in Cooperation is Stronger than Ever; Ambassador Murata's Remarks to Japanese Journalists

Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Murata met with a group of Japanese journalists yesterday and made a statement on the recent situation of the Philippines' active cooperation with Japan since the birth of the Philippine government half a year ago, saying that since the independence of the Philippines, half a year has passed in an instant. The key figures of the Philippine Republic government and Japan have become more firm in their belief in a common destiny. In accordance with the spirit of the Japan-Philippine Alliance Treaty, they have strengthened the Philippines' combat strength, material resources, and defense posture, which is truly commendable. President Laurel said, "Without Japan's victory, the Philippines cannot be completely independent." This belief is not only clearly recognized within the Philippine government, but also generally affirmed by the Filipino people. Therefore, the Filipino people's cooperation with Japan is now more solid. The Filipino people previously relied on the economic power of the United States to live a comfortable life, but now they seem to be experiencing various economic hardships under wartime. However, the Filipino people have cultivated a spirit of self-reliance, enduring hardships and actively solving this problem. For example, in the current food problem in the Philippines, the Filipino people have also abandoned their bystander attitude and have moved forward to cooperate with the policies adopted by the government, automatically reclaiming vacant land, and recently all of it has been transformed into useful land. From this, it can be seen that the food problem in the Philippines will not be too difficult. The food problem in the Philippines is ultimately a problem of the city. If the people can actively increase production and facilitate transportation, it can be easily solved given the fertility of the Philippine land. Recently, Japanese residents in the Philippines have organized a Japanese association to respond to Japan's domestic emergency measures and have begun to provide labor services to the country. In short, the future of the Philippine government still faces many difficulties, and there are many issues that need to be improved in the future. However, the Philippine government has only been established for half a year, and it is impossible to expect perfection. We are fully assisting the Philippine government to make the Philippines a completely independent country.

### The Ministry of the Navy Schedules to Celebrate Navy Day; Ceremonies Held in Nanjing, Hankou, and Other Places

### Conflict Between Kong and Song in Chongqing

(2) Regarding the Xuzhou-Hai'an Canal section, it will be carefully inspected and then repaired to facilitate the smooth transportation of coal and salt from the Xuzhou and Hai'an areas. (3) The current situation of the South Grand Canal is still acceptable, but it can only accommodate ships with light tonnage, so it will be gradually renovated. Mr. Yin earnestly stated that he deeply hopes that local officials and people will work together to complete the mission, so that future north-south transportation will not rely solely on land routes. This will also facilitate the exchange of goods, stabilize people's livelihoods, and further enhance wartime people's livelihood and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War.

### Atlantic Charter Has Become a Mere Document; British Parliamentarians Express Strong Criticism

Central News Agency telegram from Stockholm, 24th: According to a London dispatch: During a meeting of the British House of Commons on the 22nd, members of parliament raised numerous questions regarding British foreign policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden asked Churchill whether the British government could follow the example of the Soviet government and recognize the Batet regime. Churchill replied that the British government did not intend to change its relationship with the Batet regime. Member of Parliament Lipson then questioned whether the principles of the Atlantic Charter applied to any territory, as there was considerable doubt. He asked the Prime Minister to clarify. Churchill replied that the current war situation is constantly changing, and the documents regarding the so-called Atlantic Charter need to be re-stated. Therefore, the major Axis powers should approach the Atlantic Charter with caution. He further stated that the Atlantic Charter clarified the spirit and purpose of the Allied nations in prosecuting the war. It was not a treaty concluded by the Allied nations because of the Charter, nor was it intended to initiate negotiations between the Allied nations and the enemy.

Clearing the Last Obstacles to a Period of Glorious Peace Goebbels Explains War Objectives

Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article entitled "The Last Obstacles" in the latest issue of the German magazine, stating: "The anti-Axis countries are all fighting according to their respective goals, and the contradictions between their goals and those of their partners are sometimes even greater than those with the Axis countries. If we look back to the beginning of the war, the question of what caused the enemy camp to become enraged and fall apart has now disappeared without a trace, which is truly astonishing. Regarding the notion that the concept of war may undergo fundamental changes between now and the end of the war, can we reject this? In other words, are things currently placed in the crucible to remain unchanged until the arrival of peace? In fact, the ultimate secret of this war may only be revealed after the cessation of hostilities, and the current war remains the most astonishing event. Therefore, attempting to predict the course of the war in the future is irrelevant, as there are decisive factors beyond human influence. However, on the one hand, we must act according to a predetermined plan, and on the other hand, we must make the methods of realizing this plan as flexible as possible. The enemy is trying hard to prove that their war aims are solely motivated by moral considerations, but in reality, such attempts are merely window dressing. Changes in the internal influences of the anti-Axis camp will inevitably lead to changes in their war aims. Fortunately, the war aims of the Axis countries have remained true to their original purpose from the start of the war, which is to fight for the survival of their people, 'to exist as a nation.' At the same time, the political crisis in the enemy camp remains paramount, and there is no way to stop it. London is terrified that workers are demanding strikes without the consent of trade union leaders, but these British workers are merely putting into practice the theoretical lessons their government has taught them. We do not understand why the British government, which has unlimited cooperation with the Kremlin, is surprised that workers are acting according to Bolshevik principles. However, this kind of development has gone beyond a certain degree and become completely uncontrolled and arbitrary. We have read the statements of British soldiers captured by the German army, which are extremely pessimistic, saying that the British people do not understand the meaning of the war, nor do they know the purpose of peace, and that British soldiers and officers hope that sooner or later they can join forces with the German army to fight against Bolshevism. British soldiers who hold this war aim are therefore unwilling to advance wholeheartedly under the German machine gun fire at Cassino. Are the British still surprised that the German army in Italy is fighting so bravely? This is because the British did not foresee such a possibility, and British workers also know that they have no hope of improving their living standards. However, the Germans are fighting for new ideas with centuries of traditional habits, and the Germans are all aware of the dangers of this war, so they have achieved great results. Even though the Germans are worried in the fifth year of the war, this is merely an expression of their inner prudence and a model of heroism unparalleled in the world. The time will eventually come when we clear the last obstacles to reach the final decision. After this final leap, the savior of the Germans is on the other side, because there is a bright world of peace there. This kind of peace is worth our struggle and sacrifice."

### Battle for the Crimean Peninsula Unfolds; Fierce Fighting on the Tonglinburg Railway Line

Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Haidong News Agency military news: The battle for the Crimean Peninsula is currently taking place at two points: one in the foothills of Mount Mithridates near Kerch, and the other in the lowlands near Saki. Tatar volunteers are fighting alongside German troops in that area. The fighting between Nikolaev and Kovel is intensifying, but the overall situation remains unchanged. The German air force has not been as active as in previous days due to bad weather.

Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Haidong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front is now between Ternopil and Proskurov, and near Brody. The Soviet Union is deploying half its forces in an apparent attempt to launch a double flanking maneuver from Proskurov towards Lviv (Lemberg). The Soviet offensive northwest of Kovel has been halted, and the second defense of Vitebsk has also failed.

### German Army Builds New Defense Line in Cassino

Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: According to Haidong News Agency: The Allied forces have used heavy weapons to build a new defense line in Cassino, so the German artillery has been very active in recent days. One artillery position fired an average of sixty rounds per minute on Wednesday. During the initial Allied offensive, groups of soldiers attempted to drive straight in, but after suffering heavy casualties, they had to change their tactics.

### Mount Vesuvius Erupts More Violently; Bari Shrouded in Thick Smoke

Central News Agency telegram from Milan, 24th: According to news from Southern Italy: The eruption of Mount Vesuvius intensified on the 22nd, with the lava flow reaching a width of 300 meters and a depth of 27 meters. The entire Bay of Naples is shrouded in thick smoke. Villages such as San Sebastiano al Vesuvio and Massa di Somma have been swept away by gray lava flows, carrying countless rocks and lava from the volcano's southwest slope.

### Intensification of European Air Warfare Before the Opening of the Second Front

America

The American characteristic lies in carrying out daytime bombing in good weather with large formations of large bombers. Their bombers, the "Liberator" flying fortresses, have better armor and combat weapons than British aircraft. They do not use many incendiary bombs, and they can easily find targets in the daytime, so they aim to hit the targets accurately. In daytime bombing, they are often intercepted by German fighters, so American bombers have strong combat capabilities and use large formations to engage in aerial combat.

In last year's Schweinfurt bombing, the American sacrifice was enormous. After that, they temporarily chose cloudy daytime and targeted Norway and other nearby locations. Later, they used long-range fighters to attack in clear weather. According to recent announcements, a new device is now in use that can aim through the clouds even in cloudy weather. But it does not seem very accurate.

British Air Minister Sinclair said last October: "In the same location, Britain conducts area bombing at night, and the United States conducts precision bombing in the daytime. The ideal of Anglo-American cooperation in bombing is to combine the strengths of both sides." But today, in order to avoid sacrifices, the United States is also adopting the British-style nighttime bombing method, which is noteworthy.

Germany

The German bombing of Britain in 1941 was characterized by the fact that, unlike today's Britain, it did not have the concept of area bombing. It used radio waves to navigate accurately using forward positions in Europe, and it valued range of action, not loading bombs to the limit. But it had to stop due to the need for bombers in the war against the Soviet Union, the development of British radio wave detectors, ground air defense equipment, and fighter interception methods. At that time, Germany did not regard bombing cities as strategic bombing with the greatest importance, as Britain does today. This is also one of the reasons. However, the recent continuous bombing of London is a feat. Londoners will relive the terror of the past.

The details of the current German bombing technology are unknown. But the recent bombing of London not only fully adopts the methods taken by Britain, but also adds Germany's own excellent technology. Its new features include forming large formations to prepare for combat with British fighters, using large formations to concentrate bombing, choosing bad weather at night, using guided aircraft, flying extremely high over London, and implementing effective bombing with dive bombers (according to British reports, the sound of dive bombers can be heard in the center of London). They also use roundabout tactics to prepare for fighter interception and side-flying tactics to avoid anti-aircraft guns. There are newly built four-engine Heinkel 177s, 217s, Messerschmitt 110s and 210s , each with its own special purpose. Their speed is so fast that British fighters cannot intercept them.

Attacking Berlin from southeastern England is more advantageous to the Germans in terms of distance than attacking London from northern France and the Netherlands, so if aircraft production is equal, the bombing war favors the Germans.

The comparison of British, American, and German bombing technologies is briefly as described above. So what is the purpose of urban bombing? What the British and Americans are trying to achieve is to destroy Germany's production capacity to reduce its war power, prepare for the second front, and destroy the morale of the German people. Regarding the destruction of production capacity, according to British reports, it is about 30%, of which direct destruction of factories accounts for nine-tenths, and the rest is general chaos, destruction of workers' residences, and disruption of traffic. According to German reports, the loss rate has been greatly reduced, factories that are bombed are given priority for repair, and workers' residences and traffic problems are considered major problems. The British and Americans also lack confidence in using air raids to destroy production capacity because Germany has successfully dispersed industry and commerce and reorganized. They hope to be able to destroy morale.

As for the psychological effect, it only makes the Germans feel more hostile and strengthens their morale. But its adverse impact cannot be denied in any way.

As for Germany's purpose in bombing Britain, on the one hand, it is of course retaliation, and on the other hand, it is also to hinder the concentration preparations for the landing operation. What impact it has on British morale and production can only be understood if the bombing is further intensified. But at least in terms of the destruction of production capacity, if the degree of damage is the same, then its impact in Britain is greater than in Germany. But whether a large country like Germany or Britain can be forced to surrender by bombing alone is impossible to say for sure based on the experience so far.

Today's urban bombing is very different from before due to the concept of British strategic bombing. This should be done to them what they are doing to others. At the same time, there is also a tendency to ignore the loss of bombers. In today's world of developed aircraft production capacity, a loss of about one-tenth is indeed not enough to see. Judging from the British and American figures, from May to October the bombing was not as intense as it is today , but the United States lost 553 flying fortresses, with 5,000 crew members, and Britain lost 288 heavy bombers, with 11,000 crew members. Since November, it has become even more intense. In this sense, if radio-controlled bombers are realized in Germany, the intensity of urban bombing will have even more epoch-making progress.

### Temporary Rationing of Cloth; Prices Have Been Determined; Purchase Certificates to be Printed and Sold in Early May

Regarding the issue of temporary rationing of cotton cloth for civilian use, the National Commercial Control Association has completed preparations and will begin general rationing around early May. The Commercial Control Association has now completed the printing of purchase certificates for rationed cloth and will hand them over to the municipal government to distribute to citizens according to the rationing household system. Citizens can purchase cloth at designated retail stores by presenting the "Purchase Certificate." Each person will receive one purchase certificate per household, and each certificate can purchase 15 feet of cloth. The price of rationed cloth will be calculated at twice the purchase price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth, which is 3.75 yuan per foot, doubled to 7.5 yuan. To this, a 30% profit margin for merchants will be added, bringing the price to 9.75 yuan per foot. Finally, a 4% administrative fee will be added, bringing the final price to 10.014 yuan per foot. It is reported that there are more than 700 retail stores throughout the city that will distribute the cloth. The cloth distributed will be half of the amount reserved by each retail store for sale. If a retail store does not have enough cloth to distribute, it can apply to wholesalers for additional allocation.

### Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Society

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the medical community of allied Japan organized the East Asia Medical Society in Japan in 1932 in order to connect feelings, enhance academics, and promote the exchange of medical technology in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The participating members are all medical professionals from the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The first and second congresses were held in Japan. The third session will be held in our country on a rotating basis, and it has been decided to hold a one-day meeting in Nanjing on April 25. The 26th, 27th, and 28th will be held at Aurora University in this city for three days. Preparations are actively underway.

### Japanese Army Attacks Indian Territory; Indian Overseas Chinese All Feel Excited; Minister Bopi Delivers Speech

Since the news of the Japanese army in Burma assisting the Indian National Army to attack the Indian territory reached here, the 2,500 overseas Chinese in Shanghai have all been extremely excited. Among them, Bopi, the Minister of Liaison of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League, who had previously been running around for the independence movement near the Koring River, where the Japanese army is now attacking, was arrested by the British army. Fortunately, he was able to escape with wit. Therefore, his feelings are particularly deep this time. The reporter specially visited Mr. Bopi at the League's office, and he gave the following speech:

### Indian National Army

With the cooperation of the Japanese army, they have finally stepped into the territory of their homeland. All of us comrades who have been engaged in the independence movement for many years are extremely excited to hear this news. Looking back more than ten years ago, when I was engaged in underground activities in China, I was almost arrested by the army in the same area as the Koring River. At that time, six English detectives were chasing me day and night. I lurked in the dark wilderness for days without food or drink, and finally managed to escape to Burma and then to Japan. The place where I escaped at that time has now become the gateway for the Japanese army to assist us in attacking, which makes me feel extremely happy. At that time, when I learned that the Japanese army was launching an offensive in the central-Indian border, I was quite concerned about whether they would be able to cross the Koring River. Now they have safely

### Breaking Through Difficulties

My heart is greatly relieved. The British and Americans have always been afraid of death, so they always make other ethnic groups fight in the front line first. However, they also fear that the Indian troops will rebel, so they have transferred the Chongqing army to India. However, they are still not at ease, and they have transferred the West African army from afar to reinforce the defense, because the African army can definitely endure the harsh environment of the Indian border. In fact, the climate of Africa is completely different from the Assam area. With the spiritually inconsistent troops of the British, Americans, Chongqing, and Africans resisting the Japanese and Indian armies that are liberating Asia, failure is inevitable. Crossing the Koring River and traversing the state of Assam is Bengal, the birthplace of the Indian independence movement. After the Japanese and Indian armies reach Bengal, the independence movement in India will definitely develop by leaps and bounds.

### Police Consumer Cooperative to be Established by the End of This Month

In order to improve the lives of the police and promote police efficiency, the First Police Bureau has organized a police consumer cooperative to handle the procurement and distribution of daily necessities to stabilize the lives of the police. A fund of 40 million yuan has been requested by Director Chen in a letter to the city's banks, chambers of commerce, and citizen welfare associations for assistance and advance. Various sectors have also enthusiastically borrowed, so there are generally no problems. It is reported that the society is scheduled to be formally established on the 31st of this month and begin procurement and distribution matters.

### Distribution of Coal Briquette Certificates in the Seventh District Extended by Two Days

Regarding the distribution of coal briquettes to households in the Seventh District of this city, the City Economic Bureau has divided the second phase of distribution of purchase certificates into eight locations and dispatched personnel to directly distribute them to citizens. It was originally scheduled to end this afternoon, but due to the large population, the Bureau has decided to extend it by two days. Tomorrow will be a day of rest, and distribution will continue on the 27th and 28th , so that all citizens will receive them. As for the date of coal briquette distribution, once the coal briquette purchase certificates have been fully distributed, it will be announced publicly. Citizens can purchase from designated stores by presenting the certificate. Each person can purchase 15 catties, priced at 8.4 yuan.

### Nanshi Implements Emergency Alert

Since the implementation of wartime permanent blackout in the entire Nanshi area, all private lights in the area have been shielded and dimmed, yielding very good results. However, theft cases have occurred repeatedly. In addition to intensifying secret contact and cooperation, the Second Police Bureau has also implemented emergency alerts. A police brigade patrols thoroughly every night. At the same time, it is stipulated that each Lianbao (collective security) group's patrol team will thoroughly inspect the Lianbao under its jurisdiction all night to prevent the rise of theft.

### Victory of Japanese Army Confirmed in the Burma-India Border Battle Minister Matsushima Issues Statement

Colonel Matsushima, the press minister of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with the Chinese press corps at the naval attaché's office yesterday (the 24th) as usual. The main points of the minister's statement are summarized below:

### Significant Impact of the India-Burma Operations

The British and American propaganda about a counteroffensive in Burma has been going on for a long time, but the current battle situation has confirmed their continued defeat. The reason is the internal conflict between Britain and the United States. They disagree on the use of naval power and ships, which has led to the Japanese army's victory in Burma. Their use of naval power and ships to the greatest extent possible in the India-Burma region has affected the naval battles in the Pacific. The enemy forces at the Marshall Islands and Rabaul have made no significant progress. The failure of their operations is based on the defeat in Burma.

### Failure of the Ledo Road Construction

The Japanese victory in Burma has promoted the rapid independence of India, the great unity of the nations of East Asia, and prevented the Allied Expeditionary Force from making any progress. The enemy initially had great hopes for the construction of the Ledo Road, but since the defeat in the Burma campaign, these hopes have been shattered by the Japanese army. On the contrary, the Japanese army and navy have already gained an advantageous position in Burma and the Pacific. We will not make extravagant predictions about the future war situation, but the victory in the Burma operations has already been confirmed.

### Current Situation of the Andaman and Other Islands

When this newspaper asked Minister Matsushima about the situation on the front lines of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the minister explained that these two regions are the forward bases for the Japanese navy's defense of Burma. The Japanese army attaches great importance to air and sea defense, and the defense is tight. The enemy will have a hard time succeeding. Since the beginning of this year, they have repeatedly attacked with air force, but they have all been calmly repelled by the Japanese naval officers and soldiers. If the enemy wants to attack these two regions, they must use extremely large naval and air forces. Judging from the current situation of Britain and the United States, they have no ability to take risks in these areas.

### Britain and the United States Compete for Arabian Oil

The minister then talked about the problem of Arabian oil, saying that U.S. President Roosevelt recently told reporters that the United States is experiencing a shortage of oil and will exploit it in Arabia. We can predict that the following problems will arise from Roosevelt's statement:

A. On the oil issue, conflicts between Britain and the United States will not only arise at present, but will be difficult to stop even after the war, and will become more acute and continue indefinitely.

B. The United States' ambition to dominate the world will reach Arabia, and conflicts will occur there with Britain.

C. The United States' preservation of domestic oil reserves will cause resentment from oil merchants.

D. Problems will arise for the entire Muslim community. Mecca, the holy city of Islam, is a sacred place revered by Muslims, and they will not allow the United States to exploit it. Conflicts between Britain and the United States will inevitably arouse great resentment from Muslims.

E. The United States will use the Arabian Sea as a naval base, from which it can develop towards the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is also heard that the United States is storing one million barrels of oil in Arabia (each barrel containing about twenty gallons), and will use this power to confront Britain.

### Impression of Minister Ren of the Navy

Minister Matsushima continued by talking about his impression of meeting with Ren Yuandao, Minister of the Navy, on April 1st, the Chinese Navy Day. The minister said that he recently met Minister Ren at a social banquet and was impressed and admired by Minister Ren's health and dignified attitude. It is heard that Minister Ren is related to Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong once wrote a couplet for Minister Ren at the age of sixty-two, encouraging Ren to become a military model in the future. At that time, Ren was in his prime, serving as a regimental commander in the army, and was very grateful for Wenzhong's encouragement. Today, Minister Ren has honorably assumed the most important position in the Chinese army and navy. We must observe Minister Ren's grand plans for the entire Chinese navy. Regarding the current situation of the Chinese navy, I will publish a detailed article with photos to inform those who care about the Chinese navy.

### Men and Women in Rabaul Are Indistinguishable

Finally, Minister Matsushima shared an interesting story: "I recently met a member of the press who had returned to Shanghai from the front lines of Rabaul. He said that the US military often has problems with women wherever they fight, but the Japanese army does not. When asked the reason, he told me that he had been working in Rabaul for more than a month and had never seen what the local women looked like, because the men and women of Rabaul dress the same and are indistinguishable. As a result, the Japanese army does not have problems with women."

Economic Commentary

### Health Problems of the Banking Industry

For more than two months, the turnover of funds in the Shanghai banking industry has not been as flexible as before, due to the central financial authorities' active contraction of currency and restriction of loans. Those with superficial views regard this as a disease of the banking industry, but they do not know that the health of the banking industry does not depend on the amount of funds used, but on the way the funds are used. Just like the health of the human body, it should not be symbolized by the size of its muscles, but should be measured by the tightness of its muscles. The excessive expansion of the banking industry's own economic credit will result in the same danger as a person's excessive strength.

Since the establishment of the banking industry in Shanghai, perhaps it has never been as abnormal as it has been since the war, whether in appearance or in substance. In terms of appearance, there are simply too many banks and money shops, so many that supply exceeds demand! In terms of substance, except for a few legitimate operators, almost every bank and money shop is involved in speculative operations. We have long predicted that there would be a day when they would run out of resources.

For the sake of the banking industry itself, and for the sake of the entire national economy and people's livelihood, we still adhere to our consistent position, which is that the banking industry should first practice self-discipline and then implement mergers. We should have long used the bank merger method in Japan's wartime economic system as a model. The recent formal decision of the Japanese Ministry of Finance to abolish branches and offices of ordinary banks should also tell us that the allocation of banks during wartime urgently needs to be rationalized.

### Authorities Actively Strengthening Transportation Institutions in Various Regions Large Quantities of Goods Will Flow to Shanghai

Various trade associations in Shanghai, for the welfare of their members and the long-term stability of industry and commerce, have separately requested the relevant authorities to: 1. Fully allocate materials. 2. Thoroughly improve the evaluation system. 3. Assist in the purchase of finished products or raw materials. They have won the sincere sympathy of the authorities. According to reporters' inquiries from authoritative sources, regarding the full allocation of materials, the authorities will determine this based on the source of materials. They are currently actively strengthening transportation institutions in various regions, so it is expected that the amount of various materials transported to Shanghai will gradually increase in the future. At the same time, the authorities are happy to assist merchants in purchasing from various regions in the country.

### Materials Association Decides to Investigate Soap, Candles, and Matches

The Materials Investigation Committee held its tenth plenary committee meeting at its office at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 24th). All Chinese and Japanese committee members were present. After Vice Minister Jiang Zuoxuan of the Ministry of Industry reported on the recent investigation work, the meeting immediately discussed the results. Regarding the inventory and production of soap, matches, and candles, each business was required to fill out a report, which was compiled and submitted by the relevant trade associations for submission to the Executive Yuan for review and filing. It was decided at the meeting to send personnel for an on-site investigation. Those who are found to have made inaccurate reports or concealed information will be severely punished. The investigation of other materials will be decided after submitting a request to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### Finance Department Will Inspect Financial Institutions

The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office, in order to crack down on speculative hoarding and stabilize prices, has formulated restrictions on financial institutions' lending operations in order to invest funds in production. All financial institutions have refused to provide loans secured by major commodities and have tightened all unnecessary loans. In order to prevent financial institutions from engaging in speculation, hoarding, and illegal investment activities, the office has implemented inspection limits. Personnel will be dispatched to any financial institution at any time to conduct inspections, in order to supervise and correct financial operations and ensure the proper use of funds.

Thanks to the cooperation of the Buddhist Congee Kitchen and the enthusiastic response from people from all walks of life and charitable organizations, who generously contributed to relieve the poor with kindness and care. The application for allocation was repeatedly delayed, but fortunately, all parties understood and appreciated it. In addition, the Buddhist disciples of the Allied Nations provided thousands of feet of assistance, and Layman Rongbai and Dharma Master Fancheng helped design and travel, which allowed the entire process to be successfully completed. Due to a lack of materials, a total of 6,220 sets of winter clothing plus half-bodies were produced. The income and expenditure accounts are listed below to show the truth:

### Navy

- Iwata Souo, translated by Hong Yang

Wide Open Skies (1)

It was hot, but a clear and bright day. The auditorium was decorated with red and white curtains and彩旗. The medals of the formally dressed instructors shone, as did the slightly mismatched civil officer instructors'礼轄, the instructors' wives in紋章禮服, and the new graduates and the entire student body, all standing silently in rows.

His Imperial Highness the Envoy, on a naval vessel, arrived at the dock. Gunshots rang out, and the Japanese national anthem was played. His Highness, accompanied by Minister of the Navy Yonei,侍從武官, and others, entered the hall under the respectful greetings of all.

Soon, the bugle sounded "Attention," indicating that His Highness had taken his seat. It is best to leave the readers to imagine the circumstances of the solemn graduation ceremony that followed.

However, the 真人 only received a graduation certificate from the principal and did not receive a short sword bestowed by the侍武官. This was a fact. Although he was not a poor student, he was not an excellent student either. His only consolation was that he had obtained a second-dan license from the Kodokan before graduation.

After the graduation ceremony, His Highness returned to the ship. All the members saw him off until the shadow of the御召艦 disappeared. Following the order, the new graduates flew to the student hall like脱兎. New lieutenant junior grade uniforms were waiting for them there. Although not very wide, the full line of knots shimmered on the cuff. The微章 on the military cap shone with golden light.

The new candidates, who had changed their clothes, came out of the student hall one after another with shy smiles on their faces.

"Congratulations!"

Instructors, students, instructors' wives, and even children shouted, and even the thick-skinned people turned purple.

### Aurora University New Collection of Rare Books

- Luo Yimin

Recently, Aurora University received a donation of four large books from Mr. Liu Tizhi, all of which are rare books for studying Chinese literature and linguistics. They have been on display in the university's linguistics library since the other day for viewing. Mr. Liu is a prominent scholar of the time, with a family history of scholarship. His father, Bingzhang, was a great Confucian scholar during the Xianfeng years of the late Qing Dynasty, who served as the Governor-General of Sichuan for many years. After his death, he was given the posthumous title "Wenzhuang." The "Collected Memorials of Liu Wenzhuang" in eight volumes and "Jingxuan Notes" in four volumes, written by him, were published by Mr. Tizhi and are the first two of today's rare books. The other two, which are voluminous, were written by Tizhi himself and are precious books for studying Chinese bronze inscriptions. One is "Shan Qi Ji Jin Lu" in twenty-eight volumes, containing thousands of pictures and inscriptions of bronzes, all of which were owned by Mr. Liu in the past or are now. The other is "Xiao Xiao Jing Ge" in eighteen volumes, which consists of rubbings of genuine works of more than six thousand five hundred ancient bronze inscriptions, with modern copies, annotations by predecessors, and annotations by Mr. Liu himself. Modern Chinese linguists, all those who are concerned about the history of Chinese calligraphy and explain Chinese characters and inscriptions using scientific methods, must not take Mr. Liu's works lightly.

Regarding the explanation of ancient characters, Xu Shen wrote "Shuowen Jiezi," but judging from the various font styles listed in the book, it can be seen that his knowledge of ancient bronzes and inscriptions was limited. Since Australia, historical books have mentioned the discovery of ancient bronzes from time to time. By the Song Dynasty, collection began to expand, and the decision was made to request explanations for inscriptions. However, it was not until the late Qing Dynasty that significant progress was made. Many books on the collection of bronzes have been published, with rubbings of inscriptions and annotations. However, the rubbings are often handwritten copies rather than the originals. The increase in publications is due to the increasing number of bronze discoveries in various famous ruins, and this trend continues to this day. Among these publications, Mr. Liu's lifelong works can be regarded as the culmination of them all.

Mr. Liu is proficient in literary and historical classics, and is especially versed in 小学. He provides accurate explanations for several chapters of ancient inscriptions, revealing what predecessors had not. He is not only a master of Chinese literature and history, but his works also express the spirit of modern science: that is, any view, no matter how old its origin, if it conflicts with the various materials obtained through meticulous research and excavation in recent years, he resolutely abandons it without hesitation. In short, Mr. Liu is truly an heir to Eastern culture. Now, he has donated the above-mentioned four books to Aurora University, giving most people the opportunity to observe them, which is truly commendable.
