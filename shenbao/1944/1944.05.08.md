### Praying for Death in Battle

The spirit of fighting and unity is the foundation for a nation's existence in the modern world. To give up one's life for the country and the nation, to seek lasting survival, is the highest morality. This spirit is most evident in our allied nation, Japan. So-called Bushido, so-called the Yamato spirit, are concepts of battle.

The three characters "Praying for Death in Battle" were a slogan on the flags of well-wishing relatives farewelling Japanese conscripted soldiers departing for the front line during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. This slogan encouraged the people's courage to sacrifice for their country. Only when individuals have the courage to sacrifice can the country avoid being sacrificed and exist perpetually. At the same time, only when the country can exist perpetually can individuals exist perpetually. The relationship between the country and the people is both one and two, and two and one. Selfish and self-serving people can never create a strong country. A nation without a spirit of sacrifice will only hasten its own demise. Once the country has been sacrificed, everything for the people is over. By the time you want to turn things around, it's too late. The spirit of praying for death in battle shows that the entire Japanese nation is determined to sacrifice for the country. This determination lays a foundation for spiritual victory, and its power can overcome all material difficulties, creating an effect of one against a hundred on the battlefield. Therefore, Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War was decided not when Japanese soldiers arrived on the battlefield, but at the moment they set off.

In this Greater East Asia War, it is our allied nation, Japan, that is best able to demonstrate the fighting spirit. Marshal Yamamoto's martyrdom last year and Marshal Koga's dedication to his country this year both demonstrate the spirit of Japanese generals leading by example and regarding death as homecoming. The fleet commander-in-chief does not necessarily have to be on the front line, but the Japanese commander, following the traditional spirit of Marshal Togo, always stood on the front line of the bridge rather than hiding in the command tower. The marshal is the center of gravity of the entire fleet, and if the marshal's courage is like this, then the courage of all personnel in the fleet is a hundredfold, which goes without saying. Therefore, when Marshal Togo issued the slogan "Our survival depends on this battle," all personnel in the fleet had a spirit that could swallow mountains and rivers, and victory in battle was already decided.

This kind of tragic spirit is also what we Chinese have admired since ancient times. The so-called "risking one's life in times of danger" and "being impartial in public affairs and selfless in private matters, forgetting one's family for the sake of the country" are what people have generally encouraged since ancient times. This spirit has enabled China to flourish for thousands of years until now, and it is the essence of the Eastern spirit. However, since the Opium War, the Chinese people have been deeply poisoned by Anglo-American thought. The idea of benefiting others cannot overcome the idea of benefiting oneself, and the idea of loving the country cannot overcome the idea of loving oneself. The number of selfish and self-serving people is increasing day by day, and the number of people who love their country is decreasing day by day. As a result, the country's rights and interests are being invaded day by day, and the country's status is declining day by day. This Greater East Asia War is a rare opportunity for China to liberate itself after a thousand years. We should take the Japanese soldiers of our allied nation as role models, and everyone must stand on their respective posts and work hard to demonstrate the fighting spirit. In particular, officials in the government should have the courage to eliminate problems that hinder participation in the war and demonstrate the same fighting spirit as the soldiers on the front line.

### Analysis of the Domestic Situation in India Under the Japanese-Indian Army Offensive

The fundamental concept of British policy towards India is "divide and rule." This is consistent with Britain's traditional diplomatic policy towards the European continent: the balance of power. The foundation of Britain's balance of power policy is the fragmented nature of European powers. Similarly, the divide-and-rule policy towards India subtly utilizes the divisive nature of the domestic situation in India. Gandhi once lamented: "The self-contradictory opposition of Indians within India is the biggest obstacle to the completion of India for Indians." Most of the movements that Gandhi has engaged in over the years are less anti-British resistance movements than coordination movements between religious adherents, horizontal movements of untouchable castes in Hindu society, or movements to break down the classes among them.

India has a vast territory of 1.55 million square miles, a population of 400 million, more than 200 languages, and various religious oppositions and complex class systems in society. Therefore, various problems are very complex, leading to a state of division in various aspects, which is inevitable.

Political Group Opposition

The most prominent of these divisions and oppositions are the opposition between political groups and the relationship between the princely states and British India. The reason why India's independence has been so delayed is due to these two problems, if the responsibility lies with the Indians themselves. Let us briefly describe the three powerful political groups in India today and their views on the issue of Indian independence.

The Indian National Congress has 4.5 million members and is the first political party in India. The party's movement for independence is marked by India's complete independence. It clearly opposed the proposal for a dominion system after the war, which was declared by the Governor-General when the war broke out. It also opposed the Cripps Offer and resolved that British forces should immediately withdraw from India and expressed a tough attitude to the General Assembly, stating that if no reply was received within two weeks, it would immediately begin a large-scale disobedience movement.

The All-India Muslim League has 400,000 members and is backed by 80 million Muslims in India. The League's platform is on the same position as the Congress Party on the point of India's independence, but the Congress Party advocates a minority nationalism, taking the interests of the Indian union as its main objective, while the League advocates racialism, taking the protection of the interests of Indian Muslims as its primary goal. Therefore, on the issue of India's independence, it does not support India's independent independence, but advocates a separate independence theory for India's Hindus and Muslims. When the war broke out, the Muslims clearly understood British policy, but did not engage in anti-British movements and were generally quite compliant with British hopes.

The Hindu Mahasabha party is the first priority to support the interests of Muslims, while the party boasts of supporting the interests of Hindu Indians and adopts racialism. In this respect, it differs from the position of the National Congress. The party's goal is to obtain the complete independence of India under the auspices of Hindu Indians, and it is satisfied if Britain immediately recognizes the establishment of an Indian national government and allows complete autonomy. There is a lot of compromise with the British.

In this way, although there is a unified goal in hoping for independence, opinions are not entirely consistent among the various parties on the degree of independence and freedom and on its complete power method. The British policy of divide and rule cleverly aimed at this point.

British stooges - the princely states

In addition to the opposition of these political groups, the attitude of the Indian princely states also hinders India's independence movement. The princely states demand that Britain recognize their feudal monarchy and guarantee their established rights and status, in exchange for their loyalty to Britain. They are completely captured by Britain's policy of appeasement and containment, are now fascinated by feudal glory, continue to ruthlessly collect from the people, and are willing to be Britain's loyal servants. Moreover, regardless of the content of the independence movement, as it threatens their own power and status, they have always opposed it and are willing to be British stooges. When the war broke out, they still took an indifferent attitude despite witnessing the great changes in the world situation. The reason for this lies here. There are more than 600 of these large and small princely states, with an area accounting for about 40% of the total area of India and a population accounting for about 30%. Therefore, their position is quite important in the Indian independence movement.

On the issue of India's independence, Britain has always consistently argued that as long as the internal political disputes in India can be resolved, autonomy will be granted. Otherwise, independence will cause internal strife. Britain knows that the princely states' loyalty to Britain will not change, and the opposition between the various political groups will not be resolved. On the one hand, it incites and exacerbates their opposition in policy and behind the scenes.

Eliminating Opposition

However, the above-mentioned opposition and inconsistent actions have gradually been resolved by the European War and the Greater East Asia War. Indian Muslims have expressed considerable resentment towards the measures taken by the United Kingdom against Palestinian Muslims and the Arab nation, and some young Muslims are quite dissatisfied with the pro-British coordination attitude of the League's leadership and have expressed their opposition. In addition, Bishop Foucher, who has recently been paying attention to the changes in the world situation in Germany, has declared to Indian Muslims: "Cooperate with the Japanese and Indian armies and participate in the war to liberate India." Therefore, the future direction of the Indian Muslim League will have a period-making double change. On the one hand, with the Japanese-Indian army's offensive operation into India as an opportunity, the people who have suffered under the tight squeeze of the princely states have already risen up. The police attack incidents in Rachiputana and Kashmir in the past, the strike incidents in the military supply factories and textile factories in Travancore and Mai An'er, and the anti-British demonstration movements such as boycotting British goods have been vigorously launched.

In this way, just as the balance of power policy towards the European continent has failed, Britain's divide-and-rule policy towards India is now in jeopardy. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on April 22)

### Japanese Air Force Active in Burma, Fiercely Attacking Enemy Transportation Lines, British Fourth Army Surrounded and in Perilous Situation

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from an Indian base on the 7th: Since the escalation of the air war in Burma, enemy air transport corps have been continuously conducting active transport activities. In addition to obtaining supplies through the Chongqing air transport route, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and adjacent flight teams use dozens of transport aircraft and other transport aircraft to continuously engage in transport and supply work, just like the enemy air transport units in northern Burma. Because the Japanese army's offensive posture in the Imphal area has now been completed, the enemy is determined to defend Imphal to the death, and dispatched Douglas DC transport aircraft to transport wartime materials and personnel to enhance personnel and various supplies, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army, 50 of them were shot down, and the loss of air force personnel was quite significant, which had a great impact on the enemy's lack of air force personnel.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a Burmese base on the 7th: The elite Japanese army air force units in Burma flew over enemy positions in a combined large formation of fighter-bombers on the morning of the 5th, continuously dropping bombs and heavily bombarding enemy artillery positions, silencing the enemy artillery positions completely. The Japanese aircraft continued to attack enemy truck convoys speeding along the Dimapur highway, diving and bombing 20 to 30 enemy trucks, achieving great results. Another Japanese team fiercely attacked an enemy airfield, instantly destroying four land gliders, and even fired at enemy positions and a large number of soldiers around the airfield at ultra-low altitude, causing heavy losses. All Japanese aircraft returned to base.

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) The British Fourth Army south of the Imphal basin is in a critical situation because the last line of resistance, Palel and somewhere else, is in danger, so it sent personnel to Ceylon to request assistance. However, because the domestic situation in India is chaotic, Britain must send troops to suppress it and must also take into account the air transport support work of other troops. Therefore, although it has reluctantly agreed to the Fourth Army's request, they still do not feel panicked. Recently, the Indian troops in the Imphal basin, on the one hand, are affected by the Japanese army's encirclement and compression, and on the other hand, they have witnessed the enthusiasm of the Indian National Army dedicating themselves to the country's independence, so their fighting spirit has almost completely disappeared, and the number of people joining the Indian National Army is increasing day by day. This has caused great embarrassment to the command of the British Fourth Army, so it has transported these Indian troops to the Calcutta area by plane and transferred African troops from that area to the Imphal basin and the Kohima front.

### Rumors Run Rampant in Turkish Capital

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) Reuter's reports: Rumors are running rampant in the Turkish capital, which is caused by Germany's failure to express its position on the suspension of the import of Turkish minerals. An air defense exercise was held in Istanbul the night before, making all parties feel more uneasy. In order to stabilize people's hearts, the semi-official agency "Ulus Newspaper" published an article officially denying rumors such as the bombing of Edirne and the discovery of a time bomb on the Taurus Express, and resolutely denied the saying that Germany issued an ultimatum. The newspaper also refuted the rumors that the Turkish government and the parliament disagree.

### European Air Offensive: Prelude to a Landing Operation; German Mechanized Elite Await in Strict Formation

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency): Reuter reports from London: British Air Undersecretary Balfour stated in a speech in a town on the southeast coast of England yesterday that the current anti-Axis air offensive is the beginning of the second front. Thousands of anti-Axis airmen are flying over Europe every day, effectively beginning the invasion. The start of land battles will mark a new phase of the second front.

Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency): According to a London dispatch, The Daily Telegraph's editorial detailed the German defense plan against the anti-Axis forces' invasion of Europe as follows: When the anti-Axis fleet approaches the continental coast, the German army will first launch a fierce attack with thousands of new radio-controlled bombs. They will also mobilize submarines waiting in secret bases and small two-man submarines. Simultaneously, electrically-operated mortars deployed along the coast will be activated, firing from behind coastal cliffs. Furthermore, they will guard against Anglo-American paratrooper units in their rear. Therefore, the German defense forces are composed of mechanized elites. Upon receiving an alarm, elite mechanized units stationed at various bases will mobilize for large-scale counter-offensives. At the same time, special units composed of SS troops in mechanized formations will annihilate anti-Axis paratrooper units, completing their specific task.

Only a few enemy reconnaissance planes attacked German mainland on the night of the 5th.

Strong Italian Defenses

Milan, 7th (Central News Agency): Reuter reports: The United States is fully prepared for the invasion of Europe. The fortifications along the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas are numerous, similar to the Atlantic Wall. The fortifications recently inspected by Marshal Rommel are stronger than anything previously seen on the Italian coast. Italian cement and brick factories are scattered throughout the region, unaffected by air raids. They have been producing large quantities of materials for building fortifications in recent months. In addition, the rocky terrain along the Italian coast provides an excellent base for constructing these defensive works.

Danish Authorities Deny Rumors

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency): Recently, anti-Axis propaganda related to the second front has intensified.

### 35th Period of Cigarettes: Handling of Distribution

The Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association recently issued a notice to all wholesale and retail merchants to handle the distribution of the 35th period of cigarettes, estimated at approximately 8,300 yuan for Grade D, with other grades increasing according to a 1-2-4-8 system. The distributed goods are entirely in accordance with the new price limit, granting the association a legal profit of 20 percent. The majority of the cigarettes distributed are from various Chinese tobacco factories and miscellaneous brands. Payments are due by a deadline, followed by a scheduled date for pickup. It is said that wholesale and retail merchants are dissatisfied with Huazhong's adjusted price limit, requesting improvements to maintain their business. Huazhong is currently considering this matter.

### Miscellaneous Brands of Cigarettes Will Also Have Fixed Prices

Since the Huazhong Cigarette Allocation Association adjusted the prices of allocated cigarettes in the middle of last month, the black market for cigarettes has virtually disappeared, and it is no longer as difficult for citizens to purchase allocated cigarettes as it used to be. According to reliable information from the tobacco industry, the control of cigarettes will be further strengthened in the near future. It is planned to implement fixed prices for all miscellaneous brands of cigarettes produced by various cigarette manufacturers to prevent the illegal price increases of these brands, which would affect the sale of allocated cigarettes. It has also been noted that the variety of miscellaneous brands of cigarettes in the city has been increasing daily, with over thirty kinds currently selling well in the market.

### Spring Loan: Banking Syndicate Agrees to Lend 50 Million Yuan

According to financial circles, after all the silk factories in Huazhong were returned by the Allied nations, the original owners have continued to operate them to seek future development. The spring cocoons will soon be available on the market, and it is said that the silk industry has approached banks to negotiate loans for purchasing spring cocoons. Banks have formed a syndicate to provide loans totaling 50 million yuan. The method will be through bill discounting, and the Silk Industry Association will need to provide certification. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to rediscount. This loan is expected to be established soon, and the silk factories have sent personnel to Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places to arrange for the purchase of cocoons. It is expected that the cocoon harvest will begin in late this month. This year's spring silkworm breeding in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been prosperous, and a bumper harvest is expected. The silk industry anticipates that the 50 million yuan loan may not be enough to purchase all the cocoons and is planning other methods to increase the amount of funds available for cocoon purchases.

### On the Establishment of the Shen Bao Science Award Fund

— Zhang Shizhou

On the 1st of this month, the Shen Bao announced the establishment of the Science Award Fund and made public the list of committee members and the organizational charter, with the aim of rewarding citizens for their research and inventions in natural sciences. This is joyful and deeply moving news. Undoubtedly, this is a great initiative in the Shen Bao's sixty-year history, and it has been immediately echoed by other newspapers and many social celebrities. In this time and place, the significance of this is profound. I think that besides student aid, nothing can compare with it.

Organizations similar to the Shen Bao's Science Award Fund include the Nobel Prize Committee in Sweden and the Rockefeller Foundation Committee in the United States. Most other developed countries also have similar award and foundation organizations, all of which aim to reward meritorious cultural figures and indirectly promote the enthusiasm of citizens for scientific research. The Shen Bao's actions may be a first on the Chinese mainland. Whether it can achieve the practical effect of promoting science depends on how enthusiastically our intellectual class supports it. Of course, the original driving force is necessary. As for the prerequisites, of course, it is first to engage in solid foundations. Because various actions can gain genuine trust, although the funds currently managed by the Shen Bao are not very large, and the committee members and staff cannot devote themselves fully due to their various occupations, they can first extract some time to do some work to show the public. As long as trust is gained, donations will naturally flow in, and great things will be readily accomplished. The management of science awards needs to be proactive, such as immediately extracting considerable funds to first subsidize some poor scholars who are engaged in scientific research and have real and great achievements. After that, I am afraid that millions of donations will follow one after another, and the fashion of scientific research can spread throughout China. The grand occasion and practical effects obtained will be a thousand times greater than student aid and loan funds. There is no doubt about it.

China has many unknown scientists who cannot achieve anything due to economic limitations. There are many such situations among professors and teachers in colleges and universities across the country. If this is the case, at least China's scientific personnel can get something they need. Science can be proposed to replace passive national salvation as a national policy. Fortunately, I hope that the members of the committee can adopt my suggestions and implement them immediately. Then the long-term plan can live up to the hard work of planning in those years.

### Authorities Stabilize the Market: Investigate Trading in Various Industries; Price Trends Last Week Remain Quiet

The authorities in charge of controlling materials in Shanghai are sparing no effort in conducting daily investigations to strictly prohibit illegal price increases by various stores. The general investigators are familiar with the commercial situation of various industries, so the thorough investigation is more convenient. The objects of the investigation are: First, review the store's account books to verify the incoming and outgoing cargo books to determine whether the price of the sold goods has increased and the points that do not comply with legal regulations. The second is to investigate whether the store has hoarding and reluctant to sell. Others, such as whether the sales are given invoices, and whether the prices are clearly marked on the goods display labels, are also examples of the investigation. If any non-compliance is found, severe penalties will be imposed in accordance with current regulations.

According to information from various industries yesterday, the price trend last week remained as quiet as ever, but various hoarding households asked to reduce the price of long-hoarded goods, but because there were few people who inquired, various transactions were very idle. However, in order to recover the decline, general speculators attempted to set up a "trading company", beautifying its name as "buying and selling on behalf of customers", and its essence is that it is a broker nature, which will increase the cost of the buyer, that is, increase the market price. Therefore, the authorities concerned have paid close attention to these similar fictitious transactions and decided to strictly ban them in order to stabilize prices for a long time. As for the persons in charge of price limits for various items, they have just investigated their sales costs. If the cost is indeed increased, they will try to gradually increase them to maintain the difficulties of the merchants.

### Mayor's Cup Football Quarterfinals: Donghua Wins Over Yijing

In the Mayor's Cup Football Quarterfinals, Donghua played against Yijing at 9:45 AM yesterday at the Shanghai Sports Association Stadium at Huangpi Road Racecourse. Donghua defeated Yijing by three to one and won the right to play in the final. At the beginning of the game, Donghua fought against the wind. Yijing kicked off in the middle line, and Yu Liming advanced on the side line. With one pass, Donghua Zhang Banglun caught a full embrace, and things passed. Yijing is still prosperous, and Mai Qidang did not hit the door with one shot each. Donghua committed an arbitrary ball twice, and Yijing failed to get what it wanted. In 20 minutes, Dai Linjing had a great scoring opportunity, but it was a little bit oblique. At 37 minutes, Jia Youliang intercepted a handball and passed it to Li Yao. Li had eyes on the top, approaching Yao Long, and Rossell was too late to stop it. Donghua led by 1 to 0 in the first half. In the sound of the second battle, both sides did not move. Zhang Lingen was anxious for a while and fouled by pushing people in the penalty area. He was sentenced to 12 yards, which was operated by Robert Stoff. Zhang Bang绾Fu Zhixinling turned the danger into safety. After a while, 戴经捲土重来, passing through Tie Funik, kicked the corner of the heavy pass, and Funik ignored the beginning and the end, and returned after hitting the mark. Soon, Sun Tieleg's second artillery-style attack hit the crossbar and escaped. In 23 minutes, Han Longhai crept into the hinterland and merged with Funik. Li Yao took the opportunity to shoot into the empty goal to make it 3-0. Yijing was unwilling to sting for a long time. Mai Qidang tried a small knife and recovered the lost ground. When Yijing desperately counterattacked, but the silver horn rang for a long time, the time ended, and Donghua finally defeated Yijing by 3 to 1. The military capacity of the two teams is recorded later:

Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Sun Jinshun, Zai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang.

Yijing: Funik, 維納, Rossell, Yu Lihua, Tie Funik, Mi Hailov, 洛夫, Mai Qidang, Robert Stoff, En Dibifu, Yu Liming.
