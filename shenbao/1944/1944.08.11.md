### Editorial: Disconnection Between People and Affairs

In recent years, the most telling sign of the disconnection between people and affairs in Chinese politics is the statement made by Mayor Chen during the National Day celebrations: "Everyone is idle, and every affair lacks personnel." This is an honest statement, and only by daring to speak honestly can modern politics be ventilated and developed.

This problem arose after the revolutionary movement in the early years of the Republic of China. However, for more than thirty years, everyone has focused their attention on political affairs and systems. Everyone has studied the structure of Chinese politics, how to establish the Yuan, ministries, and commissions, waiting for major issues, while few have paid attention to obtaining and training talent. However, personnel is the foundation of all political issues. If this fundamental problem is not handled well, any political system, political ideals, or good plans will be unable to be promoted and implemented, and good policies that benefit the people will often turn into bad policies that harm the people.

Establishing a civil service system is the only way to harmonize people and affairs. After the civil service system is established, everyone can be permanently engaged in the affairs they are suited for, and every affair can permanently have suitable people to handle it, so that people can make the best use of their talents and affairs can be utilized to their fullest potential. After people and affairs are properly matched, the greatest effectiveness can be demonstrated. The most important methods for establishing a civil service system are examinations and personnel assessment. Examinations can prevent people from seeking advancement through luck, and personnel assessment can encourage people to be permanently diligent. If government agencies at all levels, based on their respective affairs, openly recruit suitable talents, at least some of the problem of "every affair lacking personnel" will be solved first. If government personnel, based on their respective knowledge, experience, and performance, are individually assessed, then a portion of the personnel will no longer be able to "occupy positions without performing duties," which will at least provide considerable help in solving the problem of "everyone being idle."

During times of political turmoil and public unease, the primary goal of those in charge of the political situation is to implement their policies. To implement their policies, they cannot help but expand their staff. Therefore, the recommendations and maneuvering of relatives and friends are inevitable. As the saying goes, "When one person attains enlightenment, even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven," which is a true depiction of this deformed politics. However, this is a transitional phenomenon, and transitional phenomena cannot last long. If this transitional phenomenon continues permanently, then personnel disorder and political corruption are inevitable results. Wise politicians should seize the opportunity to thoroughly reform the system, immediately bring the turbulent politics back on track, and let the personnel management agencies fairly handle all personnel issues. After personnel are sound, there will be suitable people to advance politics. With suitable people to promote politics, then politics can see the dawn of clarity.

The impact of the disconnection between people and affairs on national politics has been described above. Furthermore, it also has great harm to individuals themselves. If an organization is filled with irrelevant people who cannot do things, then, first, capable people will not be motivated to work and will inevitably do things perfunctorily, wasting their ambitions; second, it will foster laziness and decadence in those who have maneuvered their way in, and may even ruin their lives. Therefore, working in an organization where personnel are mismatched is also a waste and a loss for the individual themselves. Therefore, for the sake of the country and the people, politicians must seize this critical moment and quickly find ways to eliminate this deformed state.

A certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese naval air force sank one enemy submarine each in the waters southeast of Taiwan and near Oshima Island on the 9th. The enemy submarine sunk off Oshima Island was in the process of surfacing when it was attacked by a torpedo and sunk.

A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese garrison on Omiya Island has been inviting attacks from enemy forces near the eastern outskirts of Akashi Street and Mount Halta since the beginning of August, inflicting heavy damage on them.

Since the 7th and 8th, the battle lines of both sides have crossed, with localized fierce battles occurring everywhere.

A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the main force of the Japanese army freely retreated from Guadalcanal, the remaining units engaged in guerrilla warfare in the area were immediately cut off from national economic support. Unexpectedly, after this unit recently captured an enemy torpedo boat, it obtained national economic support with the Japanese military base. It has now been determined that the entire unit is currently using the dense forest as a base and engaging in guerrilla warfare with the enemy. The national economic committee members on that side again rode a torpedo boat full of ammunition, amidst the cheers of the base garrison, and set off again towards Guadalcanal.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Ganzhou Airport, Destroys Seven Chongqing-US Aircraft

A certain Japanese military base on the Chinese front, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the dawn of the 9th, the Japanese bomber squadron raided the Ganzhou (between Zhejiang and Jiangxi) airport in Jiangxi Province, destroying seven Chongqing-US aircraft, and after severely bombing its military facilities, safely returned with all aircraft. The details of the operation are recorded as follows: At 3:30 AM that morning, Japanese aircraft invaded the airspace above the Chongqing military base in adverse weather, and carried out low-altitude bombing of the Chongqing-US aircraft under cover. Five small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two small aircraft and four vehicles were destroyed. At the same time, two locations that appeared to be fuel and ammunition depots were bombed, but no fire was seen. Because the Chongqing army in the area showed signs of retreat, there were only a few small aircraft at the airport, and because no fire was seen in the fuel depot, it was expected that all its materials had been withdrawn.

### Chongqing Aircraft Attacking Hengyang Suffer Losses of Nine Aircraft

The local front line on the mainland, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the morning of the 8th, about 20 Chongqing P40 aircraft attacked Hengyang. The Japanese garrison on aerial patrol immediately invited the attack, and after a fierce battle, shot down seven Chongqing aircraft and destroyed two.

All Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defenses.

### Residents of Shaoguan Migrate in Succession

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, the Chongqing army in Shaoguan, considering the harsh environment, moved all units under the Seventh War Zone to southern Jiangxi. The Chongqing provincial government authorities and their affiliated agencies have moved to nearby counties. The population of Shaoshi reached 500,000, but after the Chongqing army forcibly dispersed them, the civilians moved to other places in succession. All schools were closed on January 27th. Those who exceeded the deadline and did not leave the city were expelled and their national army identity cards were inspected at any time. To avoid forced expansion of military service, most young people voluntarily returned to peaceful areas. It now appears that the Shaoguan authorities intend to abandon the area. Currently, Shaoshi is desolate and has become a dead city.

### Japanese Continue to Attack Leizhou Peninsula

A certain Japanese military base on the front, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the end of July, the Japanese army on the Leizhou Peninsula has defeated the 155th Chongqing Division, which was based in Lianjiang, and then turned from Lianjiang to the south, sweeping away the defeated Chongqing army south of the area.

The Japanese army is continuing its attack.

### Registration of Banks in Nanjing to Be Handled Strictly

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) It was previously reported that the Ministry of Finance had stopped registering financial institutions in Nanjing. However, recently there have still been banks opening for business. The reporter specially visited the Ministry of Finance authorities, who provided the following information: The Ministry has already announced in a statement on December 18, 1942, that registration of financial institutions in Shanghai has been stopped. The Ministry has also approved that no new financial institutions are allowed to be established in Nanjing. Applications for the establishment of financial institutions submitted to the Ministry after April 1st of this year were all rejected. Those submitted before March 31st were still being processed according to the regulations. Recently, the banks mentioned in the press may have recently opened for business due to preparations, or are still in preparation, but their applications for establishment were submitted before the deadline. In addition, a small number of money shops, due to business reasons, applied to the Ministry for approval to change their names to banks and formally open for business again, and are not newly established financial institutions. Recently, it was also reported that various banks that have been approved by the Ministry but have not yet opened for business, due to their inability to operate, have taken the opportunity to stop registration and sell the bank licenses approved by the Ministry to others at high prices. There are even banks that have already gone bankrupt and are still selling their business licenses that should be destroyed, hoping to make a profit. This kind of illegal behavior is truly hateful. The Ministry is currently strictly investigating and will severely punish those who are found to be guilty. The Ministry has always strictly reviewed applications from existing banks to increase capital, change their names, or re-elect directors and supervisors. If the above-mentioned circumstances are discovered, they will be severely punished to prevent abuse.

### Military Communications Conference Holds Closing Ceremony

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) To meet the needs of the war situation, the Japanese government is strengthening the production of synthetic petroleum. Therefore, it has recently implemented direct management of synthetic petroleum by the Fuel and Mobilization Company. It is resolutely strengthening synthetic petroleum enterprises within the customs, and granting considerable production goals to the Fuel Company. Moreover, the relationship between the price of synthetic petroleum, which has always been a matter of great debate, and the war situation has recently been realized due to the urgency of oil supply. Therefore, the Fuel Company's direct management and increased capabilities in securing resources and funds, technical guidance and its exchange and common use, participation in production replenishment plans and material mobilization plans, etc., and other efforts to turn defeat into victory have been strengthened. The rest of the United Control has cooperated with the government to ensure the production of synthetic petroleum, and the Fuel Company has absorbed several existing companies as directly-managed manufacturing plants. In addition, it is also steadily establishing condensation function ceremonies for other powerful companies as targets. The new business model that has recently been realized is worthy of attention in the future for the supply of synthetic petroleum in North China.

After fierce battles, they broke into several marching positions. The marching units immediately counterattacked, detouring to the flanks and deep into the rear of their vanguard, cutting off their retreat, and at the same time repelling the main force of the Soviet army. The battle at the Barga bridgehead was also very fierce. German armored vehicles, which had taken the initiative in the battle situation, began to fiercely attack to the east, and used blitzkrieg to compress the Barga bridgehead. The Soviet army southwest of Bialystok, on the eastern border of East Prussia, launched another large-scale armored offensive on the 8th. After fierce battles, they broke into several German positions. The German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, preventing their advance, and fierce battles are continuing. The German army from Swaruki to Neman blocked the Soviet army's attack, and the Soviet army failed to approach the border by one step. A major offensive and defensive battle unfolded on the 8th in the Rasenya area on the northeastern border of East Prussia.

The weapons and forces supplied from the rear are constantly flowing. I have full confidence in the loyalty and bravery of the German people.

### US Forces to Make New Landing in Italy

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Military editor of the Houtong News Agency, Setho Mus, said: Subtle signs show that the anti-Axis forces are preparing to land in Italy again. This matter will be presided over by the US Fifth Army, which has not been active on the Arno River line for a long time. Most of its defense zone has been taken over by the Eighth Army. The new landing is likely to be near the Gulf of Gulian, but in terms of geography, landing in the Adriatic Sea and the Adriatic Sea is more advantageous, because that area is the North Italian lowland, which can be used for large tank operations. On the Ligurian coast and Genoa, the mountains extend to the coast, making it difficult to secure a beachhead and difficult to advance north. There may be two reasons for the anti-Axis forces to land here: they hope to occupy the port of Genoa, and the German army's unexpectedly strong resistance on the Arno River line has prevented General Alexander from deciding whether to break through the German defense line from below.

### Germany Is Reviewing the Conscription of Women

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Based on Goebbels' total mobilization plan, the German authorities are currently mobilizing extensively and are reviewing the conscription of women in the rear in detail.

### Northern France Anti-Axis Forces Break into Rouen; Germans Begin Counteroffensive at Loire Estuary

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Northern France battle situation on the 9th: Fierce fighting occurred on the Caen to Avreches front. A large Anti-Axis force, under the cover of tanks and air power, strongly attacked German positions. Their vanguard has broken into the Caen area and the general army positions south of Vire. However, they have now been completely halted. In other war zones, the Anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses in positional warfare. The Axis forces' offensive from the front lines still has limited progress. Intense fighting erupted in the Rouen area on the 8th, with Anti-Axis forces breaking into Rouen city. The battle for Saint-Malo is particularly fierce.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 9th: German forces in the Brittany Peninsula have begun a counteroffensive from the Loire Estuary. Anti-Axis forces' claims of cutting off the Brittany Peninsula are untrue. The situation in that area remains unchanged. German forces in Brittany are seizing strongholds through assaults; therefore, American plans have ultimately failed. American offensives at Saint-Nazaire and Lorient have been thwarted. American forces in the Laval area and Sarthe have advanced eastward through German strongholds, but their advance is limited to a portion of the forces.

Berlin, 10th (Reuters dispatch) - The German defense forces in Brittany have been consolidated into three major units for resistance: one in the Brest Peninsula, one in the Lorient area, and one in the Saint-Nazaire area. American tank units in Brittany have been replaced by infantry, and the tanks have been moved between the lower reaches of the Loire River and the Vilaine River. The redeployment is not yet complete. Enemy tanks have advanced from Maine to the Sarthe River, with a portion reaching Château-Gontier and engaging in street fighting. Currently, along the line of the River Oudon near Angers, while American forces have launched large-scale attacks, German forces have not launched large-scale counteroffensives. However, both sides are actively preparing for a major battle. The outcome will have a significant impact on the entire Western Front. In the area between Caen and the River Orne, American First Army, with the assistance of massive air power, barely avoided defeat. German forces not only held their original defenses but also made slight advances. The Canadian First Army's offensive southeast of Caen is fierce, but they are still between the Orne and the Caen-Falaise road. Enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, but they have not broken through. The Canadian forces were halted after advancing four kilometers, and it is expected that enemy pressure will continue to increase.

### New Japanese Cabinet's Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged; Ambassador Tani Meets with Press Corps and Issues Statement

Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masanari, took the opportunity of his visit to Shanghai to meet with the Shanghai Chinese press corps at the Broadway Mansions Hotel on the afternoon of yesterday (10th) at 5:00 PM. He answered various questions from newspaper reporters and clarified that the new Japanese cabinet's policy towards China remains unchanged, and that Sino-Japanese relations are progressing gradually according to established plans. The meeting lasted for forty minutes. The record of Ambassador Tani's statement is as follows:

Ambassador Tani first clarified the purpose of his visit to Shanghai, which was to inspect the work of the personnel at the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy and to pay his respects to the Japanese naval commander in Shanghai. He then answered the various questions asked by the press corps in detail:

Decline in Rice Prices

The recent decline in rice prices in Shanghai is the result of the efforts of the National Government and the Rice Control Association, as well as the sincere cooperation of the Japanese side. Therefore, the price of rice will continue to decline permanently. Moreover, the new rice crop is about to enter the market, and it will definitely fall to a reasonable price.

Policy Remains Unchanged

Japan's new policy towards China is based on the original posture of the two countries. In the past, it was obstructed by the enemy British and Americans, which prevented Japan from achieving it. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, from a position of moral principle, assisted China. This time, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and a new cabinet was formed, which still adheres to the established policy of the past. Furthermore, the entire nation, both government and public, unanimously supports the key points of the new Sino-Japanese policy. For example, Minister Shigemitsu remains in his position as Foreign Minister and concurrently as Minister of Greater East Asia, and Minister Ishiwata remains in his position as Finance Minister. Therefore, Japan's policy towards China will absolutely not change. Moreover, there is no need to elaborate on specific issues. Japan is working hard in accordance with the established plans between China and Japan. For example, cooperation in politics and economy, and the recent measures regarding food rice, are all manifestations of the new policy. In addition, cultural exchanges will be even more closely promoted. China and Japan are currently progressing gradually according to established plans.

Economic Cooperation Regarding Japan's economic cooperation with China, such as in the agricultural field, the Chinese authorities already have a detailed plan. This year, due to favorable weather conditions, a bumper harvest is expected. I am very pleased about this. As for the industrial field, Japan will do its best to provide assistance. Advisor Ogura has specially returned to Japan to consult with the Japanese government and public, and I expect that there will be good and clear results after he returns to China soon. The recent cabinet reshuffle in Thailand is to strengthen cooperation in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. The new Prime Minister has a deep understanding of Greater East Asia, which is a great blessing for Thailand.

### Method for Moving Registered Rice in the Future: Report to the Economic Security Office for Verification

In order to understand the quantity of rice stored in Shanghai, the Shanghai Commodity Distribution Office conducted a city-wide rice storage registration, which ended yesterday morning. When the Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter with the relevant authorities yesterday, it was said that after the rice storage registration is terminated, rice shipped from outside the city to the city in the future should still be registered with the Commodity Distribution Office in accordance with regulations, and the office will then notify the Economic Security Office for verification. As for registered rice, if it needs to be moved, the buyer should report the facts to the Economic Security Office within three days, and the office will list them weekly and notify the Commodity Distribution Office for verification. If rice is stored in warehouses designated by the Municipal Government and needs to be moved out of the warehouse, a removal certificate should still be obtained from the Commodity Distribution Office as usual before it can be moved, in order to prevent abuses.

### Baojia Expenses to be Collected Regularly

In view of the unification of Baojia administration in the city and in order to strengthen the close connection between the police and Baojia, the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau convened a joint meeting of Baojia personnel above the level of Lianbaozhang in each district at Xianyao Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM yesterday (10th). The meeting was presided over by Gu Zongwu, the director of the Baojia Office, and Goto, the director of the Special Higher Police, also attended. The meeting was attended by the Zonglianbaozhang and Lianbaozhang of Huangpu, Laoza, Xincheng, Jiangning, Putuo, Jing'an, Taishan, Changshu, Lujiawan, Huashan, Changning, Xinshijie and other districts, as well as Baojia committee members Wang Boyuan, Wang Lianfang, Zhou Qiankang, Shen Siliang, Yu Zhijing, Zhou Mengbai, Chen Fukang, Le Fenglin, Luo Youlan, etc., and Ding Zhuo, secretary of the office, Chen Jiufeng, section chief, Xiao Gang, etc., totaling hundreds of people. Director Gu, as chairman, clarified the purpose of convening the meeting, and put forward issues such as Baojia expenses, the waste metal collection movement, and improving the issuance of residence certificates, hoping to discuss them together and solicit high opinions. Finally, he gave detailed instructions on the system of Baojia. Then, Secretary Ding explained the unified fee collection form, including the Baojia fee-paying household list, the Baojia fee-paying household increase/decrease report, the Baojia arrears list, the Baojia arrears recovery list, the Baojia fee collection report, and the Baojia arrears increase/decrease report, item by item. After the Baojia personnel in each district expressed their opinions successively, they began to discuss the date for collecting unified Baojia fees and the date for collecting the waste metal movement. After discussion, it was resolved that the collection of Baojia expenses would begin on August 15, with a fee of 10 yuan for attached households, 30 yuan for regular households, and 50 yuan for store households, collected for both July and August. Those who are extremely poor may apply for exemption. The collection accounts of each district must be completed by the end of August. The waste metal collection movement will begin on September 1.

### Exhibition of "Refugee" Paintings Extended

The Jiang Zhaohe painting exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, Jiyi Society, and Shen Bao, etc., was held at the China Painting Institute on Jing'an Temple Road and was originally scheduled to end yesterday. However, because one of the works, "Refugee," is nine feet high and more than seventy feet long, vividly depicting the plight of human displacement, and won the sympathy of the audience, various circles have sent letters requesting an extension.

Reader Scholarship News

### One is Delighted, One is Resentful: Same Enthusiasm, Opposite Results

The list of students approved for scholarships this year, for elementary and junior high schools, was published on page four of this newspaper yesterday. This piece of paper with black ink is not major international news, nor is it a novel social event. It is just a dull list, lacking the value of close reading, nor will it arouse the reading interest of the general public. However, we firmly believe that at least 5,000 people or more, with extremely enthusiastic emotions and extremely tense heartstrings, will carefully read it from beginning to end, word for word, and even read it several times. At least 10,000 people or more, with the same mood, will carefully listen with their eyes open and ears pricked up. As a result, more than 2,000 people who read the list will see their names and a burst of involuntary joy will appear in their hearts. More than 5,000 people who listen carefully will hear the names of their children and will reveal a comforting excitement. This group of people is the students who applied for and were approved for scholarships and their families.

At the same time, at least more than 2,000 people will not see their names, and more than 5,000 people will not hear the names of their children, and they will feel pain, resentment, and tears. This group of people is the students who applied for scholarships and were not approved and their families. However, most of the students in these more than 2,000 students are also excellent in their academic performance. Therefore, those who were not selected were not because they did not meet the "poor and excellent" standard, but entirely because the amount of scholarship money we received was insufficient for distribution. Regarding this point, our sad mood is no less than that of the students who were not selected.

Now, our only hope is to request that you, the readers, especially the wealthy merchants, display a good intention, donate some money, and we can successively allocate aid to the students who were not approved. We are leaving space to publicize the benevolent spirit of the donating gentlemen, so that the society can admire them.

In order to facilitate the investigation and verification of various primary and secondary schools, 600 copies of the approved student list have been printed. If schools need to request them, please use a note with a stamp and request them from the social service department of this newspaper.

Yuan Tai Company Generously Donates a Large Sum Yuan Tai Industrial Company Electrical Department generously donated 50,000 yuan yesterday, showing great enthusiasm for helping students, which is extremely admirable. The letter is recorded as follows: "To the Editor, since your newspaper has been handling scholarships, enthusiastic people in the society have responded and donated large sums to establish a great cause of cultivating talents, so that the outstanding children of ordinary families who cannot afford to study can continue their studies, benefiting the poor and rescuing those who have dropped out of school, which is deeply admired. Now we enclose 50,000 yuan in national currency, which we donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Please accept it. Although it is a meager contribution, it is enough to fulfill the duty that citizens should do." Others, such as Xincheng, donating 30,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhu donating 30,000 yuan from his funeral expenses to the scholarship fund, are all worthy of admiration.

Thinking of the Source After Illness, Not Forgetting to Help Students

Chen Qixian, a student who has been assisted by this newspaper, wrote: "To the Editor, I have received scholarships from your newspaper twice, so that I can continue my studies and complete high school. Now, due to illness, I am temporarily resting. Feeling grateful, I would like to donate 500 yuan from my savings during my illness to your newspaper's scholarship fund to express my sincere gratitude. I hope you will accept it."
