### Japanese Submarine Attacks in Eastern Seas off Luzon Island in Coordination, Sinking Enemy Destroyer and Aircraft Carrier with Torpedoes

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy Americans suffered losses in the seas off Taiwan, they have been extremely cautious in their use of their mobile task force. When conducting air raids on the Philippines, they shortened the duration and adopted surprise attack tactics. On the 21st, taking advantage of the poor weather in the eastern sea off Luzon, they approached the Philippines again. Around 7:00 AM on the 25th, they launched air strikes on various locations on Luzon Island. Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Units immediately went to search and broke through the enemy's mobile task force fighter groups, delivering fierce bombing. They bombed and sank one enemy large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one large cruiser. Currently, the enemy American fleet has concentrated its forces into three groups, cruising the seas off Luzon. A certain Japanese submarine, responding to the aerial operations, also sailed out on the 25th to intercept. When the enemy had three aircraft carriers, one battleship, and several destroyers acting separately, the submarine launched four torpedoes, one of which sank a destroyer. The other three hit an enemy medium aircraft carrier, causing a massive explosion, presumed to have sunk it as well. After achieving its objective, the Japanese submarine observed the chaotic scene of enemy forces rescuing survivors.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The American mobile task force in the eastern sea off the Philippines has recently shifted from offense to defense. The types of aircraft on their carriers are mostly fighters for defense. This is because, since the naval battles in the Philippine Sea, they have been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Units and other air units, causing them to feel terror. According to the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 25th, since the naval battle in the sea off Taiwan, the total number of American aircraft carriers bombed and sunk has reached fifty-one. From this, one can see the extent of the heavy losses suffered by the enemy Americans. Furthermore, the number of American aircraft attacking Hudson Island has recently decreased sharply. On the 13th, the number of aircraft attacking various locations on the island was 500; on the 14th, about 400; on the 19th, the cumulative number was about 500; and on the 25th before noon, about 200, and in the afternoon, no more than a dozen. Judging from the sharp decrease in the number of attacking aircraft, one can also see the decline in the power of American aircraft carriers.

### Japanese Yasukuni Attack Squad Collides with Enemy Ships, Seizing Air Supremacy in Leyte Gulf

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Special Attack Unit (Yasukuni Unit) attacked enemy transport convoys in Leyte Gulf on the 26th, setting three large transport ships ablaze. The Yasukuni Unit consisted of three special attack aircraft piloted by Second Lieutenants Maru, Tanigawa, and Sergeant First Class Kinoshita. From 10:40 AM to 10:45 AM on the 26th, they crashed one aircraft each into two enemy large transport ships off Tacloban, causing severe damage and explosions. The other aircraft crashed into an enemy large transport ship north of Taguroban, setting it ablaze. The aircraft of the Yasukuni Unit, commanded by Muraoka, crashed into an enemy large ship south of Manicani Island, also inflicting severe damage and setting it ablaze.

Philippine Frontline Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The air war between Japan and the United States in the Philippines has reached its peak. The Japanese Air Force has been suppressing the airspace over the battlefield day and night, and has also been attacking enemy rear supply bases to accumulate combat power, planning a major counteroffensive. By the 22nd, the conditions for battle were ripe, and a fierce offensive was launched to annihilate the enemy air force. On the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, Japanese air units launched large-scale attacks on the enemy's supply base on Morotai Island, achieving brilliant results. It was reported that on the 22nd, 22 locations on the airfield caught fire, and 17 were destroyed. On the 23rd, three airfields were burned down and three were destroyed. On the 22nd and 23rd, 89 enemy aircraft were destroyed. On the 24th, seven enemy aircraft caught fire. At the same time, the Japanese ground forces on the island coordinated with the air force in fierce attacks, and commando units also became active. Recently, they received reinforcements, and their morale was further boosted, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and rendering several enemy airfields unusable. Another air unit also fiercely attacked enemy aircraft carriers in Leyte Gulf and enemy positions on the island, achieving the following results: (1) In Leyte Gulf, on the 22nd, one transport ship was sunk and one destroyer was destroyed. On the 23rd, one large transport ship and two landing craft were sunk. On the 24th, four transport ships were destroyed. (2) On Leyte Island, on the 24th, seven enemy airfields caught fire, one was destroyed, one anti-aircraft position caught fire, and one fuel depot caught fire. Another Japanese air unit, monitoring the movements of the enemy mobile task force, discovered three groups of mobile task forces in the eastern sea off Luzon Island on the morning of the 25th. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit immediately launched a daytime attack, sinking one large aircraft carrier and one large cruiser. The Japanese Special Attack Unit is continuing its fierce attacks, and the results are expected to expand. Due to the Japanese Air Force's preemptive attacks, the expansion of enemy air combat power has been significantly hampered. The Japanese military is gaining a more advantageous position in controlling the airspace around Leyte, which is crucial for the decisive battle in the Philippines.

### Japanese Kamikaze Aircraft "Kotoku Unit" Makes Heroic Crash Amidst the Rain

Philippine Frontline, 27th (Central News Agency) – Enemy carrier-based aircraft invaded the Manila area in several groups on the morning of the 25th. However, on that day, due to the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit's close combat against the enemy mobile task force in the eastern sea off Luzon Island, the enemy suffered a devastating blow. Their aircraft carriers were unable to accommodate their aircraft and fled eastward in panic. This preemptive attack force, the sixth formation of the Kotoku Unit, consisted of five men and five aircraft with six escort aircraft. The details of the heroic attack are described by Flight Petty Officer First Class Tenjo, the leader of the escort aircraft team, as follows: Shortly after the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit took off, it started to rain. They planned to land over a certain cape, but failed due to the bad weather. The aircraft bravely flew along the planned route. After flying for several hours, the weather gradually cleared. The three armed special attack aircraft flew safely. After a while, the commander's aircraft and other escort aircraft encountered an enemy giant aircraft, and the visibility was completely unclear. Suddenly, dozens of white wakes appeared on the sea surface to the left and front. The team discovered a group of powerful enemy mobile forces advancing southward. The formation was centered around two advanced aircraft carriers in the front and two medium-sized aircraft carriers in the rear, with four battleships and about six cruisers escorting them, and more than a dozen destroyers providing protection. After the Japanese attack aircraft identified their circular formation, they entered a charging stance. The enemy opened fire with all their ships. The sea surface below the Japanese aircraft was almost obscured by gunpowder smoke. The Japanese lead aircraft and the second aircraft broke through the barrage of bullets and smoke and advanced bravely. Then, the third aircraft also broke through. A large pillar of fire erupted from the center of the large aircraft carrier on the left, and the entire ship was surrounded by thick black smoke. Another large pillar of fire erupted from the enemy aircraft carrier, indicating the second hit. The enemy large standard aircraft carrier, slightly larger than an enemy battleship and weighing 45,000 tons, was also seen on the sea surface after this second explosion. At the same time that the enemy large aircraft carrier caught fire, a towering flame erupted from the enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier on the right. This was likely the result of the third aircraft's hit. After the enemy ship caught fire, it tilted and sailed for a short time before disappearing into the sea. At this time, the enemy ship formation also gradually became chaotic. When the Japanese aircraft wanted to turn around and return to base, they saw that one of the enemy large cruisers on the right was surrounded by flames. After confirming the results achieved by their comrades, they safely returned to base.

Japanese Base in the Philippines, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Unit intercepted the enemy mobile task force attacking the northeastern part of the Philippines in the eastern sea off Luzon Island on the morning of the 25th, launching a do-or-die attack, sinking one large and one small aircraft carrier and one cruiser. This great achievement was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 26th. It has since been further determined that one more enemy large aircraft carrier was destroyed, expanding the results of the battle, and more details of the battle have also been clarified. On that day, the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Unit, equipped with bombing devices on the new "Comet" bombers and the new "Galaxy" fighters, enthusiastically departed from the base. When they reached the airspace above the enemy mobile task force, they respectively eliminated the interference of enemy aircraft and crashed into the enemy medium aircraft carriers and one cruiser, which were bombed and sunk by two Japanese aircraft. One enemy aircraft carrier was also hit and destroyed by one Japanese aircraft. The Japanese air unit also participated in this operation in addition to the special attack unit. As for the damage suffered by the Japanese side, it was later determined that in addition to the aircraft that made the hits, another sixteen aircraft did not return to base.

### President Chen Cables Thanks to Prime Minister Koiso

Nanjing, 27th (Central Military) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso sent a telegram to President Chen of our Executive Yuan to express his deep condolences in memory of the late Chairman Wang's virtues and achievements. President Chen has cabled back expressing his gratitude.

### A Second Discussion on the Spirit of Kamikaze

I remember the world-renowned strategist Clausewitz saying: "Spirit is more important than matter." This means that relying solely on material resources without the spirit to promote their strengths will not lead to ultimate victory. In other words, spirit can compensate for material shortcomings.

War is a severe test of a country's strength and a nation's spirit. A nation's spiritual performance is related to the victory or defeat of the war. A country's strength can be explored for its secrets by various means before and during the war, but a nation's spirit cannot be estimated. Therefore, Clausewitz said of the factors estimating the victory or defeat of war: "Of the four factors, the social factor is the most difficult." What is the social factor? It is the spirit of a nation.

A spirit cannot be cultivated by last-minute efforts, nor can it be expressed casually. The allied nations made long-term preparations for launching the Greater East Asia War. After the enemy Americans invaded Taiwan and the Philippines, the Japanese Air Force, based on the principle of "one man, one plane, one ship," organized the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, creating unprecedented tactics and building immortal achievements. This tactic and this achievement have now become the general model of the spiritual of the one billion people of Greater East Asia, known as the "Spirit of Kamikaze."

The birth of the Kamikaze Unit dates back 670 years ago. When the Yuan army came to attack Japan from Mongolia, a sudden storm blew the Yuan Dynasty's ships into the sea. Of the 100,000 Yuan soldiers, only three survived. Therefore, Japan named it "Kamikaze" (Divine Wind). This kind of operation achieves ultimate victory with a small number of troops against a large number of troops. The Kamikaze in this Greater East Asia War is the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit. After the unit departs, it does not intend to return alive, but fiercely destroys the enemy, promoting its Kamikaze spirit and destroying enemy ships.

From this, we can understand that the Spirit of Kamikaze originated very early. Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said: "At the very least, it can be said that the Kume, Mononobe, and other tribes who served Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition all promoted this kind of Kamikaze spirit and became the founding heroes of the country." The Japanese nation can maintain the traditional national spirit of the past, and when the fate of the country is at stake, express it in the most obvious way before the British and American enemies, leaving the enemy at a loss beyond surprise, fear, and admiration. We cannot take this human-guided V-1 weapon lightly.

Secondly, the belief in certain death is the highest expression of the Spirit of Kamikaze. We cannot regard it as "a fool's courage" or a desperate act. Even if it is, someone must be willing to die. Being willing to die is not an ordinary act. Moreover, how can a team after team rush into enemy ships with people and planes? At a critical moment, putting personal life and death aside and sacrificing for the country is by no means the righteousness of a few people. The entire people must have the determination to "serve the country with utmost loyalty" to do so. I remember there was such a poem: "Life is precious, love is even more valuable, but for the sake of freedom, both can be abandoned." The content of the Spirit of Kamikaze is for the sake of freedom.

We tirelessly discuss this spirit because we need this spirit to save the crisis of our nation and country. Decades of education have completely failed. Politics are not on track, and social morals have declined. Isn't this because some people in high positions and the intellectuals who are the backbone of society have first lost the concept of the country and the idea of the nation? Even if the environment is difficult, one cannot abandon one's national duty and stand by idly; moreover, one cannot have the mentality of "fishing in troubled waters" and plunge the country's vitality into an irrecoverable situation. We hope that every compatriot will recognize the crisis of the nation and urgently seek a way to revive it. Therefore, we discuss the Spirit of Kamikaze again, and this is the purpose.

Finally, the Spirit of Kamikaze has laid the foundation for the certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War on the front lines. We should promote the Spirit of Kamikaze in the rear, especially in the Chinese rear, to make the relationship between China and Japan more cordial and more rational, contribute all our efforts, and achieve final victory.

### Japanese Elite Troops Break into Guizhou Province

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 27th: (1) After the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, Japanese troops continued to pursue the Chongqing army. On November 24th, they captured Nanning, the last remaining US Air Force base in Guangxi Province. Another unit of Japanese troops broke through Limingguan, a key point in southern Guizhou Province, on the same day and entered Guizhou Province. (2) Since the start of the offensive operations in Guilin and Liuzhou by the Japanese troops in the China theater in early September until mid-November, when they occupied the area, the overall battle results obtained were as follows: The Chongqing army suffered approximately 39,000 bodies of soldiers recovered by the Japanese army, and approximately 18,200 prisoners were taken. On the ground, 77 Chongqing-US aircraft were shot down (23 of which were unconfirmed). Seized were 411 artillery pieces of various types, 1,245 light and heavy machine guns, approximately 17,000 rifles, 18 aircraft, 108 locomotives, 916 railway passenger and freight cars, 62 automobiles and tanks, and a large number of other weapons, ammunition, grain, and aircraft parts. The Japanese side suffered approximately 4,500 deaths.

Guangxi Frontline, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese elite troops successively occupied Sien and Hechi and fiercely pursued the main force of the Chongqing Fourth War Area. The Japanese troops in the Sien area arrived near Limingguan, a key point on the border between Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces, 10 kilometers southeast of the town, on the morning of the 24th and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing 20th Army. On the morning of the 25th, they quickly broke into Guizhou Province.

Chinese Frontline Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since occupying Quanzhou on September 14th, Japanese troops on the China front have continued to launch a major offensive in Hunan and Guangxi, successively occupying major Chongqing army strongholds such as Liuzhou and Guilin, and are still expanding their battle results. Since the capture of Quanzhou until November 24th, extremely large battle results have been obtained. Among the extraordinary circumstances, the Chongqing army abandoned over 12,500 bodies, while the number of prisoners reached over 16,000. Compared to the battle results from the capture of Changyang to before the occupation of Quanzhou, with over 11,300 bodies and 1,500 prisoners, the number of prisoners has increased more than tenfold. This proves that the Chongqing army's will to fight has gradually decreased. From the capture of Quanzhou to the battle results of November 4th, the Chongqing army abandoned 12,500 bodies, 16,100 were captured, and the seized items included 293 artillery pieces of various types (including 13 rocket launchers), 834 heavy and light machine guns, 5,944 rifles, one aircraft, 40 tanks and automobiles, 84 locomotives, and 629 freight and passenger cars.

### Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Kunming Airport

Mainland Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force, taking advantage of the moonlight, launched an air raid on Kunming, the largest base in the southwest of Chongqing, on the night of the 24th. After a fierce bombing, twelve locations caught fire, and many aircraft on the ground were destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Kunming Airport is not only the largest base on the Chinese side of the China-India air route, but also a major reception base for the Chongqing-US Air Force retreating from Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning. Its military value has also increased accordingly, and it has recently shown unusual activity. When the air force bombed the area that day, it also saw hundreds of large and small aircraft parked wing-to-wing near the runway. Under the shining signals, the entire appearance of the base was fully visible, so the battle results were extremely large.

A certain base on the South China Front, 27th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese troops broke into Nanning, they occupied the Nanning Airport, the last Guangxi base of the Chongqing-US Air Force. The airport is located approximately 30 kilometers northeast of Nanning. The Chongqing-US forces, fearing a fierce attack by the Japanese troops, and with Nanning in danger, began to retreat at 2:00 PM on the 19th, destroying the north-south auxiliary runways and affiliated facilities. However, its main runway was spared from destruction and is still usable.

### Japanese Ambassador to India: Selection in Progress

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has decided that the envoy to be stationed in the Provisional Government of India must be of ambassadorial rank and a seasoned diplomat familiar with the situation in Southeast Asia. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently carefully weighing candidates, and a formal announcement may be made before Chairman Bose leaves Japan.

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government's dispatch of diplomatic representatives to the Provisional Government of Free India is a manifestation of Japan's sincerity in cooperating with various countries to build Greater East Asia, which has deeply moved the Burmese and Indian people living abroad. The Minister of Propaganda of the Provisional Government of India issued a statement on the 26th as follows: "The decision of the Tan government and the Provisional Government of Free India to exchange representatives will strengthen the cooperative and friendly relations between the two governments. The Provisional Government of Free India's efforts in the war are becoming increasingly significant, and its cooperation with the Japanese government is becoming closer."

### Enemy Aircraft Air Raid Kanto and Other Areas in Japan Yesterday Afternoon: Important Facilities Not Damaged

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 27th: Approximately 40 enemy B-29 aircraft scattered and attacked Kanto, Tokaido, and the southern Kinai regions around 1:00 PM on the 27th, carrying out indiscriminate bombing from above the clouds. However, the damage to the Japanese side was slight, and important facilities were not damaged.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Although the enemy B-29 fleet from the Mariana base was attacked by Japanese air units on the night of the 26th, causing heavy damage to the Saipan airfield, an important base, approximately 40 B-29 aircraft again attacked the Japanese mainland on the 27th, conducting indiscriminate bombing. On this day, the enemy aircraft split into several groups, infiltrated the Kanto, Tokaido, and southern Kinai suburbs of Japan at high altitude, and randomly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs from above the clouds, with the sole purpose of achieving the effect of psychological warfare. However, important Japanese facilities were not damaged in any way, and only some civilians and public buildings suffered minor damage. Bombs were also dropped on shrines and schools in Tokyo. Some enemy aircraft infiltrated the Kinai region, but did not fly near important areas such as Osaka and Kobe, but randomly dropped bombs on the southern mountainous areas and in the sea. The Japanese side suffered no losses. The Japanese Air Defense Force immediately dispatched to intercept, but its actions were somewhat limited due to the bad weather, and the results of the battle are unclear. There was also no damage in the Tokaido region.

### Japanese Forces in Leyte Launch Fierce Offensive to Annihilate Enemy; Japanese Forces Launch Night Raid on West Coast of Samar Island

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Five hundred enemy troops in the Managanas area of Leyte Island, supplied with food by transport planes, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines by passing through the cold forests. They were met with a fierce attack by the Japanese army, and an annihilation battle is now underway.

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Southwest of Carigara on Leyte Island, Japanese defenders bravely resisted under intense enemy artillery fire. From the 12th to the 17th, they killed many enemies and repelled an enemy unit. In the Tagami area, the enemy launched an offensive on the 16th, only to be ambushed by Japanese forces, resulting in 103 enemy deaths.

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces in the Samar Island area (north of Leyte Island), in response to the Japanese forces on Leyte Island, have been fiercely attacking the enemy entering and exiting Binabankepta (east of the Macqueda Bay) on the west coast of Samar Island since the 11th of this month. On the 14th, Japanese forces boldly launched a night raid, killing as many as fifty enemies, causing great shock to the enemy. Currently, the enemy is only maintaining the Calbiga position and has lost the intention of actively attacking. It also appears that the enemy on the east coast has no intention of attacking.

Tokyo's Air Defense System Surpasses That of Global Cities

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Office of War Information issued a statement on the 26th, stating that air raids on Tokyo are among the most difficult tasks. Citizens should not be overjoyed upon receiving news of air raids on Tokyo. The gist of the statement is as follows: It is completely wrong to assume that Tokyo is entirely composed of wooden houses and can be completely reduced to ashes by incendiary bombs. According to reports from the Army, Tokyo's fire prevention organization is extremely sound and has an air defense system that surpasses major cities around the world. Not only are high-angle gun positions densely distributed throughout Tokyo, but the city is also surrounded by secret airfields. Tokyo, like Berlin and Cologne, possesses strong defensive capabilities. Fire poses the greatest threat to the Japanese people, so the fire prevention organization is extremely sound. Especially after the Great Earthquake, Tokyo's new urban roads are extremely wide, which will enhance fire prevention effectiveness. Furthermore, Japan has had ample time to study the details of the bombings of Germany, so Tokyo is fully prepared both materially and spiritually for large-scale bombing.

Commander of U.S. Bomber Squadron Admits Air Raids Are Difficult

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to an Associated Press dispatch from a Saipan base, Hansell, commander of the U.S. 21st Bomber Squadron, stated on the 15th regarding the actual situation of the air raids on Tokyo and the downing of a B-29 aircraft: Near the Japanese mainland, a Japanese fighter plane approached the tail of a B-29 aircraft. The B-29 gunner immediately fired machine guns and cannons, and other U.S. aircraft also launched a fierce attack on the Japanese plane. At that time, the gunner of the Japanese plane suddenly stopped firing, apparently hit and injured. The Japanese plane then rammed into the B-29, causing its tail to shatter and fall into the sea. This time, we were not able to safely achieve our objectives beyond satisfying ourselves with the air raid on Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that the future will become even more difficult.

China News Association Sends Telegram of Respect to Acting Chairman Chen

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The China News Association recently sent a telegram to Acting Chairman Chen, saying, "Respectfully to Chen Junjian, Acting Chairman of the National Government: Our association believes that as a founding member of the Party and the nation, you are succeeding to the central leadership, which is what the public expects, and we are overjoyed. This association sincerely expresses its loyalty and will emulate the stars orbiting the North Star, wholeheartedly support you, respectfully send this telegram, and hope you will accept it." The China News Association bows.

### Chairman Chen Convenes Political Training Personnel for Instructions; Military, Political, and Party Affairs Should Be Unified

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chen convened political training officers from various troops and military organs at 9:00 AM on the 27th in the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission, delivering instructions. After elaborating on the importance of political training work, he pointed out that due to the great responsibility of political training personnel, it is especially necessary to improve their quality.

Finally, he encouraged everyone to work together and intensify their efforts to advance political training work and achieve the mission of defending the nation and securing the people. All those who received instructions were extremely inspired.

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – Local military and political leaders from all provinces and cities, who previously came to Nanjing to attend the funeral of the late Chairman Wang, the National Military and Political Conference, and the Provisional Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, have arrived in Nanjing one after another weeks ago. Now that their official duties in Nanjing have been completed, they left Nanjing yesterday and today to return to their posts.

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission, because political training officers from various troops are coming to Nanjing to attend the National Military and Political Conference, Director Zhou convened a discussion meeting in the auditorium of the department at 3:00 PM on the 27th. Various issues regarding strengthening political training work were discussed in great detail.

### Allied Friends Sympathize With Declaration of Central Executive Committee

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee held a provisional plenary session a few days ago due to the passing of Chairman Wang, issuing a declaration stating that it would inherit the late Chairman Wang's legacy and continue its efforts. All parties at home and abroad attach great importance to this. Allied friends in China generally believe that the Kuomintang is the sole leader of the Chinese National Revolution and the central pillar for promoting Chinese political power. Therefore, they have always had great expectations for the Kuomintang's activities, and they expressed full resonance with this declaration. On the 27th, reporters interviewed influential figures in the Japanese community in the capital to inquire about their impressions. The following is a summary of what various parties said:

In this declaration, the Kuomintang has clearly indicated that overall peace has not yet been achieved, and all Party comrades are determined to inherit the late Chairman Wang's legacy and strive to promote national unification. It also points out that China is now divided into Nanjing and Chongqing, with the former cooperating with Japan and the latter colluding with Britain and the United States, creating mutual opposition. In this connection, we often recall National Father Sun's speech to the Japanese people in Kobe. In that speech, Mr. Sun explained Pan-Asianism and also stated that without Japan, there would be no China, and if China perishes, Japan will also perish, thus establishing the theory of Chinese and Japanese compatriots.

In his speech, National Father also stated that China must form a spiritual union with Japan, like brothers helping each other, and an economic collaboration with Japan. National Father's policy was to make China and Japan the center of Asia and to cooperate with the United States to develop the economy. However, Chongqing's continued policy of resisting Japan has created the unfortunate situation of Nanjing cooperating with Japan and Chongqing colluding with the United States.

We hope that Chinese people in both peaceful and war-torn regions will further reflect on the true meaning of National Father's Sino-Japanese and Sino-American cooperation. Using American material cooperation to resist Japan is causing the country to be divided and deteriorating. This is not only harmful to the people, but also makes National Father's spirit in heaven uneasy. When National Father gave his speech in Kobe, he temporarily adopted a policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists, while spiritually uniting with Japan, hoping to restore Asia and maintain world peace.

Chongqing's collusion with the Communist Party for the sake of resisting Japan superficially imitates National Father's policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists, but in reality, it obliterates its own conscience and engages in sophistry. National Father adopted the policy of tolerance of the Communists in order to realize the Chinese Revolution, but Chiang Kai-shek himself liquidated this policy after the success of the Northern Expedition. Now, Chongqing is cooperating with the Communists for the sake of resisting Japan, but this has no effect on the resistance war and instead promotes Chongqing's own weakening.

This time, due to American intervention, Chongqing's internal reorganization has become chaotic, especially the core forces of the Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu CC clique, which have also been attacked by the Communist Party. Therefore, the US government's support for the Communist Party to drive out Chen Lifu and others has been successful. US-Communist cooperation has forced Chongqing to submit. Considering the above facts and reviewing the declaration of the Kuomintang's provisional plenary session, it is expected that it will prompt Chongqing to fully reflect. The two major policies that the late Chairman Wang failed to realize – national peace and unification and anti-communism – are essential issues that China must resolve. The Kuomintang has already expressed its clear attitude on this, and we cannot help but deeply sympathize with it.

### German "Ghost Division" Repeatedly Achieves Military Successes on the Western Front; American Tank Units Invade Saar Region

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Military news: The famous "Ghost Division" led by General Weitersheim has achieved another victory in the southern sector of the Western Front. The division has destroyed 169 American tanks and armored vehicles and captured 16,000 prisoners in ten days.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Military news: A powerful American tank column on the northern flank of the Lorraine battle has penetrated further into the Saar region.

### Soviet Forces Besiege Hatvan; German Forces Withdraw From Hatvan

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Soviet forces are now increasing pressure on the east bank of the Danube River. In addition to advancing on Budapest from the east, north, and south, the Soviet forces are now attempting to reach the city from the west, and the threat to western Hungary is becoming increasingly apparent. The battle for the Danube bridgehead is intensifying, with Soviet forces sending reinforcements to cross the Danube River. The battle has now extended to the area north of the Trave River estuary. The Soviet advance has been stopped southeast of Bodulje, where control of the area has changed hands several times. A major battle for Hatvan has broken out east of Budapest. Hatvan is located midway between Budapest and Eger. German forces were ordered to withdraw from the ruins of the city in the evening, occupying a shorter line of defense west of the city.

### Kamikaze Spirit

— Tokutomi Sohō

The kamikaze spirit does not mean waiting with folded hands for the divine wind to blow. It means becoming the kamikaze oneself, or a part of the kamikaze, blowing the enemy away in a chaotic mess, scattering them, and making them disappear without a trace. In other words, the kamikaze special attack units that are working day and night in the Philippine Islands are the true living examples.

Even now, some people are still talking侃侃and談 about whether the kamikaze will come to save them or not, and there are still people debating whether or not to pray for the kamikaze. But this kind of talk is a waste of energy. Of course, the kamikaze will definitely blow, and we should pray for the kamikaze to blow. But the prerequisite is to always be the head of the kamikaze, or a part of the kamikaze, and complete the kamikaze's mission. This was exactly the case when the Mongols invaded. Later, many national crises were also handled in this way. That is to say: If you pray for the protection of the gods, as long as you do your best, your wishes will definitely be fulfilled. Before the gods protect you, if you want the gods to protect you, the first and most important condition is to do your best. Therefore, our prayers should not be empty words, but practical prayers. Therefore, the actions of the kamikaze special attack units can actually be said to be a great prayer to the gods. In this sense, I humbly represent one hundred million citizens in expressing my greatest gratitude to our special attack units.

Kamikaze Group and Kamikaze Spirit

About seventy years ago, there was a kamikaze group in Higo, Kumamoto. They intended to express a major protest against the situation at the time; and to fulfill their aspiration of revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians, resulting in a major incident: almost 99% of the two hundred people sacrificed themselves for their beliefs. At the time, social figures, if not all, but the majority, criticized them for being stubborn and inflexible. However, even if we don't talk about their actions, their spirit is admired by everyone today. Tracing back to the source, they are the ancestors of the Greater East Asia Holy War. From this point of view, rather than regarding them as outdated and failing (it would be better to say that they failed because they were too far ahead. This is definitely not a far-fetched argument). I am specifically mentioning them because I believe that they are the embodiment of the actual kamikaze spirit.

The Kamikaze Spirit Originated in the Age of Gods

Perhaps some people think that this kamikaze spirit was fostered by the samurai code of conduct, but the truth is not so. The so-called samurai code of conduct is nothing more than a product of the feudal era, with the purpose of making vassal samurai devote their loyalty to feudal lords. Therefore, loyalty and righteousness are actions towards the masters who take care of them, and they often abused many great-sounding titles. Among those who originally promoted the samurai code of conduct, there were Yamaga Sokō in the past and Yoshida Shōin later. The samurai code of conduct that these two gentlemen spoke of was indeed as clear as daylight and full of righteousness. Ultimately, it was addressed to the Emperor. Other samurai code of conduct theorists opposed this point. In short, this kamikaze spirit is not a product of the feudal era, nor is it a product of the Warring States period, but it occurred at the same time as the imperial country, so it can be said that it originated in the age of gods. At the very least, it can be said that Hisae, Mononobe, and other tribes who served Emperor Jimmu during his eastward expedition all promoted this kamikaze spirit and became meritorious founders of the nation. Therefore, rather than simply saying that the samurai, a single class, excluding the farmers, artisans, and merchants, supported the imperial country and promoted its power overseas, it would be better to say that the kamikaze spirit supported the imperial country and promoted the power of the Japanese emperor overseas.

The courage of the Yamato race is known to all who know the Yamato race. It's just that the origins of this courage are vague, and people only know that the Japanese people are brave people, but they neglect to trace back to the source. To talk about the kamikaze spirit, one must talk about the way of the imperial people. To talk about the way of the imperial people, one must talk about the bravery of the imperial people. To talk about the bravery of the imperial people, one must talk about the loyalty of the imperial people. The Japanese people were not originally brave like wild beasts. They were single-mindedly loyal to the imperial family, and thus the kamikaze spirit arose. It is the spirit of "even if there are no enemy arrows in front, there must be no enemy arrows in the back," the spirit of "there are drowned corpses in the sea, and there are abandoned corpses in the mountains, but one can only die by the side of the great lord," which is all a natural outflow of single-minded loyalty to the imperial successor. Courage has many different kinds. There is courageousness of desire, courageousness of greed, courageousness of violence, courageousness of hypocrisy, courageousness of wilderness, etc. But the courage of the Japanese people is loyal courage. That is to say, it is the courage to be loyal to the supreme and not be afraid to die. In this sense, those who followed Emperor Jimmu on his eastward expedition and died in battle at Kongosa-zaka, Kusunoki Masashige who sang the red sincerity of repaying the country seven times at Minatogawa, Colonel Hashinaka during the Russo-Japanese War, Lieutenant Commander Hirose during the blockade operation, and all the hard-working and meritorious people of the army and navy during the recent Greater East Asia War are all closely related, spiritually connected, and inherit the excellent traditions of three thousand years.

The Difference Between Divine Courage and Bestial Courage

We also know that the enemy country also has considerable courage. Today's enemies are not weaklings who lose their souls and turn their heads at the sight of a bow in a cup or soldiers in the grass. Among them, there are also those who are brave like striking tigers and wading across rivers. But their courage is adventurous, opportunistic, conquering, curious, and gambling. For example, jumping off the world-famous Niagara Falls or climbing a skyscraper in New York to the top, or hunting tigers and lions for a reward of tens of thousands of US dollars. Comparing it to the pure loyalty and pure sincerity of our Japanese kamikaze spirit, the single-minded devotion to loyalty and righteousness that is worthy of heaven and earth and the gods, it is truly inferior and cannot be compared. We cannot say that the enemy is as timid as the wind. It's just that their courage lies in the thought of gains and losses, while our kamikaze spirit is not only different from them in degree or quantity, but also in essence. In short, the courage of the enemy, the United States, is bestial, while the courage of us Japanese is divine.

The Greater East Asia War and the Kamikaze Spirit

In the past, when Emperor Meiji passed away, The Times of London predicted: "Japan is about to decline!" Many Japanese people also thought so. At the same time, from the end of the Taisho era to the beginning of the Showa era, signs of this hidden concern even appeared. However, since the September 18th Incident in Showa 6 (1931), which expanded to the July 7th Incident in Showa 12 (1937), and further expanded to the Greater East Asia War in Showa 16 (1941), until today, the above-mentioned hidden concerns have been completely eliminated. I was born in the era of Emperor Komei, and in the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras, I have always paid attention to the changes in Japan's national prestige and world fortune as a journalist. During the Sino-Japanese War of Meiji 27 and 28 (1895-96) and the Russo-Japanese War of Meiji 37 and 38 (1905-06), I carried a pen either among the soldiers or near the senior officials who were strategizing. Even now, I still hope to repay the nation in any small way, despite my old age and hardship. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from looking at the three generations is that the kamikaze spirit has never reached the climax it has today. In the past, the organization of suicide squads was by no means small in number. The Drawn Sword Squad in the Ten Year War was also a suicide squad. The White Sash Squad of Iwo Jima was also a suicide squad. The two blockade operations were also all suicide squads. However, there has never been a suicide squad that started like this and was promoted like the Greater East Asia War. Especially with the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, it is no longer a suicide squad, but a "must-die" squad. They do not care about the approach of death, but advance towards death. The German new weapon, the V-1, does not require anyone to pilot it and flies to enemy territory, but our Japanese kamikaze special attack unit is a person themselves and a bomb together, or it can be said that the person themselves is the bomb, and rushes towards the enemy. Throughout history, in the history of world warfare, such a heroic fact of not fearing sacrifice is probably only something that the Japanese can do, and only the Japanese of today can do. The phrase "only now" refers to the past, as for how this kamikaze spirit will develop in the future, it is impossible to predict. I want to say one thing in particular, that the heroic sacrifice of this kamikaze special attack unit is not simply limited to a part of the imperial army, but the entire imperial army (both the army and the navy) is like this. The sacrifice of Captain Seki in the Philippines the other day, and the recent sacrifice of Lieutenant Commander Abe in the sea off the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean, and the sacrifice of Major General Honma in the sea east of the Philippines, are all of the same spirit. These kinds of facts are countless since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

The Kamikaze Spirit Also Exists Domestically

Of course, we not only hope that the imperial army has this kamikaze spirit, but we also hope that our one hundred million Japanese people have this spirit. Especially those who are closely related to the front line in military production. We also hope that the cadres who produce soldiers, like the officers and soldiers on the front line, will use this kamikaze spirit to encourage them and record them in the biography of heroes. In other words, do not let the officers and soldiers on the front line die in vain, but abandon all thoughts of gain and loss, and quickly make up for the quality and quantity of aircraft and ships required by the production front line. In short, in order to provide sufficient supplies, we can only work hard with one heart and one mind, vowing to die, with the kamikaze spirit. At the same time, I hope that the authorities will also do so. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, November 6)

### Secretary of State Hull Retires Due to Old Age

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Washington officials announced that U.S. Secretary of State Hull, age 73, has resigned due to health reasons. Hull was appointed Secretary of State in February 1933, after Roosevelt was elected as the first president. During Roosevelt's first term, Hull promoted a diplomatic policy of promoting economic and political cooperation in the Americas. When Roosevelt was elected as the second president, Hull continued in his original position. At this time, the United States' posture of hegemony in the Americas became more obvious. The United States' abandonment of its isolation policy towards Europe also began with Hull, namely the exchange of U.S. armaments for British naval bases before the war. During Roosevelt's second term, Hull also engaged in making the United States involved in the war against Germany from the beginning to the end. Therefore, Hull's resignation is indeed a loss of a closest subordinate for Roosevelt.

General Wilson will be relieved of his position as Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region, and General Alexander will succeed him. Alexander has been promoted to marshal since the fall of Rome, which was also announced at the same time.

### Minister Matsudaira Reveals: America's Ambition to Dominate Has Already Provoked Dissatisfaction from Britain and the Soviet Union

Yesterday, the 27th, at 2:30 PM, Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, speaking at a regular press conference, commented on the ambition of U.S. President Roosevelt to dominate the world, as revealed by the British Daily Mail, as follows: "According to a Washington dispatch in the British Daily Mail on the 15th of this month, reporter Don Iddon revealed President Roosevelt's intention to become the world's president, which has aroused criticism from British public opinion and pointed out three aspects of Roosevelt's ambition: first, to build the world's most powerful fleet; second, to dominate the world's largest merchant fleet; and third, to control civilian aviation worldwide. President Roosevelt, before entering the war, transferred fifty destroyers to Britain, intending to seize the British colonies of Baa-Newton and Newfoundland as bases, which he successfully did. Subsequently, he deployed troops to Iceland and occupied it as a military base. After entering the war, the United States built land, sea, and air bases on all British colonies. In the second half of last year, the U.S. Senate also organized a delegation to Europe and the Near East to investigate the American shipping industry. After three months, the delegation leader, Lee Lutherer, submitted a comprehensive report recommending three points: (1) The United States should secure permanent usage rights for the airfields it has built in various foreign locations; (2) The United States should have equal rights with Britain regarding international transportation lines; and (3) The oil issue should be further studied. A portion of the oil supplied by the United States should be charged to Britain. After the report was submitted, it criticized the poor British foreign policy and suggested that it should be changed, while also emphasizing the need to protect American power. On the 1st of this month, the International Aviation Conference held in Chicago was aimed at the United States demanding free usage rights for aviation bases overseas. In other words, the United States directly sought to control global air routes. Before the conference even opened, it had already aroused considerable dissatisfaction, and it was widely predicted that the aviation conference would not be successful. The next day, the Soviet representative refused to participate, and the British representative expressed opposition to the demands made by the United States. As a result, the two sides were deadlocked in the conference and failed to reach any effective agreement. Later, the British representative yielded and recognized the American demands: (1) The United States could use British territories, especially aviation bases in British colonies in the Americas; (2) It was recognized that South America and the Chongqing area would be within the sphere of American aviation influence. However, the conference proceedings already exposed deep rifts between Britain and the United States, demonstrating the increasing overtness of America's ambitions. Now, British newspapers are exposing Roosevelt's ambitions and warning the British people, urging them to closely monitor America's future aspirations. The Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the free use of air routes proposed by the United States is due to the fact that no country is allowed to fly freely back and forth over Soviet territory."

### This Period's Ration Rice to be Sold Soon

### Ancient Porcelain Exhibition: Last Three Days

Our nation's culture and art originated the earliest. For thousands of years, cultural relics have been brilliant, not only as the embodiment of our national spirit but also as the cornerstone of world cultural evolution. The China Art Museum, based on this principle, has been displaying famous porcelain from various dynasties during its opening period for public viewing. The number of visitors has been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. Individuals such as German Ambassador Wörmann, Consul General Fischer and his wife, as well as numerous middle schools such as Zhonghua, Minguo, Guoqiang, Wuguang, Qingnianhui, Zhonghua, and Guangcheng, have visited, totaling no less than several thousand people. The grand occasion is unprecedented, demonstrating that a love for antiquity is shared by both Chinese and foreigners. Various sectors have praised this exhibition highly. The serene and lofty elegance of the Song and Yuan porcelains, the antique charm of the Ming porcelains, and the dazzling magnificence of the Qing porcelains each represent the artistic spirit of their respective eras and deserve great attention from all parties. This is a unique opportunity to appreciate ancient art. According to the museum, this exhibition of rare treasures is being systematically and meaningfully displayed. Aside from our country's participation in the London Chinese Art Exhibition, this porcelain exhibition can be considered an unprecedented grand event. Do not miss this opportunity.

### Mourning Touyama Mitsuru

— Ren Yuandao

Mr. Touyama Mitsuru, a patriot of our allied nation, passed away from illness on the 4th of last month at his villa in Gotemba. The news of his death fills us with shock and grief. Mr. Touyama's passing is a great loss, and our thoughts and memories of him will not cease. Mr. Touyama was a leader of the Japanese nationalist movement and a powerful figure outside the government. Early in his career, he founded the Genyosha and Roninkai in his hometown (Fukuoka). His disciples were numerous, all outstanding in character, knowledgeable, and learned. They focused on increasing their knowledge and strengthening their bodies, aiming to serve the country and dedicate themselves to society. Mr. Touyama was extremely generous, often donating his wealth to friends. This is why he had so many loyal followers and friends today and was universally respected. Moreover, Mr. Touyama, dressed in plain clothes, was repeatedly summoned to the Imperial Palace for imperial banquets, an unprecedented honor in Japan.

Touyama was born in 1855, coinciding with the Meiji Restoration. Early on, he believed that to save East Asia, East Asian nations must unite their spirits, strive for progress, and strengthen themselves. When the Chinese Revolution surged, Mr. Touyama provided significant support. The success of the Chinese Revolution relied heavily on Mr. Touyama's assistance. In the past, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, while in exile in Japan, had a very close relationship with Touyama. In 1929, when Dr. Sun was enshrined, Touyama did not hesitate to travel to China to assist in the funeral. Mr. Touyama's sincere friendship and great spirit have been praised by people in both China and Japan, and this is no accident. Throughout his life, Touyama spared no effort in promoting the reform of Japanese society and the advancement of Sino-Japanese relations. In life and in death, we deeply feel the greatness of his friendship and boundless sorrow.

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Touyama was constantly worried and hoped for the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Touyama, in his capacity as a private citizen, advocated the construction of a new East Asian order to lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia. The full realization of peace has yet to be achieved, which would have been a regret for Mr. Touyama. However, we are determined to take this as our responsibility as survivors, to remember Mr. Touyama, and to strive to fulfill his will and carry out our revolutionary aspirations to promote further cooperation between China and Japan. We also look forward to further efforts from many Chinese revolutionary friends to contribute more effectively to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, so as to comfort the spirit of Mr. Touyama Mitsuru in heaven. (This article was originally intended for publication in a special issue commemorating Mr. Touyama, but it arrived late and is included here. —Editor's Note)

China Pharmacy Advocates for Scholarships: China Pharmacy, located at the entrance of Yiyuan Lane on Xin Zha Road, is celebrating its second anniversary and promoting scholarships and donating to the funds of the eight major public organizations. Yesterday, they sent a sincere letter stating: "To whom it may concern, since its establishment by Mr. Yuan Jideng, Xie Baosheng, Wang Boyuan, and others, this pharmacy has been committed to serving society. To commemorate its second anniversary this December, all medicines will be sold at discounted prices. Furthermore, all proceeds from sales during the three days of (24), (25), and (26) will be donated to your newspaper's scholarship fund and the *Xinwen Bao*'s student loan fund, to express our sympathy for poor students. Moreover, given the imminent arrival of winter, the charitable activities organized by various public organizations are in urgent need of funds. It is proposed that 20% of the total proceeds from the other 27 days of the month, excluding the three days for the scholarship fund, be allocated as donations to the Pushan Villa, the Civilian Maternity Hospital, the Pharmaceutical Industry Training School, the Zhengyi Primary and Secondary School, the Qunwei Primary and Secondary School, the Boyuan Senior Nursing School, and the Yuan Society, to be divided equally. We are aware that this is a drop in the bucket, but if various industries follow suit, the accumulation of small contributions will make a difference. During this commemorative period, the prescription department will offer 'Civilian Prescriptions' to assist the poor and sick. Patients certified by doctors to be truly poor will be charged at a flat rate, and assistance will be provided to the extent possible to fulfill the responsibility of mutual assistance among humans.

### After Electricity is Halved Again

— Zhou Ronghai

Recently, the authorities halved electricity consumption again. During this decisive year, the electricity expenses of all citizens should be saved as much as possible. However, are there still many questions that the authorities have considered? I believe that all citizens must have the same feeling. Now, I will list several points for public discussion:

(1) The continued existence of dance halls, cinemas, cafes, and all other theaters and entertainment venues is extremely contradictory. Cinemas are public entertainment venues, and generally speaking, they still have some benefits. However, in the entire city of Shanghai, their number is truly ubiquitous. Therefore, if the authorities intend to save electricity and increase production and combat power, they must first start by banning these entertainment venues. Depending on their geographic distribution, the number of cinemas should be reduced to the bare minimum, and other entertainment venues have no need to exist during this extraordinary period and should be strictly ordered to close.

(2) A small amount of electricity should still be supplied to factories, because no matter what, even if a factory does not help increase combat power, at least it is still a producer, which is much better than all the entertainment venues that are consumers! Furthermore, if factories close, unemployment will inevitably increase drastically. In this society of oversupply, this will only add to the crime and cause social unrest. Although the closure of entertainment venues can also cause a batch of people to lose their jobs, the difference in the number is naturally very large. If all the factories in the production sector can still be maintained, it will not be difficult for this group of people to engage in production and work.

(3) As in the regulations of the 24th of this month, trams are only operating outside (except for a few trams on routes 1 and 2, etc., but even these only operate for four hours, one hour in the morning and two hours in the evening), while all entertainment venues resumed business from this day. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon; movies are still shown three times a day, as if the reduction in electricity has no impact on them at all. This allows ordinary consumers to continue to enjoy themselves to the fullest, while ordinary producers travel back and forth, wasting time and reducing the efficiency of production work. The consequences are so different.

(4) Regarding the saving of electricity, the authorities should also consider the situation of the citizens. An ordinary house has only one electricity meter, and most houses in Shanghai are inhabited by more than one family, from as few as two or three families to as many as six or seven families. If electricity is reduced again and again, and even the lowest limit is not enough for a house, residents can only revert to using oil lamps, as in the uncivilized era. In the current period of soaring prices, the price of oil per *jin* (approximately 0.5 kilogram) can already cover the expenses of one year in the past. Can someone who is employed and earns a salary bear this heavy burden?

The above four points are all factual statements. If the authorities can understand, then society will be fortunate, and the citizens will be fortunate!

### Mr. Zhang Furen's Birthday: Relatives and Friends' Birthday Celebrations Aid Charity, Donating 100,000 Yuan to Support Our Winter Relief

Mr. Zhang Furen, Chairman of the Industrial Oil Industry Association, celebrated his 40th birthday the other day. His relatives and friends held a banquet at the Wanli Restaurant to offer their congratulations, receiving celebratory gifts totaling 200,000 yuan. Mr. Zhang, deeply moved by the difficulties of the times, generously decided to donate the entire amount, along with an additional 150,000 yuan from his personal funds, totaling 350,000 yuan, to various charitable organizations to benefit his relatives and friends. This includes 100,000 yuan each for this newspaper's winter clothing and porridge distribution fund and the Xinwen Bao's student loan fund; 20,000 yuan each for the Tongren Fuyuantang, Xin Puyu Tang, Xujiahui Notre Dame Orphanage, Tongren Charity Association, Renci Charity Association, and Pude Tang; and 30,000 yuan for the China General Relief Association for Women and Children. Mr. Zhang's dedication to public service and his compassionate concern for others are truly admirable.

In addition, a Shanghai "Escaping Citizen" reader generously donated a check for 50,000 yuan, of which 10,000 yuan each was allocated to our newspaper's winter clothing and porridge distribution, small loan fund, and poverty relief fund as a response. The remaining 10,000 yuan each was donated to the Anlao Home and the China Child Welfare Association. Their dedication to public welfare is also commendable. Furthermore, Mr. Hua Shihan sent a letter stating: "To whom it may concern, having read in the newspaper that your esteemed publication is organizing clothing and porridge distribution due to the approaching cold weather, I am deeply impressed by your compassionate concern for relieving the suffering of our compatriots. I am enclosing herewith five Class A and five Class B clothing vouchers from the Buddhist Charity Association. (Each Class A voucher is worth 2,800 yuan for cotton clothing, and each Class B voucher is worth 2,800 yuan for cotton trousers.) Totaling ten vouchers, equivalent to five sets of clothing, I am enclosing them with this letter in the hope that you will accept them and distribute them to impoverished compatriots."

### Zhenjiang Fellow-Townsmen Association: Increased Loan Amount

The Zhenjiang Fellow-Townsmen Association in this city has been providing small loans for two years. In order to adapt to the current environment, the loan amount has been increased to a maximum of 3,000 yuan. However, due to limited funds, it is not easy to maintain this program. Therefore, a fundraising campaign has been launched. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of fellow-townsmen and colleagues, 300,000 yuan was pledged on the spot. We hope that generous fellow-townsmen and philanthropists will contribute generously to support this endeavor. Those wishing to donate can send their contributions directly to Mr. Zhou Daoqian of the Finance Department at Hefeng Silk Shop in Changxin Lane, Tianjin Road, and obtain an official receipt. Anyone who is genuinely from Zhenjiang and lacks funds can apply at the association's office at No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, with their household registration certificate.

### Friend's Aid Hospital: Free Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment

### Continued Donation of Dysentery Medication

This autumn, dysentery is prevalent and rampant.

Sales locations: (1) Social Service Column of the Xinwen Bao Newspaper Office. (2) Dr. Zhu Ye's Clinic, No. 82 Siming Lane, Taishan Road.

### Request for Books from the Mobile People's Vocational Training Center

The World Red Swastika Society, which operates the Mobile People's Vocational Training Center, currently houses over 700 mobile people. Focusing on agricultural and industrial training, they are now conducting leisure education and need various types of books, such as moral books, books on scientific cultivation, and books on general knowledge, for their leisure reading. We respectfully request that philanthropists from all walks of life donate these books to the Shanghai Office at No. 15 Zhonghe Village, Pushi Road.

### Child Welfare Association Appeals for Donations, Hoping All Sectors Generously Contribute

The China Child Welfare Association, in order to carry out the educational work for over 300 orphans, is currently conducting a fundraising campaign with a goal of 5 million yuan, aiming to complete it within one month. Since the start of the fundraising on the 11th of this month, nearly half a month has passed, and a total of over 1.45 million yuan has been received, demonstrating the enthusiastic response and generous contributions from all sectors. After all, rescuing orphaned and destitute children is fulfilling humanity's mutual assistance obligation, and it is also fulfilling the responsibilities we should bear towards the country and society. However, the donations currently received by the association are still far from the target. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to act with benevolence and make further generous contributions so that the association can achieve its goal as soon as possible to benefit the orphans.

If you wish to donate, in addition to direct collection by the association, the Social Service Department of this newspaper can also collect donations on behalf.
