### Five Enemy Warships Sunk South of Mindoro; Japanese General Headquarters Announces Air Squadron Results

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 17th that Japanese air units, in attacks on enemy warships south of Mindoro Island in the Philippines on the night of the 15th and dawn of the 16th, achieved the following results: one battleship or large cruiser sunk, three large transport ships sunk, and one medium transport ship sunk.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - As the battle for Leyte Island unfolds in a tense back-and-forth state, enemy forces have landed on Mindoro Island in the western depths of the Philippines, intensifying the decisive battle for the fate of the Pacific. Since the 13th, enemy Americans, with an 80-ship transport fleet escorted by a powerful naval force, passed through Leyte Gulf, the Mindanao Sea, and the Sulu Sea. Despite heavy attacks by Japanese forces, they suffered severe damage but still forced their way north, finally landing a division-sized force in the San Jose area of southwestern Mindoro Island on the morning of the 15th. Japanese army and navy air units and special attack squadrons mobilized on a large scale, launching daily fierce attacks on the enemy transport fleet, inflicting significant blows. At the same time, Japanese ground forces near the enemy landing site immediately launched fierce interception battles. It is reported that the enemy Americans have already invaded Leyte Island with a large force of 150,000 troops. After fierce fighting by Japanese air and ground forces, they have been subjected to pressure, wasting time, and attempting to advance air bases. However, they were disrupted by the courageous operations of the Japanese Takachiho Air Transport Unit. They then attempted to break the stalemate, landing a division on the 7th in the Albea area south of Ormoc. Simultaneously, on the 14th, they broke into the Sulu Sea, landing in San Jose on Mindoro Island. The enemy also deployed a reorganized mobile unit off the eastern coast of Luzon Island, using carrier-based aircraft to attack the entire Philippine region. The Japanese responded with aerial annihilation warfare, driving away the enemy's vigorous will to fight and the ample pressure of material. However, the enemy is urgently seeking to break the Leyte battle stalemate and is currently dispersing forces, repeatedly following and attacking. As of today, from our perspective, the opportunity to annihilate the enemy has arrived. The enemy boasts of its superiority in material resources, but due to the long supply lines, and Mindoro Island being located at the center of the Japanese-Philippine air fortress, it is not difficult for Japanese air power to exert its full strength, cut off enemy supply lines, and isolate them. The naval and air battles in Leyte Gulf and the Philippine Sea have been going on for two months, so they have gradually recovered from the damage and are once again pouring in their material resources to counterattack the Philippines. The decisive battle is becoming more fierce. The Japanese are increasingly able to thoroughly eliminate the enemy by firmly establishing the belief, launching internal line operations, pursuing the enemy landing forces on Leyte, completely annihilating the enemy landing forces on Mindoro, and establishing a posture of seizing the opportunity.

Situation of Fierce Battles by Japanese Forces in Various Locations

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - A record of the mixed battle situation between Japanese and American forces: (1) In the Philippines, the battle on Leyte Island has fiercely unfolded near Managasnaz Beach and near Burauen. Simultaneously, after the enemy forces landed near Albea, they also launched battles near Ormoc. The stalemated Leyte front has suddenly become active. The enemy, in order to quickly break the stalemate on the Leyte Island front, used 80 ships on the 5th and 6th, from Surigao Strait around to Camotes Sea, attempting to occupy Ormoc with a small force. Simultaneously, the enemy, in order to seize the main driving force of the Philippine operation, broke into the Sulu Sea with a powerful convoy on the 13th. Enemy mobile units also appeared off the eastern coast of Luzon Island, using 200-300 carrier-based aircraft on the 14th, 15th, and 16th to invade northern Philippines, attempting to contain Japanese air force activity. On the 15th, they suddenly appeared near San Jose on Mindoro Island. Japanese ground forces and air force immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy who had begun landing, and fierce fighting is currently underway. As a result, the Philippine front has expanded westward from the Leyte area. Consequently, the scale of the mixed battle between Japanese and American forces surrounding the Philippine archipelago is also expanding. (2) On the Japanese mainland side, since the 13th of this month, about 80 or so B29-type aircraft from enemy bases in the Mariana Islands have separately attacked Tokyo and the prefectures of Aichi and Shizuoka. Although the Japanese side suffered some losses on the ground, Japanese air defense units shot down and destroyed more than ten enemy aircraft, achieving a great victory. Moreover, enemy B29-type aircraft suffered great losses when returning to Saipan due to heavy rain. (3) Regarding Peleliu and Morotai, the Japanese air force on Morotai Island has continued to attack enemy aircraft, while ground forces have also fought bravely against the enemy day after day, striving to control the function of the enemy air force's relay base. From the time Japanese troops landed on October 16th to December 6th, they killed over 290 enemy soldiers, destroyed ten camps, and the smoke and flares on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur are still very strong, indicating that the Japanese garrison forces in that area are continuing to fight the enemy in a counterattacking manner. (4) In the Indian Ocean, the British appointed former Far East Fleet Commander Fraser as the commander of the newly established Pacific Fleet, which is intended to replenish the fleet consumed by the United States. (5) In China, the Japanese army is continuing to expand its battle results after opening up the Great East Asia Transverse Road. (6) Both land and air battles are very active in Burma, and enemy movements are becoming increasingly evident. (7) In the Northern Area, the enemy forces are very quiet due to poor weather conditions on the northern front.

### Takachiho Unit - Surprise Attack on Enemy Flank - Japanese Aircraft Bomb Two Airfields on Leyte Island

Philippine Frontline Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - On the 6th of this month, a portion of the Takachiho Unit, which carried out a surprise landing at the Burauen airfield on Leyte Island and other locations, has since the 7th, with powerful units under the command of Major Saitabe, continuously carried out drop operations in several locations around Ormoc on the west coast of Leyte Island, cooperating with ground troops to launch a surprise attack on the enemy forces landing at Albea and attacking Ormoc, attacking their flanks and backs, achieving great accomplishments in past battles.

Philippine Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force bombed the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on Leyte Island on the night of the 13th, shattering several locations at each airfield.

### Japanese Forces in Burma - Expanding War Results

Burmese Frontline, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese units encountered the main force of the 30th Division of the Chongqing Army (Yu Army) at Namani (28 kilometers northwest of Namgaum), which was moving south from the old Burma Road in Bhamo. Since the 9th, they have launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing Army defending the position, inflicting great damage and gradually pressing them northwest. From the 9th to the 13th, the losses suffered by the Chongqing Army included abandoning 500 bodies, personnel casualties reaching 1,500, and a large number of various artillery and ammunition captured. In addition, in order to destroy the encircled New 38th Division of the Chongqing Army in Bhamo, Japanese forces dispatched from Namgaum and Japanese forces moving north along the Bhamo-Monto Road also launched an attack on a portion of the New 32nd Division of the Chongqing Army attempting to move south near Xidao (50 kilometers south of Bhamo) on the 10th. The Chongqing Army suffered casualties of over 500, and the Japanese forces are currently fiercely attacking the Chongqing Army that is resisting. On the 10th of this month, the Japanese air force cooperated with naval units to launch a fierce attack on the Alensangwo Chongqing military stronghold. In this battle, it was confirmed that the Chongqing Army abandoned 96 bodies, and three artillery pieces and large vehicles were destroyed, and fires broke out in more than ten warehouses and barracks. At noon on the 11th, the Chongqing Army, carrying five or six cannons, launched another attack, but the Japanese forces immediately repelled them to the Alensangwo area. Furthermore, another unit of the Japanese army also launched a surprise attack on the Chongqing Army that was constructing defensive positions near Mendo, and the war results are gradually expanding.

### Leyte Gulf Naval Battle Continued Report

— Shunzhi

Around noon on a certain day in mid-October, the anti-aircraft guns of the Japanese aircraft carrier 〇〇 suddenly opened fire. An enemy reconnaissance plane flew out of the high white clouds. After a fierce Japanese interception, it immediately fled back into the clouds, but the Japanese escort plane did not let up at all, tracking it like a shadow.

The enemy plane had already made contact with the Japanese fleet. That day, Commander Shiota issued an attack order to the entire army: "Believe in divine protection, the entire army assaults." This was a long-awaited order. All the soldiers were spirited, their blood boiling, everyone itching to destroy the enemy.

The Battle of Leyte Gulf

Nothing happened overnight, and the next day was the long-awaited day of attack for the entire army. That day, the sky above the battlefield was clear, but the waves were still very high. Before dawn, the Japanese naval forces broke through the waterway near the island and suddenly appeared inside Leyte Gulf, charging into the center of the enemy fleet. The enemy formation was thrown into chaos. Then, the Japanese forces' huge guns devoured over sixty enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other ships, and the battle results continued to expand. One unit charged into the transport fleet, another unit charged into the escort fleet, and enemy ships were destroyed one after another in the face of the Japanese's roaring guns.

The suicide close combat of the Japanese assault unit was successful. In indescribable joy, the morale of all the soldiers was further raised. However, the deceived enemy would definitely pour its air power to challenge the Japanese fleet, so the entire Japanese army was on strict alert, preparing for interception. As expected, at 〇 o'clock, the sound of the trumpet for anti-aircraft combat configuration blared. After the discovery of the enemy reconnaissance plane, after 〇10 minutes, a large formation of enemy planes came from the 30-degree direction on the left, and at the same time, four large groups were discovered in the 20-degree direction. The fleet then quickly dispersed, forming a tight anti-aircraft sailing sequence. The ships escorting the aircraft carrier moved out one after another. Suddenly, the main guns of the Japanese battleship opened fire. With a rumble, huge shells shot into the enemy formation, and the enemy planes were dispersed. At the same time, the high-angle guns also roared, and the machine guns also fired like a string of pearls. In an instant, only white smoke and flying enemy planes were seen in the sky. In the midst of accurate and fierce fire, enemy planes fell one after another, some like fallen leaves blown by the wind, others suddenly disintegrating in the air, scattering like burning pieces of paper.

At this moment, the enemy planes concentrated their attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier group. Amidst the rising and falling columns of water, the Japanese aircraft carrier calmly fought back. Several near misses also occurred on the sides of our escort ships, stirring up huge columns of water. In this smoke-filled environment, the gun barrels of the machine guns became extremely hot.

Suddenly, near the aircraft carrier, a torpedo dragging a white trail shot like an arrow. Our escort destroyer 〇〇 drove at full speed, rushing between the torpedo and the aircraft carrier. With a deafening sound, the torpedo, which was about to hit the aircraft carrier, slammed into the destroyer's hull. 〇〇 was immediately enveloped in red flames and thick black smoke, but its forward turret was still firing at the enemy planes. Then, with another loud bang, the entire ship was blown to pieces. Destroyer 〇〇 sacrificed itself to protect the aircraft carrier.

That day, the enemy planes' attacks were very persistent. Large formations filled the sky and attacked repeatedly, no less than five times until dusk. Our fleet fought bloody battles under the enemy planes' concentrated attacks of torpedoes and bombs, shooting down many enemy planes, but the aircraft carrier 〇〇 was also unfortunately hit and sank.

Night Attack Greatly Defeats Enemy Ships

As the setting sun sank westward, the enemy planes were finally repelled. The sky over the South China Sea was as red as blood, like a banner for this tragic naval and air battle. The Japanese fleet, divided into several formations, reassembled at this point. The aircraft carrier 〇〇, which had fought on the ocean, could no longer be seen in its majestic form. A tragic atmosphere enveloped the entire fleet. Suddenly, as if breaking this heavy atmosphere, flashing signal lights appeared on the flagship.

"The entire army will immediately launch a suicide night attack on the enemy fleet, and must destroy them!"

Ah, how admirable this indomitable fighting spirit is! Even though there were sacrifices in the fierce battle where flesh and blood continued to fly, the attack was not relaxed. This traditional spirit of killing every enemy encountered aroused the entire army to rise up and generate new fighting spirit.

At that time, the main Japanese force followed behind the forward destroyer squadron, forming a neat single column and speeding through the dark sea. In the sky, the stars twinkled, and shooting stars with long tails swept across the sky from time to time.

Late at night, in front of the Japanese fleet, the flashes of dark-night thunder suddenly appeared in the low-hanging clouds. Then, faint sounds of gunfire like distant thunder were heard. Flash after flash, it turned out that the Japanese fast destroyer squadron had engaged with the enemy vanguard ships. The magnificent close-quarters night attack battle, a tradition of the Japanese Navy, unfolded. However, after a few minutes, the sea returned to its original tranquility. This night attack battle at least sank one enemy cruiser and hit other enemy ships. Unfortunately, when the main force arrived at the battlefield, the enemy had already retreated hastily to the south, so they had to withdraw their troops and head north.

In this way, the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, which will be forever immortalized in history, ended with the Japanese's victorious voice. As a result of this naval battle, the enemy's naval forces suffered heavy losses, which was a major turning point in the subsequent air, sea, and land operations in Leyte Gulf. (Sent from Tokyo)

Editorial

### Re-discussing Rice Policy

The day before yesterday, we discussed rice policy and put forward several short-term and long-term solutions. We believe that if we strictly prohibit random price increases and speculative manipulation of rice prices, they can return to lower levels. This is the past experience. Of course, there are many reasons for this round of soaring rice prices, but manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and random price increases by vendors are the main causes. In particular, some rice merchants in county and suburban areas are manipulating the situation, leading to uncontrollable madness. Therefore, in our article "On Rice Policy," we advocated strict management of rice prices and absolutely not adopting a laissez-faire attitude.

How to manage it strictly? According to the current environment, we advocate implementing two things that are simple and easy to do first.

(1) Centralized retail transactions: Scatter vendors should be concentrated in one or several areas, and street vending should be prohibited to facilitate management. The selling price should be determined and approved by the authorities, and price increases should not be arbitrary. The determination of the fixed price should take into account costs and reasonable profits. For example, the current cost of buying rice by vendors in the production area is assumed to be 1,500 yuan per dou (unit of volume). Extortion along the way should be cracked down on, but for the sake of argument, even if this illegal fact exists, then the extortion along the way should be counted as 500 yuan per dou, so the cost per dou is 2,000 yuan. Giving a profit of 500 yuan per dou, the total will not exceed 2,500 yuan per dou. Assuming that this number is the fixed price, and after being approved by the relevant authorities, price increases should not be allowed unless the actual cost has increased.

(2) Joint purchase by districts: Joint purchasing offices should be set up near the areas where rice vendors enter, and nearby registered rice shops should be allowed to participate. For example, joint purchasing offices should be set up in Caojiadu, Xujiahui, Zhoujiaqiao, and other places. Personnel should be dispatched by relevant government agencies to supervise, stipulate reasonable prices, and purchase the rice entering from vendors. The quantity purchased daily should be reported to the Rice Management Committee and the municipal government's competent authorities, and then sold to citizens at a fair price. However, the maximum quantity should be stipulated for this fair-priced sale, and excessive purchases should not be allowed to prevent hoarding. At the same time, the wealthy should not be allowed to purchase, and it should be limited to salary earners, laborers, and ordinary people, and handled according to the occupation filled in on the citizen's certificate.

The above methods can be implemented simultaneously. Vendors are free to enter the centralized market or sell to joint purchasing offices. However, random price increases along the way are prohibited. These two methods still provide principles. If the government believes they are feasible, they should be carefully considered and specific measures should be implemented immediately.

This round of soaring rice prices is undoubtedly a planned action by unscrupulous merchants, which has led to general price increases. Some people say that the more price controls are implemented in this city, the more unstable prices become. In reality, it is the lack of unity in the powers of economic institutions and the lack of strictness in laws and regulations. The past laxity and chaos have nurtured the ambitions of unscrupulous merchants, who are unscrupulous and do whatever they want. If the most severe punishments are taken against those who manipulate prices, hoard goods, and public officials who commit fraud in their own name after the facts have been verified, the more serious ones should be executed and the less serious ones should be imprisoned and paraded through the streets to give unscrupulous people a relentless punishment, killing one to warn a hundred. Then the manipulators will naturally be wary, and prices can be stabilized. Conversely, if only fines are used to settle the matter and favoritism is shown, then these people's ambitions will be difficult to suppress, and prices will naturally be difficult to stabilize. In short, the current rice price is no longer an economic issue, it has exceeded the scope of economics, and it is a security issue. Therefore, it is only effective to use the laws of security to punish these unscrupulous merchants.

Finally, we hope that the authorities of the Rice Management Committee will do their best to dredge the source of rice so that the rice allocated to households can be distributed on time. At the same time, we know that the advantage of the food allocation in allied Japan is that it is appropriate and average. It does not give too much to be too full, but it does not lead to starvation, which is entirely to adapt to wartime life. Manchuria and North China all eat coarse grains, so the general public should eat more coarse grains, reduce waste, and adapt to the environment.

### President Chen Delivers Radio Address to Japanese People Hoping Allied Nations Will Fully Assist in Completing the Great Task of Nation-Building

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, Mr. Chen, delivered a radio address to the entire Japanese nation at 7:20 PM on the 17th, stating that China is determined to carry forward the long-cherished wish of the people, the Three Principles of the People, and the late President Wang's legacy, and move forward bravely to complete the war for China's own liberation, hoping to give it assistance so that China can devote itself to the Great East Asia War and complete President Wang's legacy. The full text of his radio address is as follows:

Dear Japanese people, I am broadcasting to you again in Tokyo today, and I feel an unusually warm and close feeling. At the same time, I feel very honored. This is my third official visit to Tokyo since the National Government returned to its capital. The first time was in May of the 29th year of the Republic of China, after the National Government returned to its capital, when I came to your country to return the courtesy under the order of President Wang. The second time was in April of last year, after the National Government participated in the Great East Asia War, when I came to your country to visit under the order of President Wang. Now it is the third time, and since President Wang passed away on the 10th of last month, there is no longer his guidance. I have infinite sorrow and feel the importance of my own responsibility. I hope that the Japanese government and people will stand in the position of an allied nation and friendship and give China cooperation.

Recalling that President Wang crossed over to your country in early March of this year to recuperate, he received unusual care and preferential treatment from the Japanese government and people. All the people in our country are unusually grateful. We will never forget the warmth and high regard of your country. Today, on behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my infinite gratitude to you.

Inheriting the Legacy of Predecessors

President Wang has passed away, and we feel that we have lost the guidance of our leader, and at the same time, we feel even more that his legacy must be realized.

The great policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building left by Mr. Wang is the foundation for establishing permanent cooperation between China and Japan. His instructions this year on New Year's Day to rectify thoughts, increase production, and establish security are the guidelines for consolidating the rear of the Great East Asia War. In the future, we should be based on what he has proclaimed, and be determined to share weal and woe with your country, even to live and die together. We survivors must shoulder the responsibility and implement them one by one, so as not to fail President Wang's legacy, and to realize the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father.

There is something that must be solemnly told to you today. First, the Great East Asia War must be completed. This is the determination of the National Government. The National Government decided to participate in the war on December 8 of the Republic of China when Japan launched the Great East Asia War.

The conviction will never waver

This participation in the war was voluntary because China has long been subjected to the aggression of British and American imperialism. China's status as a semi-colony for a hundred years originated entirely from the Opium War. Therefore, opposing British and American imperialism is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people. We strive for our own liberation and for the liberation of all the nations of East Asia who share the same fate. Our participation in the war is based on justice, humanity, and friendship. In the future, no matter how the war develops or how urgent the situation becomes, we will base our actions on the long-cherished wish of the people, the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen, and the legacy of President Wang, and we will move forward without hesitation, never wavering, never retreating.

Striving to promote peace

Second, China and Japan must cooperate to lay the foundation for Great East Asia. The purpose of the National Government's return to its capital is to show peace between China and Japan, and to work harder to promote comprehensive peace in China. Moreover, the purpose of returning to its capital that day was not satisfied with peace between China and Japan, but to further seek permanent cooperation between China and Japan. China does not spare its meager efforts and hopes to share the responsibility of East Asia. Although there are still some people in Chongqing who do not understand this purpose, the National Government must continue to work hard to make them understand, so as not to fail Mr. Wang's great wish of returning to Nanjing that day, and not to fail the greatest goal of the joint fighting power of the people of insight in China and Japan that day.

The two countries share weal and woe

There are too many things I want to tell you. Today, I will only choose the key points to state the interests, peace, and security of China and Japan. Today has reached a period where they cannot be separated. The ability of the world's humanity to enable the countries of East Asia to get rid of their colonial status, and the liberation of China and other East Asian nations, all depend on this war. China's strength is limited, and my ability is even more limited. I deeply hope that the government and people of your country will give assistance so that China can devote itself to the Great East Asia War, so that we can complete President Wang's legacy. This is especially something that can be hoped for and appreciated.

### The Greater East Asia Ministry in Japan Holds a Meeting of Envoys to China to Hear On-the-Ground Realities and Discuss Policy

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to hear on-the-ground realities and deliberate on current policies, the Greater East Asia Ministry took advantage of Ambassador Tani’s presence in Tokyo, and held a conference of ambassadors and ministers to China at the official residence of the Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry at 9:00 AM on the 16th. In addition to the ambassadors, the meeting was attended by consulate heads and ministers from various locations, including Kusunoki (Peiping), Tashiro (Canton), and Tsuchida (Shanghai), as well as Minister Chunhiko stationed in Manchukuo, military attachés Hara and Takeuchi from the Greater East Asia Ministry, and heads of relevant bureaus and sections. Various frank discussions were held, and the meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that past conferences of ambassadors and ministers to China were held locally, but this is the first time it has been held in Tokyo, hence its outcome is highly anticipated.

### President Chen Speaks to Reporters in Japan

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Chen Gongbo, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, met with reporters at the State Guest House here at 11:00 AM on the 16th and made the following remarks: Before expressing my personal opinions, I would like to convey the sincere congratulations of the Chinese government and people to your esteemed country.

Expressing Gratitude to Allied Nations

Firstly, since Mr. Wang Jingwei came to your country for medical treatment in March of this year, he has received gracious treatment from His Majesty the Emperor, warm hospitality from the ministers, dedicated care from the doctors and nurses, and special concern from the people. This represents an unprecedented display of amity in the diplomatic history of China and Japan, which has deeply moved the Chinese government and people. This is the first point for which we should express our gratitude to your country. Secondly, since China joined the Greater East Asia War last January, your esteemed country voluntarily returned the concessions in March of the same year, declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights, assisted our country in recovering the concessions in China held by various countries, including the public concessions, and abolished the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol, enabling China to achieve complete independence and freedom. This has allowed the realization of both the last words of the founding father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, regarding the abolition of unequal treaties and Pan-Asianism, and the spirit and effect of Chairman Wang’s cooperation with your country over the years, which have become clear to the world. Your country's justice to the world and friendship to China have been fully revealed. This not only liberates China but also the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. This is the second point for which we should express our gratitude to your country.

Cooperating in the War of Liberation

As for what I wish to declare to you gentlemen today, we feel infinite sorrow at the passing of Mr. Wang Jingwei. At the same time, we will transform our sorrow into courage and determination to complete Chairman Wang's legacy. We will certainly cooperate more closely with your country to complete the Greater East Asia War. The process of China becoming a semi-colony of the great powers began a century ago with the Opium War. Therefore, opposing Anglo-American imperialism is the great aspiration of the 450 million people of China. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not explicitly oppose Anglo-American imperialism, it was caused by Anglo-American imperialist aggression, and the people rose up, first seeking to reform domestic politics, and then urgently seeking self-preservation and national salvation. The Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, further sweeping away previous vague concepts and clearly marking the opposition to Anglo-American imperialism, in order to seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War purely represents the aspirations of the people of the entire country and implements the party program of the Kuomintang. The National Government never considered success or failure, profit or loss at the outset. In the future, even if the war situation changes again, or the situation becomes even more pressing, we firmly believe that the National Government will not waver because of this. Your country's leadership in the Greater East Asia War is fighting for justice and for the liberation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. Our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War is also fighting for justice and, more importantly, for our own liberation. Wherever justice lies, there will be no hesitation. Although there are many difficulties, we will not change our original intention.

Economic Foundation Still Unsound

Furthermore, the foundation of the Chinese economy is currently not sound. During this visit to your country, I plan to have candid discussions with your country on various issues. Especially important is the review of economic issues. I sincerely hope that both countries will cooperate to resolve issues such as the adjustment of military and civilian needs, the increase in production, financial problems, and the suppression of commodity prices, so as to maximize the effects of the total war effort. Today, China and Japan share the same interests, and our safety and danger are intertwined. The relationship between the two countries is truly inseparable. Stabilizing China is stabilizing East Asia, which is also stabilizing the great rear of the Greater East Asia War. I hope that you will all pay attention to this and fully cooperate with the National Government. During this trip to the East, my faith in the Japanese people's belief in the ultimate victory of the Greater East Asia War has grown stronger, which makes us feel infinitely excited. We can only, based on Chairman Wang's determination to share weal and woe with Japan, even to the point of sharing life and death, courageously move forward, to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven and to comfort the people's long-cherished desire for China's freedom and independence.

### Minister Lin Answers Questions

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - After Chen Gongbo, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Japan, he met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 16th and made a statement. At the same time, Minister of Propaganda Lin Bosheng answered questions from the reporter group regarding President Chen's statement, saying that the purpose of the Japanese army's current operation on the mainland is to destroy the Anglo-American forces of aggression in China. Not only is this deeply understood in the peaceful areas, but the people in the resistance areas in Chongqing are also gradually understanding it. The overall peace and unification of China may be rapidly promoted. Furthermore, the people of the entire China are comparing Japan's new policy towards China with the Anglo-American policy of aggression, and their trust in Japan has increased.

### Former President of the Privy Council, Count Ichiki, Passes Away

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Former President of the Privy Council of Japan, Baron Ichiki Kitokuro, passed away at his private residence in Hongo Ward at 5:00 PM on the 17th due to pneumonia. He was 78 years old.

### Suppressing High Rice Prices: Effective Measures Being Planned to Simultaneously Address Symptoms and Root Causes to Curb Price Hikes

The Shanghai financial and industrial market conditions experienced dramatic changes in the past week. The magnitude of the turmoil was unprecedented this year. The public unease has reached an extreme point, especially with the soaring black market prices of rice. The situation has become chaotic. The biggest reason for this is the speculative merchants deliberately spreading groundless rumors, taking the opportunity to manipulate and hoard goods, raising market prices in an attempt to make exorbitant profits. However, the economic authorities failed to thoroughly balance and regulate the daily necessities of the people's livelihoods, causing food panic to intensify, affecting the prices of other goods to rise one after another. In the financial sector, the price of gold continued to rise every day of the past week, with each surge reaching tens of thousands of yuan. The market prices in the morning and afternoon fluctuated greatly. Silver rose by more than 30%. Chinese stocks remained firm and continued to rise. The bulls were reluctant to sell, and retail investors continued to absorb them. The overnight interest rate remained at 50%, but interbank lending rates were 15% per month, and it was still not easy to obtain funds. Those who had funds did not lend them out but instead purchased goods, which directly stimulated higher prices. In the industrial and commercial sectors, factories in various industries have not been able to resume operations after the power outage. Therefore, the future of production is particularly worrying. At the same time, rice prices continue to soar, and people's livelihoods are in imminent danger. Various industrial and commercial firms are hoarding goods related to people's livelihoods, taking advantage of the situation to arbitrarily raise prices, and even hoarding them without selling. The market prices of rice, coal, oil, sugar, firewood, miscellaneous grains, cotton textiles, daily necessities, and other commodities related to people's livelihoods are all rising sharply. It is heard that the relevant authorities and various industry control groups in the city are urgently discussing fundamental and symptomatic solutions to the problems of rice regulation, supply and demand, price suppression, and supplementary distribution of household rice. A solution may be resolved shortly and put into practice. It is expected that the black market price of rice will plummet in the near future. We hope that citizens will not panic each other. At the same time, we also hope that the economic authorities will quickly seek practical and effective measures to eliminate speculators, so that there is hope of suppressing commodity prices.

### Economic Bureau Promotes Agricultural Production Experimentation Work to Investigate Actual Conditions in Various Counties

### Trade Association Organizational Structure to be Readjusted

The authorities are currently devising a plan to readjust the organizational structure of the city's major commodity trade associations in the near future. The rectification measures will begin once formally approved by the Ministry of Industry. Previously, the relevant authorities repeatedly ordered the reorganization of the organizational structure of the city's major and secondary commodity trade associations, merging those with similar characteristics, resulting in numerous disputes. Generally, these trade associations were formed due to past habits, and once merged, both parties often felt inconvenience. Some individually requested independent organizations, but were not approved due to legal regulations. In view of this and in response to the actual needs, the competent authorities have proposed a re-evaluation and rectification.

Samples were attached, requesting that the Flour and Bran Distribution Office be instructed to improve the quality. After receiving the petition, the office found that the above-mentioned matters were true and immediately ordered the Flour and Bran Distribution Office to improve the quality in the future.

### Please Urge the Monks and Taoists in the City to Devote Themselves to Social Welfare Undertakings

— Zhou Yuying

In 1933, the government promulgated the Implementation Measures for Temples and Monasteries to Run Public Welfare and Charitable Undertakings, stipulating that temples and monasteries throughout the country should allocate a percentage of their property income to run public welfare and charitable undertakings, which is sufficient to promote the spirit of religion and can also assist the government in promoting social policies. The intention is very good. However, since the promulgation and implementation of this measure, although many temples and monasteries in various places have complied with it, most of them have only superficially complied with it, and there are few that are of a considerable scale or have achieved results. Buddhism takes the greater self as the foundation and convenience as the door. Taoism is pure and inactive, saving oneself and saving others. Monks and Taoists should work hard, strengthen their aspirations, have the intention of universal salvation, and perform social service, and it is definitely not enough to simply chant scriptures and pray all day long. On the other hand, Christianity aims at universal love. Its pastors and believers are generally able to devote themselves to social undertakings. The schools, hospitals, and refugee areas established during wartime are all sufficient to express the spirit of Christ. Furthermore, the nuns of Catholicism, in addition to devoting themselves to self-cultivation, also run orphanages, nurseries, and nursing homes, working day and night without懈怠, and their reputation is well-known. In order to comply with the law and promote religion, in the future, monks and Taoists in various places must abandon their prejudices, eliminate old habits, and automatically work hard in social welfare undertakings, so as to save themselves in the future. The city's temples, monks, and property are the richest in the country. If they can catch up quickly and devote themselves to social welfare undertakings, then one call will bring a hundred responses, and various places will be able to emulate each other, and the effectiveness of this will be unimaginable, and Buddhism and Taoism will surely be able to rely on this to become brighter day by day.

There are many types of social welfare undertakings, and the scope is also wide. If they are not carried out properly, the effort will be doubled with half the results, or even abandoned halfway. If the temples and monasteries in this city are to run social welfare undertakings, they should first pay attention to social needs and start with active undertakings. They should also prepare detailed plans and submit them to the government for registration. For each undertaking, at least 80% of the funds must be raised by themselves. In terms of personnel, it is best for the monks and Taoists of the temple to share the work themselves, and there is no need to hire others. If the temple's manpower and financial resources are insufficient, it may be possible to jointly manage it with nearby temples and monasteries, so that it can be sustained. Here are some of the social welfare undertakings that the temples and monasteries in this city can run:

(1) People's Canteens - The temples and monasteries in this city have many monks, ranging from hundreds to dozens. Their original kitchens, canteens, and food utensils must be available. It will be easy to run people's canteens using the original utensils. If it conflicts with the temple's dining, the three meals can be moved earlier, which will not be an obstacle. These people's canteens can advocate vegetarian food, in line with the Buddhist spirit of protecting all living beings. As for rice, even if it is sought from the black market, it is acceptable, as long as the price is low, the food is hygienic, and it is beneficial to health.

(2) Small Loans - Most of the temples and monasteries in this city have abundant income. If they can take out some funds and assign personnel to be responsible for handling small loans, the procedures will not be troublesome. These loans are limited in amount and carried out in stages. Interest can also be charged appropriately. It is best to adopt a credit system, and the funds that can be returned can still be used for lending, so that the people and small vendors can benefit greatly.

(3) Job Placement - Many of the patrons of the temples and monasteries are wealthy and have higher status. If the abbots of the temples can use the opportunity to recommend and introduce job opportunities to some unemployed people who are indeed capable, it will be easy and successful. Therefore, it may be possible to first register job seekers and then introduce them, matching talents to jobs, and the patrons will be happy to accept them.

(4) Homes for Reformed Women - Due to the special circumstances in this city, many fallen women have been unable to extricate themselves. If the nunneries and Taoist nunneries in this city can allocate housing to run homes for reformed women, it will surely be able to save many pitiful women and children. The homes will be run by the female abbots, who will provide production training to enable them to support themselves, so that they do not have to rely on the relief of others.

In addition, temporary relief efforts such as tea distribution in summer and porridge distribution in winter can also be carried out as appropriate. In short, the temples and monasteries in this city can use their surplus manpower, material resources, financial resources, and time to run various social welfare undertakings. If they can be carried out diligently and persistently, the results will be significant, and the religion can be promoted and developed as a result. The government and society will have infinite expectations.
