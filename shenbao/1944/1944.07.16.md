### North China Japanese Consuls Confer on Important Policies, Decide to Strive for Increased Production to Ensure War Resources

Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - A conference of consulates under the Peiping Office of the Japanese Embassy in China was held in the consul's office at 9:00 AM on the 14th. From the embassy side, Minister Kamizawa, Chief of General Affairs Tsuchiya, and heads of various departments and sections attended. From the Japanese Army in North China, Commanders Tsukamoto and Nakanishi attended, along with consuls-general and consuls from Peiping, Tientsin, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Shihchiachuang, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Changtien, Tangshan, and Hsuchow. After the opening ceremony, Minister Kamizawa gave instructions on the determination that should be made in dealing with the situation in North China at this stage. Commander Tsukamoto then explained the current state of public order. Subsequently, the heads of each department reported on matters under their jurisdiction. After that, the entire group held various consultations on concrete measures to increase production and transportation in preparation for the decisive battle. The important points are recorded as follows:

In order to enhance combat power, special measures should be adopted. To ensure the production of war resources in North China in order to complete the war, it was decided to complete the past goals of increasing production and transportation in phases, and to implement the reform and strengthening of labor management. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of food procurement, it was decided to secure Chinese laborers and strongly mobilize Japanese students and engineering teams to actively increase production. Cooperation with relevant agencies is needed to vigorously promote the above tasks. Naturally, the full cooperation of the Japanese Army in North China is required. At the same time, cooperation methods will be sought with the North China Political Affairs Commission, especially on labor issues, and the utmost assistance of Chairman Wang Kemin is particularly expected.

Due to the importance of the mission undertaken by North China, the responsibility of the 400,000 Japanese residents in North China has also increased accordingly. Regarding the important policies of the normal bureau in the future, no one will be allowed to make unwarranted slanders or criticisms. If there are legitimate opinions, they should be directly reported to the authorities. In short, the 400,000 Japanese residents should unite and cooperate with the 100 million people of North China to achieve common goals.

Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - This year, the focus of the North China Labor Association's work is to supply sufficient labor to various important industrial sectors in North China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, due to the rising prices in North China this year, it is difficult to obtain the required labor force by following past recruitment methods. Therefore, an office system for the board of directors has been established in the headquarters to smoothly handle labor affairs. At the same time, the responsibility system for various offices and branches, and the business undertaking organization, are also designed to ensure that each office and branch maintains close contact with the responsible business organization to investigate the labor needs in various regions. Even if various regions do not entrust them to handle recruitment, when it is recognized that labor is insufficient and urgently needs to be supplemented, labor will be supplied immediately, so that the operation of businesses in various regions will not be hindered in any way.

### War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various parts of the Greater East Asia war zone in the past week is as follows:

On the China front, the Japanese army's southward units are still besieging and attacking the isolated city of Hengyang, while continuing to advance southward. B. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army's northward units in Guangdong Province crossed the Yunjiang River, 20 kilometers south of Yingde, a strategic point on the Yuehan Railway, on the 11th, and defeated the Chongqing army, continuing their advance. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army on this front has collected over 1,000 bodies of Chongqing soldiers and captured 286 prisoners, as well as 5 cannons and 581 other light and heavy machine guns and rifles by the 11th. (Air War) The Japanese air force not only directly cooperated with the land battles, but also aimed to thoroughly crush the Chongqing-US air force. Therefore, they have launched attacks on separate advance bases in Zhijiang, Ganzhou, Xincheng, Suichuan, Liangshan, Danzhu, and Guilin for days, achieving brilliant results and inflicting major blows on the Chongqing-US air force. The main battle results are recorded as follows: The number of Chongqing-US aircraft destroyed or burned was 28 in Guilin on the 10th, 14 in Danzhu on the 11th, 51 in Zhijiang on the 12th, and 89 in Guilin on the 13th, for a total of 182. According to the Chongqing-US aircraft raids in early July, there were a total of 224 sorties, with a cumulative number of 1,245 aircraft. However, from the 1st to the 13th, the Japanese air force alone achieved 277 kills, so the Chongqing-US aircraft suffered heavy losses. On the Burma front (Land War), the enemy attempted to break through the Kohima-Imphal road, so they gradually increased their troops in the Imphal basin, and also attempted to recapture Ukhrul. The enemy in the Palel and Bishenpur areas, with the support of artillery and tanks, launched attacks, but were repelled by the Japanese army. The land war situation in various places is recorded as follows: A. On the Northern Burma front, the Japanese army has strengthened its counter-offensive posture against the newly formed First Army of the Chongqing army gradually moving south from the area of Gamunying and the Chongqing army attacking near Umyogaon. B. In the Myitkyina area, the local Japanese army is repelling the American-style 14th Division and the newly formed 31st Division of the Chongqing army and the US army with a small number of troops everywhere. On the 6th, the Japanese army took advantage of the Chongqing-US army's weakness to launch a surprise attack, daring to carry out a night raid on their main positions. In this battle, a total of 138 bodies of Chongqing-US soldiers were counted, and 78 people were captured. According to the 50 days since the Chongqing-US army launched its counter-offensive on May 17, the number of those killed and wounded reached 11,000. C. On the Nujiang front, the 21st and 11th Group Armies of the Chongqing army in the Tengyue, Mangshi, and Longling areas have suffered heavy losses, and their counter-offensive attempts have been crushed. (Air War) On the 7th and 9th, the Japanese air force braved the adverse weather and launched two surprise attacks on the Myitkyina airfield, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft and setting fire to all 16 large transport aircraft and 23 P40 aircraft on the ground. In the Central Pacific, the Japanese army and navy units fighting in the Saipan Island battle gradually reorganized their battle lines. On the night of the 10th, they defended the cave positions near Mount Marpi and launched a brave bayonet charge against the enemy's positions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, in order to support the army and navy operations, the Japanese air force bombed the enemy's positions on Saipan Island and the enemy's cruiser and destroyer groups in the waters east of the island on the night of the 6th, and bombed the Aslito airfield on the night of the 7th. Moreover, the enemy army is still increasing its air force strength to the airfield, and on the 10th, several large enemy transport aircraft and 50 small aircraft were found to be landing one after another, and more than 20 large ships were anchored in the port. Also, two enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, and more than 30 destroyers were moving in the waters northwest of Tinian Island. On the 10th, dozens of enemy aircraft attacked Tinian Island, and enemy ships also shelled the island day and night. At the same time, the Japanese army's artillery on the island also fired back, and on the 6th, a large bomb was fired to bombard the Aslito airfield. From the 6th to the 13th, more than 340 enemy aircraft in total attacked Omiya Island (more than 33 shot down by the Japanese), and on the 9th and 13th, enemy battleships, cruisers, and destroyers shelled Rota Island, Yap Island, and Truk Island, and were also repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft. In the South Pacific, on the Solomon Islands front, enemy aircraft occasionally attacked the Japanese army's positions in Rabaul, Gabien, Radbury in Namatanai, Buka area, and the southern part of Bougainville Island.

### Japanese China Expeditionary Army Refutes Chongqing Propaganda: Japanese Army Never Used Poison Gas

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - As the Japanese army's offensive operations in Central China are progressing steadily and the Chongqing army has suffered repeated defeats that are difficult to conceal, rumors have been spread since the end of June, when Hengyang was on the verge of collapse, that the Japanese army used poison gas. The Japanese China Expeditionary Army issued a written statement on the 15th, denying this and stating that since the end of June, the Chongqing side has been propagating that the Japanese army used poison gas on the Hunan front. However, the Japanese army has always valued morality and ethics. Not only has it never taken such actions in the past, but it will not adopt such inhuman combat methods in the future unless the Chongqing side uses them first. This is because the Chongqing army has no way to deal with the Japanese army's current operations, so it has resorted to this inferior strategy, using propaganda to cover up its defeat. This is the same tactic as the previous propaganda during the Changde Battle, when the Japanese army was said to have used poison gas, and its pitiful attitude is truly laughable.

Japanese Army Achieves Victory in Xiangxiang

A certain Japanese army base in Southern Hunan, 15th (Central News Agency) - After the Ersi of the Yuehan Railway, the Fourth Chongqing Army and other defeated Chongqing troops were mopped up everywhere. In recent days, the 15th Division of the Chongqing army, which wanted to recapture Xiangxiang, has launched counterattacks in the Xiangxiang area. As a result of the fierce fighting, in addition to killing 200 Chongqing soldiers and capturing 34 prisoners, one mortar and many light machine guns were seized. On the Japanese side, two soldiers were killed and injured. Also, on the 9th at noon, the Japanese army's southward advancing unit discovered about 600 soldiers of the 98th Division of the Chongqing army near Huangpi (10 kilometers west of Weiyang) and immediately attacked them, defeating them.

A certain Japanese army front-line base in Hunan, 15th (Central News Agency) - At dawn on the 11th, the Chongqing army attempted to recapture Anren. The Japanese army immediately intercepted and launched a bayonet charge, and finally defeated them, seizing countless military supplies.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing side announced the battle situation on the evening of the 14th as follows: On the Hunan front, the Japanese army has been bombing Hengyang day and night. On the night of the 12th, they carried out artillery bombardment again. Japanese ground troops broke into the Chongqing army's defense line, but were stopped by the Chongqing army reinforcements. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army advancing north along the Yuehan Railway forcibly crossed the river at Lianjiang, 20 kilometers south of Yingde, breaking through the obstacles on the Yingde road. Regarding the above news, a United Press correspondent reported as follows: The Chongqing side claims that the Japanese army in Hunan is preparing for a new offensive, and predicts that there may be even fiercer battles within a week. Although the authorities have not confirmed the Japanese army's occupation of Laiyang, judging from the news of the 14th Air Force bombing Laiyang, it is clear that Laiyang has been occupied by the Japanese army. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army west of the Yuehan Railway is still advancing on Yingde, a strategic point 110 kilometers north of Guangdong.

US Aircraft Blindly Bomb Xinxiang Station

Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - At around 1:55 PM on July 14, eight B-25 type aircraft and three P-40 type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing flew over Xinxiang on the Yuehan Railway and blindly bombed densely populated residential areas, and attacked the station. A considerable number of Japanese travelers and nearby residents on the express train were killed and injured. In general, travelers deeply resent the inhuman blind bombing by US aircraft.

### Japanese Army Launches Fierce Attack in New Guinea

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi on the 14th, a strong force of the Japanese army in the Wewak area of New Guinea launched a fierce attack to the west on the 10th, attempting to break through the US army's positions. According to a spokesman for the Southwest Pacific Command, the US has reinforced artillery and aircraft from Hollandia and is planning to build a defensive position in the area.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Omiya Island

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in the Central Pacific, enemy aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked Omiya Island, becoming increasingly fierce. On the 14th, 85 aircraft attacked the island again.

### Ledo Road Impassable

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Ledo Road, which replaced the Burma Road, is a major lifeline for Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing and American technicians assisting Chongqing are doing their best to build it. According to news arriving here on the 14th, the construction of the Ledo Road is still continuing under the activities of American technicians and Chongqing laborers, but this is a difficult task. Especially in the heavy rain of June, no progress was made. At the same time, due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army, the road is completely impassable at present.

### Zhejiang Department of Finance Collects Land Tax

Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - As land tax is a major source of revenue for the Zhejiang Provincial Treasury, the Zhejiang Department of Finance has assessed and collected the second-term land tax for this year from the governments of various counties in eastern and western Zhejiang, taking into account the actual situation and the environment of each county. It has ordered the collection to begin separately from July 1 and July 15. It is reported that the collection of land tax in various counties in western Zhejiang is more than last year's statistics, with Jiaxing and Haining counties being the most common, and Wuhing and other counties being slightly inferior. The collection of land tax for this term has been actively supervised.

### Gandhi Advocates Establishing an Indian National Government, Does Not Accept Cripps Proposal

Guangdong, 15th (Central News Agency) - Gandhi previously proposed a solution to the Indian-Muslim opposition to the head of the Muslim League, asking the Muslim League to cooperate in establishing a new Indian government and launching a political offensive against the British government. On the 13th of this month, he also issued a statement in Bombay, advocating the establishment of an Indian national government. "Unless I discuss it with the Working Committee of the Congress Party, I cannot take any action. This proposal of mine is completely different from the proposal made by the Working Committee when the British proposed the Cripps proposal in 1942. I now believe that a national government should be organized to control all powers of Indian civil administration. The personnel should be elected from the members of the Central Legislative Assembly. Even under wartime conditions, independence should be declared, and the British Governor and the British King should stand in the same position, assisted by responsible cabinet members." Gandhi said in the above statement that he would withdraw the statement of British withdrawal from India under wartime conditions, requiring the establishment of a national government that fully controls Indian civil administration, and adopting a compromise to enable India to embark on the road to full independence. In fact, if Gandhi's proposal is fully recognized, it is predicted that the following events will inevitably occur in the future: 1. Britain recognizes Indian independence. 2. Under wartime conditions, British sovereignty in India only remains in name. Britain still retains the command of military operations, and its military status is not even as authoritative as the US military stationed in Chongqing. 3. Matters related to the mobilization of military stations and supplies must also be directed by the National Government's Minister of National Defense. 4. The practice of an independent national government is obviously anti-British. The above items are inevitable for Britain, which uses India as a base for invading East Asia, and cannot be tolerated. Regarding Gandhi's new proposal, the famous Indian expert Hughes wrote an article in the English Times on the 13th, expressing his opposition, saying that it is impossible for a country that is fighting with all its national strength to divide politics, civil administration, and military affairs into three departments. From this, it can be seen that Britain will never recognize Gandhi's proposal. Gandhi's intention is to temporarily remove the sign of British influence and withdrawal, so that the impression of harmony permeates internally and externally, and to make Britain less stubborn and more superficial, in order to speculate on the great anti-British movement. This is actually a major political offensive against Britain.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Bombay, Gandhi issued a statement on the 14th, saying: Cripps' proposal on the Indian issue is tantamount to splitting India, so I cannot accept the proposal. Indian freedom should have been realized long ago. If Cripps' proposal can be implemented, Indian freedom will be greatly hindered. Jinnah, the head of the Muslim League, may not oppose my proposal, but the British government never wants to solve the issue of Indian independence, using Jinnah as an excuse and not giving India freedom. Therefore, we must eliminate the evils that suppress Indian freedom.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Poona, Kangatthal, the former Governor of Mumbai Province, was imprisoned in August 1943 for his relationship with the Congress Party's disobedience movement. He was released on the 14th. This is the first release of a Congress Party leader after Gandhi's release.

### Heavy Sacrifices in European Invasion, Fierce Fighting in the Battle for Saint-Lô, 500,000 British Troops Gather in the Caen Area

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 14th that the US army had suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting with the German army in the forest northwest of Saint-Lô. The US army on the Carentan-Périers highway has continued its offensive in the past few days, and the fighting is now intensifying. The German army has made a planned retreat in the area between the Cotentin Peninsula's western wing high swamp area and the coast, and continues to prevent the enemy army from advancing in the defensive position in the Lessey-Haut Kocher swamp area. Since the US army launched its invasion operation in and northwest of Saint-Lô, it has carried out the largest artillery battle, with a battle line of about 10 kilometers, bombarded with 100 cannons, and has continued for several hours.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The US army's major offensive in the southern Cotentin Peninsula, which began on July 2, has only extended 10 kilometers south from the line of Saint-Lô-Duville-Rimou-Male-Kagers-to-Dut-Vil River as of the 14th. The US army has suffered heavy losses in the 12 days, and has only reached the line of Angoville-Lalo-Seri and Pont-Hebert, advancing an average of only 500 meters per day. This kind of snail's pace is no different from that in Italy, which shows how little the US army has accomplished. There is no major change in the war near Lalo Seri. The US army has made slight progress between the Dut Ville River. The German tank corps has launched a surprise attack deep into the US army's position. In the past 24 hours, the anti-Axis army launched a large-scale offensive on the Trebehou-Pont Hebert line and has broken through several points. The German army is now counterattacking. The US army has not yet reached the Périers-Saint-Lô highway.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The British Second Army occupies a bridgehead of 800 square kilometers between Caen and Bayeux. The British army is now gathering troops, four army corps and two tank divisions. It is estimated that the total strength in the area (including domestic army and autonomous area army) is about 500,000 people. It is expected that the front line of the bridgehead has about 3,000 tanks, but 1,500 have been destroyed since the start of the invasion (excluding those captured by the national army).

Heavy Losses for British and American Ships

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The British Navy Department and the US Navy Department published a list on July 13, announcing the losses of Japanese warships from June 6 to July 13. However, according to German naval personnel, the list only includes one-seventh of the actual losses of British and American ships. The actual number of British and American warships sunk from June 6 to July 13 is as follows: 2 heavy cruisers, 4 other cruisers, 26 destroyers, 1 transport ship, and 1 speedboat. The number of those heavily damaged includes several British and American capital ships, 22 cruisers, 25 destroyers, 13 speedboats, and 28 special landing craft. German naval officials said at the end that the above figures do not include enemy warships that were sunk by mines.

### Lin Dingchang Hosts Capital News, Announces Organizational and Personnel Adjustments

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Propaganda Lin Baisheng hosted a tea party for the capital's Chinese and foreign press and relevant propaganda personnel of various countries' embassies in China at the Fuyuan Hotel on the 2nd floor at 3:30 PM on the 15th. More than 60 people attended. First, Minister Lin stood up and explained the past propaganda work of the Ministry and expressed his gratitude to everyone for their assistance. As the Great East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, in order to strengthen the efficiency of future reporting and propaganda and complete the task of the decisive battle, the Ministry's organization and personnel have been adjusted. It is hoped that all comrades will express their opinions on the future work of each propaganda section, so that we can jointly review and work together. Then, a discussion began. Reporters from various Chinese and foreign news agencies and newspapers raised issues such as strengthening propaganda against the enemy, improving the methods of news censorship, and organizing a gathering of Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital. Mr. Lin answered in detail, and the result was very satisfactory. It ended at about 5 o'clock.

(Another report) The personnel adjustments for the cadres of the Ministry of Propaganda have been decided. Director of the Propaganda Enterprise Department Yang Honglie was transferred to the position of consulting member. Director of the Special Propaganda Department Fa Chiping was transferred to the position of Director of the Propaganda Enterprise Department. Chief Editor Wu Zongbao was transferred to the position of Director of the Special Propaganda Department.

### Empty Words of Joint US-China War Effort in Chongqing

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Military experts here have recently expressed their views on the joint operations between the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, and explained the truth behind the US's enthusiastic calls for joint US-China warfare. The gist of their remarks is as follows: Since the Japanese army launched its mainland offensive, the Chongqing side, in its internal and external propaganda, has emphasized that while the Henan and Hunan campaigns are important to Chongqing, the key to the overall situation lies in strengthening air force and mechanical power, as well as the situation on the India-Burma front. Judging from their words, it seems they believe the responsibility for the mainland front lies with the US and Britain. This is essentially Chongqing's demand that US weapons must absolutely cooperate with the Chongqing army in combat, and they hope to use joint US-China warfare to escape a major crisis. The US, on the one hand, pretends that the US Air Force will not fail Chongqing's expectations, but on the other hand, it still pursues its own ambitions, driving the Chongqing army to fight against Japan. The Japanese army on the Chinese front has captured Changsha and taken Hengyang airfield. Chongqing's important air force bases are not only being successively occupied or destroyed by the Japanese army, but the US Air Force is also suffering heavy blows. In this situation, both Chongqing and the US are suffering, but in reality, Chongqing's sacrifices are extremely great. The reason why the Chongqing army is suffering such heavy losses is, in a word, that they do not understand the nature of the US Air Force. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is now rampaging across the Chinese mainland. In fact, their stationing is driven by the realization of America's arrogant ambitions. Even their concentration of forces on air raids against Japan and on harassing attacks against the Japanese army's rear supply lines does not help Chongqing. What the Chongqing army expects is cooperation with the Chongqing field army in direct combat with the Japanese fighter squadrons. The US Air Force, however, is solely willing to attack the Japanese mainland. This kind of reality can be seen everywhere in the new war. The "joint US-China warfare" shouted by the US military is nothing more than this. In reality, the enemy and the US are by no means cooperating with the Chongqing army in combat. If the Chongqing army fails to see through this situation, they will inevitably suffer the same pain as the US Air Force on the front lines at the hands of the Japanese army.

Miao People of Guizhou Resent the US Military

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Recently, a young man named Liu, who escaped from Guiyang, passed through Guilin, Wuzhou, and other places, and arrived in Guangzhou a few days ago. According to reports, this young man is thirty years old this year. Last spring, he served as a transport worker for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, responsible for liaison between Kunming and Guiyang. In late March of this year, he and several friends secretly left Guiyang and returned to his hometown of Guangzhou. According to him, the Miao people of Guizhou are extremely resentful of the atrocities of the US Air Force. The following is a record of his conversation: The US Air Force is now using US dollars to manipulate the Chinese people, because those they employ are all paid in US dollars. Therefore, the monthly living expenses for a family of three (husband, wife, and child) in Guiyang now require 5,000 yuan. Being a minor official is not as lucrative as being their servant. In January and February of last year, there were about 740 British and Americans in Guiyang. In addition, there were air force marines carrying automatic rifles everywhere. They often carried bottles of whiskey and would immediately get drunk and pass out in the streets, or dance wildly in the middle of the road with women by their side. Although a US military officer was shot and killed by the Chongqing Air Force, causing a major issue, we could only swallow our anger and remain silent. In short, they squander money without restraint, which delights unscrupulous merchants, but the people suffer unspeakably. In particular, the three million Miao people out of the nine million population of Guizhou Province are extremely disgusted by this. The Miao people organized the Jingzhong Society in 1938, but after it was suppressed by the Chongqing army, it was reorganized into the Xueguang Society. In September, the Chongqing army killed hundreds of members of the Jingzhong Society. Furthermore, due to tax increases and other issues, the 68th Division was dispatched to suppress them, resulting in 3,500 casualties. Recently, the oppression of the Miao people has intensified, and the resentment of the Miao people has also become increasingly profound. They will be even more angered by the US Air Force, which is working hand in hand with the Chongqing army. At the end of March this year, the Xueguang Society's self-defense army raided the US Air Force in Guiyang, and weapons depots, heavy-duty vehicles, and so on were all destroyed.

### Rice Prices Fall in Nanjing

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The supply of rice in Nanjing is abundant, and prices have fallen. Superior rice is about 4,200 yuan, and ordinary rice is 2,700 to 2,800 yuan.

Rice Prices Stabilize in Hangzhou

Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the local authorities promulgated the "Temporary Measures for Civil Food" to protect rice merchants, allow them to freely transport rice to designated areas, increase supply, and strictly prohibit black market price gouging, the situation regarding civil food in this city has been improving daily. It is learned that there is a large amount of rice stored in the eastern Zhejiang area recently, and the price is around 3,000 yuan per dan. General traders are eager to take advantage of the potential profits. According to transportation circles, there are more than 1,000 people transporting rice into the city along accessible roads. If each person carries two dou per day, then more than 200 dan of rice arrive in the city daily, which is beneficial to the supply. As a result, people's minds are at ease, and the selling price is gradually softening.

### Ministry of Education Promotes the Zhuyin Symbols

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Zhuyin symbols are the only tool for correcting pronunciation and unifying the national language. The Ministry of Education compiled and distributed the "Zhuyin Symbols Training Booklet" in May 1930 to promote it in various regions. In July of the same year, it also formulated 25 measures for provinces, cities, and counties to promote the Zhuyin symbols, and informed the municipal governments and ordered local education departments to comply. After the national government returned to the capital, the Ministry of Education reprinted the national language textbooks with Zhuyin symbols in 1941, and in April of the same year, it issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, instructing their subordinate schools to emphasize national pronunciation in the national language subject. In August of the same year, it reissued the "Zhuyin Symbols Training Booklet" and implementation measures, instructing their strict implementation, and appropriately reprinted the "Training Booklet" for widespread instruction, with the aim of universal application. The Ministry of Education now believes that schools in various regions are not vigorously promoting the instruction and application of the Zhuyin symbols, and that the teaching of the national language subject still often uses local dialects. Efforts should be made to correct this in order to achieve the effect of unifying national pronunciation. It has specially issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, instructing their subordinates to comply with the aforementioned measures, work hard to promote them, and hold summer training sessions, etc., and the subject should be listed as a required course to be taught effectively, with the aim of achieving practical results. On the one hand, it will also adopt relevant measures to establish national language training institutes by the ministry, etc., to transfer personnel from the educational institutions of various provinces and cities to Beijing for training, and order various provinces and cities to hold national pronunciation research meetings in order to promote this.

### North China Stipulates the Scope of Major Materials

Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The National Government announced on June 16 the "Temporary Regulations for Punishing Economic Disruptions in North China" to strengthen economic control in North China, curb prices, and stabilize people's livelihood. Those who hoard and engage in other economic disruptions will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The North China Political Affairs Committee, in accordance with Article 2 of the regulations, decided on the types of major items. After repeated review, in addition to war materials and food, it also broadly included general necessities of life. The scope of major items was announced on the 14th and implemented immediately.

### Burma Hires Japanese Experts to Assist in Governance

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Mr. Ogawa Gotaro, the supreme advisor to the Burmese government, is currently staying in Tokyo and is scheduled to return to his post before the anniversary of Burmese independence on August 1. He has completed all arrangements for the Burmese government to recruit experts in various fields, and the selections have all been made. In addition, regarding the recruitment of Japanese professors to revitalize Yangon University, Kyoto Imperial University is currently the focus, but the selection of personnel will be officially announced by the Burmese government. According to the policy at the time of Burmese independence, everything was to be handled independently as much as possible. Later, with the progress of the times, it was deemed unnecessary to adhere to the initial policy, and it was decided to hire Japanese authorities from all walks of life as consultants. Therefore, Ogawa came to Tokyo to discuss in detail with Dr. Ba Tin, the head of the Burmese special inspection team visiting Japan, and actively carried out the project. Currently, the internal selections are all first-class Japanese experts, covering agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, transportation, communications, and other departments. It is expected that after the experts go to Burma, they will make great contributions to the progress of Burmese administration.

### German Troops at Lutsk Strategically Retreat; Defenders of Vilnius Bravely Break Through

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports, military news: On Friday, after several hours of heavy artillery bombardment by Soviet forces, a large-scale offensive, which had been anticipated, was launched between Tarnopol (southeastern old Poland) and Lutsk.

Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - Military news: The war on the Eastern Front is intensifying, and German troops are continuing to conduct avoidance maneuvers, switching to defending shorter and stronger lines. After destroying important military installations in the city of Lutsk, German troops have withdrawn from the city. Military figures emphasize that in order to shorten the defense lines, it is necessary to withdraw from certain cities, but the German retreat is entirely in accordance with the pre-determined plan of the command. After receiving supplies from the air, the German garrison of Vilnius bravely broke through, opening a path to the main German defensive area, during which they had to cross the Viliya River twice.

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch: Marshal Stalin announced on Sunday that Soviet troops had occupied Vilnius and Pinsk.

Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - The breakthrough of the German garrison in Vilnius on the Eastern Front should be given importance in terms of military momentum. German troops are continuing to retreat between North Lutvina and Pskov. This move is to secure the Baltic states and consolidate German defenses. While German troops were conducting this avoidance maneuver, fierce fighting took place between Idritsa and Novosokholniki, as Soviet troops attempted to obstruct the German retreat. The focus of the war on the Eastern Front is now on Daugavpils. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked German positions there, and the fighting is fierce, but all attacks have been repulsed by German troops. Another focus of the war is north and south of Grodno. German positions there are also under heavy attack by the enemy. German artillery concentrated its bombardment and ultimately defeated them. On the southern and central fronts, German troops have withdrawn from the city of Pinsk, but the enemy has not yet attacked the city. This is due to the original German plan to establish an obstacle line behind the Shchara River to the east of Brest-Litovsk. Reconnaissance patrols are active on the southern front. German and Hungarian forces encountered Soviet forces in the advance of Kolomyia in the Carpathians. Soviet reconnaissance patrols penetrated German positions but were repulsed by counterattacks. The thin German forces in Plock have withdrawn to the main defensive area.

### German Troops in Italy Constructing Goth Line; Impregnable Using Natural Defenses

Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a British dispatch from Naples: German troops in Italy are building a new fortress, the "Goth Line." The original dispatch is as follows: Staff officers of General Alexander, the Allied commander on the Italian front, predict that the German Goth Line will be even stronger than the Gustav Line at Cassino in southern Italy. The Goth Line stretches approximately 80 kilometers, lying northwest of the Trasimene Line. It is a major fortress built on mountains 1,900 meters above sea level. German troops are using all major defenses to construct positions and firing points, and are further constructing a key fortress on the 903-meter-high Futa Pass on the Trasimene-Bologna highway. The mountain road leading up to the pass is impassable. German troops have constructed many firing points there. The Apennine peaks are covered with snow and difficult to traverse after late autumn. In addition, the dense forests obscure the sky, making it impossible to reconnoiter German movements from the air.

Paratroopers Launch Surprise Attack to Regain High Ground Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 14th: The focus of the fighting in Italy is currently north of Lake Trasimeno and on both banks of the Tiber River. German troops are launching counterattacks in various places to close or repel Allied breakthroughs. In the Pucciarelli area, Allied forces stubbornly attacked under the cover of numerous tanks. German troops temporarily abandoned this strategically important location. After a counterattack by German paratroopers, the enemy was repelled, and important high ground south of Poggio was retaken.

Commander of Italian Legion Killed

Milan, 15th (German News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Italian military headquarters, the often-praised commander of the famous "Barbarigo" Legion was recently murdered by communists. The communists also murdered several soldiers returning from the Anzio front, including three naval officers and five sailors, all belonging to the aforementioned legion.

### Allied Powers Exert Pressure on Turkey

Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - British and American officials are cautious in their statements regarding negotiations with Turkey. US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt, after meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, declared that the Allied powers would intensify cooperation with Turkey. Secretary of State Hull stated that Turkey has repeatedly encountered opportunities to discuss issues of advancing relations with the Allied powers, and is now encountering another opportunity to discuss these issues. Responsible parties in Berlin have not mentioned the Allied powers' demands on Turkey, but they are not lacking in information. The news from British and American newspapers and news agencies is contradictory, with some saying that Turkey is about to join the war or break off relations with Germany, and then cede Turkish airfields and Straits bases to the Allied powers. British and American newspapers claim that the initiator of the negotiations is the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union remains silent. From all sides, the British ambassador seems to be the most active. "The Daily Telegraph" believes that the Soviet Union hopes to join the Anglo-Turkish alliance. Well-informed sources in Berlin are skeptical of this, because both Britain and the Soviet Union have ambitions for the Straits, and it is difficult for them to be sincere with each other. "The Daily Bulletin" reported that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will go to Turkey in a short time to participate in the negotiations. This is also possible, but the rumor that Vyshinsky is already in Turkey has been disproven.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Turkish Foreign Ministry met with reporters on the 14th and stated that it is true that the representatives of the British, American, and Soviet governments have begun to be active in Turkish diplomatic circles again, but the Turkish government has repeatedly reiterated its hope that the Turkish people will stand outside the war. To this day, the Turkish government cannot adopt any other policy. Regarding the oppression of Soviet policy, it is still doubtful whether it can win the sympathy of the United States and Britain. As for what demands the Allied camp is now making on the Turkish government, it is feared that it cannot be stated clearly. All that the Allied propaganda organs are spreading is contradictory.

### US Ambassador to Spain Returns Home for Consultations

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - US Ambassador to Spain Hayes called on Spanish Head of State General Franco on the 12th and then traveled to Washington via Lisbon to report to Roosevelt.

### Mandel Assassinated

Vichy, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - Former French cabinet minister Mandel has now been shot and killed. According to an official statement, Mandel was extradited by the Germans to the French judicial authorities and transferred to the French National Prison for detention. While being escorted to a certain detention camp, the vehicle he was traveling in was ambushed on a country road. Gunfire erupted, and Mandel was killed.

### French National Day Passes Peacefully

Paris, 15th (German News Agency Dispatch) - Qualified sources here recently told this agency's reporter that yesterday (the 14th) was the French National Day, and no disturbances occurred throughout the country. Jewish, London-based, and North African Algerian French committees, as well as those employed by Moscow, have all called on French people to hold large-scale demonstrations and general strikes, but all have been rejected by the French.

### London Implements Evacuation Plan

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to "The Times" of London: The city of London has recently evacuated its population according to plan. The evacuees are defined as: 1. Primary and secondary school students aged 5 to 10; 2. Mothers with children under the age of 5; 3. The infirm; 4. Minors; and 5. Those who do not need to stay in the city and wish to evacuate. The plan is supervised and implemented by the London City Council. Everything is the same as the evacuation during the large-scale air raids of previous years. The Security Department has also announced that underground air-raid shelters will be opened soon. There are eight of these air-raid shelters, all more than 100 feet below ground. Recently, the number of children evacuated from London has reached 50,000. Five trains depart from Marylebone Station every morning, each carrying 4,000 people, mostly primary school students aged 5 to 18, accompanied by teachers, evacuating to Yorkshire. Special trains also depart from other stations, carrying batches of children to the west of England and Wales.

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (German News Agency Dispatch) - A total of 133,000 women and children have been evacuated from the London area due to the German "V-1" plane attacks.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 14th: Since the V-1 has been used, due to the significant increase in its striking distance, it can now be launched from the interior.

### The Balkan Embroiled in War Clouds

The war on the Eastern Front is raging from north to south like wildfire, intensifying with each passing day. The Balkans are bearing the brunt of this. One of the goals of the Soviet Red Army's summer offensive this year naturally includes the Balkans. However, the Balkans are the foundation of Germany's resistance, and for Germany, which is decisively dealing with the Allies' three-pronged offensive from the east, west, and south with a strategy of "offensive defense," the Balkans are crucial to defend. It can be said that Germany stands if the Balkans stand, and Germany falls if the Balkans fall. Precisely because of this relationship, my ears are filled with the clamor of intensified war in the north, and the shouts of battle from the east, as I hasten like the wind towards the Balkans. My destination is Romania, which is often said to be the most tense. On my journey, I certainly plan to visit Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, and other places, but for now, I will report on the situation in the Balkans from Bucharest, the capital of Romania.

The Capital in High Summer

During my journey across the Balkans, I was attacked by Allied aircraft more than once. At that time, I had to jump out of the train and lie down in the fields, but in the end, it was not worth being alarmed, and it did not hinder the train from continuing its journey, which made me silently thankful. Bucharest is already in the heat of high summer, and compared to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which is guarded by the Guards, the temperature difference is truly like heaven and earth.

Since April 4th of this year, the tragedy of the large-scale bombing of Romania by British and American aircraft has been keenly felt as soon as I arrived in Bucharest at night. From the temporary tram terminal on the main street to the central tram station, a considerable distance, one had to walk slowly. Later, I squeezed onto a crowded city tram, and only because I had just a handbag in my hand was I able to get on. The hotel, which I found in the darkness due to the strict blackout, is said to be the last remaining hotel in Bucharest, but this only hotel had also been destroyed in the first bombing and had only just been restored to its former appearance two or three days ago.

Germany and Romania Live or Die Together

Romania's primary concern is opposing the Soviet Union. Therefore, Bucharest's greatest worry is when the Soviet Union will coordinate with the British and Americans to land on the coast of northern France and when the summer offensive will begin on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, the Red Army broke the long silence and launched a major offensive on June 22nd. The current center of the war is certainly in the central theater, but the Red Army in the area from the Carpathian Mountains to Bessarabia is watching with fierce eyes and eager to try. Although an active, large-scale offensive has not yet been launched there, the date when the border region will become a battlefield of earth-shattering decisive battles is undoubtedly approaching day by day. This is the focal point of attention for all people in Romania, from top to bottom.

Magazines and newspapers are all publishing German communiqués in a uniform manner, and are filled with reports on the situation in Normandy. Although this is enough to alarm the Romanian people, if the British and Americans do not directly attack the Balkans, Romania will still fully trust Germany's military strength. The various opinions on the country's stance cannot be fully expressed, and are merely monotonous boilerplate articles.

German newspapers, however, are very different from Romanian newspapers. They are not pessimistic or passive, but rather show an active trend. For example, the editorial of the German Bucharest Daily repeatedly shouted:

"The future destiny of Romania is not only determined by the advance of the Soviet Red Army, but also by the decisive battle in the English Channel. If the British and Americans succeed in landing in Western Europe, Romania will only be able to die together with Germany."

The Political Nature of the Bombing: Bucharest itself has only been bombed ten times before, but this city of one million people has already evacuated about 200,000 people, and most of the main agencies have long been dispersed to the suburbs 100 kilometers away. Among the foreign embassies, only those of Japan and Germany have not been evacuated. Romania's air defense facilities are truly dwarfed by those of Germany, so the daily spirit of the Romanian people is entirely focused on air raids. Because of this, the British and American terrorist air raids are not only limited to military targets, but also include political objectives, as can be clearly seen from their bombing methods. Since entering Romanian territory, I have seen countless devastated scenes of bombed towns and villages and stations before arriving in Bucharest. At the same time, I personally witnessed the air defense facilities in the Ploiești oilfield area on the train. What I felt particularly about that place was the political nature of the air raids.

The most appropriate example is the kerosene facilities in Ploiești. There, there is a complete air defense organization jointly defended by Germany and Romania. When enemy aircraft attack, they cover the entire area with the most harmful smoke screen. Although such terror is carried out, after undergoing the same ten bombings, the oil depots of the refinery area are still neatly arranged.

Only upon arriving in Bucharest did I learn that the actual losses of the oil field were very small. On the contrary, the American broadcast in Rome said that "the refinery was completely destroyed," which is a huge lie. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the British and Americans can truly satisfy the demands of the Soviet Union and completely destroy these facilities.

The Attitude of Various Countries Toward Romania

According to an authoritative journalist in Bucharest: "In Bucharest alone, 10,000 innocent civilians have been bombed to death. In the countryside, even working farmers, churches, and schools have been subjected to enemy air raids. The purpose of this despicable behavior is, of course, to disrupt the national spirit and make them betray and break away from the German alliance. However, the British and American air forces, very strangely, do not actively attack items prepared for resisting the Soviet Union. Currently, oil tankers heading to the Soviet front line are continuously dragging like long snake formations. Although some enemy aircraft will try to destroy the oil storage stations, this is related to the British aircraft bombing the mouth of the Danube and dropping mines into the Danube River. The purpose seems to be to hinder the transport trains heading to Germany, to weaken Germany's military strength on the Western European and Italian fronts."

Regardless of whether these remarks are true or not, it is worth noting that the conflict of interests between the British and Americans in the Balkans and the Soviet Union is also manifested in this point. At the same time, the different styles of the British and Americans can also be fully demonstrated here. American aircraft mainly attack during the day, often openly charging into the city airspace with large formations of three to five hundred aircraft without any hesitation. However, British aircraft often sneak into the city airspace with two or three aircraft. This proves that Britain is inhumanely unleashing the power of aircraft in Germany, but in the Balkans, it does not want to offend the masses and attempts to make the United States solely bear the people's hatred. It can truly be said that Britain's intentions are thorough. Therefore, in terms of bombing, Britain is very cunning, taking advantage of the United States' implementation of terrorist bombings to carry out the work of winning over people's hearts. In contrast to the British and Americans, the Soviet Union is not anxious, but very calm. The bombing is limited to direct combat front targets. The reason for its calm response is that Germany tightly restrains the Soviet air force and has no time to take care of other places. In terms of strength, the close cooperation between the German and Romanian armies can be seen along the railway lines, at airfields, in streets and alleys, and in rural farmhouses. This is not allowed to be swayed by the war situation or the people of Germany's mainland due to schemes.

Abundant Food Supply

What I see in the streets and alleys is the abundance of the food supply. The food served in all the restaurants surprised me, and I couldn't tell that I was eating in a country at war. The 350 grams of meat that can only be eaten once a week in Germany can be eaten in a single meal in Bucharest. Even cold rice, which is not seen at all in Germany, is readily available in Bucharest. I went to a low-class restaurant that was packed, and was even served meat soup with bones. Although household food is rationed, there is no inconvenience. Because Romania is an agricultural and livestock country, the food supply has always been abundant, whether in Bucharest or Budapest. Especially last year, due to the bumper wheat harvest, even beggars ate white bread. I had not tasted white bread for a long time, and this time I especially felt that it was delicious. But on the other hand, I felt that Germany's food supply was definitely not a problem, because it relied on Romania, so there was no need to worry about Germany. Everywhere in Bucharest, one can hear that grain production is being increased in the Balkans, and under the guidance of German technology and machinery, the harvest is becoming more and more effective.

The number of foodstuffs currently supplied by Romania to Germany, as well as the situation of trade, is kept secret by the authorities, and we cannot find out. However, I believe that if the eating of Romanians and Hungarians is further restricted in the future, their surplus food will definitely be abundant and sufficient to ensure Germany's wartime food policy.

Although living conditions have deteriorated since the war, every Romanian or Hungarian still eats at least two portions of German food.

Oil-Rich Country

Due to the conscription of tires, chauffeur-driven cars have disappeared completely in recent times, but because of the country's richness in oil, anyone with a car has been able to purchase gasoline in large quantities without restriction since the outbreak of war. In 1940, kerosene production fell to 4 million tons, but later, due to the revision of the kerosene law, the expulsion of foreign capital from Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and the adoption of German technology to reorganize various measures, the oilfield production, which had gradually shrunk since 1936, was corrected last year, and an unprecedented achievement was harvested, reaching 5.5 million tons. In the future, it is still possible to hope for further increase in production. The limit of its possibility is of course also determined by the requirements on the front line. In addition, regarding the refining capacity, it is said to be able to ensure 10 million tons, so in fact, it has not been threatened by bombers.

As for transportation agencies, oil pipelines have now been installed in the Danube River, and other strengthening measures have also been meticulously planned, so Germany's wartime kerosene consumption need not be worried about. If Romania's kerosene is completely monopolized by Germany in the future, its adoption capacity will also be improved. This proves that Germany's fuel problem will definitely not be affected.

### ### Minister of Justice and Administration Zhang Dies of Illness in Shanghai Yesterday, Dedicated His Life to Judicial and Social Causes

Minister of Justice and Administration Zhang Yipeng recently suffered from typhus and was treated at Fuxing Hospital. Unfortunately, due to his advanced age and frail health, his resistance was weak, and he passed away at 4:00 PM on the 15th. The passing of an elder statesman has caused grief to all who heard of it. In particular, Zhang, at the age of over seventy, took office as the Minister of Justice and Administration, and during his half-term in office, he actively promoted and gradually reorganized judicial administration. At the same time, he spared no effort to improve prisoner food, increase funding, and improve the treatment of judicial personnel and prisoners, benefiting them greatly. All these measures were sufficient to give judicial administration a new look. Alas, Heaven did not grant him many years, and he was unable to complete the entire improvement of judicial administration. Secondly, Zhang has devoted much effort to social causes in recent years, such as serving as the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association and the Chairman of the Shanghai Savings Association. Zhang also had a close relationship with this newspaper. When the late General Manager of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai, took over this newspaper in the early years of the Republic, Zhang was one of the key intermediaries. Until recently, he still served as an advisor to this newspaper. Also, Mr. Zhang served as the Director-General of the fifth session of the scholarship fund run by this newspaper, instructing everything. He personally conducted individual examinations and oral tests for university students who needed assistance, and his enthusiasm was truly immeasurable.

The Progression of the Illness

Since returning from his inspection of North China, he was quite fatigued, but because he paid too much attention to the affairs of the Ministry of Justice, he refused to rest and continued to travel between Beijing and Shanghai for official business, which mentally exhausted him. On the 24th of last month, he inspected the Shanghai Detention Center and, out of excessive concern, personally inspected the prisoner wards. Unexpectedly, he contracted fleas there and was invaded by bacteria. After returning to Beijing, he began to develop a fever on July 5th, but he still tried his best to perform his duties, disregarding the repeated勸告 of friends and family to take a break. It was not until the 8th, when his fever became too high, that he returned to Shanghai to recuperate. On the 10th, his fever increased, and his condition became serious. He was admitted to Fuxing Hospital, where Dr. Le Wenzhao diagnosed him with typhus. On the 12th, he became delirious and entered a coma. However, what he said still revolved around the affairs of the Ministry of Justice, and he did not mention family matters at all. During this period, the Japanese Embassy Office and the Naval Attaché Office dispatched renowned doctors to provide care, but ultimately, due to the excessively high fever and the deterioration of the illness, coupled with his advanced age and weak strength, he passed away at Fuxing Hospital at 4:15 PM yesterday (the 15th).

The Date for the Encoffining

Zhang's remains were transported to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road that evening. The encoffining is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th). As Minister, he took office on January 16th of this year. At that time, there was an arrangement that he would serve for six months, at the end of which he would retire. Unexpectedly, he continued to serve until his death, exactly six months.

A Brief Biography

Zhang was 73 years old this year, a native of Wuxian. He was a Juren in the Gui Si year of the Guangxu reign. He graduated from Tokyo Hosei University in Japan. He successively served as the Director of the Beijing Local Procuratorate, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanxi High Procuratorate, the Director of the Jiangxi Department of Finance, the President of the Pingzheng Yuan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Acting Minister, and Special Envoy for Opium Suppression. In the tenth year of the Republic, he returned to Suzhou to practice law and served as the President of the Shanghai Bar Association. He also handled local public welfare matters. On January 16th of the 33rd year of the Republic, he took office as the Minister of Justice of the National Government, until the time of his death.

### ### National Obligatory Labor Corps Implements Service

This morning at 8:00 AM, the Municipal National Obligatory Labor Corps assembled 200 members at the Corps headquarters, divided them into four teams, and, wearing armbands and carrying the necessary tools, went to various locations such as Zhonghua Road and Minguo Road to clear garbage, as well as Yanhai Road and other places to build roads, and Minli Street and other places to reclaim wasteland. It is also reported that the China Film Culture Production Factory dispatched technicians to shoot newsreels, and it is said that the police branch in charge also dispatched a large number of officers and police to the scene to maintain order.

### ### District Procuratorate Thoroughly Reorganizes Bailiffs

Since Mr. Zhao Zhengkai took office as the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, he has thoroughly reorganized the judicial police. Recently, it has been heard that there are still many criticisms of the judicial police. In order to thoroughly improve the situation, Chief Prosecutor Zhao has repeatedly consulted and decided to dismiss bailiffs with poor conduct. At the same time, he has formulated various binding rules for the existing bailiffs, such as prohibiting them from wearing uniforms when going out for non-official business, to avoid flaunting their status. He has also issued a notice allowing litigants to report unscrupulous bailiffs. The original text of the notice is recorded as follows: Notice is hereby given that this Procuratorate handles cases and instructs the police to handle summonses, deliveries, detentions, bails, reports, and all internal and external exhortation duties such as searches and investigations, without charging any fees. Bailiffs are also not allowed to make any demands. Notices have been issued repeatedly to make this known. However, recently, rumors have circulated that there are still a few unscrupulous police officers who disregard the prohibition and use pretexts to make demands. Such disregard for law and discipline is extremely illegal. Since taking office, this Chief Prosecutor and all colleagues have been working together to encourage each other. We deeply hope that all litigants will understand this intention. From now on, if any police officer makes things difficult for bail or following bail, or makes demands on the grounds of summoning or detaining, please immediately report or accuse them by name, or send a letter to this Chief Prosecutor, so that they can be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the law, and no leniency will be shown. This notice is hereby issued so that litigants will pay attention and not be deceived again.

### ### North District Security Transfer Celebratory Meeting Held Yesterday, Mayor Chen Sent a Representative to Deliver Instructions

The special security and police work in Beiqiao in this city was transferred from the Allied Powers to our country on June 1st of this year. To commemorate this event, the District Office held a celebratory meeting at the Minhang Town Stadium in the district at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 15th). In attendance were Zhou Huarong, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner representing Mayor Chen, Chief Xiong of the Security Department representing Han Shangying, Xu Chao, the representative of the East Asia League Shanghai Branch and the Municipal Party Headquarters, the commander of the German headquarters of the Allied Powers Japan, the commander of the Kuroki Military Police, Liaison Officer Takada, Lieutenant Kuwahata, and the head of the District Office, Gong Huanfei, as well as over 15,000 people from the Self-Defense Corps, police brigade, security team, youth corps, etc., creating an unprecedented grand occasion.

Remarks by the District Head

The meeting began at 10:00 AM. After District Head Gong, as chairman, performed the ceremony, he delivered an opening address, which stated: "The Allied Powers have transferred the security of this district, allowing us to seek modern construction based on self-reliance, starting from the local level and expanding to the entire area, making the promises of the Allied Treaty a reality, for which we are extremely grateful. During the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan should have the spirit of sharing the same hatred. We should consciously shoulder the responsibility of consolidating the rear area's security and cooperate with Japan to complete the war. Although the security of this district has been transferred, we should humbly seek advice and carry forward the spirit of harmonious cooperation. In the future, we deeply hope that the Allied Powers will not hesitate to give us guidance on various local administrative measures."

Remarks by the Mayor

Next, Zhou Huarong, representing Mayor Chen, delivered instructions, which stated: "The Father of the Nation said that without Japan, there would be no China. Based on this statement, we can carry forward the spirit of living and dying together. Now that the Allied Powers are fighting on the front lines, we must establish security and increase production in the rear. At the beginning of this year, the Chairman told us that the three main tasks for this year are: First, to ensure security; Second, to increase production; Third, to rectify thought. Therefore, the security transfer of this district is proof of achieving the first point. After the security transfer, the administration of the Beiqiao District is entirely our own responsibility, and we must strive for progress to demonstrate the spirit of the Chinese people, and we hope that the people will stand on the same line with Japan to achieve the goal of liberating East Asia. This moral spirit, we firmly believe, will be developed from Shanghai to the whole country, from the whole country to East Asia, and is also a sign of the bright future of East Asia."

Remarks by the Commander

Subsequently, the commander of the German headquarters delivered a speech, which stated that he was sincerely pleased that the district held a celebratory meeting for the security transfer. The security transfer of this district is due to the efforts of everyone. After the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, China and Japan have reached further cooperation. The security transfer is not a sign of separation between China and Japan. Now, the security of the district must still be jointly worked on to achieve a peaceful and prosperous environment. We also hope that the security of other districts can also be ensured for transfer, which is what we expect. Subsequently, Han Shangying, Zhu Zhongxian, Lin Qing and others delivered speeches in succession, with many words of encouragement. Then, a presentation ceremony of souvenirs was held. District Head Gong presented a banner to the commander of the German headquarters, with the words "Living and Dying Together" embroidered on it. Following this was the flag-granting ceremony for the Self-Defense Corps. Everyone paid their respects to Chairman Chen, representing the Mayor, and the Allied Powers, and finally took photos and shouted slogans before dispersing.

### ### Li Shiyu to Broadcast Tonight

In order to prevent crime and maintain local security, the Judicial District of the First Police Bureau of this city has established a crime prevention section to handle various matters such as crime prevention propaganda. However, this type of organization is the first of its kind in our country, and the public is not very clear about the meaning of crime prevention. Therefore, Director Li Shiyu will broadcast "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and the Prospects of Crime Prevention Work" from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM tonight (the 16th) at the Shanghai Radio Station, explaining in detail the true meaning and mission of crime prevention.

### ### Savings Association to Broadcast a Speech

The 22nd regular broadcast of the Shanghai Special Municipal Savings Association will still be held at the Shanghai Radio Station today (the 16th) at 7:45 PM. The speaker will be Mr. Lu Feng, the current Executive Director of the Association and chief writer for the New China Daily, who will speak on the topic of "True Savings and False Savings." Mr. Lu Feng is a true comrade who practices saving, and his speech today will surely contain cautionary words.

### ### Two Companies Implement Capital Reduction to Enhance Asset Value, Increased Capital Payments to Be Returned

Due to the prosperity of disguised investment enterprises, the stock market has declined sharply. This influence on the development of the entire industrial and commercial enterprise actually hinders the true prosperity of the entire society. Therefore, the government authorities have paid close attention to the company's content of stocks that have fallen into face value for the past few months, and will send personnel to investigate the company's organizational content, business conditions, and asset liability conditions of listed stocks. If it is verified that there are indeed listed stock assets and the business is less than the share value, the listing transaction will be immediately banned, or the business will be ordered to liquidate. Once this case is implemented, it will be able to protect the security of general shareholders. According to reporters, recently, in order to maintain credit and consider the rights of shareholders, in addition to the Right China Cheng Industrial Company's official announcement of voluntary liquidation, all stocks are recovered at face value, and now the Lianhua Real Estate Company and Lunhua Dyeing Factory, in order to reduce籌碼, increase stock prices, and protect shareholders' interests, have each decided to hold a shareholders' meeting on a scheduled date to discuss the implementation of capital reduction and the return of increased capital funds. The method of restitution is roughly to return two shares for every three shares, paid in cash, in full, based on the company's reduction of funds. The money can be used to ensure the value of the stock and demonstrate confidence in the stock value.

### Review of Rice and Grain Issues in Various Regions

Second, prevent purchasing firms from being based in rice and grain distribution centers and entering into contracts with administrative agencies. This has led to the exclusive handling of cash and goods by administrative agencies, resulting in malpractices such as farmers not receiving funds. Cash and goods should be handled exclusively by the firms themselves.

The existence of firms that use poor security as a reason to adopt the aforementioned methods is a fact that deserves the utmost attention. The Rice Control Association has announced that firms should handle their own purchasing, with a profit limit of one hundred yuan per shi. However, most purchasing firms sit idly by, allowing administrative agencies to contract out the purchasing activities, thereby reaping a certain profit. This is truly a foolish and thieving act that undermines the major undertaking of rice and grain control and purchasing.

Moreover, such unscrupulous firms often take the opportunity to undermine the corruption and insincerity within administrative organizations. They cause administrative agencies to engage in wrongdoing and shift all the painful burdens onto the farmers. Such firms should be held responsible for this crime. They are truly traitors to the war effort and the people's livelihood and should be severely punished.

Third, comprehensively eliminate the unscrupulous brokers of various firms. Firms should directly exchange cash and goods with farmers, eliminating all intermediary exploitation.

The purchasing difficulties caused by purely economic profit-seeking, stemming from the significant difference between market prices and purchasing prices, can be rectified without much difficulty. However, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of failing to compensate farmers for their supplies when market prices soar. Corrupt officials and dishonest merchants should be resolutely purged, but new principles should also be established. Firms must absolutely not exploit such unscrupulous individuals. This is, of course, the most difficult task. Overcoming this difficulty is not a technical issue but a major problem related to security, politics, and fundamental reform of purchasing. We must overcome all difficulties to pave the way for this reform; otherwise, we cannot avoid the malpractices of administrative purchasing. (Translated from the Continental New Report, June 24th)

### Subsidies for Private School Teachers to be Distributed Regularly

The fifth batch of the Municipal Education Association's February subsidies for private school teachers and staff, amounting to 500,000 yuan, has been received, and distribution procedures are ready. Distribution will begin on July 17th. However, due to the current school vacation period, the distribution procedures have been slightly modified: Blank receipts will still be distributed by the education associations in each district. After receiving the receipts, each school will distribute them to current teachers and staff for completion and signature, then submit them to the Association to collect the funds. Receipts for teachers and staff who have left the school should be returned and may not be collected on their behalf. The collection period is from July 17th to July 31st. Funds due to teachers and staff who have left the school will be temporarily retained by the Association and can be collected directly from the Association from September 1st to 11th. Failure to collect within the specified period will be considered an automatic waiver. The Association's summer office hours are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily.

### Hongkou Swimming Pool Opened Yesterday: Director Yuan Reports on the Construction Process

The outdoor swimming pool in Hongkou Park in this city, which has been repaired by the authorities, held its opening ceremony yesterday (the 15th) at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Chief Secretary Wu of the Municipal Government, Director Lu of the Health Department, Director Lin of the Education Bureau, Director Zhang Si of the Public Works Bureau, Section Chief Ling Da, Municipal Government official Nagai, and over a thousand other guests from various circles. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chairman Wu delivered a brief opening speech, followed by a speech by Yuan Jing, who provided a detailed account of the construction process. Ms. Wu Xinyi, daughter of Wu Song, then performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, followed by swimming competitions. The program was精彩, garnering much applause. The event concluded at 7:00 PM after Wu Song's wife presented awards, and all participants departed in high spirits.

Director Yuan's Speech

Chairman and distinguished guests: Today is the opening day of this pool. We are deeply honored by your presence. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the facilities and management of this pool to you. In previous years, this pool opened between May and June. This year, due to the intercalary fourth month in the lunar calendar, the weather has been warmer, and improvements to the pool's bottom and equipment have taken time. Therefore, the opening has been delayed until today. Swimming pool water is different from ordinary tap water. Tap water only needs to be disinfected and cleaned. However, swimming pool water, in addition to disinfection and cleaning, must also have bactericidal properties without harming the eyes and skin of swimmers. The color of the water must also be clear, and the depth must be appropriate. Regarding this method of purifying pool water, we use a filtration and disinfection method. Water is drawn from the deep end into the machine room, filtered through the device, and then sprayed into the pool from the shallow end. In between, it also needs to be disinfected with ammonia gas and mixed with other chemicals. This pool has three large filters, with a total capacity of 5,700 gallons. The filtration rate is 60,000 gallons per hour. Based on the total capacity of this pool, all the pool water can be filtered up to five times every twenty hours. Therefore, this pool can maintain the highest standard of cleanliness without the need to change the water.

### Abolish the Tax Farming System

— Shui Youmei

It has long been the case that our city's finances have been riddled with holes. Patching and mending them requires painstaking effort. Recently, due to blocked transportation, declining production, stagnant economic activity, and sharp decreases in local tax revenues, various expenditures have often fallen short of demand. This situation is understandable given the circumstances, and it is not surprising that those in charge are struggling to cope. However, some measures are putting the cart before the horse, or being handled improperly. It is truly not advisable for government authorities to contract out the collection of normal local taxes, thereby enriching a few individuals while reducing the revenue of the municipal treasury.

According to the draft budget for the 33rd fiscal year of our city, the total revenue is estimated at 260,990,374.7 yuan, with taxes and levies accounting for the largest share. Excluding special taxes and subsidies, they account for 41.5% of the total. Among the tax revenues, land tax is the largest, accounting for 40.7% of the total. The authorities have established a tax administration office and assigned personnel to collect it, with a well-developed organization, sound personnel system, and clear rewards and punishments. Those who commit fraud in the books are punished, and those who delay in paying taxes are pursued. These measures have yielded remarkable results. However, taxes on items such as tobacco and alcohol, licenses, bamboo and wood, and pigs are contracted out instead of being collected like land tax. This is a huge loss for the municipal treasury and a failure in the consideration of those in charge. According to the budget, the revenues from the aforementioned taxes account for only 8% of the total, totaling 21,045,572 yuan. This is questionable compared to the facts. To illustrate this point, the contracted amount for bamboo and wood tax alone has reached 1.8 million yuan. Are the revenues from other taxes such as tobacco and alcohol, licenses, and pigs only one-sixth of the bamboo and wood tax?

The tax farming system has numerous drawbacks. It is neither beneficial to the public nor harmless to the people. The Ministry of Finance issued an order in 1936 strictly prohibiting it, requiring local relevant authorities to collect and remit taxes in accordance with the actual amount collected. I accompanied my father on his official travels to a certain county government in Fujian province. At that time, the local finances were in a chaotic state. All taxes such as slaughter, business, tobacco and alcohol, and licenses were contracted out in accordance with provincial orders and established precedents, with fixed tax amounts reported and remitted monthly. When the new chief official took office, such individuals thought they could take advantage of the situation and actively sought out opportunities. As a result, letters of recommendation and introduction were flying in like snowflakes, and the door was worn through by those vying for these opportunities. Some even offered bribes or raised the contracted amount as a reward, displaying all kinds of unsightly behavior and seeking to gain power. That county was a small and remote place, with a sluggish market and limited tax revenue. Yet, the competition was so fierce. It goes without saying that Shanghai, with its thriving business and vast financial resources, is known as the land of gold.

Moreover, those qualified to be tax farmers are often corrupt or redundant officials who have been dismissed from public office, or local tyrants and bullies with strong connections and influence. They are obsequious to their superiors, trying their best to ingratiate themselves in order to maintain their positions. To their inferiors, they act like foxes borrowing the authority of tigers, using their usual tricks of levying exorbitant taxes and extorting money to fill their own pockets. They are willing to spend a considerable amount of money to obtain a low contracted amount, monopolizing the business and prioritizing their own interests. Their contracting methods are divided into large and small contracts. Large contractors add a significant profit margin to the contracted amount and subcontract it to several smaller contractors, thereby reaping the benefits once and for all. With a change of clothes, they become wealthy tycoons? Small contractors, due to their vested interests, aim to collect as much as possible for their own benefit, treating the citizens as 　meat to be slaughtered at will. Their monthly income is something that even high-ranking government officials cannot match. Therefore, those who obtain contracting rights cherish them as treasures. The authorities believe that the limited tax revenue is only enough to cover the collection expenses, so they prefer to contract it out. Little do they know that the actual amount collected far exceeds the contracted amount, not just by a multiple. Due to a momentary lapse in judgment, they give up unlimited rights, causing the citizens to suffer and increasing their unexpected pain. Living under such oppressive rule, they dare not be angry but dare not speak out. In these times of soaring prices and widespread poverty, if they are subjected to exploitation by those who enrich themselves at public expense, it would be like adding insult to injury, leading to immediate death.

The harm of tax farming is not only to the people but also to the government. If this system is not abolished, tax revenues will not be sufficient. Having taxes but not managing them, relying on tax increases is merely an empty gesture. If harmful practices are not eliminated, when can financial resources be expected to be abundant, and when can administrative efficiency be improved? Finance is the mother of all government affairs, and tax revenue is the foundation of finance. Especially during the current Great East Asia War, the security, education, construction, and material production in the rear should be actively promoted. As the economic artery and material warehouse of the country, Shanghai should prioritize these important tasks. However, these matters are significant and cannot be accomplished without sufficient funding. The source of funding is the revenue from taxes. Therefore, reforming finances is a prerequisite for increasing funding, and abolishing tax farming is the key to reforming finances. If we continue to adhere to the old system, it would not only be self-defeating but also fostering trouble, leading to endless harm. The authorities should promptly abolish the tax farming system, which has hundreds of drawbacks and not a single benefit. This would lead to a prosperous treasury and a better life for the people, benefiting everyone immensely.

### Free Addiction Treatment and Moral Reform: First Phase Begins Today, Organized by Special Agreement with the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society

In order to support the government's anti-drug efforts, this office has made a special agreement with the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society in Yuli, Nantong Road, to organize free addiction treatment and moral reform. Priority will be given to young people with jobs for registration and group treatment. After they are freed from their suffering, they will be given moral reform so that they do not relapse. After their economic situation improves, the program will be expanded to all levels. Preparations have been underway for a month, and the number of registered participants has reached the quota. The first phase of addiction treatment is scheduled to begin today. All those who have registered for treatment with this office and the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society are requested to go to the society for treatment.

During the addiction treatment period, family members of the participants will not be allowed to visit freely to prevent abuse. After completing the treatment, participants must report to the center for testing once a month. If there is no relapse after three tests, a certificate will be issued as proof. Those who fail to report for testing will be considered to have relapsed and must reimburse all medical and accommodation expenses incurred during the treatment or have their guarantor 　on their behalf. All participants should pay close attention to this. However, as this is a new program, the funds are limited, and the cost of medicine is high, resulting in heavy expenses. We rely on generous donations from philanthropists to ensure that the program does not run out of funds and is not forced to be discontinued. This will not only be a source of endless gratitude for the addicts but also a great benefit to the future of society.

### Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Opens Yesterday

### Seven Days in the Hospital

— Hui Ying

I fear illness the most, especially when living away from home. But in the four years I've been away, I've been sick every year, and this time was the worst. The illness began with carelessness in my diet. After becoming ill, the condition deteriorated rapidly, from diarrhea to bloody diarrhea. Six or seven times a day, each time a basin full of fresh blood. I had never had this kind of illness before, so I was so frightened that I went to the doctor without delay.

Introduced by a friend, I came to Nanyang Hospital. The doctor who treated me was Mr. Wu Zhaoren, the most famous figure in the medical field in the country. After his examination, he determined that my illness was not internal hemorrhoids, but that stool and blood tests were needed to determine the type of dysentery. At the same time, according to Dr. Wu's suggestion, it would be best to be hospitalized. I was a little afraid of being hospitalized, because I had never been hospitalized before. At the same time, I often heard people say how snobbish people in the hospital are. The attitude of doctors, nurses, and workers towards patients depends on the patient's economic situation. And I am just a poor student, so I couldn't help but hesitate about whether or not to be hospitalized. In the end, I decided to be hospitalized, because it was really inconvenient to be sick while living in a friend's house, let alone with contagious dysentery?

On the first day of hospitalization, after stool and blood tests, Dr. Wu discovered that I had acute amoebic dysentery. I had to take medicine about every three hours.

On the second day, although there was still blood in the stool, the number of times and the amount were greatly reduced. Dr. Wu never let his assistants do the work just because he saw that my condition had improved. He still came to ask about my illness and take my pulse with a smile on his face. The nurses also took care of me often, being considerate and meticulous.

Mr. Gu Nanqun, the director of Nanyang Hospital, is a philanthropist who is enthusiastic about social welfare. Despite running around every day and being busy with his career, he still made sure to visit the hospital every day, inspect the wards, and ask about the needs of the patients. He also often instructed the nurses and workers to provide patients with convenience and care. No wonder I gradually felt familiar after being hospitalized for two days, as if I had returned to my hometown, receiving the care of my parents, brothers, and sisters. When I saw Director Gu coming to ask about my illness, I felt as if my body had fully recovered.

On the third day, the bloody stools had stopped, and I began to ask to be discharged from the hospital, but Dr. Wu smiled and refused. His reason was that my bloody stools had just stopped, and my bowel movements were not healthy. At the same time, acute dysentery is often easily converted into chronic dysentery. When it comes to chronic dysentery, the disease will be _____.

That day passed silently. What made me feel uneasy was not that I didn't believe the doctor's words, but the burden of the daily hospitalization fees.

After that, my body temperature returned to normal. Whenever the nurses had free time, they would always sneak to my bedside to chat with me. There was also a Dr. Chen who sometimes came. They often told pleasant stories, so that I was not attacked by homesickness and new and old sorrows.

On the fifth day, I repeatedly asked to be discharged from the hospital. That day was the Dragon Boat Festival. Dr. Wu always had that amiable and pleasant face, and said kindly, "Your stool still has bacteria, don't rush to celebrate the festival!" The only reason I wanted to be discharged from the hospital was not to celebrate the festival, nor was it because I was tired of being in the hospital, but because of my financial constraints. Dr. Wu was still smiling and sincere and said, "I know, the director will help you with the hospitalization fees, because he is serving the society and seeking happiness for the public. Even my part of the treatment fee can be waived. The doctor's task and purpose is to heal people. Don't worry! As long as you get well, all problems will be easily solved." He waved his hand, indicating that he was busy seeing the second patient. I smiled silently, not knowing what to say. Gratitude! But at that time, I didn't have a word of gratitude.

On the sixth day, I was allowed to go out, but I was not allowed to be discharged from the hospital until after a stool test on the seventh day.

The nurses knew that I was about to be discharged from the hospital, so they came to tell me their names and addresses, hoping that I would come to their homes to play. Their gentle feelings made me deny the negative criticisms of nurses that I had heard in the past. The most unforgettable thing about being hospitalized for seven days was the high degree of concern, faithful diagnosis and treatment, and kind care that the director, doctors, and nurses showed to the patients.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Sakura and Anchor (9)

Longfu quickly got drunk happily. The fact that Zhenren constantly praised the merits of the painting "Warship" further enhanced Longfu's intoxication.

"If I had someone in the navy, and could see things like the grand maneuvers, I think I could definitely paint a masterpiece. Like the smoke from the cannons, the trails of the torpedoes, etc., I really want to see it once. Is there no such opportunity in Kure?"

"Then, you need a qualification?..."

"That's right, I need a qualification, I really want to have one..."

Because he was drunk, Longfu said some things that he shouldn't have said, but Zhenren listened seriously.

"Anyway, tomorrow is Sunday, and I'm also on vacation, so I'll take you to the Submarine School for a tour! The school is also on vacation, but I have friends there, so a tour is possible."

"Submarine School? That's great! I'm very interested in submarines. But Zhenren hasn't been on a submarine yet? The warship you're serving on, isn't it a submarine?"

"No."

But this time Zhenren didn't tell the truth either.

In a short while, the maid brought the meal. The two finished eating, and Zhenren asked for the bill.

"Stay at my hotel tonight! It's still early, why don't we go to Zhongtong Avenue? It's the Ginza main street of Kure!"

The two stood up and walked towards the corridor. Because Longfu had already transported his luggage to Kagoshima, he only had a leather bag left, which was very convenient.

Just as they were walking from the corridor to the door, the door of the toilet suddenly opened, and a handsome soldier in military uniform appeared.

"Oh! Old Gu, it's strange to see you at the Fukuda Hotel!"

This was a loud voice with a slight alcoholic tone. The person was as the voice, with big, bright eyes.

"I just finished eating with a friend from Tokyo and was about to go back."

"Go back? That won't do! Old Gu comes to the Fukuda Hotel, this is the first time since the creation of the world, so saying to go back is not that easy."

"No, but..."

"No matter what, come to my room! Xintian and the others are there too!"

"But I have a friend..."

"What does it matter? I am Yuasa Chusa. Won't you come and drink together?"

Longfu was very embarrassed by this sudden request and was at a loss. So Zhenren introduced from the side: "He is a naval painter who has been awarded by the Minister of the Navy."

"A naval painter. Then, we must be together even more."
