### The Rise and Fall of Shanghai: Shanghai Residents Have a Responsibility

Yesterday, in this newspaper's Sunday commentary, Mr. Funatsu cited two sentences from Gu Tinglin, a great Confucian scholar of the late Ming Dynasty: "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual."  He concluded by saying, "The rise and fall of Shanghai is the responsibility of Shanghai residents." As we reflect on the wisdom revealed by our virtuous predecessors, and considering our position as residents of Shanghai, we have a great deal to contemplate.  Mr. Funatsu, a "Friend of China" who has lived in China for fifty-six years, is familiar with all things Chinese.  The Shanghai residents he refers to naturally include all citizens residing in Shanghai.  He compared the sense of responsibility that Japanese people have towards their country with that of Chinese people and concluded that the Japanese sense of responsibility is more widespread and fervent. This is based on his daily interactions and observations, and is by no means a subjective and arbitrary judgement.  However, how rich in meaning is the sense of responsibility towards the country that our virtuous predecessor Gu Tinglin conveyed in his saying, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual"!  Today, there are still many people in society who "abandon responsibility and stand idly by," which is especially shameful.

However, the times and environment are, after all, constantly changing, innovating, and progressing. The work of the nation and society requires people to adapt to the times and the environment at all times to cope with challenges.  A passive, "detached from the world" attitude of abandoning responsibility will only increase the severity of environmental deterioration.  We must open our eyes, value reality, and work together to open up the environment and improve it.

We have repeatedly spoken of the importance of Shanghai's position; we have also repeatedly pointed out the crises facing Shanghai from all sides.  It is gratifying to note that the municipal authorities are paying close attention to this issue.  Strengthening political power has revealed a glimmer of hope for the future, such as the recent personnel adjustments made by the municipal government to strengthen itself and the preparations for the establishment of a municipal advisory committee.  If a path of cooperation between officials and the people can be established and they advance together, then the strengthening of political power in the shortest possible time can be predicted.  From what we know, Mayor Chen has lofty ambitions for Shanghai's municipal administration and is open-minded, accepting and considering opinions that are beneficial to the entire city of Shanghai. This is the best opportunity for those who sincerely care about Shanghai to contribute their strength, and they should especially not be timid and abandon their responsibilities.

We believe that in addition to strengthening political power, the most pressing issues facing Shanghai at present are public security and the economy.  In terms of public security, strengthening the police force is of course necessary. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen the police force, improve the effectiveness of police service, improve the lives of police officers, and organize police consumer cooperatives in order to strengthen public security.  From the perspective of public security, the organization of cooperatives is naturally the responsibility of the citizens themselves and cannot be shirked.  Furthermore, the maintenance of public security is closely related to the financial, industrial, commercial, and wealthy sectors.  If wealthy individuals hire a bodyguard, they make sure he is well-fed so he can perform his duties faithfully; how can the police, who protect the public interest, not be well-fed so that they can provide loyal service?  Therefore, the extent to which the police consumer cooperative progresses smoothly can be a test of the extent to which social leaders care about the public good.

As for the economic issue, this newspaper has also repeatedly stated that it should not be strengthened by imposing controls, but rather by strengthening regulations. At the same time, the strength of the economic police force should be strengthened, and the economic administrative organs of the city should be unified as soon as possible to clarify the unreasonable phenomena in the economy.  We often hear that public officials in a few agencies use coercive means to overcharge or make extra demands on citizens or merchants. The government authorities should specify detailed penalties for corruption and punish offenders severely. When necessary, they should organize units to specifically accept reports from citizens, welcome reports from citizens, or entrust the citizens' welfare association to handle them.  If citizens encounter such situations, they must not secretly endure them, but should report them to the relevant authorities. If they secretly offer bribes and fail to report them, they should be subject to the same penalties as those who accept bribes and engage in corruption once discovered.

The government authorities must invigorate themselves, and the citizens must also invigorate themselves. Only by invigorating ourselves together can we overcome Shanghai's crisis and complete the task of building a new Shanghai. Everyone who lives in Shanghai has a share of the responsibility.

### Registration Status of Companies Handled by the Ministry of Industry

In order to stabilize people's livelihood and enhance combat power, the Ministry of Industry previously implemented a registration system for all private companies, conducting detailed investigations into their capital amounts and business purposes, etc., as the first step in establishing the wartime posture of private enterprises and companies.  As of the end of February, the registration status was as follows: Industry had the most, with 713 cases and a total capital of over 2.8 billion yuan; commerce was second, with 697 cases and a total capital of over 1.7 billion yuan; followed by transportation, agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.

### The Japanese Army Continues to Clean Up the Remaining Enemy Near Kohima; Mountbatten Admits the Situation is Becoming Serious

Tokyo, April 9 (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Indian front on the 9th: After completely capturing Kohima on the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army continued to pursue the defeated enemy and is currently engaged in a heroic annihilation battle near Kohima.  One unit of the Japanese army advanced from the east of Kohima to the north of Kohima, and occupied the high ground to the west on the afternoon of the 6th, cutting off the enemy's retreat. Another unit marched north from the south of Kohima, clearing out the remaining enemy near Kohima and continuing to pursue them rapidly to the north of Kohima. Another unit reached the west side of the Kohima to Dimapur highway and completely secured the key points of the highway on the 7th, cutting off the retreat of the enemy in that area.  The enemy army was in a chaotic state of disarray due to the Japanese army's surprise attack and fierce offensive, and is currently attempting to escape to the northwest. Furthermore, the Japanese army's encirclement has been completed, so the enemy army has no way to break through. If the thousands of enemy troops do not surrender, they will only be annihilated.

Lisbon, April 9 (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Mountbatten stated on the 8th that the battles being fought by the anti-Axis forces in the hilly areas overlooking the Imphal plain are an important area. After repelling the Japanese-Indian army, the anti-Axis forces' positions in the area have been improved. He tried his best to cover up the fact that the overall situation was deteriorating and that the Japanese-Indian army had occupied Kohima. However, well-informed sources in New Delhi pointed out that the Japanese army had advanced to a point 64 kilometers inside Indian territory and said that Kohima was only 40 kilometers from the Angara-Assam railway, and they were quite worried about the current situation.

5,000 British Troops Surrounded in the Gaza Area

Tokyo, April 8 (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the India-Burma front: The Japanese army's Tani Unit has surrounded approximately 5,000 enemy troops in the Indaw (60 kilometers southwest of Gaza) and Moelu (50 kilometers northwest of Gaza) areas and began attacking them on the 6th. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked Indaw, defeated the enemy troops in the northern part of the area, and pursued the defeated enemy rapidly towards Inlu, compressing the encirclement net at a point one kilometer east of Moelu and launching a fierce offensive. Another Japanese army unit also began operations from a certain direction, pursuing the enemy troops operating in the area. It has now advanced to Moelu, three kilometers east of Moelu. A powerful unit of the Japanese army in the Mohyin area is also responding to this and pursuing the enemy troops from the north. The Japanese air force is working closely with the ground forces, fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in Kolat, and continuously bombing the enemy air force's kamikaze air transport bases in Shirkiya and Imphal for several days. They intercepted and repelled enemy fighter planes escorting these two airfields along the way. A major air route annihilation battle is currently underway in that area.

The Enemy's Basic Strategy Has Been Completely Shattered

Tokyo, April 8 (Central News Agency) - The Japanese-Indian army has surrounded the enemy's stronghold of Imphal from three directions in eastern India, and the fall of Imphal is only a matter of time. The Japanese-Indian army broke into the city of Kohima on the morning of the 6th and completely occupied the area. Kohima is a key point on the Assam-Bengal railway, located only 50 kilometers from Dimapur. The fall of Kohima poses a major threat to the Assam-Bengal railway.

The Japanese-Indian army began attacking the hilly area on February 8, encircling and annihilating the various units of the British-Indian Fourth Army on the Indian border defense line, and advanced to the Imphal plain, completely shifting the enemy's attention to the Imphal front. During this period, the Japanese-Indian army crossed the Gengdiwan River on the 15th, constructing roads in the mountains and forests at an altitude of 8,000 meters to continue their advance, shattering the enemy's will to fight, and then advanced to the vicinity of Kohima and occupied the area. As a result, the supply routes for the Stilwell army operating in the Fukong area and the enemy's air transport units in Gaza and Moini Imphal have been completely cut off and they are isolated. The enemy's dream of opening the Ledo Road has ultimately come to naught. At the same time, key points on the Tinsukia and Ledo railway lines and the air transport base for Chongqing cannot function. The enemy's basic strategy of strengthening its combat power on the Chinese mainland and attacking the Japanese army from both the Pacific and Chinese mainland is impossible to realize.

### Indian National Army Marches into the Motherland; Thai Prime Minister Sends Congratulatory Telegram

Bangkok, April 9 (Central News Agency) - Thai Prime Minister Pibul sent a telegram to Subhas Chandra Bose, Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, on the 7th, congratulating him on the Indian National Army's march into the motherland and its future success. The telegram read as follows: "Dear Indian compatriots, today the Indian National Army under the command of Mr. Bose has entered India to liberate the motherland. This is a cause for deep celebration for all the people of Asia. At this time of decisive battle, I, on behalf of the Thai people, express my admiration for the Indian National Army and pray that the Indian National Army will continue to advance towards the motherland to achieve the final victory for righteousness."

### India's War of Liberation Will Surely Achieve its Goal; Italian Chairman Publishes Article

Berlin, April 7 (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Rome, Italian newspapers published an article on the 4th written by Chairman Mussolini titled "India for the Indians," emphasizing the significance of the Japanese-Indian army's operations in East India, saying that the operation has had a major impact on the war and is an unprecedented event in world history. The great task of India's liberation cannot be undertaken solely by the internal national movement or the Indian National Army; it must be achieved in cooperation with the Japanese army. When the anti-Axis forces on the Indian border are defeated, Prime Minister Tojo's claim that "India for the Indians" will surely intensify the Indian national movement and allow India to break away from British oppression as soon as possible. Since the rebellion of 1857, the Indian independence movement has made considerable progress despite many sacrifices. Although the programs of the various factions in the movement are not completely consistent, their aim of expelling British forces is consistent. Although Gandhi's non-cooperation movement failed to solve the issue of Indian independence, the significance of the issue has been clarified to the world. Now, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, India has begun to attack foreign troops who are mistreating Indians. The Italians and the Axis powers stand on the same front, so they are extremely concerned about the progress of the Indian independence movement.

### The Nanjing Tobacco Prohibition Bureau Thoroughly Implements Tobacco Prohibition; Announces Four Policy Guidelines

Nanjing, April 9 (Central News Agency) - Nanjing is the capital of the country, and every political measure strives for perfection. Therefore, after the authorities formally promulgated the Tobacco Prohibition Ordinance, they immediately began to organize the Nanjing District Local Tobacco Prohibition Bureau to gradually eliminate the harm of tobacco poisoning in Nanjing, in order to promote the health of the people's physique and the long-term preservation of the national lifeline. The bureau was formally established in this month after active preparations. In order to clarify the bureau's future tobacco prohibition policy and various measures to eliminate the harm of tobacco poisoning, this reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau yesterday and was given a detailed explanation. The following is a record of each point:

In order to thoroughly solve the fundamental problem of tobacco prohibition, the government authorities repeatedly conducted detailed discussions and formulated plans. According to the entire plan, Nanjing District's tobacco prohibition policy can also be divided into four points, which will be implemented step by step: Registration of tobacco addicts. The government authorities, considering that some tobacco addicts have been trapped in this extremely harmful situation for more than just one day and that the poison cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, have decided that the first thing to do is registration. Then, according to the actual situation, strict rationing will be carried out, and private purchases and smoking will not be allowed. After an appropriate period of time, rationing will be gradually reduced in order to guide them to quit. Adjustment of opium dens. All county-level opium dens will also be strictly adjusted in the future. The goods sold each month will be allocated by the government, and illegal buying and selling will not be allowed in order to seek ill-gotten gains. Suppressing smuggling. In addition to strictly suppressing the private transportation of opium, the planting of tobacco seedlings in remote and desolate areas will also be strictly prohibited. Once discovered, a warning will be given immediately. Those who disobey in secret will be investigated and punished according to the law. Quitting. The positive goal of the government's promulgation of tobacco prohibition is to quit. Therefore, central and local governments have established hospitals to help people quit without suffering. Those who are able to pay the fees will do so according to their circumstances; those who are unable to pay the fees may be exempted according to their circumstances, so that they can escape the sea of suffering and regain their healthy bodies. Currently, the director of this bureau is upholding the government's intentions and working hard in cooperation. However, there are still shortcomings, and assistance from all sectors is needed.

### The Anti-Axis Three Giants Are Rumored to Meet Again

Lisbon, April 9 (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, according to a London source: British political circles believe that US Under Secretary of State Stettinius' visit to Britain is a prelude to another meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill. However, London and Washington want to resolve the outstanding issues between Britain and the United States before meeting with Stalin again, so as to avoid repeating the mistake of negotiating separately with the Soviet Union at the Tehran Conference last year. London political circles believe that this is the reason for the US Under Secretary of State's visit to Britain this time.

### Battle for Odessa; Fierce Fighting Between the Two Armies; Soviets Caught in Heavy Fighting on the Seret River Bank

Stockholm, April 9 (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line sources: German troops are continuing to shorten their lines east and northeast of Odessa, and the Soviets are following in an attempt to encircle Odessa, so the situation in that area is becoming increasingly serious. Soviet troops are moving south from northwest of Odessa and are engaged in fierce fighting with German troops. German troops stationed in the northern suburbs of Odessa are also engaged in fierce fighting with the Soviet vanguard. Furthermore, Soviet troops in the middle reaches of the Prut River have now reached the banks of the Seret River (Seret) and are under fierce attack from German-Romanian forces, and appear to be caught in heavy fighting.

Berlin, April 9 (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency: The recent situation on the Eastern Front is that the German army has launched an offensive in the northern sector on the Narva River, the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked the German army's obstacle positions in the Odessa area, and the German army has made continuous advances in Cernauti, Tarnopol, Brody, and Kovel. The German army's offensive in the Narva area is mainly aimed at the remnants of the Soviet bridgehead on the left bank of the Narva River southwest of the city, while the Soviet army is again attempting to break into the area south of Lake Peipus. The fierce fighting south of Lake Peipus has been going on for many days. The location is southeast of Ostrov, and the Soviet army's strategy is to forcibly break into the German army's positions towards the Baltic states. Unfortunately, the Soviet army has continued to attack the German lines without success, sacrificing manpower. The fighting in the area has been quiet for the past ten days, as most of the Soviet troops have been transferred to the northern wing of the southern sector. The German army has transferred fresh troops to attack Kovel, and has now listed the area as a defensive strongpoint within the German lines. The Soviet army's attack on the north side of the city has been repulsed by German artillery fire, and the German army's strategic positions have been improved as a result.

### Zhejiang Province Bamboo and Wood Tax to Be Retendered

Currently, various production and sales taxes on bamboo and wood, paper, medicinal materials, cotton and hemp, fur, etc., have been renamed business special taxes and are being carried out in order, with collection as usual. Among them, bamboo and wood is a very considerable item because of the vigorous production, and the tax revenue is of course considerable. However, the contractor only pays about 400,000 yuan to the provincial treasury every month, which is quite different from the actual amount collected. Therefore, various departments have suggested that the provincial government retender the contract.

### After Unified Management by the Authorities, Price Trends Are Balanced - Average Drop of 35 Percent

Since the competent authorities in this city have taken strict measures to uniformly manage prices, general speculative merchants have suffered serious threats. Therefore, the overall price trend in this city has turned into a calm state. According to the person in charge of each industry association yesterday:

According to the prices of various goods a month ago, as of yesterday, there has been a continued drop of an average of about 35 percent. However, although merchants holding goods cannot obtain the full extra profit at that time, the current profit is still quite substantial, because the price was very low when they purchased the goods in the past. However, some small-scale operators have been slightly hit, because they do not purchase much goods, and the prices vary depending on when they replenish their stock. Some shops have had their sales limited because they exceeded the limited price, and were found by the authorities and subjected to punishment or fines. However, each industry association believes that supervising the buying and selling of fellow traders is its responsibility, and has separately notified and urged each member to buy and sell in accordance with the regulations and not to exceed the agreed price, violating the purpose of the authorities' management of prices. As for the various types of goods stored in warehouses, the holders should gradually release the goods to the market and should not hoard them for a long time. Therefore, when the goods are negotiated and sold, a transaction document must be issued by both the buyer and the seller, which should clearly state: 　Name of goods, 　Quantity, 　Price, 　Date of transaction, 　Storage location, 　Name of the seller's shop and the name of the person in charge, 　Name of the buyer's shop and the name of the person in charge, so that the authorities can request it for inspection during investigation and avoid future unexpected disputes.

### Citizens Must Pay Attention to Inferior Goods When Purchasing Rationed Cloth

— Ji Shouyuan

The March 29th newspaper reported that the temporary household cloth allocation method undertaken by cotton cloth merchants has been announced. Each cloth allocated must not refuse to purchase. It is said that the National Commercial Control Association has decided to handle the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in advance in response to the needs of the people. The amount and price of the temporary allocation of cotton cloth have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and a "Cloth Purchase Certificate" has been produced. It will be issued by the municipal government in accordance with the household rice allocation method. Each household will be issued a cloth purchase certificate, and each certificate will allocate one foot and five feet of cotton cloth, which can be purchased by paying at the designated cotton cloth retail store. The people urgently need it and the date of implementation is approaching!

Since the promulgation of the Shanghai area cotton yarn and cotton cloth purchase law, the yarn and cloth stored by each yarn and cloth merchant have not been able to take a step beyond the boundaries. They are waiting for purchase and inspection. However, many of the items stored in warehouses for a long time have deteriorated. The reason is that the goods have been piled up for a long time, the air is not circulating, or the building is simple, the top leaks and the bottom is wet, and the moisture is blocked, or the cotton cloth processing material undergoes chemical action, or the bundled box boards and iron sheets are broken, or the management is poor, causing the cloth to become moldy, fragile, (especially sulfide base colors), fade, device damage, insect erosion, rat bites, water stains, holes, stains, and other inferior products. The retail stores retain a certain amount of cloth, and the cotton cloth obtained by applying for allocation from the joint operation office of the wholesalers, if there are any of the above-mentioned inferior products, they will definitely allocate them to the people because they are related to their blood capital. At that time, due to the limited allocation amount, and there is no way to return or exchange the goods, the past citizens who tasted yellow mud briquettes will again be tired of the people. At this time, there is a lack of wartime materials, and the small people rely on the cotton cloth allocation for a long time! And if the allocated goods are inferior cotton cloth, making clothes, plus sewing labor costs, wearing them once will see them broken, causing the people to lose money for no reason, harming the people. Who will be their warning?

I deeply hope that the wise authorities will understand the truth for this temporary household cloth allocation method, and make appropriate preparations before the household allocation is implemented to prevent malpractices and benefit the people.

### Control and Statistics

—

Stabilizing people's hearts and enriching the national treasury are what everyone hopes for, but to achieve these two major goals, under the war system, when resources are scarce, the government must implement resource control, publicly determine limited prices and allocations. Currently, all countries in the world have been vigorously implementing this. The best and most strict implementation is Japan, an allied country. Although standing on the front line of the Greater East Asia War, their national treasury is still abundant, the people's hearts are very stable, and everyone holds the determination to win the war. What is the reason for this?

To know that to implement control, there must be a thorough investigation and correct statistical work beforehand, and then start to handle the control in order to achieve good results. Looking back at our country, although we feel that resources are lacking, it is an urgent task to implement control and allocation to stabilize people's hearts and enrich the national treasury. However, since the implementation of control, have the people's hearts been stable? Is the national treasury enriched? This is because we only know the importance of control, but do not know the importance of statistics. If there are no accurate statistics for any goods, how can we know the amount of allocation? As for the amount of tax revenue, it is also impossible to budget. As a result, when the authorities make an allocation, the staff are shocked and try to find loopholes, bribe and campaign, and sell official titles.

Also, every time the government handles a control allocation, because there are no detailed statistics, it often invites merchants to recognize and handle it, using the contracting system, and the tax revenue has no standard. As a result, the handlers deceive the government, report more and less, collect extra fees, indulge contractors, and the allocation still becomes a black market sale. In this way, how can people's hearts be stable! How can the national treasury be enriched! How can politics be bright! How can the country be strong!

In short, to implement allocation, thorough statistics must be done first. To obtain accurate statistics, statistical talents must be cultivated. Compile the production and consumption of local goods into accurate figures, publish them to the public, and then implement strict control, seeking truth from facts, reforming the contracting system, eliminating corruption, severely punishing fraud, raising the salaries of civil servants, and encouraging production. Only then can prices be truly flattened, and the national economy can be put on the right track to complete the war and achieve national peace and security.
