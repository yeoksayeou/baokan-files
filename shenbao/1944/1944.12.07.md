### Fierce Japanese Air Attacks on Enemy Convoys in the Waters East of Mindanao; Many Transport Ships and Torpedo Boats Sunk

Philippine Military Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese air force units, continuing their search and attack on enemy torpedo boats in the Camotes Sea area, finally discovered approximately ten enemy torpedo boats near Poro Island on the 5th at dawn. After a fierce attack, they severely damaged two of them. It is also learned that on the morning of the 4th, Japanese air force units also discovered several enemy boats near Paoay Island, south of the Camotes Sea, and destroyed them with machine gun fire.

Philippine, 5th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force discovered a large convoy of enemy transport ships in the waters east of Mindanao Island in the Philippines on the afternoon of the 5th and attacked them continuously. They bombed and sank one large transport ship and one medium-sized transport ship, and continued to bomb them repeatedly. It is expected that the results of the battle will continue to expand.

### Continuing Heavy Rain in Leyte; Enemy Supply Difficulties

Philippine Island Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The U.S. forces on Leyte Island are currently making every effort to resupply, with large numbers of transport ships sailing into Leyte Gulf. However, due to the continuing heavy rain in the area, land-based resupply is extremely difficult. The U.S. forces can only rely on torpedo boats and other large vessels to transport supplies. In the area of Carigara-Kananga-Ormoc in northern Leyte, the enemy's land-based supply routes are still being suppressed by Japanese forces, and they can only rely on aerial resupply. The U.S. 24th and 32nd Divisions, isolated west of Carigara, are attempting to break through the gaps in the Japanese lines and infiltrate north towards Capoocan and Limon to find a way out, but every attempt has been repelled. The Japanese forces' solid encirclement remains unshaken. In the southern areas of Damulaan-Caridad, the U.S. forces, having been severely attacked by Japanese forces, are now making great efforts to strengthen their strongholds. On the night of the 2nd, several large transport ships reportedly arrived at Palo, transporting teams and weapons. The U.S. forces west of Tagame have launched attacks with small units, but have been routed by Japanese forces. The airfield built by the U.S. forces in Burauen has been rendered almost useless due to a surprise attack by Japanese airborne troops and can now only be used by small aircraft.

### Japanese Shinten Unit Strikes Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Whenever enemy B-29 aircraft bomb Japan, Japanese defense warriors do their best to shoot down enemy planes, achieving great feats. At the same time, there are also noble sacrifices. As announced by Imperial Headquarters on the 5th, in the air defense of the homeland, special attack units are making death-defying ramming attacks on enemy aircraft. For example, Sergeant Yoshio Mita, who died on November 24 near Tokyo after ramming a B-29 aircraft, Lieutenant Toru Shinomiya, who managed to fly back with his damaged aircraft after ramming an enemy aircraft on the 3rd of this month, Sergeant Masao Itagaki, who survived after parachuting from his aircraft after ramming an enemy aircraft, and Sergeant Masami Sawamoto, who died a heroic death in a ramming attack. All four brave warriors were members of the Shinten air defense special attack unit. This special attack unit is of the same suicide nature as the special attack units formed during the decisive battle in the Philippines. Its mission is to shoot down B-29 aircraft, which boast high speed and altitude. The name "Shinten Air Defense Unit" was given by Commander-in-Chief Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, hoping that the unit would be the core force in completely destroying the B-29 aircraft that harass the homeland.

### Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks Morotai

Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - From November 1st to 29th, the Japanese air force attacked the Morotai airfield day and night, destroying 114 enemy aircraft and burning 120. In addition, due to the activities of army commando units, the enemy suffered heavy losses.

Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Morotai enemy airfield has been repeatedly attacked by Japanese air commando units and is on the verge of collapse. The number of enemy aircraft attacking Halmahera Island day and night has been greatly reduced. Only a few aircraft attacked on the 2nd. The enemy's relay bases near Tobelo and Sidang are significantly weakened, demonstrating the difficulty of air force resupply on the Philippine front.

Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In response to the fierce attacks by Japanese ground forces on Leyte, the Japanese air force has continuously bombed the enemy base Morotai Island airfield, gradually depriving it of its functionality. The enemy is currently making every effort to increase its air power in an attempt to reverse the declining situation, continuously concentrating supplies from the New Guinea area on Morotai Island in order to send them to the Philippine front. The Japanese air force calculates the appropriate number of enemy aircraft gathered, and then inflicts heavy blows. Since the 22nd, continuous and fierce bombing has left the enemy with almost no time to breathe. According to the warriors who participated in the bombing of Morotai, describing the chaotic state of the enemy base, when Japanese aircraft flew into the Morotai airfield, the enemy was brightly lit with lights, working busily on aircraft maintenance throughout the night. Our side took advantage of this opportunity to aim at the targets and drop bombs. When the first bomb fell, the enemy extinguished all the lights, but the hits had already exploded and caught fire, to no avail. Shortly after the first aircraft dropped its bombs, the lights were turned back on inside the airfield.

### Worthy and Needy Students Deserving Cultivation

In order to facilitate people from all walks of life who care to directly examine the academic performance of the many students cultivated by readers with their blood and sweat, this newspaper has held an exhibition of the academic achievements of students receiving aid from the newspaper's reader scholarship fund at the Youth Association starting from the first of this month. At this exhibition, everyone can use their own eyes to observe those achievements and make their own judgment: Are these students truly worthy of cultivation?

The achievements that visitors can pay attention to are probably only a small part of the entire exhibition. The entire exhibition is only a partial stage of the various works of the assisted students, and the academic achievements during the student period are only a preliminary expression of a lifelong career. We hope - we believe - that in a few years, these more than four thousand outstanding young people will be able to make all kinds of great contributions to the country and society. Those contributions will certainly be more worthy of our praise and more worthy of our admiration than the achievements of the student era!

Most visitors may only be able to pay attention to displays such as calligraphy, painting, handicrafts, and specimen tables that occupy a prominent position due to time constraints, and do not have time to review long texts such as essays, feature stories, notes, and reports. We are especially afraid that only a small number of visitors have read a few of the "self-narratives" of the aided students, but each self-narrative is filled with the hard work and struggle of aspiring young people. From this expression of spirit, we can further believe that the contributions of these students - if their studies do not stop halfway - to the country and society in the future are immeasurable!

Readers should know that these more than four thousand students whom you are cultivating with your blood and sweat are far above the average student in their academic performance. A statistical chart of the aided students' academic performance in the school exhibition clearly proves this. The statistics are now excerpted below:

Grade Level	General Students'	Aided Students'
Approximate Percentage	Actual Percentage

A	5.0	16.1
B	20.0	50.4
C	50.0	30.1
D	20.0	3.4
E	5.0	0.0

Students with grades of A and B, that is, their scores are above 80, account for one-fourth of ordinary students, but account for two-thirds of the students cultivated by the readers. Those with scores below 80, or grades of C or below, account for three-quarters of ordinary students, but only one-third of aided students.

Because the grading standards of teachers in each school vary, the level of academic performance is not as accurate as the ranking, so we also use the percentile position of academic performance. The statistical results are as follows:

Academic Performance Percentile	General Students'	Aided Students'
Percentage	Percentage

Top 10%	10	45
Top 20%	20	72
Top 30%	30	89
Top 40%	40	95
Top 50%	50	98
Top 60%	60	99
Top 70%	70	100

This statistical chart can further prove that the students cultivated by the readers with their blood and sweat are indeed far above ordinary students, are indeed excellent, and are indeed worthy of cultivation!

Now that another semester is coming to an end, tuition fees in various schools will inevitably increase greatly in the next semester. Whether these more than four thousand students who are worthy of cultivation can have the opportunity to continue their studies is certainly a matter of common concern to people from all walks of life. In view of the urgency of time and the enormity of the funds needed, this newspaper published a special fundraising team method on the first of this month, hoping that readers will continue to do their best with the consistent spirit of enthusiastic assistance to students over the past four years, so that these more than four thousand students who are worthy of cultivation will not drop out of school halfway!

### The Situation of the Greater East Asia War Over the Past Three Years

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the eve of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Mr. Kiichi Kishi, Information Director of the Japanese Embassy in China, gave a radio broadcast to Japanese residents in China at 7:30 p.m. on the 6th from the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "On the Occasion of the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War," in which he detailed the situation in East Asia over the past three years. The broadcast lasted fifteen minutes and the full text is as follows:

Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the war situation we have encountered has entered a critical stage. Especially in the Philippines, the battle centered on Leyte Island will not only determine the future of the Greater East Asia War, but also the future destiny of the Greater East Asian nations.

On the surface, the war situation in the past year may give the impression that the enemy's strength is growing and Japan's national defense seems to be gradually retreating. However, we must not forget that since the Greater East Asia War, even though the Japanese army has occupied a vast amount of territory, at present, it has only regained a portion of this 10,000-odd kilometer battle line. This shows that the Japanese side's defensive position is still as solid as a wall and remains unshaken. Especially the Japanese army on the China front has recently achieved remarkable results. Most of the U.S. air force bases in Chongqing have been lost, and there are also signs of internal turmoil in the opposing camp. The dismissal of General Stilwell has now brought the conflict between Chongqing and the U.S. to the surface. In particular, the recent personnel changes within Chongqing are undoubtedly a ripple effect of the Japanese military operations.

Looking back to this day three years ago, that is, the state of Greater East Asia before the Greater East Asia War, what was the situation? At that time, in Burma, Britain used Burma's location between China and East India to assist Jiang Jieshi, regardless of the opposition of the Burmese people, and opened the so-called Burma Road, forming a strategic triangular formation with Chongqing, Singapore, and Rangoon, threatening Vietnam and Thailand, and firmly encircling the opposing party. In Thailand, British Minister Crosby manipulated politics, and the British financial advisor held full financial power, making Thailand virtually a British dependency. Secondly, Britain's base for invading East Asia, the Malay Peninsula centered on Singapore, Britain completely ignored the local Malayans and treated it as a British colony. In September three years ago, Commander-in-Chief Hoobaugh even exaggerated the completeness of the war preparations in the region with the bold statement that Singapore would never fall, in order to intimidate Japan. In the Dutch East Indies, because the Netherlands had long adopted a policy of illiteracy, few Indonesians were able to receive higher education, and its abundant natural resources only enriched the Netherlands itself. After the Dutch government fled to London, it was reduced to a puppet of Britain and the United States. In the so-called Dutch-Indies negotiations, it dared to repeatedly treat Japan with disrespect. At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it ignored Japan's peaceful intentions toward the Dutch East Indies, relied on the military force of Britain and the United States, and declared war on Japan. As for the Philippines, the United States used a empty check of promising independence to fool the Philippine Islands. It became a member of the anti-Japanese encirclement and made every effort to prepare for the defense of the island.

However, after three years, what is the situation in Greater East Asia? First, with regard to China, all concessions have been completely returned, and there is no longer any need to be restricted by extraterritoriality. Last January, the National Government resolutely joined the war. At the same time, Burma and the Philippine Islands also declared independence and joined the war. Thailand has also concluded an alliance with Japan and is jointly fighting against Britain and the United States for the liberation of Greater East Asia, and East India is also determining independence. The natives of Malaya can all participate in politics, and India has also formed a National Army under the leadership of Chairman Bose to fight for the independence of their motherland. We admire this Greater East Asian effort and struggle, and the epoch-making cause of Greater East Asia is gradually moving towards realization. (To be continued)

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Suichuan Airfield Again

Chinese Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese aircraft attacks on the remaining Chongqing-U.S. air force bases in the Suichuan-Ganzhou area have become increasingly fierce, causing heavy blows to the Chongqing-U.S. forces. On the night of the 4th, Japanese aircraft attacked the Suichuan airfield again, setting it ablaze and causing tremendous damage. In addition, the anti-aircraft firepower of the base is extremely weak, with almost no ability to fight back. After repeated attacks by Japanese aircraft, all aircraft returned safely. The counter-offensive of the Chongqing army in the area has gradually come to a halt due to the pressure of the Japanese army.

### Seeking War Victory with New Weapons - Remarks by President Yagi

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the change of president of the Japanese Technical Institute, it has now been succeeded by Dr. Hideji Yagi, President of Tokyo Institute of Technology. The new president, Yagi, is an authority on radio wave weapons, 57 years old this year. At the end of the Meiji era, his research on radio waves was in the era of long waves, but he engaged in short wave research and achieved considerable results. After Japan established the Research Mobilization Committee last autumn, he devoted himself to researching and manufacturing new weapons, and soon the practical value of short waves will be widely known to the world. At the stage of scientific and technological decisive battles, the appointment of Mr. Yagi, an authority on radio wave weapons, as the center of the Japanese technical world, has profound significance. On the 5th, the new president Yagi gave a speech entitled "Offensive with New Weapons," predicting that in order to win the war, science and technology must be concentrated to strive for great achievements, and the new science and technology to be completed must assume the greatest task under the decisive battle.

### Fierce Battle for Saarlautern Reaches Climax

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas News Agency: The Battle of Saarlautern reached a new climax yesterday. U.S. forces occupied the ancient castle on the 3rd, but were driven out by German forces the next day. After a fierce battle yesterday, the two sides each occupied half of the castle, and are now engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The two sides have 600 soldiers. The castle has been reduced to ashes. Yesterday, U.S. forces crossed the river on the north and south sides of the city, but the bridgeheads they established are now being heavily shelled by German artillery. In the past five days, the U.S. has lost more than 100 tanks.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - (1) On the Western Front, from the Roer River to 35 kilometers north of Cologne, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to attack with a large amount of materiel, but have been blocked by German resistance. According to front-line news from the anti-Axis side, the city of Saarlautern has been occupied. The anti-Axis forces launched an offensive at dawn on the 4th, and the infantry of the U.S. Third Army's Second Division and the First Armored Division have reached a point 10 kilometers from Saarbrücken.

### Soviet Forces in Hungary Cross the Drava River, Fierce Fighting in Southwest Hungary

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas News Agency: Soviet forces in Hungary have established a bridgehead near Dalj, south of the mouth of the Trava River in the Danube River bend, and are preparing to cross the river in force. Because the German defenses in the Zigetvar-Gaboš area on the north bank are solid, the Soviet forces are attempting to advance towards Croatia from here. Fierce fighting is now taking place on both sides of the road connecting Zigetvar and Gaboš. The Soviet forces intend to advance towards Lake Balaton. At the same time, the advance of the Soviet right wing on the west bank of the Danube towards Dunaföldvár has been blocked between Lake Balaton and the Danube. The enemy has also launched a fierce attack in northeast Hungary, attempting to break through the German lines in a small area.

### Grewe Resigns as U.S. Under Secretary of State

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 6th - A Huitong Agency dispatch relays U.S. news: American diplomatic circles greatly value Grewe's appointment as Under Secretary of State, as he represents a proponent of a conciliatory policy towards Japan, which is strongly opposed by American military personnel. Grewe previously served as Under Secretary of State during the Coolidge presidency from 1924-1927. A Republican, he served as the Ambassador to Japan from 1932 until the Pearl Harbor attack. Grewe's appointment as Under Secretary of State at this stage of the Greater East Asia War is indeed noteworthy. As early as January 27, 1941, Grewe issued a warning that war was almost unavoidable if President Roosevelt did not change his policy towards Japan. On November 26th and 28th, shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack, Grewe repeatedly warned the U.S. government, but the U.S. Army Department ignored him. Grewe's two books point out the developed and robust strength of Japanese industry, cautioning Americans against underestimating it. Within the U.S. State Department, Grewe is undoubtedly a veteran statesman, whose experience far surpasses that of Secretary of State Stettinius. Therefore, diplomatic circles believe that Stettinius's role is merely to serve as a liaison for Roosevelt.

### Soviet Government Appoints Litvinov to Australia; Kan'ao

Central News Agency, Swedish Capital, 6th - A Huitong Agency dispatch relays that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced: The Soviet government has appointed Litvinov as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Australia.

### Croatian Head of State Personally Takes Command of Military

Central News Agency, Zagreb, 6th - A Huitong Agency dispatch relays: Croatian Head of State Pavelić has personally taken command of the military, serving as Commander-in-Chief of the national army, navy, and air force.

### Reorganization of the Kuomintang and Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party (II)

— Yoshida Kunisuke

Answer: The United States believes that as long as He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi hold power within the Chongqing regime, genuine cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will remain impossible. Taking it a step further than the United States, the Chinese Communist Party believes that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is in Chongqing, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is impossible. Both of these assessments of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are correct. However, the United States is slightly less understanding of the true nature of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi. In reality, He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi are the embodiment of Chiang Kai-shek. The reason they are criticized and attacked is precisely because they are too loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's intentions. If He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were to completely disappear from the political stage, Chiang Kai-shek would also disappear along with them. The Chinese Communist Party is very clear about this, which is why they are attacking the two of them so desperately. The United States is attacking the two of them so desperately because they are not clear about this. This is like saying that a crane's neck is too long, and someone suggests cutting off a section, while the crane frantically opposes this "unnecessary action." Stilwell did not understand this reason. He only knew that He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were harmful to cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and so he wanted to cut them off from the Chongqing regime. Naturally, he would be pecked by the crane in response. If the United States still cannot understand this reason in the future, they will definitely be pecked two or three more times.

Question: Since the United States is a capitalist country, why is it so enthusiastically promoting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? The Soviet Union is almost completely silent on this issue. The contrast between the two is truly interesting.

Answer: The United States is a nation of wartime realism, desperately using all methods to defeat Japan. Currently, the primary thing they want to utilize is the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas. Due to the success of Japan's Hunan and Guangxi operations, the American airbases in the Chongqing-controlled area have been almost completely destroyed. In the future, the primary American airbase in China will likely be Chengdu! However, Chengdu is frequently subjected to long-range bombing by the Japanese air force and is by no means a safe zone. Therefore, the United States is actively building new bases in safe areas. The United States has noticed the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas with this goal in mind. However, if Chongqing is ignored, it will be difficult to transport construction materials for the airbases to the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas. Therefore, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is necessary for this task. That is the realistic reason why the United States is so eagerly requesting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

There is also an important reason that can be seen in the United States' reassessment of Japan's strength. After three years of bloody fighting with the Japanese military in the Pacific, the United States has realized that fighting the Japanese on equal terms is impossible. It is impossible to fight head-on with the same weapons and the same number of troops. Given this, the only option is to use a military advantage. The American psyche is such that they yearn for world peace to arrive quickly, so they are eager to end the war against Japan as soon as possible. However, they believe that if the current situation in Asia does not undergo other changes, it is impossible to know how many more years this war will continue. The Chongqing army is more concerned with how to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party army in the future than with how to defend against the Japanese army. While the Chinese Communist Party army is concerned with how to harass the Japanese army, they are even more concerned that a Japanese victory would allow Japan to rest easy. Beset by troubles, Roosevelt considered pulling the Soviet Union into the conflict. In order to end the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible, he wanted the Soviet Union to join the war, because victory was impossible without a position of advantage in the war against Japan. If Stalin agreed to participate in the Greater East Asia War, what conditions would be necessary? The first, and most easily anticipated, is cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Chiang Kai-shek's regime is autocratic and despotic. Let me start with the conclusion: I don't think Stalin has any intention of joining the anti-Japanese war at the moment, and the Soviet people have no such intention either. What the Soviet Union wants most today is to recuperate and rebuild. In the war against Germany, the Soviet Union's national power suffered great losses. The people believe that once the European problem is resolved, the country's strength should be restored first. Stalin does not want to drive these people into the vortex of war again.

force and weaponry to suppress Japan. The United States has already achieved success using this method on two or three islands in the Pacific. While it is possible to use superior force and weaponry to fight on the small island of Muer in the Pacific, it is not possible to have everything go smoothly on the Asian continent. This is Roosevelt's problem. Roosevelt knows the American psyche very well, especially the fact that the American people, once the European problem is resolved, want to bring the troops home as soon as possible. So, in order to end the war as soon as possible, it would take an invasion of two or three million American troops. Is this kind of venture possible? If one looks at how many ships the American landing at Leyte Gulf lost, one can find an answer. If the continent is abandoned as it is now, Japan may be able to lay a north-south railway from Singapore to Shanghai. If this policy is not changed, and if the repeated defeats of China in the War of Resistance cannot be broken, then Stalin will not participate in the anti-Japanese war, and Chiang Kai-shek will not agree to his participation either. Therefore, this is why the United States is so eager for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. This is why the United States has repeatedly sent special envoy Willkie to Chongqing via Moscow.

Question: But would Stalin really help the United States fulfill this ambition?

Answer: In order to prevent you from mistakenly thinking,

Question: Then why did Stalin call Japan an aggressor in his recent speech? Is this kind of behavior of stimulating Japan and provoking war considered avoiding war?

Answer: Let me repeat one sentence to you. What the Soviet Union wants most is to recuperate and rebuild. At the same time, the Soviet Union also needs the United States to ship as many supplies as possible. To gain favor with the United States, and to verbally attack Japan, isn't this a cost-effective exchange? Therefore, Stalin knows that Japan would not be so foolish as to take this opportunity to open fire on the Soviet Union. Of course, Stalin very much hopes that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China will cooperate. But he also knows that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is impossible under the current circumstances. At the same time, Stalin also knows that the main proponent of peace with Japan in China is not Yan'an but Chongqing. Therefore, Stalin is not as eager as the United States for the early realization of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, since the United States is earnestly trying to bring the Kuomintang and the Communist Party together, Stalin cannot pretend to be foolish and act as if he doesn't know. So, he has no choice but to scold Japan and appease the United States. If Japan takes even such a small thing to heart, then that is a sign of the spirit of Ah Q!

Question: I have one last question for you. Assuming that everything you said is correct, then in such a situation, is comprehensive peace possible?

Answer: Think carefully! Japan is currently in a situation of facing enemies on all sides in East Asia. Not a single country—Britain, the United States, Chongqing, Yan'an, or even the Soviet Union—is an ally of Japan. However, Chongqing is also in a similar situation, surrounded by enemies on all sides. The Chongqing regime is now being directly attacked by Japan, and being coldly ridiculed by the United States and Yan'an. Although the Soviet Union is keeping its mouth shut about Chongqing and remaining silent, it cannot be said to be a partner of Chongqing. What kind of emotions will be generated under such oppression?

Question: Then why doesn't Chongqing come into the embrace of Japan? Hasn't Japan declared that it respects China's independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity? Isn't it acting in accordance with this spirit of equality? The United States, on the other hand, is doing the opposite of us Japanese. No matter how much it uses flowery words to guarantee Chongqing's independence and autonomy, isn't it now interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs and demanding the reorganization of the Chongqing regime? Don't the Chinese people in Chongqing know about the United States' deceitful policy of selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton? I believe that there is no country in the world that is as stupid as Chongqing. If Britain and the United States are defeated, then Chongqing will of course also be defeated. But even if Britain and the United States are lucky enough to win, Chongqing will still be defeated.

Answer: You say that Chongqing's failure is the result of both the failure of Britain and the United States, and the victory of Britain and the United States. Naturally, there are a considerable number of Chinese people in the War of Resistance areas who are aware of this today, but these Chinese people also have this question about the peace areas. That is to say, they believe that if Japan fails, then peaceful China fails, and if Japan wins, then peaceful China will also fail. Therefore, they are not actively coming over to the Japanese side. These Chinese people are always calculating in their minds, is there more independent and autonomous living for the Chinese in the War of Resistance areas, or is there more independent and autonomous living for the Chinese in the peace areas? The Chinese people in the peace areas are completely living under the watchful eyes of the Japanese. Under these circumstances, Japan can never sincerely convince the Chinese people who are eager for independence and autonomy. The Chinese people are by no means merely satisfied with "sentimentalism" and "friendshipism." Rather, the Chinese people hope to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese and become a first-class people in the world. Think back to the youth of our Japanese Meiji Restoration, how sensitive they were to national self-esteem. Knowing this, we should respect the national self-esteem of the Chinese people. If every Japanese person had this awareness, then whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an, they would all be delighted to shake hands with Japan. The day before yesterday, I returned from Hankou, where I saw a shocking thing. Although the Japanese people in Hankou (and probably the Japanese people in Shanghai as well) can enter any Chinese restaurant, Chinese people are not allowed to enter any Japanese "inn" (i.e., hotel). If the Japanese people were driven out of Chinese hotels in Japan and not allowed to enter, what kind of feeling would they have? If that were the case, I would become the number one "anti-China advocate."

At present, we Japanese are not only using material weapons to fight to the death with Britain and the United States in China, but also using the spiritual weapon of sincerity to compete with Britain and the United States in granting China independence and autonomy. If we Japanese can surpass Britain and the United States in the competition of sincerely granting China independence and autonomy, then I believe that both Chongqing and Yan'an will bring food and drink to welcome the Imperial Army. Please, in the quiet of the night, ask yourselves, can we be confident in the "sincere spiritual struggle" in China? Has the "total war system" of the one million Japanese expatriates in China reached a satisfactory stage in this regard? (End) Translated by Lu

### Various Organizations to Hold Grand Celebration Tomorrow, Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

To celebrate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai News Federation has specifically joined forces with five organizations, including the China Film Company, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, to hold a grand celebration. With the support of the Japanese Army and Navy Press Departments, the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and the Municipal Propaganda Office, the celebration will be held on the 8th of this month. There are three events: (1) At 2:00 PM, the play "Turning Back is the Shore" will be performed at the Lyceum Theatre, with dozens of famous film stars participating in an all-star cast. The performance aims to raise funds for the Greater East Asia Essay Competition, with ticket prices slightly charged at three levels: 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, and 300 yuan. These tickets have already gone on sale at the Lyceum Theatre box office starting at 10:00 AM today (7th). The organizing authorities, due to the high price of up to 10,000 yuan for the previous performance of this play at the Lyceum Theatre and the extremely crowded audience, and the lower ticket prices for this performance, in order to prevent profiteers from buying and selling on the black market, specially dispatched personnel to closely monitor the area around the theater. (2) At 5:00 PM, a "Citizens' Celebration Meeting" will be held at the Grand Cathay Theatre, with speeches by prominent Chinese and Japanese figures and the screening of the latest blockbuster film "Spring River Regret." (3) At 3:00 PM, a soccer game will be held at the Yiyuan Garden, featuring a match between the local famous teams of the Three Provinces and Jilin. The strength of both sides is evenly matched, and there will certainly be many thrilling performances. It is also reported that the "Greater East Asia War Third Anniversary Commemorative War Trophy and Photography Exhibition," jointly organized by the Shanghai News Federation and the East Asia Transportation Corporation, has been open to the public at the Army Dormitory on Jing'an Temple Road (next to the International Hotel) for several days, with more than 10,000 visitors daily, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.

Youth Grand Parade Tomorrow

The Shanghai Special City Headquarters of the China Youth League and the Fourth Regiment of the China Youth Model Corps, in order to promote the resolutions of the Second Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Conference and implement the Rising Up with Asia movement, have specifically invited representatives from relevant agencies to organize the Shanghai Special City Implementation Committee for the China Youth Implementation and Rising Up with Asia Movement. It is reported that the committee is scheduled to hold a dawn mobilization at 7:00 AM on the 8th of this month, dividing the entire city of Shanghai into six districts: (1) South Shanghai District, (2) East Shanghai District, (3) North Shanghai District, (4) West Shanghai District, (5) Central Shanghai District A, and (6) Central Shanghai District B. On that day, members of the youth league in each district will gather on time at their respective designated locations to participate, with as many as sixty schools participating. After gathering at the designated locations, they will depart towards the racecourse. Subsequently, a grand meeting for implementation and rising up with Asia will be held at the Grand Cathay Theatre. After the meeting, all members of the youth league will participate in a grand parade, departing from the Grand Cathay Theatre, passing through Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, Henan Road, Great Shanghai Road, and Xizang Road, and disbanding in front of the New World.

East Asia Front Mobilization Meeting

To commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Chinese Anti-British and American Association, the Shanghai New Asia Patriotic Association, the Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Association, the Chinese Anti-Communist League, the United Chinese Hongmen Association, the China Construction Youth Corps, the Shanghai Special City Anqing Association, the Shanghai Vocational Youth Welfare Association, and the local production and thrift group, the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League, the Philippine Association, and other people's organizations, will jointly hold a "General Mobilization Meeting of the United East Asia National Front" at the Grand Cathay Theatre at 1:00 PM tomorrow (8th).

### Air Raid Relief Designated Hospitals Responsible Divided into Fifteen Districts According to Baojia System

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters Relief Department held a meeting of directors of public and private hospitals with operating rooms at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss air raid relief issues. After discussion, it was decided to divide all hospitals in the city into fifteen districts according to the Baojia system. The First Changning District will be covered by the Obstetrics Hospital, the Second Huashan District by the Shanghai Local Hospital, the Third Changshu District by the Chinese Red Cross First Hospital, the Fourth Jiangning District by the Chinese Red Cross Third Hospital, the Fifth Putuo District by the Municipal Special District Hospital, the Sixth Jing'an Xincheng District by the Hong'en Hospital, the Seventh Lujiawan District by the Nanyang Hospital, the Eighth Laozha Huangpu District by the Tongren First Hospital, the Ninth Taishan District by the Siming Hospital, the Tenth Zhabei District by the Jimin Hospital, the Eleventh Yimiao District by the Nanshi Relief Hospital, the Twelfth Penglai District by the Chu Seng Hospital, the Thirteenth Xixieqiao District by the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, the Fourteenth Xujiahui District by the Sanitary Experiment District, and the Fifteenth Pudong District by the Municipal Pudong Hospital. These hospitals will be responsible for the hospitals within their respective districts, and all surgeons in the district's hospitals will be organized and directed by the designated hospital to prepare for treatment work in the event of an air raid. In addition, the thirteen health centers under the jurisdiction of the Health Bureau and the Nanshi Health Office were designated as relief stations. The Health Bureau will also begin to organize relief and reception centers. Afterwards, civilians injured in bombings will first receive hemostasis and bandaging at the relief stations, and those with serious injuries requiring surgery will be sent to nearby hospitals for surgery to reduce the mortality rate of the injured. Finally, it was decided to hold a second meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month in the Health Bureau's 207 Library. Directors of the designated hospitals in each district are requested to report the detailed organization of relief in their respective districts to the Relief Department at that time in order to issue appointment letters and jointly plan the progress.

### Xiong Jiandong Acts as Acting Security Commander

Chen Gongbo, the Security Commander of this city, must stay in the capital for official duties. It has been ordered that Xiong Jiandong, the Chief of Staff of the department, act on his behalf for the duties of the Security Commander of this city.

### Security Command Captures Two Pirates

The Security Command of this city recently received a secret report that the pirate leader Lu Xianglin (also known as A Lin), who was entrenched in the Xiaochuansha Xuejing Tangkou Sea area of Baoshan County, was leading his gang to commit armed robberies on passing merchant ships at sea. Two pig boats were robbed of eighty-two pigs, netting more than 800,000 yuan. Grain ships and cotton ships were also robbed, netting tens of thousands of yuan, which was divided up for use. After the robberies, sailors and merchants were often thrown into the sea to drown. The department dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and arrested the pirate leader Lu Xianglin on the 17th of last month, bringing him back for questioning. After confirming that the crime was true, he was immediately handed over to the department's military law office for trial. In addition, Wei Xiangfa and Wang Tianrong, subordinates of Chen Guosheng, a roaming bandit in Pudong, recently sent threatening letters to Zhang Xuchu, the town head of Xiangtangqiao Town in Pudong, and Zhu Hongdao, the owner of a milk shed in Sanguantang, and other wealthy merchants to extort money, acting lawlessly. In November, they assassinated Sun De, the former platoon leader of the Independent Brigade of the Fourth Security Regiment. The Security Command dispatched personnel to sneak into the rural areas and managed to capture Wei Xiangfa and Wang Tianrong. After bringing them back for questioning, they confessed without hesitation. The suspects have also been handed over to the military law office for interrogation.

### Japanese Fleet Press Department Hosts Banquet for Reporters

The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department hosted a banquet for news reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Bund Navy Club at 6:00 PM yesterday (6th). Press Chief Matsushima and Lieutenant Kameda were unable to attend due to circumstances, and Lin Junfu, Sakazume Seiichiro, Ichihashi Hikoichi, Wu Bingnan, and Liu Zhennan represented them. Mutual toasts were offered during the banquet, and the atmosphere was extremely cordial. The party ended at 8:00 PM with the guests and hosts parting happily.

### Adjustment of "Eight Public" Sales Outlets Distribution Time for Rationed Rice

The City Goods Supply Office has adjusted the distribution time for rationed rice at the Jiangsu Road, Changning Road, Guilin Road, Xuhua Fang and other eight "public" sales outlets under its jurisdiction. The daily distribution time will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM in the afternoon.

### A Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice-Producing Areas (Part Two)

During the actual purchasing process, the reporter group inquired about the opinions of farmers. According to farmers from Changshu's first district, in the abundant harvest areas of Changshu, the yield per mu (Chinese acre) was as high as one and a half shi (a unit of dry measure), with a purchase volume of four and a half dou (another unit of dry measure). However, in the first district, the yield decreased sharply, with a purchase volume of three and a half dou, which seemed uneven. This was because the farmer had a wife and children, and after the remaining grain was used to pay the landlord's land tax at a rate of one dou, there was no rice left at home, making life difficult. At the same time, some Baojia (local administrative units) chiefs and their relatives, because the right of allocation was determined by them, set the purchase volume low, or even did not include some farmers in the purchase list, which seemed unfair.

Regarding this purchase price, Deputy Director Quan Tian of the Rice Control Association stated: "We are adopting a flexible price policy that changes with the situation, unlike last year's nationwide uniform price, which led to self-inflicted problems."

The purchase price should be calculated based on the farmers' costs to avoid losses for them. The so-called costs, in addition to labor, raw materials, equipment, taxes, and land rent, also include a very important point that should be brought to the attention of the purchasing authorities, namely, that the current exorbitant miscellaneous taxes in rural areas are higher than everything else. For example, in the Meili area of Changshu, farmers pay 60 yuan per mu per month for local maintenance fees. It is hoped that the authorities will also factor this into the cost (this point will be explained in detail in the chapter on farmers' lives).

Farmers, according to the purchase volume notified by the Baojia chiefs, accompany the township head to the purchasing point with their rice. This year, there are samples for the inspection of first-class rice, second-class rice, third-class rice, and fourth-class rice (last year, some Jia chiefs delivered first-class rice at the price of second-class rice to the farmers). After the rice is inspected, farmers receive cash (last year, some farmers received cash only 20 days after delivering the rice) and receipts. These are all improvements.

In Meili Town, Changshu, all farmers who have delivered rice and have receipts receive a 10% discount when purchasing goods in stores. This is a good method that can be adopted in other areas.

(As for the purchase period, there are restrictions on the movement of grain. A rationing system should be established first in cities and rural areas outside of rice-producing areas. This point will be detailed in the rationing chapter.)

(IV) Purchasing Rice and Propaganda

During the period of purchasing rice, propaganda work is being carried out in both cities and rural areas. This propaganda, which has a political and educational nature, is worthy of approval.

In Meili Town, Changshu, for example, there are a total of ten purchasing merchants, two of whom assist in purchasing rice, while the other eight gather Baojia chiefs in various villages to explain the significance of this rice purchase.

However, the reporter group raises the following two points.

First, the "Notice to the Public Regarding the Purchase of Grain" issued by the Changshu branch office, using classical Chinese, broad theories, and abstract content to inform farmers, is undesirable in rural areas where illiteracy is prevalent. At the same time, ambiguous sentences should be used less. For example, a slogan posted on the streets of Changshu reads: "Those who oppose hindering the work of purchasing rice are our enemies" (without punctuation in the original). If punctuation is added after the second word, its meaning is completely opposite to the true intention. These are many things that should be paid attention to.

Second, among the officials the reporter group encountered, even senior personnel, there are quite a few who mistakenly use this rice purchase as a purchase of military rice. In fact, this "rice purchase" includes both military and civilian needs. In Changzhou, a propaganda team went to the countryside and said, "The citizens of Shanghai are suffering greatly from a lack of rice." As a result, the farmers all said, "Since that's the case, I'm willing to take out the rice from my home." The results were exceptionally good, and this is where the propaganda succeeded.

(V) Expectations for the Purchasing Authorities

After inspecting the rice purchasing organization, the reporter group repeatedly contributes one point to the issue of purchasing prices. What the citizens of Shanghai are concerned about is "What is the main price today?" In the countryside, what is directly related to the farmers is: "What is this year's purchasing price?" One is afraid of it being too high, and the other is afraid of it being too low.

Last year, the Rice Control Association announced a price of 720 yuan per shi, with a purchase price of 20 yuan. This year, the black market price has reached an unprecedented high. Of course, the purchase price should not be based on the black market price, but the distance is too far, which has a significant impact on farmers' lives, because farmers sell their rice at the official price, while daily necessities rely on the black market, resulting in great losses. At the same time, it is related to the farmers' livelihood.

The reporter group invited a farmer for a conversation on the ship. He said: "We hope for rationed goods." Because his village has no soap, they wash clothes with rice ash, and they haven't had a spoonful of grain in their mouths for a year. Two points should be emphasized: 1. Take into account the actual costs of farmers! 2. Exchange rice for goods (at official prices).

### Reader's Education Aid News: Urging Wealthy People in Shanghai to Generously Donate Money to Support Education

Confucius said: "Wealth and rank attained through unrighteousness are to me as drifting clouds." How profound and insightful are these words of the sage. Few people today can understand the sage's transcendent view of life; otherwise, why are there so many people who are wealthy and ranked through unrighteousness? Having become rich and noble, they still do not know contentment and desperately try to drill into the horns of wealth and nobility, not awakening until death! In general, the more money one has, the deeper the sins, and the more unfilial the descendants. As a result, the descendants always engage in wrongdoing and do not have a good end, squandering the ancestral ill-gotten wealth. Such examples have been seen in the past and are even more prevalent today. Taking present-day Shanghai as an example, who knows how many people are making illegal transactions during wartime and profiting from the national crisis? Who knows how many people are taking advantage of their power and authority to fish in troubled waters and become rich and noble? However, how many people can grasp a correct and enlightened view of life? I dare to tell the wealthy people! People of modern times, especially those who want to be people of the new China in the future, should put "righteousness first" and "benevolence first." The teachings of the sages are eternal truths. If you can understand this point, it is better to do some good deeds as soon as possible, donate money for good causes, and accumulate virtue for your descendants. Like this newspaper's "special fundraising" for education aid, it is truly an active and fundamental righteous act. Please support it generously, benefiting others, oneself, the country, and the people, achieving boundless merit in every aspect!

Shen Zhuxi's Wedding Anniversary Education Aid

Yesterday, Mr. Shen Tinghai and Ms. Zhu Wanfen, in commemoration of their tenth wedding anniversary, formed a "Tin Wedding Team" and generously donated 20,000 yuan, demonstrating the deep affection of the couple and achieving a double benefit. It is hoped that happy couples in Shanghai, whether "golden wedding," "silver wedding," "engagement," or "new wedding," can all recognize team donation fund-raising to support education, in order to establish a new model of family.

Shao Huaichu's Sincere and Benevolent Intentions

Mr. Shao Huaichu expressed deep sympathy for the "special fundraising" organized by this newspaper and specially donated to one team, saying that this money was a new unexpected income and he dared not selfishly enjoy it, but donated it for education aid. His intentions are sincere and benevolent. In the Shanghai business community, accidental income, often hundreds of millions, is often received with a wave of the hand, extravagant personal enjoyment, and senseless consumption. It is hoped that they can also generously donate to meaningful good deeds.

Yu Fa Company Sells Candy to Support Education

Yu Fa Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote: "Our factory, in view of the fact that most of the pure chemical drugs used in our country are imported, has only researched and created anhydrous glucose and calcium gluconate and other pure chemical drugs, which have always been valued by the pharmaceutical industry. Now, in order to provide universal flower care and serve the society, we have specially processed and formulated the above-mentioned anhydrous glucose and calcium gluconate to make "Yu Fa Glucose" and "Yu Fa Calcium" tablets. Its characteristic is that it can be directly absorbed by cells without digestion, which helps to promote development, increase appetite, and relieve fatigue. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, puppet shows will be held at the Lanxin Theater at 3 pm and 5 pm every afternoon, inviting the Shanghai Puppet Troupe to perform famous children's plays "Flame Mountain," "Swan," "Hall of Longevity," and "Primeval World." Those who purchase Yu Fa Calcium and Yu Fa Glucose from major pharmacies will receive free tickets. At the same time, tickets will be sold at the Lanxin Theater, divided into 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan three kinds, each ticket attached with "Yu Fa Calcium" one pack, two-day ticket income, commission donation to your newspaper's education aid fund, a small expression of gratitude, hoping for your support."

Yesterday's Education Aid Received: Su Baogen 1,800 yuan, Mr. He 1,000 yuan, Qian Ji (in memory of the first birthday) 500 yuan, Mr. Huang 350 yuan, Pu Qiting (in memory of Cai Wengpo) 100 yuan, totaling 3,750 yuan, balance 6,784,871 yuan.

Eighth Shen Bao Reader's Education Aid Special Fundraising Team

Seventeenth Team: Shao Huaichu Team, donated 20,000 yuan

Eighteenth Team: Shen Tinghai Zhu Wanfen Tin Wedding Team, donated 20,000 yuan

The above totaled 40,000 yuan, balance 1,100,000 yuan

### Shanggong Xinghua: After Viewing the Fellow Artists' Art Exhibition

— Le Tian

The Fellow Artists' Art Exhibition, hosted by Shanghai Industry and Xinghua, was held this week at the China Painting Gallery. The writer visited on the opening day and saw a total of 350 pieces of calligraphy, painting, and photography, arranged in a winding and interesting way. It is said that this art exhibition has two noteworthy points: the organizers Chen Zhitang, Chuan Longcai, Che Bingke, and Wu Daoping encouraged colleagues to pursue spare-time studies and promote literature and art, and specially initiated the art exhibition to achieve the effect of voice and response. Secondly, in response to this newspaper's education aid fund "special fundraising," with the friendship of music and goodness, sales proceeds were donated to education, and the ten artists who participated in the production all gladly agreed and looked forward to its success. This kind of education aid is truly commendable.

In general, the works of the art exhibition have their own merits. Cai Tianshou's photography is clear, beautiful, outstanding, and extraordinary. Such as "Inspiration Flashing Apart," the sky clouds, layer by layer into the camera, the color is beautiful. "Clouds Light Wind Light" depicts the tranquility of nature. "Clouds Scattered Lonely Standard See" shows the depth of all things in autumn, and the tower on the wind and clouds, people think back. "Lonely Berth Frame" takes the color, all to the top. Each is titled by Xu Shuchen, which is especially characteristic. Wang Xiaolou made "Creek Mountain Cane," an old man walking alone in Creek Mountain, so that people raised the mind of fluttering away, the painting landscape, magnificent, never had.

Local Civil Leaders of this City

Express Resolve to Implement War

On the third anniversary of the Great East Asia War, the people of all walks of life in this city deepened their determination to fight against the enemy and vowed to complete the war with all their strength. When reporters from the Central News Agency visited the civil leaders yesterday, they also expressed their determination to implement the war. The following is a record of their words:

Li Sihao

"It has been three years since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. We recall that at the beginning of the war, our friendly country, Japan, united its army and navy, and drove the British and American forces out of the sea in one fell swoop, allowing the nations that had been oppressed by Britain and America for decades to regain their freedom and strive for regeneration. At this critical stage of the final battle, and on the anniversary of this holy war, we should offer all our strength, sincerely cooperate with the war, and prepare to completely eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and America, so that the nations of East Asia can rebuild a bright future."

Wen Lanting

"Today is the third anniversary of the launch of the Great East Asia War. Looking back over these three years, our country and our ally, Japan, have shared the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and have made concerted efforts from top to bottom, which is truly gratifying. Now that the war is approaching the decisive stage, in order to revitalize East Asia, we should be even more diligent in order to achieve the ultimate goal of victory. I have been entrusted with the important task of commercial control, which is one of the wartime economic measures. Since its implementation, it has been able to take shape with the guidance of all parties and the cooperation of our allies. However, due to various reasons, it has not yet met expectations. I sincerely hope that our industrial and commercial circles will work harder to increase production on the one hand and implement the unified government on the other, so as to fulfill the responsibilities of the people in the rear and not live up to the sincere intentions of our government to participate in the war."

Yuan Ludeng

"The Great East Asia War has been going on for three years now. During that time, the Chinese government and people have been fully aware of the contributions of our allies to the Great East Asia War. The foundation of freedom for all East Asian nations has been further consolidated. The industrial and commercial circles of this city have long held the same determination. Therefore, I hope that whether in the front or the rear, we should all exert our greatest efforts, endure hardships and toil, and contribute everything to the war. All East Asian nations should embrace the spirit of fearlessness and strive to achieve victory."

Yesterday's Make-Up Football Match

Overseas Chinese United defeated Qiu Wendu

Yesterday, a make-up match was played in the football league. Overseas Chinese United faced Qiu Wendu yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm in Jiaoyuan. Overseas Chinese United led 2-0 in the first half. In the end, Overseas Chinese United won by four goals.

### Postponement of Publication of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory, compiled and printed by this newspaper, was originally scheduled to be published at the end of October. However, due to the large content and the time required for printing, the printing house responsible for printing has been repeatedly subjected to power restrictions, making it impossible to complete the printing as scheduled, thus postponing the publication. Unexpectedly, the power was suddenly reduced in late last month, and power was cut off again last week, causing the work to come to a standstill. The publication of this book has been postponed again. We are now trying to remedy the situation. We sincerely apologize and hope that those who have made reservations will forgive us.

### The Urgent Salt Problem

— Song Yuan

The high prices in the current city are the most serious problem for ordinary citizens, especially the daily necessities of food, the high prices of which are more threatening to our lives than all other goods. Food, vegetables, and fuel related to food have been solved by the public's attention and the authorities' attention, but the soaring price of salt seems to have not been paid attention to by all parties. Salt is an indispensable nutrient and vegetable seasoning for us every day. Its importance is no less than food, and salt has no suitable substitutes. According to the recent increase in salt prices, it has actually surpassed all other necessities of life; Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the black market price of salt in the city was about 20 yuan per catty, but in the past few days, it may not be possible to buy it for about 100 yuan. In this less than two months, the increase has been five times, which is also amazing.

My country has always adopted a state monopoly system of unified production and marketing of salt, so it is the earliest commodity with a controlled economic meaning in my country. In general, it is easier to implement the control and rationing of salt than all other commodities, but the facts tell us that although various important necessities of the city have been implemented by rationing according to the number of people, salt only has a ration card, but has never seen a formal rationing, which really makes people puzzled. This city is located on the coast, and the surrounding areas such as Songjiang, Huainan and Zhejiang are famous salt-producing areas in my country, and the raw materials for salt production are taken from the sea, or dried in the sun, or dried with reeds produced along the coast. The restriction reduces its output. Or it is said that the transportation is difficult and the source of salt is not smooth, but the distance from the city to the salt fields is not far, in addition to railways, ships, and highways, it can also be transported by private ships, and the problem is not so serious.

Salt is not only a daily necessity and seasoning for us, but also an important industrial raw material. The impact of its high price cannot be ignored. The prices of side dishes such as pickles, curd milk and pickles are also based on the price of salt. Therefore, in this rising salt price, the authorities should seek ways to suppress its price. In addition to the difficulties in the production and transportation of salt by the authorities responsible for the production and marketing of salt, it is also hoped that a large amount of salt can be allocated to the distribution office for goods to implement the fairest per capita distribution system as soon as possible, so that the salt problem of citizens can be rationally resolved. One more thing that deserves our attention is the source of black market salt. Although it has not been thoroughly investigated, the fact that most of them are smuggled salt that has not been taxed should be a fact. At this stage of the decisive victory in the war, the government's funding needs are very high, and tax increase has become an urgent task at present, and the government's funding needs are very high. It is also necessary to find ways to prevent such a huge tax source from leaking.

### Children's Association Fundraising: Still Hoping for Donations from All Walks of Life

The China Children's Relief Association is calling for donations from the society due to feeding difficulties. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been setting a century-old plan for the society, generously donating money, and enthusiastically donating money. Now a total of donations have been received, exceeding 400,000 yuan donated by leader Luo Hongyi, in response. It is true that "compassion is in the heart and love is in the arms." However, the association is aware that current prices are soaring, and 5 million yuan is not enough to maintain the education and living expenses of more than 300 refugee children for half a year. It is still hoped that warm-hearted gentlemen and ladies of the society will generously give Renjiang and do their best to lose, so that the funds of the association will be available and the work will not be interrupted. Then hundreds of orphans will be grateful to the sea.

If you would like to donate, in addition to the association's direct collection, the social service department of this newspaper can also collect it on its behalf. If you would like to donate by phone, you are especially welcome. Please call 82273, and the association will send someone to collect the donation with a receipt.

### Mr. Chen Junxin is Enthusiastic about Public Welfare: Charity Sale of Gown Fabric to Help the Poor

Mr. Chen Junxin wrote: "To whom it may concern, your newspaper has been running various charitable activities with excellent results, which is very admirable. When I enter the Yiren workshop, I have excess energy and detailed work. At the age of forty, it is a cheap day. I am very grateful to my relatives and friends. I was given a piece of Li and Yanghang's Yihua brand colored son's dress fabric, which has been sewn properly (length 1 foot 9 inches, waist 8 inches, sleeve length 2 feet 5 inches, cuff 6 inches). I originally planned to make it for myself, but then I realized that in these difficult times, there are countless people who are suffering from hunger and cold. What am I, who can wear this dress? Therefore, I plan to sell this fabric and set a price of 100,000 yuan. All the proceeds will be used for various good deeds in your newspaper. If some of it can be allocated to the Red Swastika Society for winter relief, it would be even better, because I am also a disciple of the society, otherwise, you can do whatever you want. The price of this fabric seems high, but according to the recent market conditions, I am afraid that it is not easy to buy it for this price. Now I am sending it with the letter. I hope you will accept it and publish the original letter, so that all the great philanthropists can help and support each other to do good deeds together." Mr. Chen's enthusiasm for charity is very admirable. In addition to displaying the gown fabric, we hope that enthusiastic people will actively bid for it and do more good deeds to maximize the effect of relief.
