### Total War

Modern warfare is a struggle between the entire oppressed nation and the entire invading nation. The meaning of so-called total war is twofold: first, the entire country is a battlefield; second, all citizens are soldiers. Therefore, every citizen must work on the battlefield in the posture of a soldier. The amount of national power and the duration of work are the main factors determining the victory or defeat of the war. In the process of total war, the responsibility of the citizens is to contribute their strength, and the responsibility of the government is to unite, benefit, and utilize the strength of the citizens, and further to make the national strength permanently and continuously reborn.

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on the 13th of this month: "Today's need is not so much the increase in weapons production or food production, but rather the increase in human resources. If human resources are abundant throughout the country, then weapons can naturally be increased, and food can naturally be increased." This is a "penetrating" argument in total war. Because the power of people is higher than everything, the power of people can overcome all objective difficulties. The theory of "human determination conquers heaven" is not an empty phrase, but is proved by many historical facts and many personal life experiences. The meaning of harmony lies in uniting and uniting the power of the people. The power of unity and union is naturally greater and more lasting than the power of individuals. The saying "many people united can build a city" and "many people strike together can easily lift" best illustrates the great significance of harmony.

How to achieve the goal of harmony? Mr. Tokutomi Sohō pointed out four points: first, those in power must trust the people; second, they must respect the people; third, they must listen to the voices of the people; and fourth, they must stop bureaucratic politics and implement politics based on the people. What he said coincides with what we usually mention all the time, which shows that this idea of people-based governance is the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Anything that conforms to this rule can prosper the country in peacetime and lead to victory in wartime. Anything that does not conform to this rule, does not get the support of the people, and does not get great power, then the hope of success is naturally just seeking fish from a tree.

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō's only belief is based on the people's position, so that all the people willingly and sincerely contribute to the country, and the only way to implement it is to implement people-based politics. The government should sincerely be the people's servant, solve difficulties for the people, and increase welfare for the people. The government is not a bureaucratic institution but a place to serve the people of the whole country. The more the government does for the people, the more the people contribute to the country. The more the government respects the people, the more the people support the government. In this way, the whole country, from top to bottom, has the same will and gathers strength, and attacking the enemy with it will be invincible.

We often say to win over the people, but in fact, the people do not need to be won over. Under a wise government, the people's return is like water flowing downwards, which cannot be stopped. The original intention of what we say to win over the people lies in the government itself, which must cheer up and create a situation where the people are willing to return. The government automatically innovates, and the people automatically support it. This is the most ideal situation. Therefore, the most important thing is how the government itself strives to serve the people and seek welfare for the people. One point of service and one point of welfare will automatically attract one point of the people. The government must win over the people with political achievements. This is the most important point.

Total war must be based on total politics. The more tense the war, the more urgent the need for unity and union of national forces, and the more important the nationalization of politics. This is a critical moment, and I hope the whole country, from top to bottom, will encourage each other.

### Japanese Army on the Nu River Line Adopts Individual Annihilation Tactics, Making It More Difficult for the Chongqing Army to Counterattack Due to Torrential Natural Barriers

Central News Agency, North Burma Front, 14th - The purpose of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force's counterattack this time is to open up a new route from North Burma to Chongqing to save the declining situation. After Chen Cheng resigned due to repeated defeats by the Chongqing army in the Nu River operation, Wei Lihuang was specially appointed as the commander of the Expeditionary Force, and the most elite American-style backbone officers were dispatched to assist him. Relying on air transport to supply military needs, the aim was to use all its strength to recapture the Nu River line. However, the elite Japanese army adopted individual annihilation tactics. Since the Chongqing army crossed the Nu River, it has only been raining for a month, and more than 50,000 people have been lost. Although the generals and soldiers on the Chongqing army's front line have suffered heavy losses, the leaders have not wavered slightly, and are determined to recapture the Japanese army's strategic stronghold. Recently, its elite reserve vehicles in Jiangdong have repeatedly forced their way across the river, but because the Japanese army's operations are clever, the Chongqing army is only seeking its own demise. The torrential current of the Nu River and the natural barrier of the Li River make it more difficult for the Chongqing army to maintain its supply lines. The Chongqing army's generals and officers on the Nu River frequently request the headquarters to urgently air transport supplies, but judging from the current situation, air support is the only lifeline of the Chongqing army, and air transport supplies, due to geographical conditions, often cannot find incoming aircraft. Moreover, the disease is rampant. During this rainy season, sick soldiers are emerging one after another, and because there is no medicine to treat them, the generals and soldiers have lost their will to fight, so a large number of people are fleeing. Because of this situation, guerrillas in various places are forced to become thugs, looting everywhere. The people in the villages occupied by the Chongqing army often complain to the regular army, but the regular army, due to lack of food, often loots in the name of guerrillas, so the residents rebel and flee to the Japanese-controlled area. Recently, the number of Chongqing soldiers surrendering and deserting has increased sharply. A Chongqing general and officer captured by the Japanese army once talked about the embarrassment of Wang, a general in the Chongqing army, saying that Wang, the second battalion commander of the 26th regiment of the 76th division of Chongqing, finally fled due to unfavorable battles, so the second battalion was in great chaos, and his subordinates also fled one after another. After the 76th division commander received the report, he issued a reward notice. This situation is not limited to the 76th division, but is the same in other places.

### Japanese Army Occupies Key Positions in Hunan, Preparing for the Next Operation, Japanese Headquarters Announces Results of Hengyang Battle

Tokyo, 14th - Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th that the Japanese army in Hunan successively repelled the Chongqing army entrenched near Hengyang, and is preparing for the next operation. The main war results since the start of operations in Hunan on May 27 until the fall of Hengyang on August 8 are as follows: (Losses of the Chongqing Army) 66,468 abandoned corpses, 27,447 prisoners, Japanese army captured 335 artillery pieces of various types, 1,705 heavy machine guns, 13,666 rifles, and shot down, destroyed, and burned a total of 869 aircraft. (Japanese Losses) 5,343 killed in action.

Fierce fighting near Hengyang

Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - In the battle for the key position of Hengyang, although the Chongqing army was ordered to defend to the death, it fell in only four days after the Japanese army began its general offensive. Moreover, the troops under Fang Xianjue of the 10th Army of Chongqing completely surrendered, and the security in the city gradually recovered. In order to save the declining situation, the Chongqing army is still trying to retake Hengyang, and is blindly attacking the four suburbs of the city. The Japanese army is inflicting a severe blow on it at any time, and annihilation battles are now unfolding in various places. The Japanese army in the direction of Weiyang advanced from Xiaoshu Pu south to Zhangshuxia (7 kilometers northwest of Laiyang) on the 12th. The main force of the Japanese army in the direction of Liuyang secured Shegang City (25 kilometers north of Liuyang), Gugang City (20 kilometers southeast of Liuyang) and Yong'an cities, and swept away the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army in the four suburbs. The mechanized units of the Japanese army in the direction of Liuyang advanced southward from the west side of Xinshi and reached Chang'an Station on the morning of the 11th. A part of them quickly passed Tuoba (25 kilometers south of Chang'an Station) on the morning of the 11th and is still advancing.

Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - Since the beginning of August, the Japanese army on the Wei Yang front has been constantly encircling the powerful troops of the Chongqing army that have been moving north to that area. On the 9th, the annihilation battle began, sweeping away the scattered Chongqing army units everywhere. According to reports, the 41st division of the 26th Army and the 48th Provisional Division of the Chongqing Army were surrounded by the Japanese army on three sides while heading north to Hengyang from Xiaomu Pu, 8 kilometers south of Weiyang. The central unit of the Japanese army launched a night raid on the headquarters of the main force of the 41st Division on the front line of the Chongqing army, winning great military glory. As a result, the entire Chongqing army fell into a state of chaos and mistakenly identified the 48th Provisional Division of the Chongqing army, which was rescued from the right side, as the Japanese army, and fired fiercely at it, so most of it was annihilated. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese army in the vicinity, the annihilation battle has reached its climax.

Extreme Panic Within Chongqing

Central News Agency News - Since the Japanese army captured Hengyang, the Chongqing regime vaguely admitted its fall on the 9th. According to reliable sources, the Chongqing side has shown panic in the internal battle strategy of this time. On the night of the 9th, the Chongqing military and political circles also held an emergency meeting. At the same time, in order to "calm" the people's hearts, the Chongqing "Central Political Committee" specially passed six proposals to reform local politics. In addition, the Chongqing "Military Commission" especially carried out propaganda, claiming to gather a large army to rush to aid, but the Chongqing military and political institutions in Hunan and Jiangxi were extremely embarrassed and had prepared to withdraw. The Chongqing side shouted to counterattack Hengyang, but the morale of the Chongqing army was declining and it had lost the "war of resistance" force. The local government also showed a panic situation and could not cope with the aftermath. Therefore, no one can make the so-called recovery of Hengyang by the Chongqing side a reality. In particular, regarding the fall of Hengyang, some people deeply believe that the Chongqing side cannot continue the "war of resistance" because the decisive battle in the Chongqing-Japanese war was decided by the great battle of Hengyang. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also raised this claim at the military conference held in Lushan. Chiang's broadcast on July 7 this year decided to defend Hengyang to the death. Now Chiang's claim is quite obvious in fact, so the fall of Hengyang has greatly affected his faith.

### War Situation of Japanese Troops in Various Places

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - The war situation of the Japanese army on various fronts is as follows:

China Front

A. Hengyang Area: After the Japanese army completely occupied Hengyang in August, it secured the strategic line in that area and launched an annihilation war against the 74th, 79th, 100th, 62nd, and 37th armies (totaling ten divisions) of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang area, as well as the main force and mechanized units of the 46th Army, which recently arrived at the front to reinforce, and prepared for future offensives. B. The Chongqing army on the front of Chaling in eastern Zhejiang Province is the former 150th Division, and the Chongqing army on the front of Anren is the 133rd Division. There is no major change in the war in that area. The Japanese army is still advancing in the annihilation battle. C. The Japanese army on the front of Wei Yang is currently launching an annihilation battle against a part of the 26th and 99th armies of Chongqing at a location 18 kilometers south of Wei Yang. Currently, the war situation in that area is favorable to the Japanese army. The Chongqing Provisional Second Army once attempted to bravely return to Laiyang City and attack the vicinity of the city, but was wiped out by the Japanese army in Yangcheng and its northern areas on the 7th and 8th. D. The Japanese army on the Leizhou Peninsula launched an offensive against the Chongqing army on the Leizhou Peninsula, captured Lianjiang on the 4th, and launched an attack on the Chongqing army entrenched in Xinxu and Anpu (23 kilometers northwest of Suixi), inflicting heavy damage on it. Therefore, the Japanese army was able to attack the southern coast of Kyushu on the Leizhou Peninsula and promote a containment posture on the peninsula.

Burma Front

Because the Chongqing army's counterattack was fierce, the war situation on the entire line was extremely fierce, especially on the Nu River front. The morale of the Japanese army was extremely high, confronting the superior Chongqing army, and was still fighting. A. The Japanese army in La Meng on the Nu River front continued to fight fiercely with the superior Chongqing army, launching fierce attacks. The heavily wounded Japanese army continued to fight hard, day and night, repeatedly repelling the incoming Chongqing army, and did not leave its position for a step. In the battles from the 6th to the 9th, it caused 661 casualties to the Chongqing army, and captured more than 10,000 rounds of rifle bullets. 37 Japanese soldiers were killed in action. The superior Chongqing army in the Viet area launched an attack in unison on the morning of the 9th under the cover of more than ten fighter-bombers. The Japanese army lured them to a close distance of 20 or 50 meters, confronted each other, and suddenly launched a counterattack in the middle of the night on the 9th, defeating the Chongqing army. On the 9th, a part of the Chongqing army broke into the city, but most of them were annihilated.

New Guinea

Front: The Japanese Air Force in that area repeatedly bombed Auwai Island across from Biak Island between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on the 12th. Amidst the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and fighter fire, it broke into the enemy airfield, destroying 12 large aircraft and 8 airfield facilities. A large fire was seen at the enemy airfield, and it is expected that the Japanese army has achieved great war results.

### Captured American Sergeant Describes Guilin Air Force Equipment, Chongqing American Air Force Indiscriminately Bombs Civilians

Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - American Army Sergeant Walter (21 years old) of the 14th Air Force, along with five of his comrades, departed from Guilin in the middle of the night on July 26, riding a transport plane full of military supplies to supply Xue Yue's army in Hengyang. While passing through Lingling, the aircraft was hit by Japanese army land-based machine guns, and the aircraft parts were damaged. The sergeant landed by parachute at a landing site that happened to be occupied by the Japanese army. The sergeant mistakenly identified the Japanese soldiers as the Chongqing army and shouted "I am an American" "I am an American" and was captured by the Japanese army. The sergeant was born in Iowa, USA. At the age of 19, he enlisted as a volunteer soldier and was assigned to the transport team (about 200 people) under Colonel William Swanson in Guilin. He transported gasoline back and forth to Kunming, delivered mail, etc. According to the sergeant's confession, there are currently 25 B40 aircraft, 15 P35 aircraft, 7 P24 aircraft, and 2 transport aircraft in Guilin, totaling 53 aircraft. There are about 60 pilots, about 500 to 600 land-based maintenance units, and about 250 officers. Most officers live a gentleman's life, while officers are mostly rascals.

Central News Agency News - According to reliable sources, in order to cover up the responsibility for defeat, the enemy American air force stationed in Chongqing has been carrying out guerrilla-style attacks in non-military areas with no target, causing heavy damage to the people in various places, while the Japanese army has suffered very slight losses. At the same time, the Japanese army has close cooperation with the people in various places, and has perfect countermeasures in air defense equipment. Therefore, the Chongqing American air force's blind attacks on peaceful areas have aroused the disgust of the Chinese people. In addition, the Chongqing regime believes that the American air force's aerial guerrilla warfare in Chongqing is of no real value, and only bears the responsibility for trampling on the lives and property of the people. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly negotiated with the commander of the American air force stationed in Chongqing that in the future, any area within China that the American air force in Chongqing bombs must obtain the permission of the chairman of the Military Commission, otherwise it shall not indiscriminately bombard civilians. From this point of view, the recent changes in the Chongqing regime have really seen the power of the Chongqing American air force.

Japanese Air Force Attacks Liangshan and Liuzhou

Central News Agency, Mainland Base, 14th - The Japanese Air Force attacked Liangshan with a joint formation of fighter-bombers on the 12th, destroying 5 large aircraft and 6 small aircraft of Chongqing, and destroyed 5 large aircraft and 6 small aircraft of Chongqing in Liuzhou.

American Forces Illegally Attack Japanese Aircraft

Certain Base on the Chinese Front, 14th - A Japanese wounded transport plane, with a clear red cross mark on the fuselage, carrying several wounded soldiers, encountered ten American planes on its return to base. At that time, the Japanese plane was unarmed and was violently bombarded after being attacked by the enemy. It then tried to evade and caused one American plane to fall into the Yangtze River. Finally, it suddenly destroyed another enemy plane with its fuselage and then self-destructed.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin Airport

Central News Agency, Certain Japanese Army Base, 14th - A Japanese bomber team fiercely attacked the Guilin airport at dawn on the 14th. Amidst intense anti-aircraft fire, it destroyed three large aircraft and one small aircraft of Chongqing, and one airfield facility. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

### Fengyang County Collects Scrap Metal

### Japanese Government Decides to Establish Maritime Transport Council, Minister of Transport to Serve as Chairman of the Council

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - In view of the fact that maritime transport can directly affect the war situation, the Japanese authorities will concentrate all their efforts to strengthen transport capacity, enabling those who are directly responsible for important maritime transport relations to undertake it. Also, the increase in transport capacity is not only a matter of simple transport relations, but also has extremely close relations with shippers and other related parties. Therefore, at the 84th Diet, the establishment of a supreme transport guidance agency was proposed, which has attracted general attention. It is now heard that this proposal has been formally decided by the government authorities, and the Maritime Transport Capacity Emergency Enhancement Council will be established, with the Minister of Transport as the chairman. As for the appointment of bureau chiefs of various ministries as members and section chiefs as secretaries, the selection of members is now being carefully considered, and it is said that the members can be decided by the end of the month, and the first meeting can also be held at the end of the month.

### Emulating the Japanese Spirit of Endurance, Germany Vigorously Implements Total Mobilization, This Move May Affect the Fate of the Germanic Race

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - Germany is now implementing the second national total mobilization. Its success or failure can really affect the fate of the German people. Therefore, all Germans are determined to squeeze out the last drop of blood, and their attitude of acting vigorously is the current urgent task. In order to stop the Soviet offensive, total mobilization is vigorously implemented throughout the country, and areas directly threatened by the Soviet army, such as East Prussia, feel the impact of the thunder and lightning even more. Since August 2, all German people, regardless of age, gender, or occupation, have been working day and night under the command of the Nazi political instructors, with a participation of more than 100,000 people. There are thousands of party instructors alone, which shows the proactive nature of their work in defending the border. These rear warriors include Hitler Youth from the age of fourteen or fifteen and old men over the age of sixty. As for their occupations, they range from farmers and workers to university professors. The most interesting thing is a retired elderly major general who participated in the work while hiding his identity. Later, when a military conscription order was issued, people realized that he was a general.

War of Survival, Balanced Burden

Also, in the eastern line and other areas, these rear warriors rushed to harvest new wheat and transfer it to the interior. The food supply for the next year is really not a problem. This is similar to the scene of total mobilization in the Soviet Union when the German army invaded the Soviet Union that year, indicating that what the Soviet people can do, the Germans can also do. At the moment, the German people are shouting for unity and using the total strength of the nation to defeat the Soviet Union. Regarding the total mobilization plan, announcements are published every day. By looking at Goebbels's proclamation, you can gradually understand its full picture. Goebbels's original intention is not only to thoroughly mobilize labor and military power, but also to balance the national burden of the war, so that the name and reality of the war are the war of the entire people, in order to strengthen the spirit of common hatred. This total mobilization measure can really be regarded as a spiritual total mobilization. Its system and organization are closely connected, but because the German people's individual consciousness is strong, the government should consider the issue of maintaining individual lives. Therefore, the argument of learning the Japanese people's spirit of endurance has recently become quite intense.

Using Labor, No Idle People in the Country

The German newspaper on the 12th stated that after years of struggle, based on the needs of the situation, personal life should be extremely frugal. The most eye-catching specific strategy at the moment is that officials should reduce staff. The Ministry of Railways, which has 800,000 laborers, and the Ministry of Finance, which is similar in size, are both implementing large-scale staff reductions. In addition, what is more noteworthy is the increasing organization of home industry, which can decentralize factories into smaller units. It bears a great responsibility for absorbing the labor force personnel who were previously considered unusable and put aside. Its target is women over the age of fifty without labor obligations, women with infants in their arms, and the elderly and weak who cannot work in factories. They can work slowly in their homes. From now on, Germany will have no idlers except children. The implementation of this plan to utilize surplus labor is a typical example of a total war and can be immortalized.

### Rear Area Life in the Warring Nations

Germany

During the First World War, Germany experienced four years of Russian warfare. Therefore, in this war, in order to end the war in the short term, the so-called blitzkrieg method was adopted. However, it was not completely unprepared for a long-term war. Perhaps very difficulties would be encountered before the final victory was obtained, and this has long been considered. Therefore, efforts were made to prepare for a long-term war. The National Socialist Party government's policy of food self-sufficiency is one example.

It has been four years and ten months since the start of the war. During this period, the people devoted their entire lives to the war. During wartime, there were various restrictions on life, such as lighting control, food and clothing rationing, and travel restrictions, which resulted in various tiresome constraints. However, to this day, this kind of freedom has become accustomed to and regarded as natural. Moreover, since the enemy began to indiscriminately and cruelly bomb various cities last year, today there is no distinction between the rear and the front lines, and it has completely become a battlefield.

On the other hand, since last year, the German side has continued to fight hard on the front lines against the offensive of superior enemy forces. Although they have lived under intense enemy air raids in the past year, and unfavorable news from the front lines has continued to arrive, the German people have remained steadfast and patient, without being discouraged at all, which is truly surprising. This calm spirit is evidence that the belief in certain victory has never wavered. The reason why the belief in certain victory has not wavered must be attributed to the success of the policies implemented by the National Socialist Party government.

Last year, the National Socialist Party government, recognizing the imminent crisis, made overcoming the crisis its top priority. The first was to strengthen the propaganda force. Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote an article in the "German Weekly" every week, which has become a regular practice for several years. In the article, he informed the people of the crisis facing the motherland, and discussed in detail the origin and nature of the crisis, so that the people could understand the situation. He also repeatedly informed the people that Germany was fighting for justice, and the people, after listening, greatly improved their spirits.

The second is the provision of entertainment and food countermeasures. Immediately after the air raid, the government gave priority to the supply of food and strove to reopen cinemas and concerts. Avoiding food shortages is a fundamental prerequisite for carrying out the war, and the relationship between the stomach and the morale of the people is close. After the air raid, the supply of emergency food was extremely satisfactory, which greatly contributed to stabilizing public morale.

The third is the principle of strict punishment. When the country is facing a crisis, the existence of illegal elements among the people is not allowed. If such elements exist, they must be thoroughly eliminated in order to boost the morale of the people.

In addition, the people have absolute trust in Führer Hitler, which is inextricably linked to the belief in certain victory, which goes without saying. Although Germany is now standing at the crossroads of survival, the people under the leadership of the National Socialist Party leadership are all aware of doing their best and leaving the rest to fate. They are doing their best to fight, and the morale of the soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear is high, which is due to this.

England

German bombers took only thirty to forty minutes to reach London from their bases and drop bombs. Not only that, but the supposedly impregnable French Maginot Line was soon captured, and the elite German land and air forces advanced like a raging tide to the northern coast of France, waiting for orders to cross the narrow English Channel, only twenty to thirty nautical miles wide, and land on British soil. This was Britain in the spring and autumn of 1940, with the capital, London, becoming the battlefield, the first line reached by enemy artillery.

Wide automobile roads were piled everywhere with old cars and materials, ready to block enemy tanks. The squares where paratroopers could land were all studded with sharp iron rods. Sixty-year-old old managers were also incorporated into the militia and took up their guns for training. At night, they hung up their rifles and stood guard in front of their companies and offices. Not only the elderly, but housewives also learned to make hand grenades and practiced throwing them at German tanks.

Although the situation was so tense, on the other hand, the life of Londoners still maintained a normal state in a very comical fashion. The theaters were still full, and the pubs were crowded with people, talking loudly until late at night in the hazy purple smoke.

Soviet Union

On June 22, 1941, the German army suddenly launched an attack on the Soviet Union from the old Polish border. From that time on, Moscow took on the colors of wartime, and martial law was immediately declared. Detailed rules for air defense orders were posted throughout the city.

A strict blackout was implemented from 8:00 p.m. Taking photos and filming outdoors at night, and the business hours of shops and restaurants were restricted. In addition to permanent residents, no one else was allowed to enter Moscow. Citizens carried air defense masks on their shoulders, never leaving them for a moment.

Air defense activities and security maintenance were organized on a district basis. Men aged 16 to 60 and women aged 18 to 50 were forced to mobilize, forming self-defense teams of 200 to 300 people to carry out tasks such as delivering orders, firefighting, and administering medicine and hygiene. Regardless of whether there was an alarm, they took turns on duty every night. However, since the winter of 1942, most of the restrictions have been relaxed. (Translated from the Daily News, July 8)

### Abundant Coal Reserves in Various Parts of North China Are Fully Utilized According to Quality

Tokyo, 14th - Central News Agency report: The coal produced in various parts of Greater East Asia can turn iron ore into steel, which is indispensable for war, and can directly transform into combat power. It can not only be used for ironmaking, but also be regarded as an indispensable basic resource for heavy industry and the chemical industry. Today, coal produced in various parts of Japan, such as Hokkaido, Karafuto, Kyushu, as well as in various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and in North China, Mengjiang, Central China, Southeast Asia, and Manchuria, has all been converted to the above-mentioned important uses, and is being transformed into combat power.

Coal Resources in Greater East Asia

Regarding the coal resources of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the most noteworthy is the coal in North China. The coal in North China can be said to be inexhaustible in quantity and excellent in quality. There are also many types. At present, various types of coal are used effectively according to their quality and trade, in order to maximize their utilization. In short, it is enough to be completely transformed into combat power, so the most important resource is coal. Coal in North China can be classified in various ways. According to experts' classification methods, coal can be divided into bituminous coal and anthracite. From the perspective of its nature, bituminous coal can be divided into coking coal and weakly caking coal. Furthermore, from the above-mentioned uses, coking coal is coal for ironmaking, non-coking coal is fuel coal, and anthracite is coal for industrial and domestic use. The amount of coal reserves in North China varies according to experts' estimates. Let us assume that the total reserves are 130 million tons. If an average of 10,000 tons are mined per year, the amount can support 1,300 years of mining. If 50 million tons are mined annually, the mining period will be 2,600 years.

Transforming into Combat Power According to Different Uses

Based on the above-mentioned classification by use, we will further analyze the abundant coal in North China as follows. The purpose of this analysis is nothing more than to seek to transform the coal in North China into combat power. Coal for ironmaking: This type of coal should have high viscosity, low nitric yellow content, and low ash content. The most suitable for this type of condition is the coal produced in the Kailuan, Jingxing, Zhongjian, Dawenkou, and Liuhegou coal mines. This type of coal is strong coking coal in nature. If it is combined with coking coal produced in various parts of Japan, its degree of caking will be further increased, and excellent coke can be produced. Industrial coal: The coal used in light and heavy chemical industries has seen an increasing increase in production in recent years, and has become a necessary resource for North China's coal cars. This type of industrial coal is anthracite in nature, and the coal produced in the Yangquan, Mentougou, Pingxin, and Jiaozuo coal mines is the best. Among them, the coal produced in Jiaozuo, Henan Province, is particularly important in chemical industry applications. In May of this year, its reserves were confirmed to be ten times the previously estimated amount. Fuel coal: The fuel coal mentioned here refers to boiler coal. Most of the coal in North China belongs to boiler coal, and the best of these is the coal produced in Datong Fang'er. The boiler coal produced in North China is in high demand, especially in factories in Shanghai, Central China.

### Promote the Construction War in Burma to Accomplish the Greater East Asia War - Statement by the Head of the Bating Survey Group -

Rangoon, 14th - Central News Agency report: Dr. Batin, head of the Burmese Special Survey Group, and his party returned to Rangoon on the first anniversary of Burmese independence. Although the special survey group spent only a short period of one hundred days, it gained a great harvest. Dr. Batin is currently burying himself in sorting out the harvest of the past three months, as well as the wartime posture of Japan and other allied countries of Greater East Asia. After returning to Rangoon, Dr. Batin gave his first interview to reporters and made the following statement: It is natural that there is a shortage of wartime materials, but the Japanese people all endure everything for the sake of completing the war, regardless of their difficulties. The current policies of the Japanese government are completely based on the completion of the war, and the minimum living standards of the people are also ensured. At the same time, heavy industrial production shows leaps and bounds, and the mines and factories are as lively and productive as the battlefield. The high morale and the progress of production technology are beyond our expectations. Therefore, we cannot help but feel the desire to fight together with Japan, build together, and complete the war together. Burma has cast off all the shackles of the old Britain and the United States. At the beginning of this first year of independence, in order to restore the original appearance of the Greater East Asian nation, it is increasingly entering a full-scale construction war. The results of this survey will certainly be a driving force for Burmese construction. Under British rule, there was no room for development in the production of Burmese heavy industry. We deeply feel that it is impossible to succeed if we do not adopt the Japanese production methods and the methods of the newly emerging Manchuria. Controlling prices is by no means a policy of inflation. The system of maximum prices and official prices is one stage of controlled economy. Considering the failure of various countries in the world to suppress inflation, we should imitate the Japanese neighboring-relative cooperation system. In order to win victory, we must be slightly restricted in our freedom in order to achieve our great goals. Without victory, there is no independence and freedom. Therefore, in order to achieve victory, we must realize the above new ideas. Manchuria, the Philippines, and the Celebes are gradually realizing their ideals. How can Burma fail?

### North French American Pioneer Force Advances Eastward Beyond Alençon, Frequent Movements of Enemy Ships in Seine Bay

Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: The British and American forces operating in northern France are still planning to launch a large-scale attack on the German defensive positions from both the north and the south. South of Caen, in the Saint-Sylvain district and the Saint-Germain district, as well as at Tréharancourt, the British and Canadian forces attacked again on Saturday and Sunday, but the attack became localized after being fiercely resisted by the German forces. In the evening, enemy forces also advanced southeast of Vire, creating a local gap, which was plugged by a German counterattack. There were no major battles in the Mortain district on Saturday. Enemy forces concentrated around Alençon passed through the area and advanced to the north and east, and then launched a very major struggle. At that time, the American forces suffered heavy casualties. German defensive weapons destroyed no less than seventy-eight enemy tanks in the past twenty-four hours, and German main force aircraft destroyed another thirty. After the American attempt to seize the German fortress in Brittany by means of a surprise attack failed, they changed their tactics and are now advancing towards the strongholds of the German army along the coast, but the resistance of the German garrison is very strong, so the enemy is still unsuccessful. The battle for Saint-Malo is still in progress. The American forces have entered the town, but have been driven out again by German grenadiers in several places. In the outposts of Brest, German naval and army artillery bombarded strong concentrations of enemy tanks and dispersed them. The American forces in Loriant, who were fighting a more intense battle, withdrew again as a result of heavy losses. There were only local battles in the outposts of Saint-Nazaire. In Seine Bay, enemy ships were busy moving along the coast of Normandy.

Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: German military sources pointed out today that the large-scale encirclement battle planned by the Allied Supreme Command between Caen and Mont in Normandy is already very obvious. Yesterday, American forces, with several formations of tanks and mechanized units, advanced north, intending to break through towards Falaise. The activities of the Canadian First Army east of the Orne yesterday were limited to reorganizing their forces. All attempts to break through were unsuccessful.

### Rumors Rife in Paris, French Government Denies Them

Paris, 13th - Central News Agency report: Reuters correspondent in Paris, Royevski, reports: The war in northern France is becoming more intense, and there are repercussions in the streets of Paris. The sound of aircraft can be heard in the air from time to time, but there are no air raid warnings. These are German aircraft flying to the French front lines passing over Paris. In the past week, rumors have been rife, saying that the American forces have crossed the city of Chartres (between Alençon and Paris), only eighty kilometers from Paris, and that the German army has stopped resisting. The agents of the British, Americans, and de Gaulle are using the trick of spreading rumors, causing unrest. It is said that August 15th is the latest date for the American forces to enter the central district of Paris. Laval has arrived in Paris, so there are rumors of the government moving the capital. However, well-informed sources say that Marshal Pétain is still in Vichy and there is no sign of any change.

Farinacci concluded by saying that the enemy had said that the armistice conditions would not be eased.

### A Bayonet Fight Has Begun on the East Prussian Front, and the German Army in the Central Sector Is Still Maintaining Its Positions

Stockholm, 14th - Central News Agency report: The East Prussian anti-defense war is still fierce. The key point of the Soviet attack is the Leuco area, where a series of dozens of counterattacks have been launched as powerful Matthew troops continue to arrive. The German army's hard fighting has not yet allowed the Soviet army to set foot on its national soil. At the same time, forty-five miles west of Lake Pskov, the Soviet army has launched a large offensive, intending to reach the capital of Latvia, encircling Pskov to directly north of Taru, the vital point on the road to Tallinn. The German army is only making small concessions, causing the Soviet army to expend a large amount of troops.

Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: The Soviet army, which launched a fierce attack on the German fortified positions north of the Tevina River, shifted its main focus of battle to the northern road of the eastern front yesterday. Although the enemy used powerful tank formations as cover, its fierce attack was blocked by the German counterattack. The Soviet army west of Pskov attempted to advance to the northwest and both sides, where a major war immediately broke out. The German army blocked the Soviet advance to the north, while concentrated tanks and mechanized units advanced to the west. The battle is still in progress there. A group of Soviet troops who broke into the German shaped positions were cut off from their rear lines and annihilated. In the central sector of the eastern front, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the outposts in the eastern part of the Carpathian Mountains, but was repulsed by the Hungarian army. German formations launched a successful offensive in the outposts west of the Sanok-Carpathian Mountains, driving the Soviet army several kilometers to the north. Fierce battles broke out between Mire and the Vistula River. The German air force was dispatched here and fought successfully. Hundreds of German main force aircraft and tank bombers prevented the Soviet army from transferring reinforcements to the front line, so the German formations were able to defend their positions. The German army only moved its battle line to a new position in one stronghold. West of that area, German armored units penetrated deep into the Soviet positions, and the Soviet positions immediately withdrew several kilometers to the north. Several gaps in the Ostrovetsk area have been plugged. In a powerful offensive, the German army advanced several kilometers. Southeast of Opatów, a Soviet tank attack was blocked, and the German front line advanced further in a counterattack.

### Rocket-Type Bombs Will Begin to Attack Britain

Reykjavik, 14th - Central News Agency report: According to the Swiss News Agency, London: The recent attacks by V-1 flying bombs are as follows: V-1 flying bombs began to attack London on June 15th, and it has been eight weeks since then. They are still bombing Britain, but their intensity has decreased slightly. According to military experts, because the shooting down rate of V-1 flying bombs by the British Air Force increases when the weather is clear, the number of launches by the German army has decreased. In short, what everyone is most concerned about at present is the rocket-type bombs that will appear in the coming weeks. The "Daily Mail" reported that a certain Austrian researcher who surrendered to the anti-Axis forces said that rocket-type bombs might soon be launched at Britain from western Germany and southern France.

### The Future of the Japan-U.S. Decisive Battle

Former professor at the Swedish Naval Academy and current naval correspondent for the "Swedish Capital Daily," General Aberg, wrote an article for the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi titled "The Pacific War Situation in July 1944." In it, he pointed out the battles that the U.S. military should adopt in the future, as well as the necessary preparations and strategies. He also pointed out how the Japanese military should conduct counter-operations.

Nimitz's Goal

In February of this year, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Nimitz brazenly stated, "In the near future, the American army will land on the coast of China." Before this, MacArthur had also expressed his determination to "recover" the Philippines. There is a significant discrepancy between the operational goals expressed by these two individuals. Since occupying the important base of Saipan, Nimitz has said that the U.S. naval and air advanced base in the Pacific has taken another step deeper. However, if Saipan is followed by the occupation of Tinian, Rota, and Guam, it will expand into a consolidated and powerful base. Assuming that the American army can occupy these islands, it can effectively attack the inner lines of the Japanese army on the entire surface of the Western Pacific. However, Nimitz's next urgent operational goal may be to choose a foothold at one of three locations: Luzon, Taiwan, or Okinawa, or to seize the air force base on the Iwo Jima and Ogasawara Islands.

In addition, American submarines based on Saipan often appear near Taiwan. It goes without saying that American submarines often appear and disappear around the coast of mainland China, and even around the Japanese mainland. The reason why the United States was able to occupy Saipan, the Japanese supply base, is probably entirely due to the powerful cover provided by the air force carried by aircraft carriers. Another reason is the coordination with the air force stationed in China to participate in the battles for Saipan and other island bases. In addition, the U.S. bombing of the Kuril Islands from the Aleutian Islands is intended to divert the defensive power of the Japanese army and implement a containment strategy, which is also possible.

MacArthur's Actions

MacArthur has already occupied several powerful air force bases on Biak Island and Noemfoor Island. Now, the air force under MacArthur's command is using bases on these two islands and New Guinea to conduct air raids on a wide range of areas including the Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, southern Philippines, eastern Dutch East Indies, Makassar Strait, and Surabaya.

I believe that the naval forward base of MacArthur's army is Finschhafen Bay and Tanahmerah Bay in New Guinea. From there, they will carry out leapfrog operations towards Wewak Island and Morotai Island, and then attempt to occupy Mindanao. However, when attacking Mindanao, the cover of the Nimitz fleet attacking Yap and Palau Islands must be taken into account.

The Impact of the Indian Ocean Situation

The situation in the Indian Ocean has a great impact on the Pacific war situation. Britain wants to cooperate with the U.S. Pacific operations, and intends to recover its lost territories in the Indian Ocean and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, it is also dreaming of restoring the land transportation line between China and India, and the ocean transportation hubs from the Indian Ocean to mainland China. In addition, British submarines want to cut off the Japanese maritime transportation hubs to Burma around the Andaman Islands and in the Strait of Malacca.

In this situation, it is very likely that landing operations will be carried out in the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, northern Sumatra, and Burma. The shortest distance for Britain's constant pre-war operational goal of Singapore is the narrow waterway connected to the Malai Strait and the southern Dutch East Indies islands, but due to mines, ships, air force, and coastal artillery blocking the route, the British army may carry out a roundabout battle, passing through Timor and then advancing westward to Java and then northward, joining forces with MacArthur's army and other American forces, and launching a large-scale assault on the Japanese-occupied areas, directly targeting Singapore. This is Britain's grand plan.

American Military Strength

The current strength of the U.S. Pacific Fleet can be estimated as having fifteen battleships equipped with twelve 16-inch guns, ten large aircraft carriers, eight small aircraft carriers, and about thirty escort aircraft carriers. In addition, it of course also includes the British Far East Fleet, such as three "King George V" class battleships, five other battleships, and more than ten large and small aircraft carriers, as well as many cruisers from Australia and New Zealand.

The previously disbanded Halsey South Pacific Fleet has now formed a powerful mobile force in the Central Pacific. If the Spruance fleet, which carried out the Battle of Saipan and the naval battle on June 19, had as many as eight to ten battleships and about twenty aircraft carriers as before, then the Halsey fleet would be no more than that. In addition to the 58th Mobile Task Force, there are three powerful fleets dealing with Japan, which are currently conducting main force operations individually. In addition, the small fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Kinkaid, which belongs to MacArthur, is constantly appearing and disappearing under the cover of the powerful base air force. All of the above are facts that cannot be ignored.

Japanese Military Operating Methods

From this point of view, the Japanese Navy has to confront the enemy fleet on the vast Pacific Ocean. However, the Japanese overseas army must be constantly covered by the fleet, except for the troops stationed in central China. The Japanese mainland and Taiwan are important places related to the survival of the Japanese nation, but today, when Japan's southern transportation lines are severely hampered by the Allied forces, the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean cannot be ignored. The current situation of the Japanese fleet is impossible to know the actual strength, except for speculation. In short, the current Japanese navy is inevitably too dispersed.

The Japanese fleet is constantly changing according to the movements of the British and American fleets. Since the Japanese army has such fleet strength, the only way to operate is to concentrate its main force in one place and carry out a piecemeal annihilation tactic. For example, when the American fleet attempts to break through the Taiwan Strait and attack southern Japan, then Japan should pour all its ships into a deadly battle with one of the two major American mobile task forces, and perhaps there will be a way out.

No one can deny that the longer the war lasts, the more warships the U.S. Navy will build, and thus its combat power will be strengthened. "Time" is certainly beneficial to Japan, but it is equally beneficial to the United States, and this should be known. (Translated by Lu from the Yomiuri Hochi, July 21)

### Municipal Police Bureau Takes Over North Station Police Affairs

Since the Ministry of Construction abolished the Railway Police Administration Office and police affairs were transferred to the local police authorities, the Shanghai Police Section of the Shanghai North Station under the office has also been ordered to be abolished. The Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau took over, and it was decided that at 11:00 a.m. on the (15th), the Police Bureau would send Nakano, the deputy director of the General Affairs Department, accompanied by Sun Bin, the director of the Xihongkou Branch, to the police section to take over.

### Bureau of Weights and Measures Reiterates Authority

Zhao Shantong, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures, considering that merchants and people have not thoroughly understood the knowledge of weights and measures, and that various associations have repeatedly requested clarification of the authority to inspect the measuring instruments of pharmacists, gave a speech yesterday, stating: Since the National Government returned to the capital and all undertakings were waiting to be rebuilt, the central government, in view of the fact that it is necessary to promote unified weights and measures in order to restore prosperity to industry and commerce, has re-formulated the promotion of unification and the establishment of inspection bureaus in various provinces and cities to handle the matter. In June of the 31st year, I was ordered by the former Social Bureau to prepare for the organization, and on July 15th, the bureau was officially restored and established. I immediately started to sort out and formulate centralized inspection methods by district and industry in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and gradually promoted them. However, due to environmental limitations at that time, and because the bureau had just been restored, both manpower and material resources were limited, so it could not be widely promoted, which is a deep regret. Since the recovery of the two concessions last year and the abolition of the First District Public Office on August 1st this year, the administrative structure of the city has been completely unified. In the face of promoting the unified administration of the city, the bureau's responsibility lies in making the greatest efforts to promote its rapid completion, in order to eliminate illegal profiteering, relieve the suffering of merchants and people, and subsidize the prosperity of industry and commerce. Regarding the recent reports from various associations that the municipal police authorities inspect weights and measures, and the police officers dispatched may not be familiar with the laws and regulations of weights and measures and inspection knowledge, resulting in those who have been inspected and qualified by the bureau or the inspection bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang being investigated and punished from time to time, while the illegal British and American systems prescribed by laws and regulations are allowed to run rampant. It is the responsibility of the bureau and we cannot remain silent. A special case has been submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau and the National Bureau of Weights and Measures for forwarding to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry for prompt correction in order to emphasize the administration of weights and measures.

### Police Bureau's Crime Prevention Section Holds Expanded Propaganda to Make Citizens Understand the Meaning of Crime Prevention

In order to prevent the occurrence of crimes and ensure the public safety of the city, the Municipal Police Judicial Office has been promoting crime prevention work, and people from all walks of life in the city have placed high expectations on it. It is learned that in order to ensure that citizens have a deep understanding of the meaning of this work and methods of cooperation, in addition to launching various propaganda activities, the Crime Prevention Section is also showing slides in major theaters in the city, stating the main points of crime prevention, and the wording is alert, which is very effective in propaganda.

### Nanshi Sells Red Sugar for Pregnant Women

The red sugar necessary for pregnant women in the Nanshi area has been widely sold since the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office designated ten sugar merchants, including Yichang and Yuanchang on Limalu, to sell it separately, which is convenient for all pregnant women in the area. It is learned that the procedures for the sale of red sugar stipulate that pregnant women who apply to purchase red sugar should first obtain an application form, fill it out in detail, and after it has been certified by the joint guarantee and stamped, attach a photo of themselves, and then purchase two market catties of sugar from the designated sugar shops, with each catty costing 111 yuan and 3 jiao in reserve coupons.

Short Comments

### There is an Urgent Need to Rectify Tax Revenue

Regarding the case of fraud in special consumption taxes, Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau has already made a statement a few days ago and is conducting a thorough investigation. There has also been much discussion in public opinion, prompting attention. We have repeatedly offered suggestions on the rectification of fiscal affairs in the city, especially the rectification of tax revenue. We hope that after fiscal affairs are sound, the salaries of police officers serving in public office can be increased, so that they can maintain a minimum standard of living, and then we can seriously talk about administrative efficiency.

The exposure of this tax revenue fraud case further proves the weaknesses and loopholes in the city's tax revenue, and there is an urgent need for rectification. We hope that the municipal authorities will investigate the fraud case impartially and thoroughly, without being subject to any constraints, so that the crimes can be clearly determined and made clear to society. At the same time, regard this case as a serious lesson, a painful experience, and make a thorough reform and practical rectification of all future tax revenues, whether in terms of the system, the organization, or especially the personnel. Director Yuan stated a few days ago that he plans to make special consumption taxes an independent institution and hire well-known people from society who have experience in tax affairs to take charge of the matter. We hope that this can be realized. If we follow the old ways and do not deal with the current fraud case, and if we continue to follow the old ways in the future rectification of fiscal affairs, then the future troubles will be even greater than today's fraud case, and all the construction plans of Greater Shanghai will eventually come to nothing. This is what we urgently offer for the municipal authorities to pay attention to.

### Prohibition of Late-Night Hawking

Recently, general electricity consumption in the city has been strictly restricted, which is due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, and is also a necessary measure to practice wartime life. The content of wartime life can be summarized as intensive production and economical consumption. Therefore, any uneconomical consumption violates wartime life.

Secondly, as we have said before, Shanghai is an important city in the rear, and enemy air raids are expected to be very likely. Therefore, air defense is the responsibility of every citizen and is something that every citizen should abide by for their own safety.

Therefore, anything that violates wartime life or violates air defense, no matter how trivial, should be reformed. To give a small example, there are often food vendors on the streets of the city in the evenings or late at night, hawking and selling along the streets, or striking objects to make noise and sell, as has been the custom for many years. First, late-night hawking disturbs the public's sleep and affects the energy of the city to work the next day. Second, the food sold is mostly for the leisure of those with little education, supplying the consumption of those who do not engage in legitimate work, violating thrift, and is not beneficial to eat, but hinders hygiene. Third, the food stalls have lights and loud hawking, which is a hindrance to air defense. We hope that the police authorities will pay attention to this and consider whether it is necessary to prohibit late-night hawking. This is one example, and anything that does not meet wartime needs, regardless of its historical customs, should be banned.

### The Industrial and Commercial Adjustment Committee Holds Second Committee Meeting

Since its establishment, the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee has spared no effort in carrying out the investigation and statistics of the city's industry and commerce. Its preliminary investigation work has recently been completed, and various statistics have been prepared, analyzing the current situation of industry and commerce in great detail. In order to determine future work plans and actively promote and assist the sound development of industry and commerce, the committee has specifically decided to hold the second committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow (the 16th) at the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhougong Bridge on Henan Road. It is reported that Deputy Minister Jiang Zuoxuan of the Ministry of Industry will attend and preside over the meeting.

### Postal Savings Bank Resumes Full Savings Withdrawal and Deposit Method

Postal savings accounts used to have a full savings withdrawal and deposit method, whereby account holders who opened full savings accounts could freely deposit and withdraw money at any post office in the local area, which was quite convenient, but it was suspended in the 29th year of the Republic of China due to the situation. It is reported that the postal savings and remittance authorities, in view of the current traffic obstacles and the inconvenience of customers having to go to the original bank to deposit and withdraw money, have, for the sake of the public, issued an order to resume the full savings withdrawal and deposit method. The local postal savings and remittance bureau and various post offices have implemented it.

All member representatives unanimously and enthusiastically supported and passed the resolution. In addition to donating 25,000 yuan in the name of the association and Cai Zixiang to the Xinwen Newspaper on August 14th to rescue out-of-school children, we are now sending the remaining 25,000 yuan and ask you to check and issue receipts accordingly.

We hope you will do your best to promote it, to benefit poor students. We would be very grateful."

A Kind-Hearted Person Emits a Ray of Kindness

I am donating 20,000 yuan, a small amount, to express my feelings. In the future, I will do my best to donate. There are many wealthy merchants in society. I hope that everyone will respond, so that the ideal goal of education assistance can be achieved. The country will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate."

### Trends in Economic Crime

—Tomb Tao Xiong

Economic crime is a spark that occurs in the related aspects between the economic control law order and penalties. Economic criminal law, in the theoretical aspects of economic crime, is nothing more than the economic control law seen from the surface of penalties. Therefore, it is naturally impossible to know the trends in economic crime by breaking away from the economic control law.

The Progress of Control

Although Japan's economic control law order is generally said to have developed in response to the evolution of the July 7th Incident, in fact, it had already begun to progress long before the September 18th Incident. When the Japanese nation would become a loser in economic terms and be expelled from the newly acquired land that our fathers and brothers exchanged for their heads and blood, which we can never forget, the Japanese people's boiling patriotic enthusiasm ventured to rise up publicly, launching a major event, and today's Japan has a new starting point. The origin of the economic control law also starts here. Anyone who thinks about the order of economic control must clearly recognize this action that was born out of patriotic enthusiasm. The spirit of Japan's economic control law must be regarded as related to national affairs and should be accepted wholeheartedly. Therefore, it should be regarded as a special Japanese law and unfolded accordingly. Frankly speaking, the economic control law is nothing more than something that will promote the Japanese code of law today and tomorrow, but since it consistently runs through the spirit of the national polity from beginning to end, the reason why there are deep hidden things that cannot be understood lies in this relationship.

The economic control law that developed in this way is for the sake of the Japanese nation, so it must be powerful. Therefore, it already has the help of penalties, and at the same time seeks help from penalties. This has already become a characteristic. The reason why it is called crime and attracts attention is this reason. In 1938, the prices of export goods stipulated by the Temporary Measures Law gradually tended to expand by 32%, and in 1939, with the launch of the National General Mobilization Law, it entered the era of price control orders. Therefore, price control always seeks the help of strict penalties and has an unshakable dominance. In this era of price control, economic crime and economic criminal law appeared in a very dramatic way, so everyone paid attention to it.

The era of the prevalence of anti-price from 1938 to 1941 was produced in this way. However, price control is like trying to arbitrarily use penalty dams to prevent a large economic river from flowing downward, which is really impossible. Therefore, the river water crossed this dam and flowed to the sea, which is impossible to prevent. This is the phenomenon of violating prices.

Controlled Material Allocation

In order to complete price control and to remedy the prevalence of price violations, simply stabilizing prices is not appropriate, and the movement of materials themselves must be controlled. Therefore, it is necessary to control the allocation of materials. Thus, allocation control was produced alongside price control. This is because it is impossible to prevent the downward flow of river water by building a penalty dam at the downward flow, and the only way is to move the water flow itself to another waterway, so the idea of allocation was produced. For materials, this clear water flow, a certain allocation waterway must be created. Anyone who does not go through the proper waterway will be determined to have violated the allocation and will be punished, that is, to strengthen the allocation route itself with penalties. Therefore, much effort has been gradually spent on the source of materials to create allocation waterways. The rationing system is also a by-product of the amount of water produced in the allocation mechanism.

Control is control. The price control of one material is called the price control of other materials, and price control itself is called allocation control.

However, after this well-thought-out allocation mechanism is established, just like river water flowing into a fixed road and having an organized dam built, it naturally becomes a system, and an economic organization appears. Price control before control reaches the economic organization, as well as material control, is a kind of control to prevent the conclusion of sales contracts that exceed the legal price, and it is a kind of control to prevent the exchange of materials that does not reach the law. This is a behavioral control law, that is, an economic behavior law. Soon after, the economic organization itself was also controlled. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the controlled economic organization with penalties. Therefore, due to the occurrence of necessary protection, it is necessary to consider the criminal law protection of the economic organization, because it is adapted to the criminal law provisions of Article 31 of the National General Mobilization Law and Article 5 of the Temporary Measures Law for Export Goods, which aim to protect behavior. This is the economic criminal law to maintain the economic law order, that is, crimes of malfeasance and economic secrets and oil extraction in the economic field. All of this takes the existence of the economic organization law as a prerequisite and adopts a strong protective stance.

Two Types of Economic Crime

Therefore, economic crimes can be divided into two types. One type is crimes that violate the order of economic behavior, such as violating fair prices and violating allocations. The other type is crimes in which control association officials and camp group officials accept bribes and destroy the economic organization. Crimes that voluntarily allow themselves to be law-ordered in the economic control law order will certainly not disappear in the future, but there were very many of these crimes in the past. As for the latter, that is, crimes that violate the economic organization law order, are a type of crime that is certain to continue to occur in the future.

The current trend in economic crime is shifting from crimes against economic behavior law to crimes against economic organization law, and the center of gravity of economic criminal law is gradually shifting. All enterprises that are allowed to exist are ultimately nothing more than helpful to increasing war power and have the most social and national character; that is, it is required that each enterprise abandon profitability, get rid of dependence on capital, and operate according to the sole purpose of production. This national character of enterprises, in the world of economic criminal law, will be the possible basis for the prevalence of county magistrate malfeasance crimes. When enterprises were dominated by profitability and absolute dependence on capital a few years ago, economic malfeasance crimes could not occur and could not be promoted.

Today, new types of economic crimes are very numerous and are rampant everywhere, and they are becoming more dangerous. Whether those who know this situation can eradicate these crimes is really a difficult question. However, what about Japan, from the end of the Taisho era to Showa 56 (1930), how did those surging and raging ideological crimes come about? This is worth recalling. The target of ideological crimes was communists, the target of old economic crimes was small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and the target of new economic crimes is economic leaders. All of them believe in economic laws, and all of them believe in economic inevitability, that is, the ideological basis is the same. But in Japan, ideological offenders were finally able to understand the fact that spirit is better than matter, and the national polity is better than capital.

For economic crime, the main thing is to understand the national polity ideology. And the judges, prosecutors, and police officers who represent the Emperor in executing trials must firmly grasp their loyalty and respond to this crime by proving the existence of the national polity ideology. Economic offenders who do not have a strong understanding only know how to satisfy desires and pursue material things, and do not know that there is anything else. Compared with ideological offenders, it is easier to reawaken their long-dormant loyalty.

New Economic Criminal Law

The new economic criminal law targeting officials of control associations and camp groups is fully expressed in the Regulations on Punishing Economic Relations, but the spirit of this law is not only to simply judge the acceptance of bribes by officials of control associations and camp groups as illegal, but it should also be known that this requires the integrity of officials and public servants in control relations. In addition, domestic politics and control must follow the current situation of wartime guidance. Although the leaders are soldiers, they must also seek absolute integrity from friends. Now, when soldiers are not only on the front line, but also in the rear in the country, when guiding daily economic behavior, they must specifically express that they are loyal patriots who firmly believe in the national polity ideology. This is the method of winning victory. "Only when the inside wins can the outside win." This is a national polity ideology that has been tested for thousands of years, and it will certainly crush the economic ideology that has only two or three hundred years of history.

### Scholarship Office Work Report

The various measures of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund are decided by the committee and implemented by the office. The office reports its work to the committee at any time. However, the scholarship undertaking originates from the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, and both the committee and the office are responsible to society. Now, as the seventh examination season draws to a close, a summary of the work of the past six months, as well as the process of this year's student selection, is reported to concerned individuals from all sectors as follows:

School Surveys, Visits and Interviews

In order to understand the situation of schools in this city and to establish contact with various schools, the office issued a school profile survey form in March of this year, requesting each school to fill it out. Visits and interviews were conducted in April and May. A total of 588 survey forms were filled out and returned by the schools. Except for a very small number of schools with special circumstances, or those that have not yet been related to this newspaper's scholarship fund, it can be said that all levels of schools in the city are included. A table of various types of schools and student numbers is listed below for reference by those concerned with education:

Type of School Total Number of Schools Total Number of Students

Elementary School 422 167,572

Junior High and Junior Vocational Schools 199 38,848

Senior High and Vocational Schools 127 17,629

Universities and Colleges 34 12,763

Supplementary Schools 4 7,385

Total 787 244,192

The total number of various schools here is 787, which is 199 more than 588. This is because 131 schools are simultaneously classified into two categories (such as junior and senior high schools being counted in both junior and senior high schools), and 34 schools are simultaneously classified into three categories (such as junior and senior high schools having affiliated elementary schools). However, the number of students is listed separately in each category without duplication.

As for visits and interviews, due to time constraints, they could not be carried out universally, and will need to be continued in the next semester. However, the concrete impressions gained from the schools already visited, and the results of interviews with school authorities, are quite useful for the handling of scholarship undertakings.

Guidance for Scholarship Recipients

The guidance work carried out in the last semester included the following: 1. During the visits and interviews to schools in April and May, talks were held with scholarship recipients from middle schools in each school. Schools with a larger number of students held separate sessions, while schools with a smaller number of students held joint sessions of two or three schools. As a result, the scholarship recipients were even more mindful of the high expectations of people from all walks of life and became more determined to strive. The economic methods of learning discussed were also helpful for their self-study. Some students expressed their opinions, which were also of reference value. 2. On January 14th, this newspaper's social service office jointly organized a vocational guidance lecture for high school and above students. The speakers included Mr. Pei Yunqing, Mr. Pan Yangxiao, Mr. Xu Yuanfang, Mr. Huang Xiwent, Mr. Lu Meiseng, and Mr. Chen Qishi. 3. Weekly academic lectures were held ten times from May 28th to July 30th. The lecturers were Mr. Fu Yuguang, Mr. Xu Yuanfang, Mr. Junliang, Mr. Wang Chengzou, Mr. Xu Feng, Mr. Shi Zhao Fuxin, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Jiang Zhensheng, and Mr. Fang Ziheng. The topics covered subjects such as philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, geography, and engineering. The venues were located at Xinzha Road Elementary School, Huizhong Middle School, and the China Science Society. All scholarship recipients from high school and above chose to attend lectures based on their interest in the topic and the convenience of the time and location. Each person attended at least two lectures and submitted one set of notes. The number of attendees at each lecture ranged from 100 (limited by seating) to 300. 4. In June, a practical calligraphy competition was held for scholarship recipients in junior high and senior elementary school. Hard-nib and brush calligraphy, running script and regular script were not restricted, but certificates were awarded separately. Those who passed the preliminary selection participated in the final competition at this office on June 27, with emphasis on speed. As a result, 15 people won first prize and 32 people won second prize.

The Process of This Year's Student Selection

The method of selecting students this year is slightly different from previous years. Applicants must first have their qualifications reviewed by the school, and application forms will only be issued to those who are deemed by the school to be both impoverished and outstanding. School authorities must fill out a recommendation form for each applicant. After receiving the application form and recommendation form, the office will review them again and eliminate those with poorer grades or relatively better family conditions. The rest will be grouped, numbered, and registered. The statistics of the number of registrants this year are as follows:

Senior Elementary School 1,832 Junior High School 2,974

Senior High School 1,274 University and College 857

Total 6,937

There are two benefits of objective testing: one is that the grading can be absolutely fair, without being affected by the grader's personal preferences and psychological changes. The correctness of the answers has a certain standard, and the grading results are the same regardless of who does it at any time. This is especially necessary in large-scale examinations, where thousands of test papers need to be graded in a short period of time. The second is that the answering time is reduced to the shortest limit, and the number of test questions can be increased, so that students are not judged by chance familiarity or neglect of a small number of topics. According to the test results, the reliability of such objective tests in one session is comparable to the results of six or seven ordinary exams. The distribution of test questions for this year's test is as follows:

Senior Elementary School & Junior High Senior High

Junior High 1-2-3 Grade & University 1 Grade

Text Reading Comprehension 20 Questions 30 Questions 20 Questions

Character Selection 20 Questions 20 Questions 20 Questions

Word Usage 20 Questions —— ——

Literary Knowledge —— —— 20 Questions

Natural Science 20 Questions 20 Questions 40 Questions

Foreign Language Word Meaning —— 20 Questions 20 Questions

Fill in the Blanks —— —— 20 Questions

Arithmetic 16 Questions 12 Questions 16 Questions

Total Number of Questions 116 122 226

Test Time 2 Hours 2 Hours 2.5 Hours

Most of the various test question formats use the multiple-choice type. Each question has four or three answers, and candidates only need to choose one. A few examples are listed below:

Squalid is 1. Not quiet 2. Not clean 3. Not tolerant 4. Not pleasant to hear

This flower is (1. also 2. or 3. even 4. and) beautiful

The great disaster of the Northern Song Dynasty was 1. Eunuch Power 2. Warlord Arrogance 3. Foreign Invasion

The place where the Yellow River breaches and causes disasters is often in 1. Luoyang Area 2. Kaifeng Area 3. Jinan Area

The kidney is 1. A digestive organ 2. An excretory organ 3. A circulatory organ

If a force of three pounds and a force of four pounds are applied at one point, the resultant force may be 1. Zero pounds 2. Five pounds 3. Twelve pounds

Teacher is 1. Listener 2. Teacher 3. Neighbor

Some of the test questions use a matching format, with four questions in a group and six answers provided for each group. Candidates choose one answer for each question. An example is given below:

Treat others' countries as your own, who will attack? Human nature is evil, goodness is artificial. The gentleman is wise in righteousness, the petty person is wise in profit. Those who pursue personal gain are punished, those who conquer countries become feudal lords. 1. See Analects 2. See Doctrine of the Mean 3. See Mencius 4. See Mozi 5. See Zhuangzi 6. See Xunzi

Preliminary testing can distinguish the academic performance of students. In addition to schoolwork, extracurricular reading and experience are also quite important. If the test results are compared with school grades, they can be mutually verified. Here are the overall grades on the school recommendation forms of the top five students in the first grade of senior elementary school to see a glimpse:

Gu Zhiwei 2nd place out of 37 students in Zhenying Elementary School

Zhu Cibin 1st place out of 74 students in Huishi Elementary School

Yu Depan 1st place out of 53 students in Runde Elementary School

Shen Fuxing 3rd place out of 72 students in Wuding Elementary School

Xie Baoyu 1st place out of 45 students in Shengxin Elementary School

As for the decision on the number of people to be approved, the amount of donations must be considered, and expenditures must be based on income. Those with particularly excellent test scores will be selected. Students who cannot be approved are not necessarily failing, but are simply limited by donations, and there is nothing that can be done. Similarly, the amount of subsidy per student must also be limited with reference to donations. Except for a few schools with particularly low fees, it is generally only enough for five or six tenths of the tuition and miscellaneous fees, which is very regrettable. The list of approved students for senior elementary school and junior high school has now been released, and the number and budget are as follows:

Senior Elementary School 1,200 students Budget 2.4 million yuan

Junior High School 1,500 students Budget 4.5 million yuan

Total 2,700 students Budget 6.9 million yuan

The list of senior high school and university/college students has not yet been released. Based on the current total amount of donations, the budget can only approve 800 students. If donations increase sharply in the coming days, the number of approved students can be increased. This is hoping for the final enthusiasm of people from all walks of life.

### Navy Long-cherished Wish (II)

— Written by Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yang

"How did you know the arrival time of the train?"

Longfu looked at his younger sister in surprise, but the appearance and body of the younger sister who he had not seen for six years had completely grown up, which made him even more surprised.

"It was Zhenren who telegraphed to inform..."

"Ah, so that's how it is!"

Longfu thought to himself that he would certainly tell Zhenren about taking the early morning express train, but it was really appreciated that he notified the family.

"Is Dad still angry with me?"

This was a sentence that Longfu suddenly asked his younger sister when he got on the tram from the West Station.

"How can you be so worried?"

Miss Zhi's voice was very gentle and soft. The tone was just like a newlywed wife speaking to her husband, deeply imprinted on Longfu's mind.

"Changed..."

Longfu felt strange and secretly looked at his sister's face. The slightly permed hair, neck, and milky white shoulders had the flavor of a Tokyo girl, but the sunken eyes, long eyebrows, high nose bridge, and lightly closed lips still had the shy look of Changdi.

(This younger sister who was scolded by her mother for climbing to the top of the tree has now changed so much...)

Longfu believed that his sister's change was nothing more than the result of age.

After changing trains halfway, they got off at Second Middle School Street. Longfu carefully looked at the houses and shop signs lined up along the street, which made him feel the infinite touch of revisiting the old place even more. Everything was the same as six years ago. Even now, he felt that Zhenren, Ren, Wandai, and others were coming from the opposite side wearing cotton clothes.

As soon as he arrived in Shimoarata, he immediately smelled the scent of the sea breeze blowing from Tenpozan. Sakurajima quietly revealed its head on top of the neatly arranged houses. In an instant, the street leading to his home appeared in front of him. Tears welled up in Longfu's eyes, and he could no longer look into the distance.

When they arrived in front of his house, Miss Zhi hurried into the house. Longfu suddenly became shy when he opened the door to his house.

The sound of footsteps was making noise inside the house. The glass windows rattled sharply.

"Ah, Longfu..."

His mother's voice and figure, filled with sorrow, appeared in front of Longfu at the same time. Longfu lowered his head like a criminal, unable to say a word.

After a while, urged by his mother, Longfu walked towards the study. Here, his father was still sitting healthily.

"Dad... I am guilty."

"Don't say any more!"

His father held his son in his arms, and tears could not help but flow from his eyes.

(III)

Like a dream, three days passed.

Indeed, the hometown was good. The mountains, the sea, the fish, the loquats, and even the pickles of his hometown all suited Longfu's taste.

His parents did not blame their son's past, and his friends were praising his success in winning the Navy Minister's award.

"Longfu, I am old and want to stop working for the city government and go to Tokyo to live with you!"

His father said this one morning when the two of them were sitting and chatting.

"Yes, that would be best."

Longfu did not dislike his hometown like the painter Ichiki, but he had to stay in Tokyo permanently in his professional position. When he thought about being a son, he felt that he should also do his filial duty and serve his parents. How happy it would be if the whole family moved to Tokyo to live together! But what he was concerned about was the timing. It would be better to live together and talk about family happiness after his position was stable.

"How about in five or six years?"

"Yes, there is no need to rush."

His father quietly flicked off the cigarette ash and continued:

"Also, Zhi is grown up now. She is already twenty years old."

"Should she get married?"

"Yes, I wanted to wait for you to come back to talk about this issue, but to be honest, I already have someone in mind."

"Who is it?"

"It's Zhenren-kun from the Tani family."

Longfu couldn't help but exclaim when he heard this sentence.

(Why didn't I notice this before?)

He really wanted to knock his head. There could be no more suitable match than this. Zhenren and Zhi-mei have known each other since childhood. Their father and mother have always praised Zhenren and the simple family style of the Zhenren family, and Longfu himself greatly respected Zhenren as such a good friend. The reason why he didn't think of forming such a good family marriage was because he always felt that the two were still children.

"Absolutely approve, absolutely approve!"

Longfu's voice was so loud that it almost startled his father.

"That person is definitely good, but we should have sought Zhenren-kun's own opinion earlier."

"Then what does Zhi-mei think?"

"Zhi-er? Zhi-er!"

His father laughed loudly for some reason.

### Improvement of the Apprenticeship System

— Zhi Jing

The unreasonable apprenticeship system is cursed by most people. I always feel that this is the influence given by the current social system. It already has deep-rooted traditions, and it will be very difficult to eliminate it in a short time. It can be said categorically that it is impossible. The only remedy is to improve the current apprenticeship life from all aspects. Now I put it forward hoping to attract everyone's attention:

Sweeping the floor, emptying the spittoons, etc., are considered by people to be unworthy of work, and apprentices are made to do it. This is a destruction of young people and a burying of ambition. This view is extremely reasonable. But, apart from apprentices doing this trivial and necessary work grudgingly, is there anyone else to replace it? This is the crux of the problem. Therefore, I think the key lies in correcting the general public's subjective concept of apprentices. Whether it is managers, accountants, or partners, the most important thing is not to think that this kind of trivial work is the main daily life of apprentices. On the contrary, it should be considered as their unavoidable incidental operation. If we can understand this point, all problems can be solved easily. Here are a few principles to contribute below.

Shorten the Apprenticeship Period Currently, most stores stipulate the apprenticeship period as three years (although there are also shorter ones). During this long period, they receive extremely low wages and do heavy work. During this stage of life, they are very likely to cause great changes in their psychology and feel hatred for reality. Therefore, I believe that shortening the apprenticeship period is the first priority. The method can be to determine the apprenticeship period based on their age, from a little over a year to two years.

Gradual Guidance Everyone has self-esteem, and young apprentices are the same. Their fragile minds cannot withstand excessive blows. If there are occasional mistakes, they should not be moved [missing character], and their own work should be guided from the side at any time.

Provide Opportunities for Further Education Convenience should be given as much as possible for studying in schools in their spare time. If it is actually impossible, some time should be left in the store to give them opportunities to learn. Excellent pictorial magazines should be encouraged to read, and they should not be discriminated against.

4. Distribute Work According to Talent Many managers with subjective prejudices assign habitual work based on the order in which apprentices are employed. Apprentices who enter the store later, even if they have better talents, do not easily get work that matches their talents. This prejudice should also be broken.

In addition, if there are housewives living in the store, apprentices should absolutely not be allowed to do their household chores. Partners should avoid bothering others as much as possible for their own affairs, otherwise they should also show a kind attitude. (Remuneration to help study)

### Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory Medical Laboratory Establishes Free Services; Chinese Dental Hospital Offers Free Extractions

The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory Medical Laboratory, regarding impoverished men and women in society who wish to have their bodies checked or who suffer from illnesses and require laboratory tests to diagnose the source of their ailments, are often limited by their financial circumstances and unable to fulfill their wishes. From today onwards, amidst their heavy workload, they will extend an invitation to experts to dedicate a portion of their time each day to perform voluntary laboratory tests. We have received one hundred free laboratory test referral letters, and impoverished sick men and women can apply for referrals at this office.

Furthermore, the Chinese Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital, established to this day, is about to complete two decades of serving society. Benefiting people and assisting them is its aim. Because there is a free treatment department, it is dedicated to serving impoverished patients with volunteer work. At a time when all goods are expensive, the cost of drugs and materials used by the hospital has also gradually risen, but in order to alleviate the suffering of the poor and sick, the task of free tooth extractions will continue. Now, in order to expand the scope of services, a type of free tooth extraction certificate has been printed for distribution to the poor and sick. We have received twenty of these and will distribute them on your behalf. The new scheduled registration time for free tooth extractions at the hospital has been changed to 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM every morning, starting today. It is hoped that patients will take note.

### Chinese Document Research Society Organization Completed

### News from Charity Schools

The Private Hualian Middle School on the sixth floor of the Xueye Building, No. 255 Beijing Road, is known for its strict training of young people. Last semester, entrusted by this office, it ran the vocational training class with remarkable results. The school's principal, Mr. Chen Tianyu, is now tentatively planning to continue establishing a simplified senior high school commercial program. All subjects will emphasize practical application, so that school education and social life can be integrated. The program will last one year and the tuition will be low. Those from impoverished families can also request assistance. Anyone who has graduated from junior high school or has an equivalent level is welcome to register. The exam will be held on the morning of August 25th.

The Zhengfeng Elementary and Middle School at No. 60 Yongjia Road, in order to encourage outstanding young people, will hold scholarship examinations on August 13th and 27th. Those with excellent conduct (those with above-average conduct grades from their previous school) and a score of 70 or above on the entrance exam will be exempt from half or all of their tuition fees. There will be 20 students each for elementary and middle school. There is also a half-day class that teaches major subjects such as Chinese, math, and general knowledge. The program is divided into three terms and lasts four years, with a level equivalent to elementary school graduation. Tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees are only 250 yuan. Classes have already started and there are still openings.

Students from the Hongshe and Mingxin (formerly Lixin) Accounting Schools in this city, in view of the large number of out-of-school youth, especially students and apprentices in shops who lack vocational skills, have specifically established the Hongxin Obligatory Accounting Tutoring School with funds raised by Hongshe. All faculty and staff are volunteers from the Mingxin University alumni association. In addition to waiving all tuition and miscellaneous fees, textbooks are loaned and paper is provided, which is a great blessing for impoverished children. Registration begins on August 15th and classes will be held from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, starting on September 1st. School address: No. 48, Lane 41, Jiading Road (Card Road), inside Guangzhong School. Details and brochures are available upon request.

The Shanghai Private Huai'en Elementary and Middle School's "Guiqin Scholarship," which offers free and half-price student aid to twenty students each, still has openings. A second exam will be held at 9:00 AM on August 18th. Students with excellent character and academic performance from impoverished families in senior high school grades 1 and 2, as well as all levels of junior high and elementary school, may apply. School address: No. 32, Wangjiasha Garden Road, Datong Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII).

The Private Jiancheng Elementary and Middle School at the intersection of Baker Road and Datong Road has established the Jiancheng Student Aid Fund for three years. This year, more than 400,000 yuan will continue to be raised by all teachers and students to continue the program. Those from truly impoverished families with excellent academic and behavioral records can receive full tuition and miscellaneous fee assistance. Those from impoverished families with acceptable academic and behavioral records will also receive half-price or more assistance with meals. There are still a few openings available. Those who cannot afford to attend school should apply quickly.

The Central Vocational Obligatory Night School aims to assist outstanding impoverished out-of-school children. This year, it will begin to enroll new students. Anyone from truly impoverished families with a desire to study may apply, regardless of age or gender. Levels: Three classes of 60 students each will be accepted for Senior Elementary School Book 4 and Junior Elementary School Book 8 and Book 4. Time: Every evening from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Fees: Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, books are provided, and a security deposit of 200 yuan is collected, which will be returned at the end of the semester. Registration: From now until August 19th (registration will close when full). Exam: August 21st and 22nd, 7:00 PM. School starts: August 25th. School address: No. 189, Lane 9, Dean Lane, North Suzhou Road.

Qingyun Elementary School, in order to help out-of-school youth, has specifically set aside a fund donated by the school's board of directors to provide assistance to impoverished students. This semester, sixty scholarships will be temporarily established. Those from truly impoverished families who are healthy, and whose academic and behavioral records are above average, may apply. Registration begins immediately and the exam will be held on August 22nd. School address: No. 365 Minguo Road (intersection of Yongan Street).

The General Association of Charity Schools organized by the Vocational School Friendship Association has been in operation for almost a year. However, because the lease on the school building inside the former Beijing Road Vocational School has expired, the new school building has been located inside Chunyi Elementary School on Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road. Registration will begin on the 3rd of this month from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Classes start on the 20th. Time: 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM daily. Grades range from Junior Elementary School Grade 1 to Junior Elementary School Grade 4. In addition to retaining places for old students, new students will continue to be recruited, regardless of age or gender.

The night schools organized by the Jiashen Obligatory Education Society are successively recruiting new students. The first school is located inside Chunyi Elementary School at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Ningbo Road and specializes in Grades 4 and 5 of elementary school. The second school is located inside Fumin Elementary School in Maler Lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. The third school is located inside Ma'an Lane on Dagu Road and specializes in Grades 1 to 6 of elementary school. The curriculum is the same as the daytime curriculum. Classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night. Registration begins immediately. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, and a security deposit of 100 yuan is collected, which will be fully refunded at the end of the semester if there are no absences.

Secondhand Book Service - The Ziqiang Secondhand Book Service Society, in view of the current high price of books and the difficulty students have in purchasing them, the purpose of this service is to lend secondhand books for reading to those who cannot afford to buy them, and no rent will be charged. Those who wish to borrow must lend books they have previously read to the society in order to exchange them. It is temporarily divided into junior and senior high school sections. The lending period is set from August 5th to 25th, and the borrowing period is from August 25th to September 5th. We hope you will participate enthusiastically. Service hours: 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. Address: Chengyi Middle School, No. 694 Taishan Road. However, because the society does not have a university section, it is expected that there will be few books for senior high school Grade 3. Therefore, we sincerely hope that students in senior high school Grade 3 last semester can assist by voluntarily lending as many textbooks as possible. We welcome you. Also, in response to the needs of students this autumn, a consignment book department has been specifically set up. Prices for consignment are negotiated, and a handling fee of 5% is charged after the sale. All of the fees, after deducting expenses, will be used for this newspaper's scholarship fund.
