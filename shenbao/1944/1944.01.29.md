### Editorial: On Increasing the Production of Talent

Increasing production is of utmost importance to a nation, whether in wartime or peacetime. Especially during the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang Jingwei said, "This year should be a year of total mobilization for the production increase movement." However, increasing production cannot be achieved through empty words; it requires the entire nation, from top to bottom, to be grounded, practical, and diligently hardworking. In our opinion, the definition of increasing production is "utilizing human power to increase material resources." Therefore, human power is the primary factor in the issue of increasing production, and talent – individuals with genuine ability and practical knowledge – is the most crucial element within this primary factor.

Chairman Wang Jingwei said, "We must protect productivity, enhance productivity, and cultivate productivity." The same applies to the issue of talent. For existing talent, we must make every effort to cherish them and sincerely employ them. For talent already employed, we must cherish them greatly and enable them to increase efficiency. For new talent in the future, we must strive to cultivate them.

The existing talent now is the result of past cultivation by the nation and society and represents the nation's current essence. The authorities should make every effort to cherish them and, with the utmost sincerity, immediately employ them. Participating in government work is good, and participating in social work is equally good. The most crucial thing here is sincerity. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, only with true sincerity can all personnel issues be resolved.

It is hoped that talent that has already been employed will redouble their efforts and redouble their increase in efficiency. The authorities should "grant full authority and regulate with full rules." With full authority, they will not be constrained; with full accountability, they cannot shirk responsibility. Prior constraints and subsequent shirking of responsibility are the greatest drawbacks of past administration. This drawback has harmed countless national affairs, made it impossible for those engaged in politics to distinguish between right and wrong, and created a negative image of the government in the minds of the people. What era is this now? This ailment must never be allowed to recur.

New talent in the future is the lifeblood of the nation, and the authorities should strive to cultivate them. The most important method for cultivating new talent is planned training. Twenty-six years ago, China's university education and specialized education were quite developed. However, there was a contradictory phenomenon in society at that time: talent and careers were mismatched. On the one hand, everyone could not find work; on the other hand, everything could not find people. Therefore, the nation spent huge sums of money every year, but the nation could not benefit from the use of talent, which was a great waste. Therefore, planned training should be based on the needs of national and social construction, specify procedures, and proceed step by step. The goal is to have a type of talent prepared for every job, and when one person is trained successfully, there is a job for that person. The authorities should have a comprehensive design, and the government and society should have close communication and coordination. Now is a critical period, and we would like to propose an on-the-job training method, which is the simplest and most effective. This integrates training into practice, combining teaching and doing. It is most practical for science, engineering, and administrative management. Students, while actually participating in work, have practical places and wise guidance. The experience they gain is far greater than that gained solely through lectures. At the same time, the new talent trained in this way can immediately have work and immediately serve the country. Therefore, planned training of new talent is the most important focus of cultivating new talent.

The above are just a few simple principles. In view of the need for talent in the year of increased production, we are specifically raising them, hoping that government authorities and social figures will pay close attention to them and then research detailed plans.

Greater East Asia National Representatives Congress; Proposal to Convene by the Japanese Parliament

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese parliamentarian Seiichi Aoki, on the 27th, proposed to the Yokusankai Committee, on behalf of aspiring Diet members, to hold a Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, and hoped that the members would support it. The main points of the proposal are as follows: In view of the great achievements of the Greater East Asia Conference held last November, in order to realize the mutual assistance principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration through the national consciousness of the various countries of Greater East Asia, and to strongly promote the great undertaking of building Greater East Asia, it is hoped that the government will stipulate the holding of a Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference in the Greater East Asia construction policy. In order to realize this, a resolution with this aim will also be included in the final agenda of the parliament.

### Rabaul Suffered Four Air Raids, Over a Hundred Enemy Planes Shot Down; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Results of Various Battles

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 28th: The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy Garrison engaged approximately 80 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul on the morning of January 24th. Twenty-four of them were shot down (eight unconfirmed). Aside from the sinking of two of our ships, there was no other damage. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy Garrison engaged approximately 200 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 26th, shooting down 67 (18 unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return, and there was some damage on land. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force engaged approximately 150 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul twice on the morning of the 27th, shooting down 31 (11 unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific: 22 enemy aircraft attacked Madang early on the 27th. After the Japanese army's ground fire engaged them, the enemy aircraft fell into disarray and randomly bombed the dense forest area before fleeing. The Japanese side suffered no damage in this battle. According to reports, two enemy D40-type aircraft collided in the air, and both enemy aircraft crashed in the dense forest area. From this battle, it can be seen that the enemy's combat technology is very poor in the air power that attacks with quantity.

### Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Weekly Battle Situation; Japanese Air Force Attacks Jian'ou Airfield

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the weekly battle situation on the 28th as follows: The Japanese Dispatch Army in China's mopping-up operations against the Chongqing Communist Army are becoming increasingly active. Among them, in the North China area, 782 bodies of the Chongqing Communist Army were abandoned in the areas of Dongshan and Xishan. The Japanese army seized 9 firearms and 596 rifles. The "cleaning up" is continuing in this area. Furthermore, on the 24th and 25th, the Japanese army aircraft, despite the bad weather, launched a fierce attack on Jian'ou, which was prepared by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing as the first-line base for air raids on the Japanese mainland, and destroyed the runway and nearby military facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.

Four U.S. Planes Attacking Hong Kong Shot Down

Hong Kong, 26th (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Hong Kong on the 23rd with 24 fighter-bombers. The Japanese naval air force immediately engaged them, shooting down four (P40) type aircraft.

### Japanese Hospital Ship Attacked Again

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific, the Japanese hospital ship Yoshino Maru was bombed by enemy aircraft at 2:30 AM on the 26th while sailing towards a Japanese military base in the front line waters of the South. Fortunately, the personnel and hull were not damaged. Although it was midnight, the weather was excellent and the visibility was clear. At the same time, the ship was marked with the night identification of a hospital ship and was sailing with navigation lights. Therefore, this bombing by enemy aircraft was an atrocity. It is clear that the enemy's illegal bombing of Japanese hospital ships has now reached more than ten times. If the enemy continues not to reflect and commits this inhuman act again, the Japanese side will inevitably take the final means to punish them.

### Ambassador Gu Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Southern China; Situation in Hong Kong and Guangdong is Good

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The information department of the Japanese Embassy announced today: Ambassador Gu, in order to inspect the situation in Southern China, departed from Nanjing on January 16th and inspected Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Taipei.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador Gu, who had gone to Southern China on his first inspection tour since taking office on the 16th of this month, has now returned to Nanjing. He also issued a statement on the 27th as follows: In order to adapt to the new stage of Sino-Japanese relations, we have implemented reforms in the embassy and consulates in China. This time, in order to inspect the various situations in Southern China, I went to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taipei. At the Guangzhou Embassy Office, in order to further develop the new policy towards China and thoroughly permeate the central policy, I convened a meeting of the heads of the offices in the South China region and made various agreements. In particular, the cooperative relationship between the Guangdong Provincial Government and our side is progressing extremely smoothly, which is a great pleasure. In Hong Kong, I deeply felt that the area is a microcosm of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The mechanism for the Chinese in Hong Kong to communicate their intentions to the higher levels is achieving very good results. The Sino-Japanese relationship is extremely close. The distribution of materials, except for special items, is generally smooth, and the power of the Governor's administration is strongly exerted. I also held talks with the heads of the Chinese and Japanese military officers and influential figures in the private sector to review the situation in the South.

### Under U.S. Pressure, Argentina Announces Severance of Relations with the Axis; Japanese and German Foreign Ministers Explain Their Views

Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Argentine government announced at 10:00 AM on the 26th that it was severing relations with Japan and Germany.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated his views this morning at the first subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives' budget committee in response to questions from Diet members regarding the Argentine government's severance of relations with the Axis powers. The gist is that the Imperial government's diplomatic policy towards neutral countries is to maintain and promote friendly relations with each neutral country. From this perspective, if the news that Argentina has severed relations with the Axis powers is indeed true, it is regrettable. However, it is also evidence that the enemy countries are illegally oppressing neutral countries, forcing them to join the Anti-Axis camp.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to the Havas News Agency, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday told reporters that for several years, the United States has been trying to get Argentina to sever relations with the Axis powers. The Ramirez government has now succumbed to U.S. pressure and sacrificed its national sovereignty to gain U.S. favor. As for Argentina's claim that German Embassy personnel in Argentina were involved in espionage activities, that is absolutely false.

### Spanish Embassy to Represent Japanese and German interests in Argentina

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires, Spain will henceforth be the country representing the interests of Japan and Germany in Argentina. The Argentine Minister of the Interior, Birgen, has already considered all necessary measures to maintain domestic security, and plans to take full precautionary measures near the Japanese and German embassies.

The China-Japan Aircraft Donation Soccer Charity Match, organized by the Xingya Patriotism Association, East United vs. West United, was postponed due to rain and held in Yiyuan on Sunday.

### Matsushima Fleet Press Officer Discusses Naval Strategy: U.S. Naval Operations Violate Principles

Central News Agency dispatch: Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese fleet, met with a group of Chinese journalists at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 28th) on the fourth floor of the fleet's press department. He made the following remarks regarding strategy:

"The Chongqing Special Report on the 27th claimed that on the 19th, a Japanese warship struck a mine and sank southwest of Wuhu in the Guichi area, resulting in over a thousand casualties." Based on this report, we can imagine that a warship with over a thousand personnel would certainly be over 10,000 tons. We would never deploy a warship of that size in that location, so its absurdity is self-evident.

Air Combat Aspect

The activity of Japanese naval fighters is universally acknowledged, and their combat power is undeniably unmatched. Combat power refers to the three essential elements of a fighter plane: speed, firepower, and maneuverability. The reality of this combat power can be proven by the fact that when enemy planes attacked Hong Kong on the 23rd, our air force, with a smaller force, intercepted a larger enemy force and shot down four enemy planes. The most important issue is the air force personnel. Our air force personnel are not only able to endure hardship and fight, but they are also very well trained. Therefore, they can cope with ease in terms of: maneuvering – adjusting speed and fuel usage up, down, left, and right; reconnaissance – judgment; and combat – shooting. They can also demonstrate their combat abilities even in cold, thin air or in adverse weather conditions. Since we have such excellent fighter planes and air force personnel, and the number of planes is extremely large, it is only to be expected that the U.S. Air Force will suffer heavy losses.

Naval Warfare Aspect

The purpose of naval warfare is generally to destroy the enemy's main fleet. However, the enemy's (American) elite forces, including battleships and aircraft carriers, are being depleted in operations around the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands. In terms of naval warfare principles, this can be said to be putting the cart before the horse, and the result will be self-destruction. In the past, the United States used its main fleet for transportation and island occupation operations, and has already lost most of it. According to a Washington dispatch on the 26th, the head of the U.S. War Production Board, Donald Nelson, announced that in 1943, the U.S. built two 45,000-ton battleships, fifteen aircraft carriers, and other warships. This announcement is merely propaganda to cover up their past excessive losses. These warships will simply replenish the majority of the main force previously lost by the U.S. However, if the U.S. continues to use them for island occupation operations, it would be a waste of war effort. Furthermore, it is unimportant to worry about the U.S. building a large number of warships, because the combat power of a navy is the product of machinery and human power, as shown in the diagram:

Naval Combat Power = Human Power (total number of people, skills, and spiritual strength) x Machinery Power (ships and weapons)

No matter how much the United States increases its machinery power, it is absolutely impossible to make crude progress in human power. In Japan, a naval lieutenant usually goes through a ten-year process. Even a sailor, to be able to fight, must undergo at least three years of training. Therefore, it is impossible for the U.S. to replenish its human power. We do not need to worry about its increased production of machinery power.

Napoleon once said: "The final decision in war is the spiritual strength of man." Therefore, we are certain that the final victory in the Greater East Asia War belongs to us.

### Spring Vacation Ends: Money Shops Reopen Today; Banks Resumed Operations Yesterday

The general accounting for the 32nd year of the Republic of China has concluded.

Stock Exchange Resumes Operations Today: The Huashang Securities Exchange, which suspended trading on the 20th of this month to conduct its final accounting, has now completed its vacation and is scheduled to resume operations today. However, since today is Saturday, only morning trading will be conducted. Regarding brokers' commissions, which were 0.0625 during the trial auction period, the exchange plans to increase them to 0.125. The brokers have requested to temporarily maintain the current rate and are currently negotiating. In addition, the exchange has allowed brokers to establish sales representatives (i.e., junior partners), stipulating that each broker may have five sales representatives. However, each sales representative must register with the exchange and obtain a business license. These sales representatives are not allowed to directly enter the market for trading. All transactions must be handled by the brokers.
