### Announcement to Female Compatriots

The great Confucian scholar Gu Yanwu of our country said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." This is indeed a profound truth. It is worth our heartfelt adherence to. It should not be interpreted as referring only to men, but should be interpreted as "individuals," including women.

Women's thoughts and actions are enough to influence the family, and thus enough to influence their husbands and children. Therefore, we have the example of Madam Jing Jiang assisting her husband in building the nation, and Mencius's mother teaching her son to achieve fame. In addition, there are countless precedents for learning, such as Madam Curie dedicating herself to science. To shirk this responsibility would be a mistake. Modern warfare is total war, and cannot be borne by only half the population, the men. Let us briefly review the expectations and responsibilities placed on women in various warring nations, as a lesson for us.

Japan's age limits for conscription and labor are stricter than those of other countries. Recently, in order to implement the "Essential Outline for Decisive Battle Emergency Measures," there has been significant activity on the domestic front. Consequently, on March 28, the cabinet decided to strengthen the system of women's volunteer corps. The purpose is to organize unmarried women aged twelve to forty into women's volunteer corps, based on their occupation and region, to engage in tasks suitable for women's characteristics in the coming year, and to actively advance towards increasing production for war efforts. This measure is different from general conscription, but it aims to expand the organization of women's labor, so that women can spontaneously assist in increasing production based on patriotism in response to the needs of the current situation. Today's Japanese newspaper reports from Tokyo's Central News Agency that factories across Japan are working day and night to increase aircraft production, and the deployment of women's volunteer corps is particularly noteworthy.

Germany announced the "Military Service Law" on March 16, 1935, which allowed the conscription of men aged eighteen to forty-five. On September 22, 1939, the "Student Apprentice Placement Order" was announced, stipulating the mobilization measures for male and female students aged sixteen and above during the busy farming season. On January 27 of this year, the "Wartime Labor Application Order" was announced, requiring men aged sixteen to sixty-five and women aged seventeen to forty-five to apply to their respective labor bureaus.

The Soviet Union announced the "Military Service Law" on September 1, 1939, stipulating that men aged eighteen to fifty should be conscripted for active duty. In addition, it stipulated that women aged nineteen to fifty with special skills should register with the army and navy and be incorporated into the second reserve. According to the "Labor Law," the age limit for conscription is sixteen to fifty-nine for men and sixteen to fifty-four for women. In terms of auxiliary labor, even young men and women as young as twelve are conscripted.

The enemy Britain announced the "National Service Act" on September 3, 1939, which required men aged eighteen to forty-one to be conscripted. On September 5 of the same year, the "National Registration Act" was announced, which required laborers aged twenty-one to sixty-five to register. In November 1941, the scope of registration was changed to men aged eighteen to fifty-one and women aged eighteen to forty, and women aged twenty-one to thirty-one were forcibly conscripted.

The enemy America implemented the "Selective Service Act" from September 16, 1940, which stipulated that men aged twenty-one to thirty-six should be registered for military training. The following year, the age limit was expanded to eighteen to sixty-five. Recently, according to Paul McNutt, head of the Wartime Manpower Commission, based on the Austin-Wadsworth Act, women aged eighteen to fifty must also be forcibly registered and have an obligation to be conscripted by the state.

In summary, it can be seen that the demands on women in wartime in various countries are no less than those on men, only differing in age limits and the nature of work due to physical strength. Fortunately, the women of our country, in view of the international situation and the domestic environment, should repeatedly and deeply study the true meaning of gender equality and understand how to conduct themselves. Otherwise, if they confine themselves to being concubines and slaves, allowing themselves to be played with and still be complacent, their ignorance is pitiful. As for contributing to the darkness and degradation of society, whether intentional or unintentional, their crime is punishable. Considering the position and work undertaken by women in other countries, what should those women who do nothing but play mahjong, dance, and watch plays all day with red nails and permed hair think?

I hope that my female compatriots will, from today onwards, resolve to uplift themselves, correct their faults if they have them, and strive harder if they do not. And remember the saying, "Every 'woman' is responsible for the rise and fall of the world."

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Enemy Positions in Western Kohima, Enemy Troops Defending Imphal Are Exhausted

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – On the 14th, despite adverse weather conditions, Japanese army fighter planes repelled enemy fighter groups and resolutely launched a fierce attack on enemy artillery positions near Zipsa, west of Kohima. They broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft barrage and carried out intense dive bombing, with bombs hitting enemy artillery positions and groups of vehicles concentrated nearby, inflicting devastating blows. In the aerial combat, they also shot down two high-speed bombers. One Japanese plane did not return to base. Also on this day, a group of fighter planes attacked a certain area in central Burma, but was met by the Japanese army, which shot down eight P-51 aircraft (three of which were unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return to base.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a report from Kandy, the Southeast Asia Command announced on the 16th that Japanese aircraft bombed American and Chongqing troops stationed in the Mogaung Valley of northern Burma, inflicting significant damage.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – The enemy troops defending Imphal for more than a month have shown signs of exhaustion and wavering in recent days. According to the enemy's intention, they originally intended to confront the Japanese army at Imphal until the rainy season arrived, believing that the Japanese offensive would be limited by the rainy season. Therefore, the enemy army used its superior air force to carry out aerial supply work to enhance its combat power and implement counterattacks. To date, the biggest factor in the enemy's ability to sustain resistance is reliance on continuous aerial transport of personnel and materials. This method is tantamount to giving the enemy's soldiers spiritual vitality. Aerial supply is subject to various conditions, and its effectiveness is far less than that of land transport supply. Therefore, in the Indo-Burmese border area, the aerial supply work will be greatly affected after the rainy season arrives. Currently, the enemy's aerial supply work is carried out at night or at dawn because they fear attacks from Japanese aircraft during the day. However, night and dawn are the times when the rain is most intense. Therefore, after the rainy season arrives, the aerial supply work will encounter the greatest difficulties. The Japanese army, on the other hand, is different because it has already secured ground supply routes, so it can still carry out the annihilation battle against the British Indian Fourth Army even in the rainy season. Now, the enemy relies on the solid fortifications built over a year and a half, about a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, hundreds of artillery pieces, and aerial supply to continue to resist. However, the arrival of the rainy season will make the enemy feel the crisis of severed supply lines. At the same time, coupled with the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, the enemy will inevitably fall into a difficult situation, and their confidence in defending Imphal will waver.

### Factories Nationwide Work Day and Night, Japanese Aircraft Production Doubles, Women's Volunteer Corps Mobilized for Diligent Work

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – During this decisive battle period, what the billion people of Asia are most concerned about is enhancing the superior air power that can overwhelm and annihilate the enemy. The aircraft production target for the 19th year of Showa (1944) must achieve a several-fold increase over the production of the 18th year. Factories across the country are working day and night to launch a production increase campaign, resulting in a constant increase in aircraft production. Japanese aircraft production has been focusing on ultra-priority production for more than a year, and aircraft production has been increasing dramatically month by month. In this year, there have been many cases of several-fold increases in production. At the same time, new and advanced aircraft with excellent performance have been manufactured one after another. Looking at the production index of a certain factory, the production of one worker has increased several times in this year. On the one hand, the number of workers has also increased. The total production value of the factory has increased several times. This is not only an example of the rapid increase in aircraft industrial production in Japan. The details of this figure are explained as follows: What is most striking is that the amount of production per person has increased several times. This amount of production is the amount of money that is evenly distributed among the number of workers, and it is not caused by raising the official price during this year. There are even cases of the official price falling, and there are three reasons for this. First, production equipment has been formally prepared. Second, with the improvement of the same production equipment, there have been significant improvements in operation management, and the production time required for a large number of reduced man-hours has been implemented. In addition, the military authorities have worked hard to unify machine types or strive to simplify them, and have also made reasonable adjustments to the inspection standards of products. Third, the increase in the labor capacity of workers is most noteworthy. Whether they are staff or workers, they are fighting under the banner of "Kamikaze Squad Members," striving to achieve the production target. What is particularly noteworthy is that while the amount of production per worker has increased, the number of workers has also increased several times. However, the workers who have been added in one year at a surprising rate of 80% to 100% are almost all unskilled workers, not even experienced workers. They are all novices to the aircraft industry, newly recruited soldiers or female workers and female volunteer corps. Moreover, the average age of the newly recruited soldiers has also increased significantly in this year. This fact can generally imply the following two points: that Japan's aircraft industry has indeed made great progress today, and has leaped from infancy to adolescence. The second thing to pay attention to is how much room there is for future increases in the amount of production per worker. What is most noticeable in aircraft factories is the dispatch of women's volunteer corps. In terms of actual working conditions, women account for a certain percentage of workers in the airframe manufacturing department, and women are also replacing men in the engine manufacturing department. Although the dispatch of women's volunteer corps is only a modest manifestation in terms of numbers, their strong will to work and their fighting spirit, which is not inferior to that of men, is commendable.

### Japanese Postal Savings Exceed 20 Billion Yen

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – According to a survey by the Ministry of Communications on the 17th, postal savings have now exceeded 20 billion yen, which is the largest record since the start of the postal savings business in Meiji 8 (1875). According to the previous year, May, it was 10 billion yen, and it has doubled in just two years. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the increase record was 3.5 billion yen in June of Showa 12 (1937), 5 billion yen in July of Showa 14, 10 billion yen in May of Showa 17, and 15.8 billion yen in July of Showa 18. That is, since the Sino-Japanese War, it has achieved more than five times the good results.

Local movements are also carried out in accordance with this policy. The method of implementation is decided by the local liaison conferences composed of prefectural and prefectural support associations and prefectural government liaison consultation councils, taking into account the actual situation of each locality.

### Chongqing Troops Show American Characteristics, Willing to Degrade Autonomous Status

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th – Chongqing's belief in resisting Japan has been increasingly strengthened since the Cairo Conference last year, along with the fierce progress of the Pacific war. Therefore, it has been seeking for a long time to strengthen the military strength of the first line of the mainland counteroffensive and the air transport base against Japan in the southeast. However, the anti-Japanese counteroffensive base was crushed in this instant collapse. It is noteworthy that the Chongqing army has American characteristics. The training and equipment of the Chongqing army, which is the mainstay of the anti-Japanese counteroffensive, is completely Americanized. Infantry schools and artillery schools have hired American advisers to train various cadres. What is most noteworthy is that the Chongqing Army's 12th Army "Xue Yue Department," which was deeply influenced by German military advisers before the incident, is also rapidly turning pro-American. In the ordnance factories in Lushan and other places in the Funiu Mountains, American and British-made rifles, light machine guns, and armored vehicles are piled up like mountains. After the Battle of Hankou, the Soviet-style Czech-style military aircraft that once appeared on the Xiangdong Front in 1940 have now disappeared. The army commanded by generals and colonels is now completely Americanized. The United States' ambition to command Chongqing in this operation is not only in the military field, but also in the political and economic fields, which are completely swept into American rule. Chongqing's independence and autonomy have invisibly entered the American trap.

### Indian Heavy Industry Plants Equipped with Self-Destruct Devices, Indians Dissatisfied with British

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – Recently, an Indian arrived here. According to him, Indian local capitalists are extremely dissatisfied with the attitude of the British. They hope that the British will retreat and welcome the Japanese-Indian army and Bose. The following is a record of his conversation: The Indian people all believe that if the British withdraw from India, they will adopt scorched-earth tactics and destroy various heavy industries. In fact, various heavy industry factories are now equipped with self-destruct devices. Indians are extremely opposed to this move by the British, and there are already widespread complaints. At present, public utilities such as electricity, water, and railways are exclusively occupied by British capitalists. If the British retreat and Bose arrives in India, these industries will be invested by Indians, so they all hope that the British will retreat. Heavy industrialists believe that there is a need for the heavy industry of Japan and the infant industry of India to coexist and prosper together. If the British leave, Japan will definitely be able to provide assistance and help it develop. Therefore, they hope that the British will retreat.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – Several mass graves of 10,000 people have been discovered near Ula, between Vitebsk and Polotsk. The mayor of Ula said that in June 1941, about 2,000 Latvians were killed by the Soviet secret police and thrown into these graves. Most of them were upper-class people and many women and children. Most of these victims came from the city of Memel. When they arrived near Ula at the end of June, they were exhausted from hunger, thirst, and fever. They were shot dead by the Soviet secret police with machine guns in broad daylight. Two days later, nearby residents were forced to bury these unfortunate Latvians. After the German army recently swept through the area, the people reported it to the German authorities, and these burial sites were discovered. The German authorities have organized a special team to excavate these graves.

### Reforming Provincial Administrative Agencies Benefits Health Undertakings, Interview with Director Lu of the Health Department

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – The provincial administrative agencies have been reformed, and the Economic, Food, Social Welfare Bureaus, and the Propaganda and Health Departments have all been abolished. In order to understand the situation of health matters in the provinces after the abolition of the provincial health departments, the reporter visited Director Lu of the Health Department, who said: The Yuan has resolved to abolish the health departments and change them to be handled by the provincial political affairs halls, with the provincial governor directly responsible for them. The observation and facilities are certain to be quite appropriate, and are actually much closer compared to the days when the health departments existed. The purpose of strengthening health at the county level will not be interrupted as a result. The opportunity for this department to discuss with the provinces from time to time based on its authority will not be alienated as a result. There is no better method than this. During this period of epidemic prevention, the relationship is very important. It is hoped that all personnel involved in epidemic prevention and social groups assisting in the work will continue to work as usual. It is important to know that after the change to handling by the political affairs hall, the rate will be stronger than before, and we must work harder to achieve complete success. Under the wartime system, reforming administrative agencies is bound to be done as well as possible. From the beginning to the end, there is still a need for the political affairs hall to work hard during the six-month trial period. However, the world's health undertakings depend on gradual implementation in peacetime, so as to eliminate the effects of the work invisibly and unknowingly. Moreover, the cost is also twice as high as other undertakings, because it can only improve people's health and does not directly increase production, so people often neglect it and regard it as insignificant. This is the reason for China's backward health, and it lies here. Recently, the administration of health has been handled by the provinces, and the provinces have also gained an understanding of the importance of health. Therefore, the future of health is greatly promising, so it is said that this reform of agencies is of great benefit to health undertakings.

### Soviet Army Prepares to Launch Large-Scale Offensive - Frequent Soviet Troop Movements on Old Polish Border

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: From the German perspective, it is unknown whether the Soviet summer offensive will be launched simultaneously in several locations. One of the most important goals of the Soviet Command is likely the advance of the Southern Route Army through Galati towards the Romanian oil fields. The German army's resistance in Crimea has allowed the German defenses on the Dniester, Prut, and Siret fronts to be strengthened calmly, and the Soviet army has failed to gain a springboard for future offensives. The current lull on the Eastern Front is actually the calm before the storm. When the Allied forces carry out large-scale activities in Western Europe, the Soviet army will also launch a large-scale offensive and is currently actively preparing.

### 17 Enemy Ships Sunk - Rear Admiral Yoshikawa Receives Special Honor

During the Battle of Bali in February of Showa 17 (1942), the Japanese Navy 8th Destroyer Division encountered a powerful enemy fleet and fought against overwhelming odds. In late November of the same year, during the Battle of Guadalcanal, the reinforcement unit destroyed a superior enemy fleet in the waters off Lunga, fully demonstrating the attacking spirit of the Japanese Navy's mine warfare unit. The Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet had previously awarded letters of commendation for these two battles. Lieutenant Commander Yoshikawa, captain of the destroyer, made the greatest contribution in these two battles. On November 24th of last year, Lieutenant Commander Yoshikawa engaged the enemy's combined fleet commander in the waters west of Bougainville. In order to commend his outstanding achievements, the matter was reported to the Emperor, who ordered that he be promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, which was announced by the Ministry of the Navy on May 1st. This is truly the highest honor for a destroyer fleet captain. According to Naval Captain Nakano Minoru, an associate of Rear Admiral Yoshikawa from his time at the Naval Academy, Rear Admiral Yoshikawa's combat record is as follows:

As a destroyer captain in the mine warfare unit, the Rear Admiral was renowned in the military for his courageous fighting. He participated in a total of 35 battles, large and small, and achieved great results each time. He sank a total of 17 enemy ships, including 6 cruisers, 10 destroyers, and 1 submarine. He often opened the door to victory in various battles and single-handedly repelled 641 enemy aircraft. His remarkable achievements made him the center of admiration for the entire fleet. On November 24th of last year, after completely transporting army troops to Bougainville Island, on the way back, the ship encountered an enemy cruiser squadron in the sea 57 nautical miles west of the island. The destroyer unit, consisting of eight ships, immediately launched a close-quarters attack, breaking into the enemy formation amidst a hail of bullets. He died heroically. According to the report of an officer from a friendly ship, the ship encountered enemy units and engaged them in battle, followed by a large explosion. The Rear Admiral and all the crew members perished with the ship.

Life Experiences in Dozens of Battles

The Rear Admiral often used the phrase "dedicate myself to the sovereign and the country" as his motto, which was the consistent creed of his entire life. This loyalty was unequivocally proven in his glorious combat record in various battles. The most intense of these battles were the Battle of Bali, the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, and Troki.

In the Battle of Bali, the Rear Admiral, as the destroyer captain of the mine warfare unit, protected the landing of army troops on Bali Island. While patrolling the Lombok Strait east of the island, he encountered a US-Dutch joint fleet composed of 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers. He immediately sank 2 destroyers and severely damaged another, while the rest fled in panic. Cruisers had the mission of attacking destroyers, but the Rear Admiral actually engaged an enemy fleet composed of 3 destroyers and 2 cruisers with his warship, sinking two of them and severely damaging one. His great achievement fully proved the Rear Admiral's conviction and courage.

In the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, from late August to mid-November, under enemy air supremacy, the Rear Admiral undertook the important transportation mission and was able to land successfully. During this period, he and friendly ships cooperated to sink one enemy cruiser and one enemy destroyer. When the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred, the Rear Admiral was the destroyer captain of the vanguard unit of our fleet. After discovering the enemy fleet, he immediately informed the entire army and unexpectedly broke into the enemy fleet, sinking two enemy large cruisers and severely damaging one large cruiser and one destroyer. The Rear Admiral held the determination that "one cannot catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den," causing the enemy fleet to be limited to chaos and opening the door to victory in this sea battle.

Completing the Mission and Heroically Sacrificing His Life

Last November, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive on Bougainville Island in the Central and South Pacific. The Japanese Navy inflicted great damage on enemy ships in five air battles over Bougainville Island, but the enemy still landed on the island regardless. The Japanese army fought bravely, and the Rear Admiral undertook the extremely difficult transportation mission in this battle. He completed the mission in the first and second attempts but heroically sacrificed his life on the way back.

The Rear Admiral was a descendant of the Yoshikawa clan of the former Iwakuni Prefecture. He received a good family education from an early age, was honest, robust, and possessed the spirit of an ancient warrior. He was intelligent, loyal, filial, and had a bright and cheerful demeanor, and was loved by all. He always stepped forward in times of trouble. Since entering the Navy more than 20 years ago, he has always served in the Yongshen combat unit and on destroyers, seeking to break the Washington Conference's Five. It is truly the existence of God. (Translated by Xiang from the May 2nd Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### The City Celebrates the 39th Japanese Navy Day With Grandeur - Five Days of Grand Programs

This month's 27th marks the 39th Japanese Navy Day. As the decisive battle stage approaches, looking back at past victories is particularly significant. To celebrate this historic commemorative occasion, Chinese and Japanese groups in this city have decided to hold various grand programs on the commemorative day and the five days around it. The details of the implementation were finalized on the 17th. The commemorative programs this time will focus on strength and simplicity. In terms of film, in addition to "The Battle of Hawaii and Malaya" and "Records of Victory of the Imperial Navy," there will also be a film of the sinking of an enemy transport ship taken by a special correspondent of the Japan Film Corporation while serving in the Indian Ocean on an Imperial submarine, which will also be shown publicly, entitled "Sinking." In addition, the Navy Art Popularization Association will hold the "Greater East Asia War Navy Art Exhibition" in the Continental Gallery of the Continental News. The Shen Bao and Continental News will jointly hold the "Chinese Ancient Liao Exhibition" at the Cathay Hotel. The detailed programs are summarized as follows:

### Lighting Control Measures Improved - Efforts to Prevent Light Leakage - Civil Defense Corps Implement Air Defense Training

Since the implementation of permanent lighting control in this city on March 3rd, the results have been good. The Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, in order to allow citizens to handle their usual affairs normally, and also because it is now summer, when windows should be hung with air-raid blackouts, causing discomfort and heat, have re-amended the lighting control measures, which were officially announced yesterday (17th). However, the public must still pay attention at all times to prevent light leakage. In addition, the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to strengthen and perfect the special defense corps of major buildings and factories, so as to cope with emergencies, is paying special attention to intensifying air defense training for the members of each special defense corps. Since the 9th of this month, major buildings and factories have been ordered to automatically carry out various exercises of air defense measures at any time and send personnel to guide them in order to become proficient, and to seek to achieve contact and complement each other, so as to make the city's air defense organization perfect.

Air Defense Song Has Been Set to Music and Recorded

The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters of the Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to awaken the air defense awareness of all citizens of the city, and to promote the determination of 5 million citizens to actively defend Shanghai, previously requested the assistance of this newspaper to solicit air defense songs from the citizens of the city. Now that the solicitation has been in progress for a considerable period of time, a total of 111 lyrics have been received, many of which are excellent. Liang Xiuyu, Chen Binhe, and Sun Lifu were invited to serve as review committee members to evaluate and adopt them. As a result, Jin Yugu's work was considered the best (the lyrics and ranking have been published in this newspaper) and was selected as the air defense song, and the renowned composer Liang Leyin was invited to compose the music. Thanks to Mr. Liang's efforts, he came up with a wonderful tune. The Air Defense Headquarters will soon hold a music society to play the selected song. In addition to being included in the air defense film currently being produced by the China Film Company, it is also planned to record it on a record and use radio broadcasting to promote it, so that the selected masterpieces are popularized throughout the city, in order to awaken the citizens of Shanghai, who are living in a decisive battle under the permanent battlefield, to the awareness of air defense, and to consolidate their determination to win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of the public will provide assistance.

### Section of Huangpu Bund Road Closed to Traffic

Public Announcement by the First District Office: Upon investigation, the section of Huangpu Bund Road between No. 3 Shuijiao Society and No. 9 French Steamship Company Building on South Huangpu Bund Road, and the section east of No. 9 China Jianyedi Real Estate Company Building on Great Shanghai Road, is closed to all pedestrians and vehicles.

### Report on Donations to Subsidize Teachers and Staff

Mr. Xu Chu and Mr. Wu Jiyun each donated 12,000 yuan. Mr. Liu Jingji, Mr. Xu Busun, and Mr. Wang Boyuan each donated 6,000 yuan. Huang Yuzhai, Wang Haibo, Zhusen Sheng, Tang Zhiliang, Liu Nianyi, Ding Houqing, Wang Xuenong, Pan Zhijie, and Lin Chaoping each donated 2,000 yuan. Mr. Wu Guiru donated 1,000 yuan.

The above totals 61,000 yuan, bringing the total collected to 828,000 yuan.

### The Necessity of a Central Advisory Body - Opinions on the Municipal Advisory Committee

The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee has decided to establish five subcommittees on daily necessities, public order, finance, education, and rural areas to jointly promote Shanghai's municipal administration, as reported in the previous newspaper. The clarification of its nature and function was eagerly awaited by the general public at the beginning of its establishment. Insiders and outsiders alike have argued that "the use of advisory forms of public opinion activity for Shanghai's municipal administration will ultimately not break the severe earthquake situation in Shanghai. We should re-establish a public opinion organ that is adapted to Shanghai's reality and can gather the total power of the general population." Therefore, the future direction of the Advisory Committee's activities is worthy of attention. Regarding this reform theory, some people also advocate that a public opinion organ for the central government should be established, which is different from the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Organ. Here is a summary of the criticisms of the Advisory Committee from all sides, summarized as follows:

1. Regarding the general political and economic situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government, which is a local government, what position did it occupy in the past, and what position will it occupy in the future? This is the most important issue to be strictly examined at this time. Because of the importance of Shanghai's political, economic, and cultural status, Shanghai's politics should be determined by a strong central government, rather than being controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Government.

For example, there is the Commodity Control Commission directly under the Executive Yuan for commodity control, the Rice Control Commission directly under the Executive Yuan for rice control, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank for the financial sector, and the Ministry of Industry for the business sector, each of which is responsible for its political responsibilities. Central politics has a very large direct impact on Shanghai.

Therefore, if we truly want to rebuild Shanghai, instead of setting up an advisory body for the municipal government, it is better to set up an advisory body for the central government first. Otherwise, the nature of this organ is somewhat incomplete.

2. At a symposium held on the 12th to invite Chinese and Japanese press corps, Standing Committee member Chen Binci immediately stated on behalf of the Standing Committee: "The activities of the Subcommittee on Daily Necessities are the most important among the five subcommittees." To revive Shanghai's economy, five points must be reformed immediately:

A. Adopting control methods suitable for China's national conditions and public sentiment,

B. Simplifying controls

C. Eliminating corruption and profiteering,

D. Full cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities,

E. Active cooperation of the public with the authorities,

These five points are almost all central issues that the Shanghai Municipal Government cannot solve.

It is heard that the Advisory Committee is working hard to solve the rice and fuel problem. On the rice issue, the Shanghai Municipal Government only handles the allocation of food rice assigned by the Rice Control Commission.

However, if Shanghai's rice problem is not solved first, the purchase problem in various parts of the country cannot be solved at all. The Rice Control Commission is an organ directly under the Executive Yuan, and the rice problem is a national problem. Therefore, the inquiry on this issue should, of course, be directly to the central government. Control should be simplified, and inquiries should also be simplified. Intermediate indirect negotiations through the municipal government only make things more complicated. The fuel issue is even more so. The decision on the coal problem rests entirely on the central government's political policies, and the municipal government can only submit hopes to the central government.

3. Most of the 25 advisory committee members participate in three or four subcommittees. This greatly hinders their concentration of responsibility and effort on one issue. In addition, the Education Committee includes current university presidents such as Zhao Zhengping and Shen Siliang, but Zhu Boquan, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, and others, or financial figures who were teachers in the past, have also joined the committee as financial figures who have become current school "wives." However, in a committee like the Education Committee, incumbent educators should account for an absolute majority, so the real representatives of teachers from large, medium, and small schools in this city should participate as committee members. Simply using celebrities as committee members makes some intellectuals criticize the Advisory Committee as "fishing for fame and reputation." At the beginning of its establishment, the Advisory Committee should thoroughly conduct self-criticism. (Translated by Xiang: from the May 16th Continental News)

### Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Other Places: New Cocoons to be Evaluated Within the Month; Evaluation Price Up to 6,000 Yuan Per Dan

This year, the spring cocoons in the Jiangzhe provinces production areas are about to enter the market. The Ministry of Industry has held a cocoon price evaluation meeting a few days ago and decided on the purchase price: 6,000 yuan for dry cocoons that can be reeled into 380 jin of silk. Other prices will be determined based on this standard price. It is learned that various silk factories have sent personnel to various production areas to purchase cocoons. It is heard that new cocoons in the Hangzhou area will enter the market for evaluation on the 19th of this month, Jiaxing area will start evaluation on the 23rd, Suzhou will start weighing on the 26th or 27th, and Wuxi will also start weighing in early next month.

(Another News) The cocoon purchasing loan syndicate organized by 15 banks in this city has provided cocoon purchasing loans. It has signed a 50 million yuan loan contract with various silk factories in this city and has already started using it. Now, the cocoon purchasing funds of various silk factories are still insufficient. Therefore, on the 15th (previous day), another 20 million yuan cocoon purchasing loan was established. The interest rate and loan method are still the same as before.

### Henan Operations Advance Rapidly, Chongqing Suffers Serious Blow; Spokesperson of Japanese Army Reporting Department Speaks

The reporting department of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai held a routine press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 17th) at the Hu Hotel on the Bund outside Nanjing Road. Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi of the reporting department attended. The spokesperson of the reporting department gave a detailed account of the success of the Henan operation and the operation in Imphal, India. The details are as follows:

The Fall of Luoyang is Imminent

The success of the Henan operation shows that the Japanese army is advancing rapidly, exceeding the planned time. It not only panicked the Chongqing side, but also frightened the British and Americans. After the Japanese army in North China crossed the Yellow River and began to attack, it took only about three weeks, and the Japanese army in Central China also began to act in Xinyang to launch a joint attack. In just nine days, the Japanese army in Central and North China joined forces in Queshan, thus opening up the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the progress this time was surprisingly rapid, far beyond the expectations of the Chongqing spokesperson. The spokesperson then added: From a military point of view, opening up the Pinghan Railway is the completion of the first stage of the Henan operation. The Chongqing army, which retreated from the front line of the defensive position on the Yellow River, obtained reinforcements from Tang Enbo's army in Mixian and Yuxian and still tried to struggle to launch a counterattack. However, this counterattack was only a desperate act, which made the Japanese army's annihilation operation more favorable. We can understand this by observing the war results announced by the Japanese headquarters. He then mentioned that the main position of the Chongqing army in the second line of defense, the Funiu Mountain, was heavily surrounded by the Japanese detachment on the left wing and is being annihilated in various places. On the other hand, the Chongqing army led by Jiang Dingwen near Luoyang was also surrounded and annihilated by the Japanese army attacking Sishui and Mixian. Therefore, the fall of Luoyang is imminent.

Chongqing Severely Threatened

Luoyang is the strategic city of Chongqing and an important military and political stronghold for Chongqing's "resistance." The first goal of the Henan operation is to eliminate the entire combat strength of Chongqing's first line. As for opening up the Pinghan Railway, it is only a byproduct of this operation. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, suffered a terrible defeat this time and is still trying to reorganize his remnants to reverse the decline. Tang Enbo's main force, about a dozen divisions, is currently in a state of chaos. Even when Jiang Dingwen received Chiang Kai-shek's strict order to defend Luoyang, Luoyang was in a state where it could not be defended. He was forced to abandon the strategy of defending Luoyang. Jiang himself fled first, hoping to prepare for efforts on the third line of defense. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing army's low quality and loss of morale in this operation are even more obvious. Therefore, the Japanese army has not only achieved military victory, but also has significant meaning in other respects. The Japanese army has captured a lot of war trophies and prisoners, especially those who come to surrender. The Chongqing army in the Henan operation was mostly Tang Enbo's most elite troops, which he himself admitted, but this defeat is a serious threat to Chongqing. In other war zones, the Chongqing army is divided and the command is not unified. They mainly focus on defending their own positions and will never provide assistance when friendly forces are in danger. Finally, the spokesperson said: Currently, some people in Chongqing advocate abandoning the encirclement operation of Hu Zongnan's army, which is encircling the Communist army, in order to quickly rescue the crisis in Henan. The incompetence of the Chongqing military generals is likely to cause the British and Americans to re-examine the possibility of providing assistance and utilizing the Chongqing regime in the future. On the other hand, it has also caused endless disputes between internal peace advocates and "resistance" factions, which will benefit peace from now on. Opening up the Pinghan Railway this time will not only make the logistics in North and Central China smoother but also stabilize the political situation and ensure public security, which is an undeniable fact.

Imphal Under Encirclement

The spokesperson then announced the status of the operation in Imphal, saying that the Japanese army has encircled the enemy British and Indian Fourth Army there and is launching a fierce attack to completely destroy them. The Japanese army's offensive has completely cut off the enemy's land supply route and changed from a plane war to a three-dimensional war. Although the enemy is trying to supply by air, the enemy's forces surrounded by the Japanese army amount to about 60,000 people, so even if the enemy provides supplies by air, it will be of no avail. The enemy's only reliable mechanized unit is now out of gasoline and cannot move. Tanks are abandoned on the road every day. From April 5 to May 5, the Japanese army shot down as many as 98 enemy transport planes.

Attempted Crossing of the Nu River Has Been Defeated

The attempted crossing of the Nu River by Yunnan forces on the 12th of this month was defeated by the Japanese army, shattering their attempt. On April 27, the Yunnan-Chongqing expeditionary force also attempted to cross the river, but was immediately wiped out by the Japanese army. This time, they attempted to revive the ashes, but the Japanese army swept them away and is now attacking the fleeing remnants. Regarding the Yunnan expeditionary force's attempt, it was due to the fact that the American and Chongqing forces under Stilwell in northern Burma and the British and Indian forces in India did not cooperate and showed no support, which was criticized internally and externally. This time, the attempt to cross the Nu River was regarded as the last joint operation of the allied forces. The spokesperson also said that the residents of Zhengzhou and other places occupied by the Japanese army are living in peace and are deeply grateful for peace. They are maintaining local public security and striving for construction, which is progressing rapidly. Finally, he praised the unique characteristics of the Japanese army before and after this operation, saying that they have strict discipline, are friendly to the people, and are friendly and kind, so the people are at ease and never disturbed.

### Reader's Aid to Education News

The Vocational Guidance Lecture Scholarship Office and the Social Service Office jointly organized the Vocational Guidance Lecture, which was held from 8:00 AM on the 14th. More than 500 graduating students from various schools attended, including 30% from universities and 70% from high schools, and 50% of the students receiving scholarships.

In the past month, 70-80% have been returned, but there are still a few schools that have not yet returned them. This form is important because this office will use this form as a guideline when handling scholarship work next year. Therefore, it is hoped that the schools that have not yet filled it out will not delay any longer. In addition, there are many primary schools in this city, and a large number were missed last time. Those who have not received the form can ask for it in person or enclose a self-addressed envelope with sufficient postage stamps and clearly written school address, and it will be sent immediately.

Master Fouzhai Continues to Donate Scholarships to Three Schools: The three private primary schools in this city, Fuchun, Xicheng, and Wuben, have received charitable scholarships from Master Fouzhai for three terms. This semester, the schools have received another 20,000 yuan each, which was received in full a few days ago. Master Fouzhai is enthusiastic about education and loves to cultivate talents.

### New Automobile Permits; Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau Speaks

Director Ye Xuesong of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau spoke to reporters yesterday on the issue of automobile restrictions in this city, saying: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this bureau has formulated measures to restrict the use of automobiles in order to save materials, and has strictly cracked down on those who do not need to use them. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. However, recently, people who do not understand the restrictions have been applying for permits, which has caused many complications. It should be known that as the decisive stage of the war approaches, the saving of materials is even more urgent than before. Therefore, in the future, the issuance of new automobile permits will be temporarily suspended."

### Second Police Bureau Thoroughly Investigates: Two Gambling Dens Reopen

After the six major gambling dens in the Nanshi area were ordered to close, there were rumors of attempts to revive them, but no such thing had been implemented. However, recently, rumors have resurfaced that the gambling dens run by Huamin and Lüshi have secretly reopened. Every day from 10:00 PM to the next morning, gamblers are allowed to enter the den to gamble. After receiving the report, the Second Police Bureau of the city believed that since it had been explicitly banned, how could it be allowed to reopen? This is a violation of government orders, so it immediately ordered the local branch to thoroughly investigate and report.

### Cold Storage Warehouses: Stop Accepting Customer Goods

The Cold Storage and Ice Making Industry Association of this city, in order to save electricity for cold storage members, and in accordance with the order that all cold storage locations must be used to supply ice to fish transport vehicles, the industry has decided that customer goods will not be accepted for storage from today.

### Strengthening the Organization of Trade Associations

— Shui Zhaoxiong

It has been a year since the reorganization and establishment of trade associations. There is much to be said about the quality of their achievements and the speed of their progress.

The trade association itself has no independent work. All the tedious tasks are busy with undertaking and relaying, so some people laugh that the association is a trust with a small capital and a large scope. Although undertaking and relaying is necessary; how to enrich yourself, how to maintain independence, is an urgent task; this is the step that should be taken from temporary to permanent. For example, running a school for children of the same industry, running a technical school for the same industry; establishing an obligation treatment center for the same industry, supplementing the moral and intellectual cultivation of the same industry with a regularly published publication and academic lectures; holding various military entertainment and various sports trips at any time to improve the noble interests of the same industry and increase physical education. Establishing cooperative societies or cooperative banks for the welfare of employees in the same industry, etc.

At present, the trade association and its members are under the heavy supervision of Shu Zhong, and it is said that they have to do the public affairs of undertaking and relaying, and they have the suffering of being disagreeable on all sides. For example: those belonging to the municipal government have the Economic Bureau; those belonging to the First District Office have the Economic Department; those belonging to the First Police Bureau have the Economic Section. Recently, an Economic Security Department has been created. In terms of commercial political organizations with the same nature, there are the Commercial Coordination Association and its affiliated associations, etc. In addition to this port, there are also the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Construction, the National Economic Commission, and the tax authorities of the Ministry of Finance, which can directly instruct and instruct. To be more intimate and sincere, the trade association has so many superiors who take care of it. However, there are also the sufferings of being unable to pay due to the multiplicity of institutions and the lack of political orders. Therefore, I believe that in the future, the industrial and commercial management institutions must be adjusted and unified by the authorities as soon as possible, reducing the complexity of the stacked racks, and making the organization systematic and simplified, then the efficiency of the trade association can be improved, and the county merchants will also be blessed.

At present, the directors and supervisors of various trade associations are indeed qualified and learned, but there are also many who fill the ranks with incompetence and use wealth as a cover. Secondly, many of the employees of the association are indeed learned, experienced, and capable, but there are also many who are empty, outdated, and incompetent. I believe that if we want to strengthen economic control, we must strengthen the personnel of trade associations. On the one hand, we should strictly stipulate the minimum qualifications of the candidates for directors and supervisors, and secondly, we should increase the responsibility of each director and supervisor so that those who are elected are not honorary positions of ease, but must make actual achievements. As for the employment of association employees, it is best to incorporate examinations into the employment process, so that we can get real talents.

Letter to My Sister (1)

### 

— Translated by Iwata Hiroshi

Several days have passed since I was told by Mr. Tsuruhara at the yakitori restaurant in Koenji: "Well then, you are a nerve teacher - a pure scripture weakness."

Mr. decided to ask the minister for a week off. The reason was just for rest.

In fact, Mr.'s worrying behavior had already been noticed, so no one was surprised by his request for leave.

"Young people from the countryside will always be like this once. This is the soil and water disease of Gyeonggi. Well then, take a good rest!"

After saying this, the minister gave a small amount of travel expenses. One of his colleagues said:

"Where are you going to rest?"

"Not sure yet."

"Really freehand! Then I'll tell you a good place. A place near the house that doesn't cost money and is suitable for rest is the coast."

After saying this, he wrote down the car to take on the way and a letter of introduction to the inn and handed it to Mr..

Mr. didn't care about the sea or the mountains, as long as it was quiet and cheap, any place would do. So without much thought, he decided to go to the coast called Kurihama.

The next morning, he took a fire train from Koenji to Shinagawa, and then took the Shonan train to Uraga. The setting sun in autumn radiated faint light from the large glass window. While taking a peek at the newspaper being read by the person next to him, the big topic of the first air raid on Yunnan was printed on it in special characters.

(It's still good to take a break...,) Mr. thought as he sat in the train car. This trip had no taste of travel, but it had more sense than accompanying Mr. Ichirai to go to Kyushu for a sketching trip.

At this time, the scenery outside was land and land - people with no edge in sight. After passing Yokohama, it was an endless plain. In the distance, the blue sea was sparkling.

(That's Tokyo, huh, this is completely like a river east

He had always despised Tokyo Bay, which didn't look like the sea. So he recalled the wide sea and high mountains of his hometown, and felt endless sadness. Therefore, the constant homesickness emerged in his heart.

(When I was in a completely helpless situation, I once agreed to write a letter to my sister. Now is the time to write a letter.)

He was exhausted and felt that everything was tasteless. So he thought that the only way to fire back to Kagoshima, beg his parents for forgiveness, and apologize to his relatives and friends, there was no other way.

Unconsciously, the scenery outside the window changed. The short mountains gradually approached his eyes. The road was very winding. Suddenly, unexpectedly, a scene appeared in his eyes.

Social Service

### Mr. Shan Yunhui's Father Donates 150,000 Yuan for Public Welfare, Which is Admirable

Mr. Shan Yunhui wrote a letter yesterday saying: "My father received 150,000 yuan of medical loss expenses from Mr. Xian Shi Rong and his brother Deqi. My father did not want to accept it, and donated all the money to charity. I am sending a check here and hope you will accept it. In addition to donating 20,000 yuan to your organization's midwifery fund in response, the remaining funds will be used by your organization for distribution to various charitable organizations to serve as education funds. I hope you will be satisfied."

Mr. Hui Guang is currently the manager of Dahongyun Restaurant, Hongqing Restaurant, Daqingguan, Hushan Soap Factory, China Flying Fast Transportation Company, and the executive director of the Shanghai Municipal Restaurant Industry Association. In addition to devoting himself to his own duties, he is also devoted to social welfare and relief for the poor and sick. Mr. Jianbin, his father, is a senior in the restaurant industry, with a benevolent and charitable heart. He is always ready to help friends and relatives in need. He is a model of public service. Now, he has donated the loss expenses given by friends to charitable organizations, and his enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable." In addition to complying with the request, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the poor people who will benefit. The list of donations is recorded below. It is hoped that each group will issue an official receipt as soon as possible after seeing the report in the newspaper and collect it from this office to meet Mr. Shan's expectations. The details are as follows: 20,000 yuan for the poor women's midwifery fund, 10,000 yuan each for the Chinese Religious Ethical Conference, Wuyi Mountain Villa, Poor Children's Craft Institute, Children's Welfare Association, Nursing Home, and Sacred Mother Church. 5,000 yuan each for Small Loans and Medical Aid Funds. 3,000 yuan each for the Jianlun Library, the People's Women's Hospital, the Red Swastika Society Congee Yard, the Nanshi People's Hospital, the Bo'ai Hospital, the Andang Hospital, the People's Obstetrics Hospital, the Shanghai Health Association, and the Zhenxin Epidemic Prevention Institute, Tongren Fuyuan Hall. 2,000 yuan each for Fuyou Institute, the Christian Orphanage, the Qiying Association, the Nursing Industrial Children's Institute, the Disaster Children's Shelter, the Ren Shan Nursing Institute, the Renji Nursing Hall, Tushan Bay, Bosgao, Emmanuel, Bethel, Bethany, and foreign orphanages such as Yangjingbang, and the Yigong of the Women's Christian Association, and the Nüguang Welfare Agency.

### Chinese Science Society: Lecture Training Course

The Chinese Science Society believes that in order to cultivate righteous patriots, we must start with the study of basic science, and mathematics is especially important. It has long had the ambition to open a lecture course. Fortunately, Mr. Zu Heng, the administrator of Hengtong Yarn Factory and Zhenxing Woolen Factory, undertook the scientific lecture and publication expenses. Therefore, it has gathered many mathematics experts among the society friends in Shanghai, and has established a mathematics training course at the Shanghai Society located at 523 Xianyang (Yalta) Road, inviting students above the second grade of university and those with equivalent academic ability to register for lectures. Registration will be open from the 1st to the 20th of each month, and lectures will begin at the end of the month. Articles of Association are available and will be mailed upon request.
