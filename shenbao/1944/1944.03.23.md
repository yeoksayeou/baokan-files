### Supporting the Police Cooperative

Our editorial on March 1st, "Improving Police Treatment," discussed that the responsibilities of the police are extremely significant, while their current treatment is quite meager. Assigning the responsibility of maintaining public order while struggling with a sustenance-level income is indeed a difficult matter. We have stated that the police's responsibility is to maintain public order, investigate and eliminate corrupt elements within the police force, uphold social ethics, and serve as both teachers and protectors of the people. Furthermore, maintaining public order and investigating corrupt police require not only the courage to risk one's life but also the adaptability to respond to changing situations. Upholding social ethics and serving as teachers and protectors of the people require not only a high moral character of leading by example but also a wealth of knowledge for guidance and judgment. Therefore, from the perspective of the police's responsibilities, the objective requirements for their ability and quality should be very high and strict. Let us use these expected responsibilities of the police as a basis to examine whether the current treatment matches the responsibilities and whether it is reasonable. According to the report by Deputy Bureau Chief Su at the reception for all sectors held by the First Police Bureau of this city on the 16th regarding the establishment of a consumer cooperative, "The current salary of the police is 1,200 yuan per person per month, which, compared to the current cost of living, is truly appalling. Under such circumstances, the lives of the police officers are naturally austere. On the one hand, the government's funds are limited, making it impossible to meet actual living expenses. Even maintaining personal meals is challenging. However, everyone has family members. If we estimate that for 10,000 police officers, there are 60,000 family members, then each police officer must support the lives of six family members. It is naturally impossible to support the lives of six family members with a monthly salary that is insufficient to maintain personal life. However, no one is simply waiting for death. In short, when income is less than expenditure, attempting to increase income to supplement it is a universal demand. The only difference lies in the methods of attempting to supplement it. While there are distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate methods, there is no difference in how it affects service efficiency and the ability to fulfill the responsibility of maintaining public order."

Based on the above discussion, we believe that the responsibilities of the police are extremely disproportionate to their current treatment. Furthermore, it can be said that if the treatment of the police is not adjusted and their living conditions are not improved, there is no point in talking about serving the citizens or shouldering the responsibility of maintaining public order. Therefore, in our editorial "Improving Police Treatment," we advocate that the authorities should promptly determine police funding and improve the treatment of the police so that every police officer and their families can obtain a minimum standard of living, have no worries about the future, and serve with loyalty and diligence.

Now, the First Police Bureau of this city is organizing a consumer cooperative to purchase daily necessities and distribute them to the police at affordable prices, thereby reducing the burden of daily consumption. Providing daily necessities at affordable prices is certainly one of the main ways to improve the lives of the police. Directly improving the lives of the police indirectly strengthens the power to maintain public order. From this perspective, we believe that all citizens have an obligation to assist in the establishment of the police consumer cooperative. According to the news reported in today's newspaper, the cooperative is actively preparing, first raising a capital of 40 million yuan. The city's Banking Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the Citizens Welfare Association are invited to separately raise funds. At the same time, the Central Trust of China and the China Development Bank have agreed to provide large loans to show their support. It is deeply believed that among those who are enthusiastic about municipal public welfare and have the financial resources, there must be many who hold the foresight that maintaining public order is maintaining their own businesses. We sincerely hope that they will enthusiastically provide loans so that the cooperative can be established as soon as possible, the lives of the police can be improved as soon as possible, and the power to maintain public order can be strengthened as soon as possible.

Finally, we should further recognize that the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Shanghai is an important rear base and a vital wartime city. Maintaining public order and fulfilling the wartime participation duty of the rear base is of utmost importance. Therefore, improving the lives of the police is even more urgent.

### The National Army Returns Land to the Indian Government for Management. Prime Minister Tojo Clarifies His Determination to Assist India.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The coordinated preemptive strikes by the Japanese and Indian armies have commenced operations on the Burma-India border. The two armies are closely coordinating, routing British forces everywhere. These operations have now entered the second phase of advancing into India. Prime Minister Tojo recently issued a statement clarifying that all regions within India retaken by the Indian National Army should be placed under the administrative control of the Provisional Government of India. The gist of his statement is as follows: The Indian National Army, under the command of Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose, has, with the cooperation of the Imperial Army, begun the long-awaited advance into their homeland. Only half a year after the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, it has been able to carry out a bold offensive, which is truly cause for celebration. The 400 million people of India, groaning under years of British tyranny, will undoubtedly be overjoyed upon hearing this news. The Empire's purpose remains to crush the enemy's forces and completely hand over India to the Indian people. All land retaken by the National Army in India should be placed completely under the administrative control of the Provisional Government of Free India. The advance of the National Army has filled the Indian people with a passion for their homeland. We expect that the rapid expansion of the liberated areas will lead to the completion of Indian independence. Independence is the consensus of Asia and the demand of world justice. Anyone who is aware of India's plight and seeks to obstruct its liberation is a public enemy of justice. While there are still many obstacles to the liberation of India, I sincerely hope to cooperate with the Indian military and civilians to overcome all difficulties, so that the National Army can continue its advance all the way to the shores of victory. We will spare no effort to support the National Army. Hereby, I specifically declare the Empire's firm determination to the world.

### Japanese and Indian Armies Cross Two Rivers and Advance into India

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After crossing the Chindwin and Manipur rivers, the Japanese-Indian allied forces broke through the Burma-India border and advanced into India. According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters issued a war bulletin on the 22nd acknowledging the above facts, stating that the Japanese-Indian allied forces, which launched an offensive along the Chindwin River, are continuously attacking in the mountainous areas and have broken through the border at one or two points, entering Manipur.

### The Collapse of the Enemy at Tiddim-Tongzang

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the front lines of Burma, the enemy forces at Tiddim-Tongzang on the Burmese border have finally collapsed completely. The details are as follows: The main force of the British 17th Division near Tiddim attempted to escape but encountered strong resistance at the Paiz strategic point, 25 kilometers east of Tongzang, and the Algae heights to its west, where they deployed dozens of 18-caliber artillery pieces. Since the 14th, they were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated from the Paiz strategic point at 10:00 AM. The strategic point was then taken over by the Japanese army. Since the 19th, seeing the situation was unfavorable, they retreated westward from the enemy on the right bank of the Kaphi River northwest of Tongzang on the Manipur River, as the Tongzang self-defense forces had collapsed and the rear was empty. However, they were wiped out by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is expanding its gains on the right of the Kaphi River. The enemy forces at Tiddim-Tongzang were also severely struck by the Japanese army on the banks of the Manipur River, resulting in the tragedy of the Chin Hills.

### Capture of a Strategic Point, Attempt Frustrated

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front lines, Tongzang, the British-Indian army's base for a counterattack on Burma in the Chin Hills area, finally fell on the 20th due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian army. The area is about 40 kilometers from the Chin Hills-Burma border and is a military stronghold. Now that it is occupied by the Japanese-Indian army, the enemy army has no foothold. The counterattack attempt was greatly frustrated, and Burma's defense situation has become stronger. The fall of the area not only annihilated the enemy's 17th Division, inflicting a major blow on the enemy militarily and politically, but also had a profound impact on India and the occupied territories. The area is a supply base in the Chin Hills area, with large-scale material warehouses, responsible for supplying the front lines in Tiddim, Minbya, and other areas, and is the source of activity in the Chin Hills area. Once lost, a general counterattack on Burma cannot be launched from the Chin Hills area. Therefore, when the Chongqing side heard of the fall of the area, they were extremely frustrated and even more dissatisfied with Britain and the United States. Before the war, there were only 300 households in the area, with about 800 Chin people. Since the British-Indian army was stationed there, the population has soared to 10,000. Its chief, Shawza, discovered that he was 48 years old, talented and knowledgeable, and famous. Due to being oppressed by the British government and having his authority reduced daily, he received a salary of 2,000 rupees from the British government and had long been a righteous man and the only anti-British figure in the area.

Bose Issues Statement Making Five Demands, Urging Indians to Rise Up and Fight for Independence

Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India issued a statement on the 21st urging the Indian people fighting for the independence of their homeland to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and put forward five demands to their compatriots and their leaders: 　Indian people should provide full assistance, directly or indirectly, to the Japanese-Indian allied forces. 　All Indian people should strive to promote the Indian war of independence. 　The Indian people in the country should carry out organized sabotage in order to prevent the British and Americans from completing the war process, so that the war we are promoting for freedom can be completed as soon as possible. 　The Indian army should refuse to join the war launched for Britain, and instead join the ranks of the Japanese-Indian allied forces. 　Indians working for the British government should assist the Free India government in completing this sacred operation. The declaration finally advised their compatriots to avoid airfields, barracks, munitions factories, harbors, and military facilities of the British and American forces.

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India, in the name of the Chairman of the Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army

### Supreme Command

issued the following statement from the Provisional Government of Free India: The Indian National Army, led by the Provisional Government of Free India, with the close cooperation of the Japanese Army, has begun a sacred mission. Since the failure of the Indian army in its battle with the British invaders in 1857, the Indian people have finally surrendered to Britain in spirit. Although the Indian people have suffered inhuman oppression from Britain and have been deprived of weapons, the Indian people have continued to resist British rule by using propaganda, agitation, or military action, strikes, or armed revolution. Recently, Gandhi launched a non-violent disobedience movement to engage in the struggle for independence, and since

### This War

broke out, Britain, in order to carry out its imperialist war, has caused the Indian people to be unable to bear their lives and have fallen into an unprecedented famine. Therefore, in order to save India from the flames of war, Gandhi requested the British government to recognize India's independence and withdraw its troops from India, but Britain has imprisoned Gandhi and tens of thousands of patriotic Indian people. This inhuman behavior is even more obvious. Three million Indians residing in East Asia have now established the Indian Independence League in the political sphere in order to liberate their homeland, and in the

### Military Sphere

they have organized the Indian National Army. After the Provisional Government of Free India was born on October 21, 1943, the Indian National Army was actively reorganized and completed, and on February 4, 1944, it began to raise the torch of the liberation of the homeland in the Arakan region of Burma. The Japanese government has repeatedly declared at home and abroad that Japan is not only fighting to defend Japan, but also to defeat British imperialism in East Asia. At the same time, Japan has also stated that it will unconditionally assist India's independence. Later, the Japanese government based its assistance on this policy. When the Provisional

### Provisional Government

of India was established, Japan immediately recognized it, and also decided to cede the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to India. Therefore, what is requested of patriotic Indian compatriots today is to strive to fight for India's independence. For all compatriots to actively carry out organized sabotage in the homeland to prevent Britain and the United States from completing the path of war, this is to promote the completion of our operation. Indian soldiers should refuse to fight for Britain and instead actively join our ranks. Indians subject to the British government should especially assist us in the sacred war we are promoting. Today is indeed

### Realizing Freedom

the best opportunity, and if you can perform your due tasks at this time, then the time for India to gain freedom will not be far away.

### Japanese Forces Complete Major Annihilation Battle on the Burma-India Border

By breaking through enemy lines in a swift advance, striking directly at their retreat route, and preventing large enemy units attempting a major southward retreat, the Kubo Assault Force played a decisive role. After a month of arduous fighting, they completed the annihilation battle of Sinzweya, fully demonstrating the true spirit of the Japanese army and earning the praise of units everywhere. On the 5th, this unit broke through enemy positions teeming with remaining enemy soldiers, returning to the front lines of the friendly forces covered in blood. Several hundred soldiers from the Indian National Army also participated in this attack, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the elite Japanese troops, establishing the glorious tradition of the National Army. The following is the battle record of the Kubo Assault Force:

### Order to Cut Off Enemy Retreat Route

On February 4th, the Kubo Assault Force and the Indian National Army Assault 〇〇 Force, which had crossed the Mayu River at Tong Bazar, received the following order: "Our Assault Force will rapidly advance to Nakyangan, cutting off the enemy's retreat route near Maungdaw and preventing the enemy from moving south to Palibazar. The Indian National Army will immediately advance to Nakyangan, taking responsibility for destroying bridges near the streets, and, along with the advance and retreat of the main force, will contain the enemy moving south."

The sound of engines seemed to be nearby and was clearly audible. In the square, there were five or six barrack-like gasoline roads, and smoke and dust billowed, indicating that automobiles were moving about. The target was to cut off that road. The unit commander pointed to each location below, giving detailed instructions for the night assault plan. At 9:00 PM, all units completed their alignment. Under the faint starlight, the Monawa River resembled a white ribbon. The National Army successfully destroyed the bridges, and the entire force launched an attack on the enemy positions. Under the relentless pursuit of the Japanese warriors, they fled in disarray, scattering in all directions.

Fifty or sixty automobiles were instantly set ablaze, their fires illuminating the area like daylight. The enemy was completely unprepared for this attack and fell into utter chaos. Concentrated artillery fire was directed at the burning area, destroying an estimated one hundred automobiles, thirty abandoned corpses, and capturing three soldiers.

### Enemy Counterattack

From the 6th, as a result of the Japanese army's surprise attack, the enemy began to mobilize both north and south, centering on Nakyangan. On the 7th, the Japanese army launched another surprise attack on Nakyangan, hoping to completely cut it off. That is, the National Army was able to launch a surprise attack on the 201 Heights, six kilometers north of the village, while the main force once again destroyed its bridges. Day and night, in order to reliably cut off the enemy's retreat route, the bridges south of the village were completely destroyed. On the afternoon of the 9th, several hundred enemy soldiers, led by four heavy tanks and covered by tank fire, suddenly launched a counterattack. This was expected by the Japanese army. The artillery fired simultaneously at the enemy automobiles, setting them on fire and immediately repelling the attack.

On the 10th, three hundred enemy soldiers, with four artillery pieces and two tanks, attacked in front of the position, but each time they were repelled. On the night of the 10th, a strong assault on the enemy positions resulted in ten abandoned corpses and the capture of a dozen vehicles. Mines were laid north of the Nakyangan village. By the 11th, the enemy had gradually increased its strength on the Japanese army's front. The Japanese army unit destroyed the bridges again that night. From the 12th, the enemy counterattack became more intense, using five or six artillery pieces and four mortars to attack the Japanese army's positions with bayonets. However, they were still repelled by the Japanese army, leaving behind one hundred and fifty corpses. Subsequently, at noon on the 14th, approximately one thousand enemy soldiers, with ten artillery pieces, attacked from three directions. The Japanese army did not retreat a single step, resolutely repelling the attack.

### Avoiding Enemy Pressure

On the 16th, under the crossfire of artillery from the north, south, and west, the Japanese army suffered increasing losses. They bypassed the flank and shifted their position toward the 　　, avoiding the pressure from the west. The enemy, unaware that the Japanese army unit had already shifted its position, concentrated intense artillery fire on the 　　. Under conditions of hardship and scarcity, the unit fought arduously for a month, finally securing this key point and completing its mission. On the 25th, they departed east of Nakyangan and embarked on their return journey. The journey was fraught with difficulties. On the evening of the 29th, they arrived at that location.

On the morning of the 1st, they departed from that location, and on the morning of the 5th, they returned to the front lines of the 〇 army.

During this period, due to unfamiliar terrain and frequent encounters with the enemy, the military horses were exhausted. Artillery and other supplies had to be transported by manpower, advancing only 500 meters per day, but they finally overcame numerous difficulties, broke through enemy lines, and returned to base. The annihilation battle of Sinzweya was successful because of the efforts of this assault force. (　: Translated from the March 10th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Enemy Admits Operational Difficulties

A military inspection group composed of naval and air force officers from Britain, the United States, and Canada, headed by British Major General Gascoigne, had previously inspected the "Line." They recently arrived in India, having witnessed the defeat and inspected the Chinese army in the Hukawng Valley region of the northern border. They have now returned to London to present their final report to the Anti-Axis Chiefs of Staff. The group met with reporters on the 3rd, admitting the deep dilemma of the Burma front:

"The Burma front, from Arakan to Ledo, is more difficult in some respects than the Pacific. For example, in the South Pacific, the sea and air power of the Anti-Axis forces can threaten the Japanese army's long lines of communication, but in Burma, the Japanese army has good lines of communication everywhere. There is rice everywhere, and fish in every river. In contrast, the Anti-Axis forces have more difficult lines of communication than the Japanese army. As a result of inspecting this front, we are convinced that Japanese soldiers are almost superhuman."

Gascoigne added:

"Burma is by no means an easy area of operations, and is more difficult than the Pacific."

It can be seen that the enemy has also acknowledged the impregnable nature of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (翔: Translated from the March 7th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

Economic Commentary

### Re-discussing Economic Police

"If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Undoubtedly, economic police are theoretically a sharp tool for actively suppressing price gouging. Because hoarding materials and raising prices are both economic evils to be avoided during wartime. Because of their impact, the market is disrupted, and the people's livelihood is harmed, which is bound to lead to the worst and most disastrous consequences. Therefore, wartime Japan enforced the law strictly on all economic criminals without leniency. Thus, it was able to build its great achievements in controlled economy. Recently, the National Government's treatment of corrupt officials is enough to prove that only under "heavy punishment" can the declining trend be reversed, and only with strict law enforcement can the surge of all profiteering ideas and the rampant speculation be curbed.

The only task of the economic police is to thoroughly investigate and crack down on unscrupulous businesses engaging in speculation and hoarding and violating economic regulations at any time. However, whether this task can be executed depends on whether the economic police organization itself is sound. If an economic policeman is "impure himself but wants to correct others," it is better not to have economic police at all! We have also discussed economic police before, believing that broad knowledge and integrity are their most important conditions. If their knowledge is very shallow and their behavior is very despicable, then the establishment of economic police will not only be insufficient to protect the people but will also be sufficient to harm them!

Because the authorities have recently realized that the price issue is becoming more and more serious, they are studying the coordination and establishment of a new economic police organization, abolishing the various dispersed organizations that have existed in the past. Therefore, we are re-discussing economic police and placing our greatest expectations on them.

### A Review and Outlook on the Stock Industry

— Du Ganru

When the stock market began to develop last year, it was precisely at a time when various speculative markets were declining. Therefore, before long, it showed a vigorous and prosperous appearance. The former securities exchanges also emerged in response to the times and made a comeback. As a result, some cunning capitalists seized the opportunity to increase capital and solicit shares. They rose like a storm, and they followed suit. For a time, those who were blinded by greed were dizzy and eagerly opened their wallets, fearing falling behind.

At that time, the author witnessed the current situation, recalled the stock craze of various exchanges twenty years ago, and was angry and worried about it. After analyzing and considering the inside story of capital increase and share solicitation, I felt that doubts arose. It is true that the property value of companies and manufacturers has risen many times compared with before the war, and it is necessary to increase value and capital. However, the most important point to clarify is that the entire property of companies and manufacturers is the property of shareholders. Whether it is increased or not, it has already appreciated with prices. Increasing capital does not increase or decrease the interests of shareholders. Therefore, I believe that the capital increase by the company authorities is like the trick of a monkey trainer, changing in the morning and evening, deliberately making a mystery. As for the fact that shareholders still have to pay blood money for the capital increase, it is even more ingenious. The price of the stock also rises due to this stimulation, attracting ordinary blind speculators to participate in the way of increasing the stock and subscribing for shares, with the inferior atmosphere of investing in the morning and getting rich in the evening.

For example, at the end of last year, a newly created base company raised 100 million yuan of shares, and in no time, the subscription was empty. Within a month, the stock price had already risen by more than double the face value. I would like to ask where the company has not yet operated and where the profit comes from. On what basis does this double the price rise? Thinking about it this way, I feel that it is empty, dangerous, and unparalleled. As expected, once entering the new year, first the funds were tightened, and then new stocks were banned from being listed. This made those who were engaged in stock trading feel like cold water was poured on their heads, and their dreams were shattered. They scrambled to sell their stocks, and the market price plummeted, even falling within the face value, affecting society. The review is not insignificant, and the prospects are worrying.

So, will the stock industry collapse from this? This is not entirely true. Strict inspection is still necessary, and no leniency is allowed. Then the stock industry can last forever. Written by Haijun Iwata, translated by Hong Yang, November 8 (Tuesday), sunny.

### Diary of a Real Person (5)

— Written by Iwata, translated by Hong Yang

Yesterday, I hoped that the parents of the young people would come to the school. I was moved by their rigorous maturity. I invited them to visit the inverted son and the chief short boat.

After sending the Xiao and others away, there was a speech by General Takeshita. Lieutenant Colonel Guangzhong, who has become a war god, was also a figure who was forged during his student days, which is very touching.

November 12 (Saturday) Afternoon, sunny.

It is indeed a rare phenomenon for snow to fall in November. It is really cold to practice short rafting and aquatics. Buying snow can penetrate the skin like a knife, but when I think of our future life on the ship, I know that this is a normal state.

The general short boat started late and fell to eleventh place, which is a pity.

November 27 (Sunday) Sunny.

There is a classmate meeting. Due to the announcement of the instructor, I heard that Colonel Okashita and Captain Okashita were wounded in battle, and we could not be idle and self-advancing. We, who must step on the front line within a year, must work hard so as not to leave a bad name after death.

December 9 (Friday) Sunny.

Training in martial arts. Rouwei must also work harder. However, I must obtain the second dan before graduation. I want to be twice as powerful as others. This is something that Ping has realized.

December 19 (Sunday) Sunny.

During morning education, there was a lecture on the Japanese sword. I deeply feel that there is a soldier's heart on the Japanese sword.

The No. 4 rifle was rusted and was severely reprimanded. This kind of thing must never happen again in the future.

December 23 (Friday) Rain.

Because of yesterday's vaccination, my left wrist has been aching since morning. Thinking of the warriors on the front line who are still advancing despite their injuries, I can't hurt anymore. A military parade exercise will be held in two days. Although it has not rained on my skin, the wrist is painful with the cold rain. I must practice harder. No matter what, if I do it with responsibility, I will not feel difficult.

Sky and Sea (1)

After the end of this diary, another half year has passed. The real people are waiting for the pressure of the times, which makes them graduate early. Not only has the Chinese Incident passed three years, but the sound of cannons is also alarming in the sky above Nomonhan, and in Washington, a statement has also been issued on the termination of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. For students graduating from school at that time, it can be said to be a recent graduation ceremony.

Gu Changren's twenty-first summer—that small body, full skin, and twinkling eyes, and his attitude has also calmed down. Compared with when he entered school, it seems like two people. He is a light-trained saber, and he only needs to be wasted from now on.

(To step on the wide sea, boundless, the surging sea...)

This morning, when I put on that last student military uniform, I suddenly felt a sense of generosity and tragedy. Bidding farewell to the student festival that I was used to living in, and the excitement of stepping on the ocean, the emotions of joy and sorrow intertwined, and a tear floated on the edge of the limit.

### Economical Methods for Water Use in Student Equipment

Since this city restricted the consumption of water mines, it has not only become a serious problem for factories, but also makes it quite difficult to live at home. It is heard that some people have been fined for exceeding the water limit. If it is impossible to develop new sources, then we can only think about reducing expenses. If there are flush toilets at home, it is better not to flush the water in the tank, but to use used water instead of the water in the tank for flushing the toilet. The method is to simply collect the used water in a lead bucket or a wooden bucket in each household. When you want to flush the toilet, just pour the water into the toilet at once, but you must pour a bucket of water at a time, otherwise the pressure is not enough to take effect. This move is simple and easy to implement, and the waste water can also be used for fire fighting. Frugal people may want to try it. (Xi Huancheng)

### Rickshaws Should Be Painted White to Prevent Hitting Pedestrians
