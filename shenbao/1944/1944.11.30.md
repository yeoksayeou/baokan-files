### Record of an Interview with Minister Kusumoto

â€” Wu Gong

Mentioning Lieutenant General Jitsutaro Kusumoto, appointed as the Envoy of the Allied Nations stationed in Beijing, might not be unfamiliar to the average Shanghai resident. After the Incident, he once served as the head of the Shanghai Special Agency. Immediately after the establishment of the Asian Institute, he was reassigned as the Vice-Minister of the Central China Liaison Department of the Institute. Later, after the Allied forces landed in Mid-Western, he was also responsible for guiding the political revival of the Eastern Zhejiang region. Especially for the latter, he indeed established a good model of Sino-Japanese cooperation at that time, strictly cracking down on those ronin who wanted to take the opportunity to make a fortune. To this day, the people of Ningbo still remember it with gratitude. This time, the reporter was specially dispatched from this newspaper to the north, and it happened that he was hosting newspaper reporters in his capacity as the newly appointed minister. As a Shanghai resident, I certainly couldn't miss such an opportunity for a conversation.

Treating Chinese and Japanese Reporters Equally

Minister Kusumoto arrived in Peiping by plane on November 1st. In addition to meeting with important Chinese and Japanese figures from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM that afternoon, the first to be invited was the tea party for reporters from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM the next afternoon. This time, the invitation to newspaper reporters was limited to reporters only, regardless of nationality. Therefore, newspaper reporters from China, Japan, or other third countries could participate. This attitude of treating everyone equally had already made a good impression on the reporter. Secondly, ordinary gatherings are often scheduled for 4:30 PM, but you have to wait until at least 5:00 PM. However, today, Minister Kusumoto arrived at the meeting on time and showed a face full of spring breeze and a harmonious expression. I think the first reporter would not have a bad impression of him.

Returning to a Familiar Place After Twenty Years

After everyone was seated, Minister Kusumoto immediately opened his mouth and said, "Beijing is a place I visited twenty years ago. This time, I am taking office as Minister in the era of decisive battles and returning to my old homeland, I really feel like I have returned to my hometown." It turned out that Minister Kusumoto had served as an instructor at the Chinese Army University in Beijing twenty years ago, so he had a long-standing relationship with our country. In the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing, many of his outstanding students are in it. According to Minister Kusumoto, if he now has the opportunity to have a cordial conversation with his group of students in the anti-Japanese camp, perhaps they would not be so obsessed. At this critical moment of the decisive battle, Minister Kusumoto's coming to North China, the base of the decisive battle, is naturally of extremely important significance. But he was very polite. He only stated that he would continue to emphasize the work of increasing production and transportation in North China, just like former Minister Shiozawa. At the same time, he expressed his gratitude to the 100 million officials and people in North China for seeing the success of past efforts in increasing production and transportation during this visit to North China.

Working Together in Unity and Solidarity

Before leaving Tokyo this time, he had listened to the opinions of Prime Minister Koiso and had already made up his mind to clarify the situation in China. However, before starting this work, he hoped to hear the opinions of both the Chinese and Japanese sides on the ground. Therefore, he humbly hoped that they could provide him with assistance in this task. He said that only with a clear and strong spirit can North China carry out the mission of a decisive battle base. He hopes that the people of China and Japan should truly work together in unity and solidarity, especially asking the local Japanese residents to understand this intention well. Therefore, his so-called clarification means that the Chinese and Japanese people should be harmoniously and seamlessly integrated into one. He said, "People often refer to China and Japan as brotherly countries, but in fact, the term brotherly relationship is not enough. I think this brotherly relationship should be expressed from the perspective of the same discipline. For example, when completing a certain task together, if this task is a specialty of the Chinese, then the Chinese are the younger brothers. Conversely, if a certain job is a specialty of the Japanese, then the Chinese are naturally also the little weaknesses!" The author can easily understand that with such a minister of the Allied Nations taking office in Beijing, the future politics of North China are naturally very promising.

Wartime Economy is the Most Complex

After Minister Kusumoto finished speaking, he waited for questions from the reporters. Most of the initial questions were raised by reporters from Japan and Manchukuo. After Minister Kusumoto inquired again humbly, a Chinese reporter finally raised his hand and asked: "Minister Kusumoto must have met with Chairman Wang. I wonder if you could tell us about his talk?" Minister Kusumoto replied immediately: "Due to the urgent time, there was no time to talk much." As for the questions from Japanese and Manchukuo reporters, the most important was the wartime economic policy. Minister Kusumoto considered this issue to be extremely complex. Based on his past experience in Shanghai and Ningbo, it seems that sometimes policies that are suitable for the general public in China will cause problems for the Japanese residents.

When it was almost six o'clock, Minister Kusumoto invited the reporters to the drawing room for light refreshments of champagne. At that time, the reporter happened to have the opportunity to talk to the minister. The reporter spoke first: "When Your Excellency the Minister was the President of the Victoria College in Shanghai, the reporter happened to be a professor at the college, so we may have already met!" After Minister Kusumoto received the reporter's business card, he nodded and smiled and asked about the situation of the Shen Bao. The reporter said, "It is a great honor for Guoguang in North China to see Your Excellency the Minister come to the ancient capital. I would like to extend the greetings of President Chen on behalf of him." Then, the reporter raised a question to ask him: "In the past, Your Excellency's style in Shanghai and Ningbo seemed to be different. I wonder what kind of great ambitions you have for this visit to North China?" The minister smiled and said: "The people of Central China are, after all, very sensitive. When I got off the plane and took a brief tour of the ancient capital, I felt that it was no different from twenty years ago." Just as Minister Kusumoto was talking eloquently, someone suddenly interjected, so the question I asked was never answered in the end! Fortunately, Section Chief Chongfu reported that when the minister has free time, we can visit him at any time in the future.

Concerned About China's News Industry

At this time, Mr. Hideo Umino, a special correspondent from the Allied Yomiuri Shimbun, came over to chat with me when he heard that I was a Shen Bao reporter. He asked me, "Is President Chen coming to the north too?" I said, "No." He then continued, "I was very grateful for President Chen's help when I was in Shanghai last time! I am very grateful!" From this, we can see the importance attached to our country's news industry by the Allied tradesmen. Soon, the bell rang at six o'clock, and everyone returned home with great interest.

Editorial

### Exhibition of Achievements by Scholarship Students

Starting tomorrow (December 1st), we will hold an exhibition of achievements by students receiving the Shen Bao readers' scholarship at the Chinese YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. These are all the results of the blood and sweat of the readers, and these are all the hard work of the many scholarship students. This is just the first step of demonstrating their academic achievements. In the future, after graduating and serving the country and the nation in society, the second step, the third step, and even countless achievements will be shown to the people of the country, creating a new situation for the future Republic of China. It is like planting flowers. The readers are all the garden owners, and the scholarship students are all the seeds of good flowers. We are just a small gardener. However, in just four years, under the guidance, encouragement, and care of the garden owners, we have collected many seeds of famous and rare flowers. If these seeds were not cherished by the garden owners, they might have been abandoned in the barren sand long ago, or even the ability to grow would have been impossible. Of course, there would be no talk of flowering and bearing fruit. Now, these seeds are fortunate to have been charged with the responsibility of watering and cultivating by the readers for the past four years, and under the care and guidance of all sectors of society in Shanghai, we gardeners have used our full spirit to support them, paying attention to them, watching them slowly germinate and grow, and step by step embarking on the road of flowering and bearing fruit. The joy in our hearts is truly indescribable. At the same time, we dare to say that the joy in the hearts of the garden owners is several times greater than ours. We dare to say that this is not only the joy of the garden owners, but the joy of the entire Shanghai people and the entire Republic of China.

These students, although they may not be our children, may not be the children of our relatives and friends, but our care for them surpasses that for our own children, because they are the children of the whole society, the children of the whole of China, and the foundation of the next generation of the Republic of China. No one should harm them, and no one should neglect them. We must pay twelve points of attention to the students' physical health, character, and academic performance. If there is even a slight negligence, we will have committed the greatest crime against the entire society and the entire China. This is our creed. Based on this creed, we continue to work tirelessly. How much can we achieve? We hope that you will guide us, and we are willing to ask for the most sincere, most frank criticism and guidance.

Alas, these poor and outstanding young people! How lovely, these compatriots of the new Republic of China! How respectable, the enthusiastic readers of the Shen Bao! From a thought, a gesture of the readers, accumulating little by little, has enabled thousands of talented young people to continue to make progress. A small cause can lead to such a great result. This can be said to be a miracle in modern China, and it is also the main spirit that has enabled our Republic of China to stand independently for five thousand years. From a thought in the readers' hearts, it can arouse the sympathy of many people and awaken everyone's mutual assistance. This proves that human minds are interconnected and that human instincts are mutual assistance.

The scholarship program is just a small manifestation of "interconnection" and "mutual assistance." Although this manifestation has only been around for a few years, it has already achieved considerable results, but this is only a minimum result. Looking around society, how many out-of-school youths are still unable to enjoy the right to education. Quietly think about it, under such circumstances, how much effort do the thousands of students currently receiving assistance need to make to continue to make progress so as not to fall short? We must continue to work hard. We must permanently create causes, and we will naturally be able to bear fruit permanently.

Appendix: Mr. Dai Yoshida's "Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution?" in the Weekly Review on the 26th is the first section. There is still a sequel to be published.

### Launching a Rapid Offensive, Japanese Troops Occupy Nandan, Advancing Towards Guiyang Along the Highway

Guilin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a frontline Japanese military base in Guangxi, elite Japanese units are advancing forward. At 10:00 AM on the 28th, they occupied Southwest Nandan and Nandan Airport, capturing many Chongqing troops and seizing a number of locomotives, freight cars, and other military supplies. According to a frontline Japanese military base in Guangxi, after the rapid Japanese forces captured Nandan, the last stronghold in Guangxi, they continued to advance along the Southwest Highway and the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway towards Guiyang. A crowd of 50,000 Chongqing troops retreated in that direction, and the Japanese army continued to pursue. At noon on the 29th, they had advanced to a place eighteen kilometers north of Nandan, and were still continuing to launch a rapid offensive.

Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Battles in Guizhou Province

Frontline in Guizhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Chongqing troops in southern Guizhou are ordered to stop the Japanese army from advancing along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway and the highway front, and are putting up a desperate resistance.

The gist of it is introduced as follows: The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway starts from Liuzhou and ends at Dushan, with a total length of 394 kilometers, requiring 22 hours and 40 minutes. The railway equipment is very crude, so passengers feel very painful. Starting from Liuzhou, the road is full of uneven slopes. The cars often run on other railways. And, on average, one-third of them carry freight cars. Among them, the 60 kilometers from Guandong to Yating is the most difficult part of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway construction project. The area is more than 600 meters above sea level. There are about ten rocky caves above and below the ground. The situation when the rocky caves were developed, as well as the tens of thousands of workers mobilized for the embankment construction project. In addition, there are many curved valleys, and the project is also very difficult. Dushan, the terminal of the railway, is a plateau area 900 meters above sea level. Since the opening of the railway, it has become an important transportation hub and the political center of the southern part of Guizhou Province. In the canteen of the Guiguan Hotel inside the military station, people from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries are often seen. The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has great military significance. As for when it will be directly connected to Guiyang in the future, its economic value will be greatly developed.

### Fourth Anniversary of the Three-Nation Declaration: China, Japan, and Manchukuo Closely Cooperate to Further Jointly Promote the Great Undertaking of Reviving Asia

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Today (30th) marks the fourth anniversary of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. At this critical juncture of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, its significance is deeply felt. Four years ago, when the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued, although the situation in East Asia was fraught with crises, the war had not yet broken out, and the dangerous situation could still be salvaged. The issuance of the joint declaration by the three nations was intended to resolve the root causes of Sino-Japanese disputes and seek peace in East Asia. However, in December of the following year, due to the United States' insistence on its aggressive designs in East Asia, the Greater East Asia War finally erupted. Since then, the situation in East Asia has undergone a complete transformation. In January of the 32nd year (1943), our nation joined the war. Consequently, the task before us was not only to achieve comprehensive peace but also to cooperate in the war to ensure lasting peace and defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. The significance of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo was thus further enhanced. The original intention of the declaration evolved from mutual cooperation and joint pursuit of prosperity to close collaboration to devote all efforts to the war to defeat the enemy and defend East Asia.

Unexpectedly, our nation suffered the misfortune of Chairman Wang's passing, losing its leader and the people their guide. Amid our grief and mourning, as we commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Three-Nation Declaration, we recall that this time last year was just the first month after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and less than a month after the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Chairman Wang, upon returning to Nanjing from an inspection in Shanghai, delivered a speech, stating that the foundation for strengthening amicable relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo was the cornerstone for establishing the axis on the East Asian continent and the basis for the unity and cooperation of all nations in Greater East Asia. Now, we have the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, with both sharing the same spirit and will. The fundamental principles of mutual trust, mutual assistance, co-existence, and co-prosperity among East Asian nations are even more evident, and the scope of the co-prosperity sphere is even more expanded. From now on, we must base ourselves on the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo and adhere to the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to strengthen the East Asian axis and strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the realization of the common vision of Greater East Asia. Chairman Wang did not live to see the realization of his ideals and passed away suddenly. To fulfill Chairman Wang's legacy, we must follow his instructions, cooperate closely with our allies, and advance bravely to promote the spirit of the Three-Nation Joint Declaration and complete the co-prosperity construction of Greater East Asia.

Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, Foreign Minister Li issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: The joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which laid the cornerstone for East Asian unity, has now reached its fourth anniversary. At this critical juncture of the Greater East Asia decisive battle, looking back on the Three-Nation Joint Declaration that was sworn to the world and laid the permanent cornerstone for the revival of Asia, one cannot but feel deeply grateful. Since the issuance of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, China and Manchukuo have exchanged ambassadors and officially recognized each other. Subsequently, the National Government, through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, resolutely declared war on the United States and Britain. Thus, China, Japan, and Manchukuo, under the same goal, moved forward on the path of jointly destroying the United States and Britain and revitalizing East Asia. As the war is now facing a decisive battle, the heavy responsibility of reviving Asia should be shouldered jointly by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. In the future, we must further closely cooperate, move forward in step, and achieve the great undertaking of reviving Asia.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - November 30th marks the fourth anniversary of the declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Embassy in Nanjing will hold a commemorative ceremony in the embassy's conference hall at 10:00 a.m. on that day. Acting Ambassador Zhang is also scheduled to visit our National Government and the Japanese Embassy that morning to extend congratulations.

Our party is a revolutionary party of the Three Principles of the People, so it must have a strong organization, strict discipline, and rigorous training, so that party members can fight for the cause, and party members must be able to devote themselves to the cause, and be able to go deep into the people in the future, so that the Three Principles of the People can be popularized among the masses. It is also necessary to make the Three Principles of the People popular among the people, so that we can unite the entire nation, unify our will, and cultivate our forward-looking creativity, so as to fight against the opposing forces and aggressive forces, and establish an independent and free modern country. In the spring of the thirteenth year (1924), our Premier convened the First National Congress and reorganized the party, launching a broad mass movement, the fundamental spirit of which lies here. During the eighteenth and nineteenth years (1929-1930), our Chairman strongly advocated the great cause of protecting the party and saving the country, "restoring democratic centralization in the party, and realizing democratic politics in the country," the main task of which also lies here.

What makes the revolutionary party of the Great Three Principles of the People different from ordinary political parties is that it can select the most outstanding and progressive elements from the democratic masses as the vanguard of the revolution, that it can organize the masses, lead the masses, and be a viable and lasting revolutionary team, that it can motivate the masses, train the masses, and establish a broad and concentrated democratic force, and use this force to devote itself to the revolutionary struggle, and devote itself to the application and preservation of revolutionary power. The purpose of the revolutionary struggle is to establish revolutionary power, and this power will be returned to the revolutionary productive masses, entrusted to the revolutionary productive masses, and will belong to the revolutionary productive masses. It cannot be borrowed by a small number of warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians. The revolutionary party members who bear the heavy responsibility of revolutionary midwives should do their best, select the wise and capable, accept the entrustment of the people, and exercise their governing power. This is the essence of the revolutionary masses, and also an essential element of the anti-feudal struggle.

Party Members Go Deep into the People to Promote Work

Our Chairman expounded the legacy and gave detailed instructions, saying that the formation of revolutionary forces is: "The real meaning of revolution lies in awakening the oppressed majority of the people at the lower levels, so that they can engage in political struggles to obtain political achievements, so as to relieve suffering and increase happiness." "If we want the majority of the people to engage in political struggles, we must first unite the most enlightened elements among them, so that they can be trained and organized, and become capable fighters, so that they can lead the general masses and actively participate in political struggles. This kind of unity is what is called a party, and this kind of fighter is what is called a party member." As for the relationship between party rule and civil rights, he "advocates giving equal emphasis to implementing party rule and cultivating civil rights," and "for the enlightened elements, we should give them the freedom to develop their activity ability, and for the unenlightened elements, we should also encourage them, so that their activity ability can be gradually developed freely." "The people's freedoms of speech, assembly, and publication must be given practical guarantees." He also said: "The party cannot be high above the people," but should "go deep into the people," so party members must never become a "special class" above the masses, but "do guiding work and promoting work within the people," so that the people's strength will gradually be enriched, gradually expanded, and truly able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the national revolution. This is the duty of every party member. "Only in this way can we be comrades, otherwise we are enemies, only in this way can we be the vanguard of the people, otherwise we are traitors of the people." His words are so profound and famous. He deeply felt that the spirit of democratic centralization had been forgotten after the passing of the Premier, and the democratic forces had not been established, which would make the revolution change its nature and the people lose their faith.

Uniting National Patriots to Jointly Clean Up the Situation

Before the incident in the twenty-sixth year (1937), he repeatedly explained that democratic politics is the foundation for uniting the people, "The more political freedom given to the people in peacetime, the easier it will be to cope with in case of an emergency, because the country is formed by the collection of people, and the people's political ability is strong, so the country's strength is also strong." "It is the essence that the government and the people depend on each other for life when dealing with national disasters, the government is loyal to the people, and the people trust their government is their active activity." "China today is in the midst of internal and external troubles, and only by basing ourselves on the common interests of the entire nation and the entire nation can we seek unity and establish a strong foundation." In the declaration of the Sixth National Congress of our party in the twenty-eighth year (1939), he solemnly announced again, "Except for the Communist Party, all people have the freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication, and our party is willing to unite all patriots and factions with sincerity to jointly shoulder the responsibility of cleaning up the situation." "Only a sound democratic organization can have agile centralized action, so free will and discipline should be given equal importance. Only in this way can the party concentrate its will and concentrate its strength, only in this way can the party continuously absorb elements with independent opinions and free thoughts, so that we can all take responsibility, and when things happen, we can have a real understanding and resolute action." Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in the thirtieth year (1941), he launched the New National Movement Program at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our party, as a guideline for organizing the people and training the youth. "First popularize it among the general comrades, so as to be the vanguard, and then popularize it among the general compatriots, so as to form the gold and soup pool of the Republic of China." To shoulder the new mission of "defending the great war in East Asia." This is the experience of our Chairman leading the anti-feudal thing after the death of the Premier. All our comrades and our compatriots should inherit the legacy and implement it to the end.

The Policies of Tolerating Communists and Separating Communists Were Used in the Beginning Without Any Difference

In the thirteenth year (1924), our party was reorganized, and the policy of tolerating Communists was decided at the same time. However, reorganization is one thing, and tolerating Communists is another. The spirit of reorganization has been described above, and the Premier has carefully discussed the policy of tolerating Communists at the First National Congress, so that the general new youth with ideas can recognize the Three Principles of the People as a national revolution and fight together, so as not to go astray. Therefore, the joining of Communist Party members into our party is to "change Communist Party members into Kuomintang members." Our party's tolerance of Communist Party members is not to "change the Kuomintang into a Communist Party." Not only that, on January 26 of the twelfth year (1923), our Premier and Lenin's representative Yuefei issued a joint declaration, the first article of which clearly pointed out that "Communist organizations, even the Soviet system, cannot in fact be applied to China," "Mr. Yuefei completely agrees with this view." Therefore, our party's tolerance of Communist Party members is to recognize that "China does not have the conditions for the success of Communist organizations or the Soviet system." The joining of Communist Party members into our party also recognizes that "the most important and urgent problem in China is the success of the unity of the Republic of China and the acquisition of complete national independence." Not only that, the national revolution takes imperialism as its object, "so it is necessary to awaken all the people oppressed by imperialism to engage in the national revolution," "and it cannot be successful by specializing in one class." Therefore, the so-called tolerance of Communists depends entirely on whether they can jointly devote themselves to the national revolution. From the tolerance of Communists in the thirteenth year (1924) to the separation of Communists in the sixteenth year (1927), the policies were used in the beginning without any difference. After the separation of Communists, the Communist Party's atrocities of harming the country and harming the people became increasingly obvious. Their "propaganda of the land policy at the end is purely the face of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng, and their killing and arson are the inevitable results of the raw swallowing and live peeling method," which is still the case today. After the September 18th Incident, our party comrades, from all over the country, united sincerely under the slogan of "seeking unification through construction and seeking co-governance through equal rights," and re-established the situation of unification. Although the worries were deep, there was still something to be done in national affairs. However, the Communist Party members harbored evil intentions and used external propaganda to incite internal chaos. During the Battle of Shanghai, the government transferred the Jiangxi army to support, and the Communist bandits attacked Fuzhou. During the Battle of Gubeikou, the government transferred the Yangtze River army to support, and the Communist bandits broke Fuzhou and attacked Nanchang. Therefore, after the thirty-second year (1943), the central government made the decision that "the most urgent task is to eliminate the Communist bandits, and the most urgent task to cure the root cause is to promote production and construction." Indeed, the bandit atmosphere is wanton, and the disease is in the heart. If we do not eradicate its roots and fight its fierce flames, then all plans, internal and external, will not be able to start. In the midst of advancing the suppression of Communists politically and militarily, the remnants of the Communist bandits are increasingly impoverished, just like fish in a cauldron. Initially, the Xi'an Incident was not expected to be revived, and at this time, our Chairman reiterated that "there should be a determined determination to prevent Communists," severely criticized the error of the so-called "people's front," and in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of our party, he analyzed the difference between the Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism in order to prevent the conspiracy of the Communist Party members and to eliminate the short-sightedness of the defeatists. However, before several months had passed, the incident had occurred, and the national vitality was increasingly mourned, and the international conspiracy was becoming more and more serious. If we do not resign earlier, the situation will be even worse. (To be continued)

### Special Attack Units of the Japanese Army Demonstrate Glorious Results; Director Izubuchi Delivers a Speech

Director Izubuchi of the Shanghai Army Reporting Department of the Allied Japanese Army delivered a speech at the regular meeting of reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (29th), announcing the magnificent battle results of the special attack units of the Japanese Army and Navy. He also clarified that the Japanese Army, loyal, brave, righteous, and tolerant of all difficulties, is promoting righteous warfare in the continental operations, reflecting the glorious results of the special attack units. His speech is as follows:

The Majestic Power of the Kamikaze Remains Unwavering

Regarding the Philippine Islands war situation, the Japanese Army's special attack units, Wanduo Unit, Tomi Unit, and Hachiko Unit, echoed each other, achieving great battle results, establishing a strong determination, and vowing to completely destroy the enemy, the United States and Britain, and never stop until the final victory is achieved. Therefore, when the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit launched an attack last time, it had already achieved magnificent and great results. After the battle results were announced, many Japanese nationals eagerly volunteered to join the special attack unit. This enthusiastic spirit continues to be discovered, inheriting the legacy of the martyrs and giving a greater blow to the enemy, the United States and Britain. As long as there are traces of enemy American ships in the Pacific Ocean, the work of the special attack unit will continue to attack. The Japanese side has this special power, which has not yet been activated and is calmly dealing with the enemy.

Continental Frontline Continues to Advance

The incomparably loyal and brave actions of the Japanese special attack unit members have made the enemy frightened and the world amazed. However, the spirit of the Japanese army's special attack units to move forward and follow each other is even more inspiring, and every soldier in those operations has the same determination as the special attack unit members and is actively working on the battlefield. At the same time, in terms of continental operations, after the Japanese army completely occupied Guilin and Liuzhou, the largest and most important base of the enemy's US air force, it continued to pursue and attack the defeated enemy army, overcoming the difficulties of Guangxi's mountain peaks and natural dangers, and working hard in battle. It has already occupied Nanning and advanced into Guizhou Province. The difficult and arduous fierce battle continues to advance, enduring all difficulties and promoting righteous warfare. Its actions are in fact mutually shining with the spirit of the special attack unit. Only this kind of Japanese army's loyal, brave, and righteous spirit is the guarantee of Japan's vast combat power, and it is also the guarantee of the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Comprehensive Ration Coupons to be Extended and Generally Issued

The city's Materials Allocation Office originally scheduled to issue comprehensive ration coupons Nos. 61 to 90, starting yesterday (29th), at the 1st to 19th issuing offices (i.e., within the old Zones 1 to 8 and the Nanshi District), sequentially according to the property tax and the scheduled date on the application. Because there are still many comprehensive ration coupons held by citizens for items that have not been received, it has been decided to postpone the issuance, and the date will be announced by the office after it is determined.

### Household Coal Briquettes to be Replaced with Coal Dust

Because of electricity issues, it is difficult for coal briquette manufacturing plants in this city to manufacture them, so the allocation of household coal briquettes will be changed to allocate coal or coal dust. The city's Materials Allocation Office is actively preparing for this.

### Changes in the Deputy Director of the Economic Security Office

The position of Deputy Director of the Police Economic Security Office of this city was originally held concurrently by Yao Yunbo, Deputy Director of the Special High School. Because Deputy Director Yao's duties at the Special High School are heavy and he cannot take care of both, he has been relieved of his concurrent position as Deputy Director of the office. The vacancy has been filled by Yamaguchi Heijiro, a specialist of the office, and he has been working since the day before yesterday.

### Installation of Alarm Bells in the Huashan and Changning Districts

The Huashan and Changning District Baojia Committees previously consulted with the Football Federation on holding a football match to raise funds for the installation of alarm bells in the district. The bidding process has been completed, costing more than 15 million yuan. The contract has now been signed and work has begun to install the latest type of alarm bells in Shanghai, which is beneficial for police defense.

### Special Tax on Cattle and Poultry to be Collected Starting Tomorrow

The municipal government has investigated the fact that cattle and poultry (including chickens, ducks, geese, etc.) are a major part of the city's food sales. The special business tax on cattle and poultry will be collected starting tomorrow (1st), and after investigating the recent market value of cattle in this city, the tax will be 5 percent, which is 2,000 yuan. The remaining chickens, ducks, geese, etc. will be taxed at 5 percent based on the monthly business figures of each wholesale business, which will be handled by the Special Tax Collection Office for Livestock Business.

### Exhibition of Famous Porcelain of Past Dynasties to Close Today

The First Exhibition of Famous Porcelain of Past Dynasties, sponsored by the Chinese Art Museum, has attracted more than 20 groups of visitors, as well as thousands of distinguished people from the East and West, since its opening, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. In order to implement the purpose of promoting ancient art and promoting the national spirit, the museum has hired contemporary archaeologists and collectors to actively prepare for the second exhibition, so as to provide us with a study of the origin of the production of our ancestors, and also to examine the traces of mild evolution, the significance of which is not only for appreciation and research. The first exhibition of famous porcelain has many rare treasures, which is a great opportunity for appreciation. Because the value is too great, it is scheduled to close at 4:00 p.m. today and will not be extended.

### Ministry of Justice Orders to Establish Protection Association for Released Prisoners

In order to prevent prisoners from committing crimes again after their release, the Ministry of Justice has specially ordered all subordinate procuratorates to quickly plan and establish protection associations for released prisoners as soon as possible, so as to urge released prisoners to correct their mistakes and start anew. After receiving the order, the High Procuratorate of this city immediately instructed the local procuratorate to actively prepare for the establishment.

### Industrial and Commercial Firms Re-register

The Municipal Social Affairs and Food Bureaus have both been abolished successively. All factories and firms that have registered and obtained certificates are considered valid. However, for the convenience of statistics and supervision, the Municipal Economic Bureau will conduct re-registration from now until December 20th. The Municipal Economic Bureau will issue new registration certificates free of charge, so that all are consistent.

### Notification from Trade Association Secretariat: Members Should Not Seek Profiteering

The secretariats of the various trade associations in this city held a symposium at the Municipal Economic Bureau the other day to discuss issues such as commodity prices. They advised all members not to engage in speculative price increases, especially the illegal price increases of oil and candles after the enemy aircraft attacked Shanghai in the middle of this month. This is extremely abhorrent, and it is hoped that all members will cherish themselves in the future. If there is any profiteering behavior taking advantage of the situation, the authorities will severely punish them.

### Air Raid on the 21st: Over 300 Civilian Casualties

As a result of the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Shanghai on the 21st of this month, after an investigation by the Air Defense Headquarters, as of the 28th, the total number of Chinese civilian casualties was approximately 300 (with about one-third of them dead). The municipal authorities hope that the general public will, in the future, cooperate with air defense measures during air raids. Investigations have revealed that the victims of this air raid were all innocent Chinese civilians. This proves that indiscriminate bombing is neither planned nor discriminate. Citizens should understand the tragedy of this incident. In the future, when enemy aircraft attack, they must thoroughly implement light control and refrain from looking up in the streets when the anti-aircraft guns are firing to ensure their safety.

### Random Notes on Wu Quanlai's Western Painting Exhibition

â€” Wen Zhaotong

The continuous decline of the Shanghai art scene is an undeniable fact. This is because what most young people engaged in painting know is either the well-practiced techniques of modeling or the pursuit of sensation and taste. But the result is that the former becomes a superficial and mediocre so-called realism, which is in fact nothing more than a vulgar technique without a voice. The latter only cares about the momentary pleasure of the producer but neglects the accuracy of basic depiction, and thus returns to emptiness and superficiality.

The works in Quanlai's exhibition include the crystallizations of his research over the past decade. Seeing each of his oil paintings or sketches will make you discover that he is searching for a way out everywhere. No, he is trying various new techniques, whether in conception, brushstrokes, color, or position. Superficially, each painting has its own characteristics. After seeing No. 55 "Still Life" and No. 54 "Canna," you will believe that this statement is more reasonable. However, his art is, after all, built on a solid foundation, so it can also be said that it is completely consistent in essence, because there are also paintings such as No. 40 "Remote Return" and No. 7 "Vase" that can be studied by the author.

Excellent and lively modern art requires the use of modeling techniques as a means and the expression of sensation and taste as a goal. This is precisely the significance of Mr. Hai Su's enthusiastic sponsorship of this exhibition, and it is also a measure to correct the current malpractices.

### Materials Control Review Committee to Hold First Standing Meeting Early Next Month

The first meeting of the Standing Committee of the Materials Control Review Committee was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to review the recent control operations of the National Commercial Control Federation and the control committees for rice, flour, wheat, oil, grain, cotton, daily necessities, etc., and to further strengthen the control matters. However, due to insufficient preparations, it was postponed. It is now learned that the various control committees have drafted detailed reports on the control work after their reorganization and submitted them to the meeting. It is expected that the meeting will be held early next month, and Committee Chairman Zhou Fohai and Minister Chen Changjun of the Ministry of Industry are determined to attend in person.

### Naval Seamen Training Center Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Merchant Seamen Training School Held Ceremony Simultaneously

The Central Seamen Training Center of the Ministry of Navy and the Central Merchant Seamen Training School began training the eleventh term of naval recruits and the first term of ordinary seamen in June of this year. Through the efforts of all officers and men under the leadership of the director, and with the assistance of Allied navies, the results have been remarkable. A joint graduation ceremony was held at the school on Bansongyuan Road, Shanghai, at 10:00 AM yesterday (29th). Forty-five of the 142 graduating recruits were selected for advanced studies, and an opening ceremony was held for special training soldiers in artillery, steering, machinery, and signals. At the same time, 98 graduating seamen were assigned to the China Branch Shipping Company, East Asia Shipping Company, China Steamship Company, and Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company for internships. The ceremony was presided over by the director, Major General Huang Xun, and the training director, Colonel Yang Zheren. The details of the ceremony are described below:

Ceremony Begins

The ceremony began at 10:10 AM. The officials present included the representative of the Minister of Navy, Major General Chen Ruiming, Director of the Military Balance Department of the Ministry of Navy, Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, Principal of the Central Naval Academy, Colonel Zhang Binying, Director of Education, Major General Ye Kesong, Director of the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of Navy, Lieutenant General Xu Fuqin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Navy, and the Allied officials, Lieutenant General Maeda Minoru, Chief Military Advisor of the Navy of the National Government, Rear Admiral Minato Keijo, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Fleet of the Chinese side and Chief Naval AttachÃ© in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Mori Tokuji, Commander of the Aftermath Base of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, Colonel Miyasaka, Chief Instructor of the Central Naval Academy, Major Morita, Instructor, and dozens of others. Director Huang presided over the ceremony, and the ceremony was performed as usual. The director entrusted the graduates of the eleventh term of naval recruits and the first term of seamen, entrusted the special training soldiers of each department, and awarded graduation certificates and prizes to the graduates of this term.

Director's Speech

The director then delivered a speech, saying: "Although the navy and shipping are different in name, their missions are the same. The responsibility of merchant ships in wartime is as great as that of the navy. The Allied navies win every battle, which is due to the bravery of the officers and men, but it is also due to the rapid transportation and the spirit of sacrifice of the seamen. After the National Government returned to the capital, the highest authorities were determined to build a unified and strong navy. The graduates trained by this school include 11 terms of recruits and special training soldiers, 8 terms of artillery and machinery, 9 terms of steering, and 10 terms of signals. They are now serving in fleets or agencies with good results. Today's graduates are all excellent members who have received strict training. They should do their best to protect the country and the people, and to revitalize East Asia. We should also learn from the naval spirit of our ally Japan, and earnestly follow the training instructions for soldiers of the army, navy, and air force prescribed by the late Chairman Wang, and the exhortations of all officers, and live up to my expectations of you."

Maeda's Congratulatory Remarks

Then, Chief Advisor Lieutenant General Maeda delivered a congratulatory speech, saying: "I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in the graduation ceremony. Under the cultivation of the director and all the instructors, the recruits and seamen of this term have graduated today with excellent results and will be assigned to various places to serve. I sincerely express my congratulations. Various special training soldiers are selected from the graduates and hone deeper academic skills as the backbone of the implementation unit. This time you have the opportunity to receive special training, which is really commendable in the Chinese navy. I hope you will understand the significance and strive to encourage each other. At present, the world war situation is entering a decisive stage in the East and West. Our East Asian nations should unite, gather the total strength of the East Asian nations, break the enemy's dreams, and lay the foundation for the permanent stability of the Greater East Asia. In the future, whether you are serving in the military or serving outside, you must cultivate the cultivation of the military spirit and the Tao of the seaman's soul, grasp the true posture of the current war, and hope that you will keep your duty and move towards the bright road." Subsequently, Minister Chen gave instructions on behalf of the Minister of Navy, with many encouraging words. The graduating recruits and seamen were very excited. Finally, the graduating recruit representative Wu Wei and the graduating seaman representative Ni Zhongkai gave speeches in reply, and the ceremony was completed. In the afternoon, the 98 graduating seamen, led by the staff of the various shipping companies to which they were assigned, left the school in three motor vehicles. All the officers and men lined up to bid farewell at the school's pier, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic and everyone was very happy.

Gratitude Gifts to Teachers Transferred to Scholarship Funds

Li Xinhui, General Manager of Gongxin Electric Factory, wrote: "I am writing to inform you that our company's trainee, Cui Zhenghai, has completed his internship. His family sent two gift certificates worth 6,000 yuan and 6,000 yuan in cash, totaling 12,000 yuan in national currency, to thank the teachers and friends for their banquet. I believe that it is appropriate to practice thrift during this extraordinary period. Furthermore, I believe that our company's training of talents is originally to reserve materials for the country, and the establishment of your newspaper's scholarship fund is the same as our company's tree-planting and talent-cultivating. Therefore, I specially sent the 12,000 yuan, except for 6,000 yuan to Xinwenbao as a loan scholarship, and the remaining 6,000 yuan to your newspaper for use as a scholarship fund. I hope you will publish this."

### The Problem of School Classes After Air Raids and Electricity Conservation

â€” Lin Wencai

Because of the previous air raids, there have been many discussions about the issue of students attending classes, and there has been no consensus. At the same time, "another power outage" has been implemented. Because electricity conservation is a general and universal issue, it has a great indirect impact on students' evening self-study work. At the same time, the opinions I provide are also related, so they are discussed together.

My opinion is provided to the municipal education authorities. I hope that it will be promulgated by order to achieve a unified effect. -- To save space, I will omit the theory and focus on practical solutions.

(A) All schools in the city should adopt a half-day class system uniformly. The method is as follows:

(1) From 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, there are six classes. Each class is 40 minutes, and each class rests for 10 minutes, for a total of 300 minutes, which is equal to 5 hours.

(2) Schools should reduce the amount of morning exercises if deemed necessary.

(3) Art, handicrafts, music, and other subjects should appropriately reduce teaching time, and each school should guide students in free extracurricular activities.

(4) If an air raid alarm is issued in the morning, in addition to the classes that have already started, the school should be responsible for handling the situation in accordance with the air defense regulations. If a warning alarm is issued before 8:00 AM, parents should immediately stop their children from going to school.

(5) If the alarm is lifted before 1:00 PM, each school should make up the morning lessons in the afternoon (the method should be the same as in the morning). After this method is determined, each school should notify the parents in advance, without having to inform them temporarily.

(6) In the event of a full-day alarm, each school should make full use of "Sundays" or "Saturday afternoons" to make up for the courses of that day.

(7) After the method is announced, all public and private schools in the city should follow it uniformly, so as to avoid time conflicts for part-time teachers.

(B) All students' parents should be notified to earnestly supervise their children in accordance with the following items:

(1) If you hear an alarm on the road, you should immediately look for a shelter, or if you are closer to home, quickly fold back home. If you are not far from the school, you can still run to the school for shelter.

(2) After leaving school every day, you should immediately return home and try to complete the self-study work or homework that should be done that day in the afternoon, and you don't need to do self-study in the evening.

(3) Patrol children, practice going to bed early and getting up early, make full use of daytime working hours, minimize games and rest, concentrate your mind, and cope with the most difficult situation.

The above methods are briefly described. If the authorities quickly adopt them and order their implementation in a timely manner, the studies and lives of young students in the face of air raids and electricity conservation will surely be improved in the shortest possible time.

Regarding the Company's Layoff Problem, Report Opinions Factually, He Sumin

In the issue of this month's 23rd, there was an article by Li Liangru, "Contributing Some Opinions on the Company's Layoff Problem," which was reasonable and in line with the actual situation.

A friend of mine works in a large printing house in this city. Yesterday, he mentioned that the library had issued a notice this month and formulated two methods, A and B. Method A is to keep the job without working. From next month, you can not go to the company to work. The company will pay the full salary and subsidies for November every month (the lowest salary and subsidies currently earned by the library's employees are more than 9,000 yuan) until September next year. The original position is still reserved, and the company will temporarily notify you to return to the company to work according to business needs. Method B is retirement. The company will pay a one-time retirement salary and subsidies for 10 months. Any employee who voluntarily applies to the company to handle Method A or B this month can do so. If you do not apply this month, you will continue to work as usual from next month. According to the library's method, it coincides with the first point of Li's opinion, and it is more thoughtful.

### Mr. Zhou Nianxi's Charity Sale of Fox Fur to Aid Disaster Relief

A letter from Mr. Zhou Nianxi states: "Respected Sirs, Nianxi, shielded by ancestral blessings, is not exposed to cold or starvation. Since the events [likely referring to a recent disaster or war], my dwelling has been reduced to ruins, and I live in a humble dwelling in Shanghai. I practice frugality and contentment with my lot, but every time winter arrives and I see people freezing to death on the streets, I can only feel deep sorrow and compassion. Recently, I saw that your organization is holding a winter disaster relief and emergency aid drive to help those in danger and need, and I deeply sympathize with this cause. Therefore, I dare to urge my whole family to further reduce expenses. Besides the donations I have already made, I still feel I have not done enough. I am donating an item of clothing bestowed upon me by my late father, namely a fox fur satin jacket and a gray squirrel satin robe, to your organization to be sold, with all proceeds to be used for winter disaster relief. I hope you will appreciate my sincere intentions and not hesitate to go through the necessary procedures to make this a success, so that I can fulfill my wish to provide as much assistance as possible. I will be endlessly grateful for your kindness."

Furthermore, as the weather grows colder, the Salvation Army's porridge kitchen plans to set up a soup kitchen and distribute winter clothing as usual. After special consultation with this newspaper, we jointly launch a winter relief effort to provide porridge and clothing. We continue to appeal to people from all walks of life to assist with enthusiasm, saving money to rescue the hungry and cold, accumulating small contributions into a large fund to collectively engage in this charitable act.

### Voluntary Reform and Anti-Smoking - Ninth Session Concluded

The voluntary reform and anti-smoking program organized by the South Tonglu Moral Education Association, under special agreement with this newspaper, has concluded its ninth group smoking cessation session yesterday. The graduating members left the facility, and a farewell ceremony was held in the association's auditorium. The atmosphere was solemn. First, the supervisor, Huang Jingqi, delivered a speech, followed by Wang Huishan, Wang Xiutong, Xu Xiuxing, and doctors Cai Daming, Yang Yusheng, and Shao Bonan, who offered earnest words of encouragement. Afterwards, a representative of the former smokers gave a speech of thanks, stating that the reason for falling into the habit of smoking was partly due to boredom and partly due to pain. Sometimes various stimuli were present, which led to the relief of emotional frustrations and resulted in addiction. Now, thanks to Shen Bao [this newspaper] and the Moral Education Association, and the sincere care of the doctors, they have been able to reach the other shore within ten days, a transformation akin to bringing the dead back to life. They vowed that after leaving the hospital, they would never try smoking again. Everyone applauded in approval, and the gathering dispersed after lunch.

### Donations to the Child Welfare Association - Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors

The Chinese Child Welfare Association is currently caring for over 300 orphaned and impoverished children. Due to soaring prices, expenses are enormous and far exceed the budget. Leading figures in the city's society have jointly discussed fundraising methods. At the scene, Luo Hongyi, Chen Binsu, and others pledged to raise over 2.5 million yuan as an initiative. The association has now received the following donations from this pledged amount: Wang Zhenchuan, 200,000 yuan; Zhang Xiangwen, 180,000 yuan; Lin Kanghou, 120,000 yuan; Wu Yunqi and Ding Boxiong, 110,000 yuan each; Le Fucheng, 103,000 yuan; Zhao Jinqing and Fang Yunzhen, 20,000 yuan each. The enthusiasm of Mr. Luo and others in providing relief and benefiting children is truly commendable and deeply appreciated. However, given the continued rapid rise in current prices, even if the fundraising target of 5 million yuan is met, whether it will be sufficient to cover the expenses for the second half of the year is still questionable. Therefore, we urgently hope that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will send in any funds raised as soon as possible, so that the association can purchase food, fuel, and other necessities in advance for storage and use to ensure long-term sustainability. If you would like to make a donation, in addition to direct collection by the association (No. 208, Central Huai Building, Dashanghai Road), the social service department of this newspaper can also collect on their behalf. Telephone donations are especially welcome; please call 82273, and the association will send someone to collect the donation with a receipt.
