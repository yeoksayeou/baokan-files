### The Current Problems of University Students

Our country has been providing university education for several decades. University graduates occupy important positions in various organizations, groups, and industrial and commercial enterprises, and their expressions today reflect the effectiveness of university education over the past few decades. Today's university students are also the backbone of national revival and reconstruction in ten or twenty years. To ensure they are competent and happy in their future service, they need to enrich themselves even more today. In light of this, our newspaper, following the symposium on primary and secondary education, specially convened a symposium for university students to earnestly discuss the current issues facing university students, achieving quite satisfactory conclusions, which is gratifying. (The minutes of the symposium are published on page three of today's newspaper.) We hope that similar meetings can be convened regularly for everyone to exchange opinions, both encouraging each other and contributing opinions to relevant authorities, hoping for comprehensive improvements in future university education. The discussions at this symposium focused on the most urgent and concrete problems of the moment. We hope that university students, university authorities, the publishing industry, and educational authorities will pay special attention to them. First, regarding the work-study program, it is originally a university education method that suits China's national conditions. However, the key is that the content of the work-study program must be appropriately matched; otherwise, both mental and physical energy will be exhausted, and success will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, we hope that influential members of society, especially in the business sector, will pay more attention to this and increase the number of work-study positions in their own business departments, cooperating with relevant universities to cultivate specialized talents, which would be a blessing for the country and society. At the same time, we sympathize with the situation of general poor university students who, on the one hand, have heavy academic work, and on the other hand, have to spend their mental and physical labor to maintain their studies. However, it is an unreasonable phenomenon to sell labor cheaply, and the work has nothing to do with what they are studying. We urgently hope that relevant parties will provide strong assistance. Second, the problems concerning university teaching materials, textbooks, and equipment are still serious. First of all, the teaching materials are very mixed and unreasonable. Most of them force students and professors to adapt to the current state of the teaching materials. Therefore, [what is learned is not applied, and what is applied is not learned] is an inevitable result. We hope that the educational authorities can focus on the needs of the entire country and nation and determine the direction of unified teaching materials. At the same time, we encourage and assist the publishing industry to publish university teaching materials in a planned and systematic way. Secondly, regarding the textbook issue, before a unified standard has been determined, we hope that the various specific requirements put forward by this university student symposium will be given special attention by all relevant parties. In addition, the problems of equipment and practice are indeed serious problems today. We can only hope that all schools will cooperate and help each other for the sake of the country and society's future, waiting for a satisfactory solution in the future. Third, regarding the issues of university students themselves and student aid, from food, accommodation, and health to extracurricular activities, this symposium has exchanged very valuable opinions. We don't need to add more praise. We are particularly pleased that after this symposium, it was decided to organize a "Shen Bao" Student Aid University Fellowship to strengthen communication between students or between students and student aid organizations. We hope that those responsible for planning and organizing will make special efforts. In addition, student Zhang's organization of research seminars, vocational guidance, and life guidance can also improve the current university student life and jointly move towards a healthy and bright future. We hope that it can be realized as soon as possible. We are facing a new era? The heavy responsibility of reviving the nation, building the country, and transforming society is waiting for us to shoulder. University students! We must unite and strive forward even more!

### Ministry of Health Investigates and Registers Anesthetic Drugs

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Recently, the source of anesthetic drugs has been cut off, and various hospitals and doctors have found it extremely difficult to obtain these drugs.

### Chongqing's Pan-East Commando Brigade Commander Participates in the Peace Movement; He Kaixuan Leads His Troops to Return

Zhengzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Pacification Headquarters of the Border Area of the Four Provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Anhui, since its establishment in Xuchang on September 1, has had a great impact on the Chongqing army's resistance camp in the area. Furthermore, due to the strong promotion of the pacification work, Chongqing generals finally appeared to participate in the peace camp. Namely, Mr. He Kaixuan, the third brigade commander and fourth regiment commander of the Chongqing Pan-East Commando (Chen Wenxin, Commander-in-Chief of Eastern Henan), led his subordinates, the fourth regiment, 13,000 people, to participate in the peace camp. According to reports, Brigade Commander He and Lieutenant General Li Yulin, the Pacification Director, are both from the Northeast and are classmates of the Fengtian Military Academy. Brigade Commander He's participation in the peace movement this time has sharply reduced the strength of the Chongqing Pan-East Commando, which may collapse. At the beginning of this Henan operation, Brigade Commander He felt the meaninglessness of the resistance war. When the Japanese army attacked, he did not accept the orders from above and remained inactive to observe the situation. With the establishment of the Pacification Director's Office this time, he finally decided to lead his troops to participate in the peace movement. Major General Guo Shoutian, the acting regiment commander of the He Regiment, held negotiations in Huangling (35 kilometers east of Xuchang), and the result was a success. Brigade Commander He and Lieutenant General Li Yulin, in Xuchang, have now shaken hands after eight years of separation.

### Recent Situation of the Mongolian Autonomous Government

September 1 marks the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Mongolian Autonomous Government. Since the Mongolian Congress resolved on September 1, 1939, to unify the formerly separate political powers, the contribution expected from Mongolia to Japan for the purpose of carrying out the Greater East Asia War has become greater, and Japan and Mongolia have become one body to respond to the urgent war situation.

### Mongolia's Reformation

Since August, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government has banned its people from wearing queues and binding feet by order of the Political Affairs Council. The prohibition of queues is, for Mongolians, like the Japanese prohibition of wearing topknots; it is a wise decision of reform. This is proof of the vigorous will of the Mongolian people. The appearance of Mongolians, who already resemble Japanese people, cutting off their queues is increasingly like the shaved heads of Japanese men and monks in the territory, which is also a gratifying scene. This kind of external change is really a manifestation of the government's administrative power penetrating and the soaring desire for war, [now is the time for the nations of Greater East Asia to rise up], and in the crucible of history, building a solid national sentiment.

### Strengthening Defense

The enemy Americans, whose bases in Central and South China have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft, are turning to the Northwest region to enrich their bases and are engaging in military intervention in the Yan'an regime. In the context of actively guiding the development of Xinjiang, the significance of the national defense of Mengjiang, which borders the Northwest region, is becoming more and more important. But the Outer Mongolian border is now extremely calm. The Fu Zuoyi army in Suiyuan, under the suppression of the Japanese army, cannot encroach. Even if the enemy Americans advance to the Northwest in the hope of a general counteroffensive against Japan, the outer line of defense of Japan and Manchuria, under the protection of the Japanese army, is as solid as a steel wall. Mengjiang has launched a landmark defense law, and officials and civilians alike have the awareness of Western defenders.

### A Fierce Advance in Increased Production

Mengjiang's resources are limited by geographical circumstances, and there are still many undeveloped areas. Among them, Longyan's iron and Datong's coal are Mengjiang's two major war resources. Officials and civilians are working together to mine and transport them to increase production. Recently, after Inspector Fujiwara's inspection, the difficulties in materials, labor, and food due to the remote location will soon be eliminated. For example, since the launch of the increased production movement at the Longyan Iron Mine in August, the production volume has increased by about 80% per day compared to July. By the end of this month, the labor force required for this year is expected to be maintained. Technical aspects have also been arranged, so it is not a problem to reach the planned increase in production for this year.

### The Savings Fever in the Combined Territory

The national festivals in various parts of Mongolia came to a grand end in August. In Bailingmiao, the birthplace of the Mongolian government, a magnificent sacrificial pond was newly built this year, and a grand inauguration ceremony was held. The lowest-level agencies of the government are now actively extending to these grasslands. For example, Xisunit Left Banner, the only purely Mongolian area in Mengjiang's Xilingol League, opened a post and telecommunications bureau in response to the savings movement. It started operations on September 1, and Mongolians are also saving. The savings target amount in the territory for this year is 350 million yuan for the year from July, which is more than triple the increase from the previous year's 100 million yuan. This figure can only be achieved with the united strength of the Five Races. The five races working together are also showing the strength of Mengjiang here.

### Japanese Army Continues to Advance and Enters Guangxi Province; Possesses a Strong Greater East Asia Defense Line

A certain Japanese military base on the front line, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army has now broken into Guangxi Province. Since the operations in Henan and Hunan, the Japanese army, north from Luoyang to the northern border of Guangxi Province in the south, now possesses a strong Greater East Asia defense line stretching thousands of kilometers. Therefore, even if the Greater East Asia War continues for any period of time, the foundation for the Japanese side has become one of certain victory and invincibility. The characteristics and progress of this operation are recorded separately as follows: The characteristics of this operation are as follows: ○ The vastness of the area, the magnificence of the scale, and the speed of troop use in this operation are truly landmark innovations in the history of war, and the threat it poses to the anti-Axis camp is especially rare. ○ In this operation, the Japanese army has gradually realized its hopes according to plan, which is enough to show the true power of the Japanese army. ○ In the continental operation, the Chongqing army is not regarded as the enemy, and its purpose is to destroy the US Air Force. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang, the Japanese and US armies on the mainland have entered the decisive battle stage. ○ The Japanese army's combat operations have always started from morality, so the Chinese people are happy to cooperate. The people liberated from the shackles of the Chongqing army are actively rebuilding their hometowns to enhance their combat power to defend Greater East Asia. The direct impact of this operation on the Chongqing army's lineup is as follows: ○ The Chongqing army's front-line defense areas, the First and Ninth War Zones, have been completely destroyed, and the Fourth War Zone, its heart, has been directly subjected to heavy pressure. At the same time, the Japanese army in South China also launched an offensive in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line area, causing the Third and Seventh War Zones to suffer great blows at the same time. In particular, the Sixth and Ninth War Zones, which defend Chongqing, have become second-line positions, and the resistance camp is now on the eve of collapse. ○ The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been trapped west of Xi'an and Hanzhong in the north, and in the south, since the fall of important bases such as Hengyang and Lingling, the Japanese army has directly entered and split it from east to west. The Chinese coastal bases are in fact extremely weak, and the southwest rear base is now directly threatened by the Japanese Air Force. The function of the US Air Force has been greatly reduced today. At the same time, in this operation, the Pacific offensive called for by the enemy Americans, that is, the enemy Americans' attempt to open up a connected continental route from the Pacific islands, attempting to move the Japanese-US decisive battle ground to the mainland, but as a result of the Japanese army's offensive in Hunan, the US Air Force and the Chongqing army's air force in the adjacent area did not come to aid, and only engaged in a frontal battle with the Japanese army. In the combat circle of this operation, there is a vast area with great military and economic value. Now, for the defense of Greater East Asia, a defense formation can be freely organized. The voice of Hunan people building Hunan has given neighboring areas a great impetus. For example, the people of Guangxi Province have stood up under the banner of Greater Guangxiism to destroy the US Air Force and escape heavy pressure, so the Chongqing-American camp is extremely embarrassed.

### Japanese Army Attacks Southeastern Guangxi on Two Fronts

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing, the rapid advance of the Japanese army attacking southeastern Guangxi on two fronts is as follows: The Japanese army in the Hunan-Guangxi border area has reached Guanyang, 95 kilometers south of Lingling. In addition, the Japanese army advancing from northwestern Guangdong Province has occupied Huaiji and continues to advance. The two Japanese armies east and southeast of Guilin are only 140 li apart. The Japanese army's offensive objectives are to cut off the connection between the eastern and southeastern parts of the resistance area and to expel the Chongqing-American air force bases attempting to disrupt Japanese maritime transport. According to the Chongqing Army Headquarters, the Japanese army advancing from Daoxian has reached the front line of the main base. Furthermore, according to Reuters, a communique from the Chongqing Army stated that the Japanese troops advancing south through Daoxian were blocked by the Chongqing Army, but they continued to advance southward thereafter, their attempt being obviously to encircle Guilin from the southeast. In addition, the Japanese troops who broke into Guangxi from northwestern Guangdong were rumored to have reached Wuzhou, and Xindu in the north. The United News Agency also stated that although the Chongqing Army Headquarters did not confirm it, it was added that it had received unconfirmed news of the Japanese army approaching Guilin.

### Actively Connecting the Pinghan Railway

A certain base on the Japanese front lines, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Pinghan Railway, connecting Beijing and Hankou, has been out of service for seven years. Due to various reasons, the northern section of the line (from Beijing to Xinxiang) has now been restored to prosperity, making a great contribution to enhancing the welfare of the people. However, the railway tracks south of the Yellow River in the Zhengzhou area have been dismantled by the Chongqing army. However, since the Yellow River operation began this spring, this section of the railway has been revitalized and once again assumed the major task of a railway running through China, connecting Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. Almost immediately after the Yellow River crossing operation erupted on April 18, the railway team took on its major task, starting bridge construction on the Yellow River and defending the several-kilometer-long bridge, eliminating various obstructions by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, so that the Yellow River bridge construction could proceed on schedule, thereby solving the greatest difficulty in opening up the Pinghan Line. On the other hand, construction was accelerated to extend the line south from the south bank of the Yellow River to Zhengzhou. By early July, trucks were able to travel from Zhengzhou to a certain place. Currently, from August to September, the authorities have not slackened their efforts in the construction of this line, hoping that the Pinghan Line, which has lost its function, will become sound, and the day when the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood and the completion of the important transportation artery mission of Greater East Asia will be realized is not far away.

### Battle for Warsaw to Unfold: US Air Transport Teams Aid Polish Rebels

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Soviet troops, responding to the Polish rebels within Warsaw, are deploying on the east bank of the river. In addition to concentrating heavy artillery and mortar fire on the German forces on the west bank of the river, they are actively preparing their forces.

The Soviet army is about to launch a general offensive on Warsaw. According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, although the Vistula River, which connects the north and south of Warsaw, is only a quarter of a kilometer wide, the German army has completely destroyed all the bridges, making it extremely difficult for the Soviet army to cross the river. Therefore, once the great offensive and defensive battle for Warsaw breaks out, it is expected to become a major battle since the fall of Kyiv. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, a large formation of U.S. Air Force superbombers took off from bases in the UK on the 18th and is currently transporting military supplies to the Polish rebels in Warsaw and will land at Soviet bases.

### German Army Determined to Defend the Ruhr Area at All Costs: Street Fighting in Eindhoven

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) British and American forces on the Western Front launched a fierce offensive on the Siegfried Line in the Aachen area on the 16th. Although it is difficult to determine whether this offensive is the final decisive general attack on Germany, the future course of the war must be given the utmost attention. The area near Aachen, where the anti-Axis forces are concentrating their attacks, is only 65 kilometers away from Cologne, the gateway to the Ruhr region, the center of German heavy industry. Therefore, this attack by the anti-Axis forces can be regarded as a decisive battle for the heart of Germany. The strength of the German defenses will have a major impact on the future course of the war. According to a statement from the British and American sides, the anti-Axis parachute troops have made contact with the British Second Army and, after capturing Eindhoven, an industrial city in the Netherlands, are continuing to advance north towards the Siegfried Line. The German side also acknowledges this. British and American forces, starting from the Erle bridgehead, entered Eindhoven after fierce fighting, but suffered heavy losses.

### Using Their Strengths

— Masatsune Ogura

In his first broadcast speech on August 8, Prime Minister Koiso stated the government's beliefs and urgently hoped that the 100 million citizens would give full play to their total strength at this critical juncture. The purpose of his entire speech was to devote himself to the Emperor and die for him. As citizens, they must carry out the war vigorously as indicated in the declaration of war shining in the world. Therefore, the people must understand the government's intentions and cooperate fully with the government's various policies to complete a system of unity from top to bottom and sincere unity. It can be said that the new cabinet is full of talents, and at this critical moment, we earnestly hope that the government authorities will seize the time without hesitation and give concrete instructions and strong implementation. On this point, I would like to state my humble opinions for the reference of those who are wise. Today, the points listed by the Prime Minister, such as rapidly strengthening military power, stabilizing people's lives, and implementing policies, are all indispensable. However, the most fundamental thing lies in revitalizing the national spirit, with everything based on the war. In this speech, the Prime Minister elaborated on the spirit of the Imperial Ancestor Amaterasu Omikami, and believed that "unity of matter and spirit" is the founding spirit of the Imperial State. Frankly speaking, this is meaningful. Matter, like people, has a soul. When matter is used and manufactured by people, it is imbued with a soul. When it interacts with people, matter becomes a living entity with a soul. This situation has been the case in Japan for three thousand years, and this is the principle of unity of matter and spirit. If production is truly a soulful activity, then the products will also have souls, and they will immediately become military power on the battlefield and can strengthen combat effectiveness. Therefore, everyone must truly understand the current situation, grasp the inherent meaning of the Imperial State of unity of matter and spirit, and unity of the monarch and the people, and strive to work hard in their respective professional positions. However, the government must establish a policy to fully promote the excellence inherent in the three thousand years of tradition. If we adopt the production enhancement policies taken in the past, and even if the government and the people, from top to bottom, deeply reflect on themselves, are selfless, and work together, I still believe that it will not achieve satisfactory results if we lose sight of the urgency, sometimes stagnate and shrink, and sometimes become激昂 and impulsive. Therefore, the government must have a broad vision. The policy that must be adopted urgently at present is to respect people's hearts and strengthen people's hearts, that is, spirit first. However, in order to make people's hearts畅达 and spirits satisfied in various professional fields, I believe that it is necessary to establish a method of entrusting tasks and stipulating where responsibilities lie. Work should be assigned according to each person's special technical abilities, etc., and they must be held responsible for the work. It is a characteristic of the Japanese to let others do the work and then trust others to do it. In short, this is a policy of generosity in entrusting and trusting people. In the past, during the Russo-Japanese War, it has become a famous story in history that Marshal Oyama entrusted the Chief of General Staff to make decisions. During the term of General Kodama as Governor-General of Taiwan, he also entrusted the important affairs to Count Goto Shinpei, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, which resulted in satisfactory results. Count Goto's colonial policy in Taiwan, implemented according to biology, was based on the local conditions, customs, and habits, and he谆谆善导 to make them follow the rules. Rather than applying theoretical theories and legal laws in books, it is better to adopt the principle of reality first. General Kodama's political vision and tolerance are worth considering again today. At such an important juncture, the government should not adopt a static policy, but should establish a policy of adapting to changing circumstances. Here, I hope that we will not waste the 100 million citizens, but will give full play to the people's hearts, each in their place, each doing their best, to complete the domestic situation. This is the measure that the new cabinet should adopt. If so, the new cabinet will get a large number of talents, that is, they can be like fish in water and like tigers in the mountains, each covering their abilities. The ancients said: "Use their strengths, do not adhere to the rules." (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, August 13)

### Cotton Control Conference Sets New Cotton Purchase and Allocation Outline, to be Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan

The Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Council has held several meetings to discuss the purchase and implementation policies for new cotton this year.

It is stipulated that textile mills with 800 or more machines must join the Yarn Mill Association as members, and textile mills with less than 800 machines are small yarn mills. ○ Cotton allocation stipulates the quantity for military and civilian needs.

### Customs Director Talks About Preventing Customs Officials from Engaging in Malpractice, Hoping for Enthusiastic Assistance and Cooperation from All Sectors

Mr. Kurosawa Jiro, the director of the Jianghai Customs, met with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning and made the following statement: In order to prevent customs officials from engaging in illegal activities such as accepting bribes and selling positions, the Customs has issued a notice yesterday, hoping that all sectors will assist in reporting.

### Cooperation from All Sectors

Maintaining customs discipline and providing convenience to merchants within the possible scope is the consistent policy of the customs colleagues. This time, the work I initiated to prevent malpractice is a necessary measure. However, the current environment is special, and it cannot be achieved only by the efforts of the customs itself. In order to thoroughly prevent malpractice, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide sincere and enthusiastic cooperation to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If any sector discovers any improper incidents involving customs officials outside the Customs, or has any dissatisfaction with the Customs' administration, they can report to the Customs Director or one of the following official agencies in writing or orally. ○ Inspectors of the Anti-Smuggling Division of the Customs General Administration, ○ Chief of the Surveillance Section of this Customs, ○ The person in charge of the card office to which the case belongs, ○ Inspectors of the Surveillance Team of this Customs, ○ Police Chief of the Port Police Department of this Customs. Once the above personnel receive reports from all sectors, they have the responsibility to immediately forward the report to the Customs Director, report the facts, and be responsible for investigating the facts.

### Persons in Charge

The above items ○○○2 are the original organization of this Customs. Item 4, the Surveillance Team of this Customs, is a newly created organization of this Customs. Its purpose is to facilitate people from all walks of life to report to me. Sometimes, people from all walks of life often cannot write reports in time, or because the locations of the card offices are limited, they do not have enough time, thus losing the timeliness and opportunity to report, which is regrettable. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the organization of the Surveillance Team of this Customs was created. The selection of personnel was very cautious in advance, but it is not a fixed position. Every day, it is temporarily designated and assigned from the external and internal affairs staff to patrol and monitor the Customs and various card offices. All personnel on duty wear armbands with red backgrounds and white characters, with the words "[Jianghai Customs Surveillance Team]" to make it easy for all sectors to identify. The above item (1) is the Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration. Their patrol area is not limited to Shanghai. They often send personnel to various places and outports for inspection and patrol. Recently, the Customs established a surveillance team to strengthen the eradication of all inappropriate incidents in this Customs and various card offices and to facilitate the general merchants and people. I hope that all sectors will pay attention. In addition, the members of the Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration will also wear armbands with red backgrounds and white characters, with the words "[Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration]" to make it easy for the public to identify and accept reports from the outside world. I hope that all sectors will understand and pay attention to the above points, and give close cooperation and assistance. I am very grateful.

### Citywide Self-Defense Corps Members Begin Registration

The headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps of the City's Baojia has been established and has begun to register members of the citywide self-defense corps and compile rosters. The headquarters has printed member rosters and handed them over to the general Lianbao of each district to instruct the Bao chiefs (i.e., squad leaders) to be responsible for filling out five copies in a unified format, stamping them at each level, and submitting them. All men aged 18 to 45, regardless of whether they are serving in the military or should be exempt from service, must be reported without concealment or omission.

### Police Bureau Replaces Branch Office Section Chiefs

The City Police Bureau has adjusted and replaced the section chiefs of each branch office. Chen Jinzhang, the general affairs section chief of the Lao Zha Branch Office, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the Jing'an Temple Branch Office. The vacancy was filled by Wang Wenju, the police defense section chief of the Taishan Road Branch Office. Zhu Jihuang, the original Baojia section chief of the Jing'an Temple Branch Office, was transferred to the personnel section of the general affairs office. Wu Daozhen, the general affairs section chief of the Lujiawan Branch Office, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the Huashan Road Branch Office. Ma Zemin, the police defense section chief, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the bureau. Wang Lubai, the original Baojia section chief, was transferred to the general affairs section chief of the bureau. Qian Ruose, a second-class police officer of the Huangpu Branch Office, was transferred to the police defense section chief of the Lujiawan Branch Office.

### Savings Association Designs Savings Gift Certificates

Sending flower baskets and wreaths for relatives' weddings, funerals, and celebrations, and store openings consumes a great deal of material resources. In view of this, the Shanghai Special City Savings Association has formulated the "[Implementation Measures for Flower Basket and Wreath Replacement Certificates]" to save unnecessary consumption and has been approved by the Social Welfare Bureau for implementation. All Shanghai citizens who give flower baskets, wreaths, or commemorative scrolls, as well as silver shields, silver cups, or framed mirrors and other physical gifts for relatives' weddings, funerals, and celebrations, should uniformly send replacement certificates (or savings gift certificates) in accordance with the provisions of these measures. The replacement certificates are divided into the following types: (A) "Fu" character certificate, each with a face value of 2,000 yuan in national currency; (B) Special certificate, each with a face value of 1,000 yuan in national currency; (C) Type A certificate, each with a face value of 500 yuan in national currency; (D) Type B certificate, each with a face value of 100 yuan in national currency. The styles and sizes of various replacement certificates are designed by the Shanghai Special City Savings Association and reported to the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau for approval. Various social groups, newspapers, banks, money houses, and shops in Shanghai may print and sell them in accordance with the format. When the certificate holder comes to the original issuing office to exchange it for cash, it should be paid in full according to the face value of the certificate and should not create additional items to deduct commissions.

### This Period's Sugar Purchase Coupons to be Sold with Joint Allocation Tickets

The 15th period's sugar ration will be sold on the 23rd. However, the authorities now stipulate that within the old First District, purchases will be made with joint allocation tickets. Because the numbers of the various retailers are different, at the beginning of this reform, there are concerns that citizens may not know the store addresses of the numbers on their tickets. The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has printed a list of store names, addresses, and sales numbers for distribution to each store for citizens to inquire.

The 22 graduating students of this year's agricultural science department were urged by all parties to start serving in the summer vacation of this year, but only met a quarter of the requirements of all parties. Regarding the advance service of some before the summer vacation, considering the very rapid progress of all parties on the production increase movement, after discussion with the professors, we recognized the importance of practice. At the beginning of this semester, we specially appointed Lu Xijun as the dean of the College of Agriculture of our university. Also, considering that some students are very interested in the study of law, we established a Department of Law in addition to the Department of Political Economy, and invited Xu Weizhen, the former president of the High Court, as the director.

Short comment

### Please Negotiate with the French Tram Company

This time, the French Tram Company increased fares arbitrarily without the approval of the authorities, reaching as much as 150 percent. We will not discuss whether trams are public utilities and should not increase fares suddenly, even from the point of view of not being approved, the company's authorities have disregarded the dignity of the law, which is already undisguised. This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers expressing great dissatisfaction with the French Tram Company's illegal measures and unreasonable price increases, which shows that public opinion cannot be underestimated. At the same time, the amount overcharged by the company due to price increases in the five days from the 15th to the 19th is equal to all of the company's income for seven and a half days on weekdays. This money is the citizens' sweat and blood, and the company is not allowed to take it illegally. It should be requested that the municipal government negotiate to recover it, and under the principle of [taken from the people, used for the people], it should be used as student aid funds for poor citizens' children. We agree with the readers' suggestion that the company's overcharge of fares without approval is illegal income and should be handed over in full for social welfare and charitable undertakings. We urgently hope that the authorities will negotiate according to law to maintain the authority of the law.

### University Student Forum

After this newspaper held three education forums for universities, middle schools, and primary schools on the 4th, 6th, and 8th of this month, in order to review the future study direction with the student aid recipients of this newspaper, a university student forum was held at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month. More than 50 university students from various aided schools attended, and the forum was still chaired by Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The main points of the record are as follows: Huang Jingwan: Students, today's university student forum is the first collective conversation between this newspaper and the aided students since the student aid movement. Looking at the atmosphere of today's meeting, I deeply feel the bright future of everyone. There are very few gatherings of university students nowadays, and it is especially not easy to gather together and speak freely today. This newspaper has always been very concerned about the depression of young people, and has been running student aid for seven sessions. Seeing you - the seeds of the nation - wandering on divergent paths, we have been trying our best to protect you at all times. Fortunately, with the assistance of all sectors of society, although the work has not yet reached the ideal level, we are willing to stand on the same line with you with the ideal of running a joint university. Today is a very rare opportunity, and I hope everyone will give full play to it, but before the meeting, there is one thing to report, that is, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the former director of the student aid fund committee of this newspaper, has now passed away. Mr. Zhang was very enthusiastic about student aid work during his lifetime, and we should silently commemorate Mr. Zhang today. Shen Youqian: Our student aid fund office often hears and sees verbal and written thanks from aided students. In addition to conveying our thanks to the donors, we deeply feel that verbal or written thanks are unnecessary and insufficient. On the donor's side, what they hope for is not thanks, but results. Therefore, good grades and results are the most meaningful and valuable gratitude. On the student's side, [the ancient scholars studied for themselves, and the present scholars study for others]. The good or bad of our grades is certainly not specially prepared for others to see, but we should not disappoint the society, but should use the effect to encourage and strengthen the sympathy of the society. I hope everyone will keep this in mind. Regarding today's forum, I hope everyone will speak freely, without having to stipulate a topic. Everyone can talk freely about various issues related to the student aid movement and education. First The use of books and instruments by university students Huang Jingwan: At present, everything is expensive, and university students have a heavy burden for books and instruments in addition to tuition fees. They are both expensive and scarce, and difficult to buy. Everyone may wish to discuss this. Hou Renmin: The books used by universities are mostly of a specialized nature, and the printing bureaus are almost limited to one or two, so it is easy to have a situation where people in and out of the industry hide in seclusion and act strangely. Please ask your newspaper to take a stand in the public opinion field and expose it based on the facts. Xu : University books are often needed for reference outside of professors' classes, such as manuals, etc. Furthermore, specialized books are often annotated, so borrowing is really difficult. In addition to hoping that bookstores will publish and sell more, we also hope that major libraries will circulate more rare or out-of-print reference books. Regarding instruments, we hope that universities can [communicate with each other] and borrow from each other to make up for deficiencies. Ji Chuanbao: University books are mostly pirated, and it is very difficult to find old books. I hope your newspaper will run a book lending service or an old book service agency, either borrowing or selling, to avoid unscrupulous merchants monopolizing and profiting. Xue Guangqi: The difficulty of using books is first that they are too expensive, and second that there are too few. To remedy this, there are two methods that can be promoted: ○Please contact bookstores and give special discounts to student aid students. ○Please allow student aid students to read for free or at half price at major libraries, and increase academic books Second Work-study issues Huang Jingwan: Work-study issues are very important at present. First, it can solve part of the living problem, and second, it can implement the proposition of integrating knowledge and action. What are your difficulties and feelings about work-study? Please express your opinions. Gu Zenan: The work-study of university students is mostly as tutors or part-time teachers in middle schools. There are two difficulties: ○It is very difficult to find service opportunities. Please ask your newspaper's social service department to assist in solving this. ○Tutors are often not valued in terms of concept, resulting in meager treatment. Middle schools also pay low wages for university students to teach part-time. These are all incorrect in terms of concept. Please ask your newspaper to advocate valuing work-study. Yang Kaibao: On the student's side, the difficulties of work-study are the conflict of time and the incompatibility of interests. It is best for those who study engineering to work in factories, and those who study accounting to work in stores, so that studying and practice can be integrated. However, this is probably very difficult. In the industrial and commercial circles, university students seem to be not very welcome because of their lower ability to handle affairs. Hou Renmin: I hope your newspaper will run voluntary schools so that university students have service opportunities. Xu 槑: Xu My school has heavy homework, and work-study is very difficult for the sake of health. Furthermore, the school curriculum cannot take into account the actual situation. The root cause is still the problem of the education system. The following turns to page 4

### University Student Forum

Continued from page 3 Third University textbooks and internship issues Huang Jingwan: At present, many of the textbooks used by various schools are too old or impractical, and textbooks and internships or experiments cannot be connected. What are your opinions? Xue Guangqi: The books used by universities now are mostly in Western languages, which makes reading difficult, and their content is often not in line with national conditions. In the past, major bookstores such as Commercial Press and China Bookstore compiled university books, but now they have stopped. However, I hope that the publishing industry will reorganize. Gua Shifan: Many universities only pay attention to theory and not to practice, which is very unreasonable. I hope your newspaper will promote the establishment of experimental rooms or training factories. Gu Zenan: Internships in science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture are important, but equipment is difficult. I hope that universities will unite and break the [separate administrations] situation. Schools can borrow instruments from each other to make up for deficiencies, and I hope that schools will contact factories, hospitals, and farms. Pu Desen: The curriculum of many schools is often impractical and does not meet the interests of students, which is a waste of time. For example, those who study law can cancel the course of Western General History. Huang Jingwan: The curriculum is formulated after careful consideration by the education authorities and experts, and cannot be chosen or discarded differently because of the students' preferences. Shen Youqian: It is true that reading should be specialized, but a person with knowledge in addition to professional knowledge is also very important. High-rise buildings can never be built on a very small foundation, so specialization and breadth should be both sides. Ye Quankun: At present, the curriculum of various schools is too focused on the British and American systems. I hope that experienced scholars and professors will re-compile textbooks that are suitable for national conditions and practical. Fourth University students' food, lodging, and health issues Huang Jingwan: Due to the rising cost of living, university students often have very difficult food and lodging, and their health is affected by the lack of proper rest. Sound knowledge resides in a sound body, and health is the foundation of all undertakings. This newspaper's student aid fund takes health as one of the screening criteria, and I hope that everyone will pay more attention. Yang Kaibao: Regarding diet, I advocate establishing more economic cafeterias and applying for special rations for rice and coal, with economy and nutrition as the premise. If this can be done, the benefits will be great. Gui Shifan: Sometimes it is inconvenient because of transportation, especially now that there are fewer trams. If there is no bicycle, it is very inconvenient to go home for lunch. It is best for the authorities to distribute bread to students. Huang Jingwan: At the same time, we should advocate washing cold rice with boiled water and bringing meals, which can be much more convenient. Xu 槑: Regarding health, I hope your newspaper will hold health and medical lectures to instill health knowledge. Ji Chuanshi: Many students in various schools lack exercise because they are busy with their studies, so it is also important to promote exercise. Gui Shifan: Please ask your newspaper to hold free health checkups. Weng Ludi: To be healthy, exercise is very important. Please contact Jingwu Gymnastics Association and YMCA to give preferential treatment to students. Gu Zenan: Due to the heavy homework and poor equipment, myopia has become an epidemic among university students. Some schools often have classes after six or seven o'clock, and the brightness of the lights is not suitable, so myopia is very common. Fifth How should aided students contact each other and contact the student aid organization Huang Jingwan: This newspaper has been running student aid for seven sessions, but the contact and organization with students from various schools have not been ideal, so the efficiency cannot be improved. At the same time, there is often no contact between aided students from various schools or aided students from various grades in the same school. Now, please provide your opinions on the contact methods. Ye Quankun: We earnestly hope that your newspaper will hold the following events: ○Research seminar. ○Career guidance. ○Life guidance. Ji Chuanshi: During the summer vacation, your newspaper held academic lectures, and the students benefited a lot. We hope to continue to run them and strengthen the content. Zuo Shudong: Many of the problems discussed today, as well as the many problems that everyone has thought about but have not yet discussed, are all because one problem has not been solved, so they have become problems. This one problem is the problem of contact, contact between students, and contact between students and student aid organizations or society. I hope that there can be a kind of spiritual or work connection. Shen Youqian: This opinion is very good. In the past, we felt that we could not understand the needs of the students in detail, so we hope that you students will automatically establish such a contact mechanism. Ji Chuanshi: Taking advantage of today's good opportunity, I propose to organize a Shanghai Newspaper Student Aid University Student Fellowship to strengthen the contact between students or between students and student aid organizations. I wonder if you agree? (The whole body passed) Huang Jingwan: In addition to strengthening the organization of special student aid students, we express our approval of your organization. (All the university students present elected eight unit representatives to be responsible for preparing to organize the fellowship, and finally Xu 槑 from Jiaotong University sang the Huaye Song, and everyone dispersed happily)

### Houletang Generously Donates 100,000 Yuan for Medical Aid Fund

The owner of Houletang, with a heart of hunger and thirst, and a desire for charity, generously donated 100,000 yuan to this office's medical aid fund yesterday. I am deeply moved by this, and on behalf of the poor and sick who will benefit, I would like to express my gratitude. The purpose of this office's medical aid fund is to relieve the poor and sick and relieve suffering. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will follow suit and donate continuously to benefit the poor and sick. Also, Mr. Zhang of Zhide Hall, Sun Mei, Xie Tianxi, Yan Guangyong, and Cai Zhao's, each donated a large sum of money to respond to the midwifery aid, benefiting poor women, which is very commendable.

### Donating Baofu Method

The number of copies of the Baofu Method sold by this office since it was reprinted has been less than a hundred. It was disclosed by this office a few days ago, and we respectfully ask charitable gentlemen to donate funds to print it so that the book will not go out of print. Afterwards, the owner of Kuqi sent 3,000 copies, each of which is still sold for 10 yuan, and the income is used to subsidize the poor. The owner of Kuqi has donated the Baofu Method three times. In addition, Mr. Zhang Shuchui of Nanyang Sock Factory sent 2,000 copies of the pocket-sized Baofu Method, each of which is actually sold for 5 yuan, and instructed that after they are sold out, the proceeds will also be donated to subsidize the poor. The two gentlemen are tireless in charity, and we are deeply grateful.

### Etiquette and Charity

Last month, Mr. Liang Shaowen of China Store held a funeral for his wife, Ms. Ouyang. Mr. Liang's relatives and friends appreciated his will and converted all the funeral gifts into cash, donating 213,500 yuan in China Storage Certificates to the First Tuberculosis Hospital of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to fund free anti-tuberculosis work. Ms. Wu Minfang celebrated her 30th birthday, and because it was an extraordinary time, she did not care about extravagance. However, because of the gifts from friends, she felt that it would be disrespectful to refuse. Considering that many poor children are out of school, especially the Lianyi Righteous School is short of funds, she specially allocated all the received gift money, totaling 50,000 yuan in storage coins, to the school's expenses.

### Thunder and Rain (5)

That might be a human torpedo. Absolutely not. Our Japanese Navy would never adopt such an inhumane and unreasonable method. When Commander Togo blockaded Lushun, the use [of torpedoes] was permitted because the torpedo boats could accommodate crew members. Therefore—

Special Attack Squads are inseparable, clinging tightly to each other. Thus, Takao felt it wasn't right and went to Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada's room.

[Can you paint it? Please tell me the details!]

He simply painted the attack on Pearl Harbor and felt he was letting down the brave warriors of the Special Attack Squad, so he wanted to paint the Special Attack Squad.

[It's not the right time yet.]

Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada said crisply, then turned his body and busily operated the switchboard.

Takao listlessly returned to his room.

Soon, 1941, forever etched in Japanese history, passed.

And a new year, brewing with grand hopes, descended.

The New Year's Day was very clear, but bitterly cold. In his apartment, Takao burned glutinous rice cakes sent from his hometown in a brazier and celebrated his twenty-fourth New Year.

Suddenly, he thought of Mahito.

(Where is Mahito eating glutinous rice cakes? Where is he welcoming his twenty-fourth New Year?)

In the same year, from the same hometown, the same south, Mahito, whom he hadn't seen, especially at New Year's, inevitably made him miss him. Moreover, since the Greater East Asia War began, he hadn't even received a postcard. Takao had completely forgotten about his sister's marriage and now only missed his close friend.

The New Year holiday was over, the work day arrived, and he began serving again every day.

Whenever he caught sight of Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada in the corridor, he always wanted to ask:

[Where is Lieutenant Taninaka? Of course, I can't say I want to know the name of the warship, but I just want to know if he is on the front line...]

But this was not allowed to be asked. Knowing things outside one's mission was a violation of naval rules. He couldn't forget that he had failed before when he wanted to paint the Special Attack Squad without orders.

So, Takao could not forget Mahito, yet had to forget him.

Because in late January, he received an order to paint the Battle of Endau, and in mid-February, he received an order to paint the Battle of Bali. These two naval battles, though small in scale in terms of formality, were in essence something our navy could be happy about. The former was a two-on-two gun battle between destroyers, resulting in a major Japanese victory. The opponent was a navy renowned throughout the world. The difference between enemy and our artillery skills was immediately proven by the results. The latter war was where two Japanese destroyers defeated two Dutch cruisers and five destroyers. The destroyer actually ate the cruiser's cat.

Takao felt a thrill in every cell and completed the two naval battle paintings with a cheerful mood. He didn't feel how bad it was. (143)
