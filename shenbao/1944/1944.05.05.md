### Current Issues for the Municipal Advisory Committee

The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee was officially established on the first of this month. According to general observations, citizens have expressed deep concern and anticipation for the future development of this new institution. Therefore, how should the Advisory Committee value its own tasks and fulfill its due responsibilities? This is indeed a question worthy of discussion.

Mayor Chen said: "The nature of the Advisory Committee is different from that of ordinary public opinion organs. Ordinary public opinion organs are somewhat opposed to the government in form, while the Advisory Committee is essentially integrated with the government. On the one hand, it can convey public opinion, and on the other hand, it can assist the government." Secondly, the first item of the principle decided on the organization of the committee is: "The task of the Advisory Committee is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities, and on the other hand, to extensively collect public opinion from the citizens and make suggestions to the municipal authorities."

What is "extensively collecting public sentiment"? It means actively conveying reasonable demands and reasonable hopes of the citizens to the authorities, hoping that the authorities will fully consider them and accept them for implementation as much as possible. What is "reporting the situation below"? It means passively striving to reduce unnecessary suffering of the people during the war, especially the illegal oppression and extortion suffered by the citizens in the past. It is necessary to represent and request the government to eliminate the illegal oppression and extortion of citizens by public institutions and prevent it from happening again in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will report to the Advisory Committee as much as possible when they suffer illegal oppression and extortion based on loyalty.

Secondly, although the Advisory Committee is not a formal public opinion organ, its position is not opposed to the government. However, in this wartime, even formal public opinion organs should not be opposed to the government, because the entire purpose of public opinion organs in wartime is to communicate the opinions of officials and the people, so as to work together harmoniously, generate united strength, and contribute to the war, in order to ensure victory. The Advisory Committee should not only report the situation below, but also convey the government's intentions to the citizens, fulfilling its responsibility of communication. What we can tell the citizens is the bright and frank attitude expressed by Mayor Chen in his address at the establishment of the Advisory Committee. He said: "I hope that you will all know everything and say everything, and I hope that you will not only not act, but also hope to act together. And I myself will only know everything and act with all my strength. Even if my strength is insufficient, I should persevere and encourage each other."

We believe that the first thing to be solved in Shanghai's municipal administration is the financial problem. How to reorganize tax revenue, how to abolish the tax farming system, how to ensure that tax revenue and public funds are not privately pocketed by middlemen, even if the tax farming system cannot be abolished immediately in the reform process, it should also adopt open bidding methods to prevent monopoly contracting. After the financial reorganization, it will inevitably increase revenue and enrich funds, and then the salaries and expenses of public officials, security teams, police, etc. will be fully increased, so as to stabilize their lives. If it is still insufficient, it is better to make up for it by increasing taxes. But what can be used for the benefit of the citizens should be used for the welfare of the citizens; what is taken from the land should be used for the welfare of the local area. Even if it increases the burden on the citizens, it will definitely be supported. Therefore, reorganizing finances and enriching funds can ensure public security and exert overall strength. This is an important issue in the current municipal administration, and it is also an important issue for the Municipal Advisory Committee to assist the government.

Finally, we still hope that the formal public opinion organs will be established as soon as possible, and will not be delayed or blocked due to the establishment of the Advisory Committee. On the one hand, because the central government is not established first, the local governments cannot be established alone. Therefore, we especially hope that the central public opinion organs will be established as soon as possible.

### The Focal Point of the Second European Front

It has been three months since Eisenhower was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force.

During these three months, their main task was to concentrate on bombing the European continent, mainly Germany. Churchill honestly told in his speech at the end of February that "the current Anglo-American air raids on Germany are the basis for the upcoming invasion of Europe." Therefore, paying attention to the trend of bombing Europe is an important key to calculating the start date of the second front.

The bombing by the Anglo-American air force, which has intensified since the large-scale indiscriminate bombing of Berlin at the end of last year, continues day and night despite suffering heavy damage. Especially since February 19, its scale has become even larger.

Take the example of bombing Berlin: the number of aircraft participating in one day reached 1,000, and the number of crew members, including fighter pilots, totaled 12,000. The number of headquarters staff and ground service personnel involved in this attack reached 50,000. In one bombing, 10,000 bombs and 350,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Berlin.

Even if this propaganda is halved, it can be seen how they are committed to indiscriminate bombing. Their attempt is obviously to use this bombing to consume the German air force's defense capabilities, destroy military bases, supply lines, and military production capacity, and reduce resistance during the invasion as much as possible.

Various military activities on the British mainland, the base for the invasion of Europe, are also gradually showing this posture. For example, the general mobilization of transportation capacity, the traffic ban on the east coast of England. The concentration of troops in southern England, the frequent traffic of convoys, and the massive air transport of American aircraft. Of course, such frank statements of military secrets can also be regarded as a means of propaganda, making everyone feel that the invasion of Europe is imminent, but we cannot but believe that there is some truth in it.

Landing Time and Location

So, when exactly will the landing take place? Of course, it is impossible to answer correctly that it will be on a certain day of a certain month. This often depends on a relative factor, that is, the strength of Germany's defensive posture. Therefore, it is not only the defensive power of the Atlantic Wall, but also the trend of the "European Air War" that has a decisive influence. The stronger the German air force's interception, the more the invasion of Europe will have to be delayed.

In addition, the war situation on the Eastern Front and political changes should also be considered. Broadly speaking, Germany's war power is the direct factor.

So, if the landing really takes place, where will it be? Regarding this question, the observations of so-called "armchair strategists" are divergent and inconclusive. But from the recent trend, their target is in the English Channel area, northern France. The Anglo-Americans know that this is a risky move, and its success or failure will determine the final victory or defeat. If they really want to invade Europe, it is meaningless not to send troops to the main battlefield closest to Germany itself. From the point of view of maritime transportation, the distance of the English Channel is only 35 kilometers, and recently it has been particularly mentioned that the main battlefield should be within the range of action of the base fighter planes. This is because it is an indispensable factor to use large-scale air force to gain air supremacy to try to land, and to fight against German interceptor planes.

The recent bombing has been concentrated in the Calais area of northern France. The German army's defense in this area is a great threat to the transportation operation in the English Channel, and the enemy must find a way to destroy it first.

From these attempts, the so-called English Channel coast, from Dunkirk in the north to Boulogne, Abbeville in the south, will become the first landing candidate site for the invasion of Europe.

A Glimpse of the Southern Italian Front

Speaking of the Southern Italian Front, according to recent secret reports, the Alexander Army is being strengthened and is closely linked to the Chetnik regime in Yugoslavia, and the situation in the Balkans is also becoming tense. But these can all be regarded as side operations of the Second Front.

But no matter what, the German side has already made preparations for this. Field Marshal Rundstedt has 700,000 troops stationed along the Atlantic coast from Norway to the French-Italian border. The second European fortress, the second line of defense of the Atlantic Wall, which was built after fully studying the enemy's strategy, has also been completed. Therefore, the enemy's attempt, I don't believe, can be easily realized. (翔: Translated from the April 5th issue of Asahi Pictorial)

### Berlin Mayor Goebbels' Speech

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) German News Agency News: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, in his capacity as the newly appointed Mayor of Berlin, delivered a speech at the recollection of various administrative departments and institutions in Berlin, saying: "I am now taking over this position at a time when the German capital is undergoing difficult training. Since 1943, although the enemy has continued to advance, they have ultimately failed to make the people of the German capital frustrated. This is because the people of Berlin and the leading institutions have a commendable attitude. When the reconstruction work of Berlin is completed, there will be vast and healthy workers' residences, as well as beautiful streets and buildings. After these streets are built, the reputation Berlin has gained in this difficult training will continue to exist, and the damage it has suffered will be forgotten early. Once peace is restored, Berlin will face a great task. The German capital, from a spiritual point of view, is the leader of the capital cities of various countries, and at that time it will contribute all its energy to the future task."

### Japanese Army Crosses the Yellow River, Occupies Various Key Points, Captures汜水, 榮陽 and 密縣

Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) On the night of April 17, part of the Japanese army crossed the Great Yellow River, defeated the Yu army at the heights southwest of Luwangcheng, and advanced westward from the south bank of the Yellow River. At 11:00 am on the 31st, they occupied the key point 汜水 and captured 榮陽 and 密縣. They broke through the mountainous area and launched a surprise attack on the enemy troops who were stubbornly resisting in the southern highlands.

Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese army in North China suddenly began to act together on April 18. They crossed the Yellow River from the bridgehead of the Great Yellow River, Bawangcheng, and several locations near Zhongmu on the north bank of the New Yellow River, and divided into several columns, forcing their way to the great plain of Henan. With the cooperation of the air force, they launched a fierce attack on the troops under Tang Enbo, a direct descendant of the Yu Central Army. Since the start of the new operation, after only ten days, they have successively occupied Zhengzhou, 榮陽, 汜水, and the key point of the Pinghan Road, Xinzheng. The important areas of Xuchang and other places are now beginning to carry out mobile operations, and the Yu army is retreating and fleeing in a hurry. According to the report, the Japanese army first gathered near Zhongmu on the north bank of the Yellow River. On the 18th, they eliminated the strong resistance of the Yu army's Provisional 17th Division, about 4,000 people, who were guarding the position on the bank of the New Yellow River, and crossed the Yellow River. The Yu army immediately retreated and fled. A part of the Japanese army that attacked westward occupied Guodian (20 kilometers south of Zhengzhou) on the evening of the 19th, and then encircled the 110th Division (Division Commander Liao Yunze) of the Yu Central Army, which was stationed behind Zhengzhou. They broke into the south gate of the city at 10:00 am on the 20th and occupied it. The Japanese army, which attacked towards Huangji Jianzuozhen, after defeating the newly formed 29th Division (Division Commander Lv Gongliang) and the newly formed 46th Division under the newly formed 15th Army of the Yu army, also captured Weishi Xinzheng. On the 1st, they occupied all of Xuchang. On the night of the 19th, the Japanese army, advancing from Bawangcheng on the Great Yellow River, defeated the 11th Division (Division Commander Jiang Dangchi) of the Provisional 15th Army and the 117th Division (Division Commander Chen Shurui) of the 96th Army of the Yu army on the banks of the Yellow River. On the 21st, they occupied 榮陽 and 汜水 and entered 密縣. Therefore, the first line of defense in Henan formed by the Yu army in 榮陽 and 密縣 completely collapsed. The Japanese army occupied the important area of Xuchang. At the same time, one deputy army commander and two division commanders of the Yu army were killed in action. The commander of the 85th Army was also wounded. Therefore, the forward troops of the Yu army were also in a state of chaos.

### Enemy Aircraft and Warships Heavily Damaged South of the Carolines

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported that the enemy mobile unit that appeared on the sea south of the Caroline Islands on April 30 attacked the Truk Islands on April 30 and May 1, and shelled the Mortlock Islands on May 1. After the Japanese air force launched a fierce attack on it, the results of the battle were announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 2nd. It was reported that one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed, one was damaged, and more than 30 enemy aircraft were shot down. However, after a subsequent investigation, it was clarified that the enemy's losses were even greater. The number of enemy aircraft shot down has been revised to 75 shot down and 25 destroyed.

### Companies Re-register, Deadline is End of the Month

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that after the deadline for company re-registration at the end of November last year, many companies still stated reasons for failing to apply within the time limit and requested registration for license renewal. After considering a flexible solution, all those who have been approved for establishment registration and licensed in the past should follow the procedures for establishment registration according to the Company Law, but are exempt from the filing of verification procedures and directly submit to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and license renewal. The implementation period is limited from now until the end of April of this year. For the sake of actual implementation, the period has now expired. There are many who comply with the application, but it is inevitable that some are delayed due to the long distance, lack of procedures, and failure to apply. In order to give extra consideration to the difficulties of merchants, the implementation period of the aforementioned changes will be extended again until the end of May of this year. After the deadline, there will be no further extension. If they still fail to apply within the deadline, it will be considered a voluntary waiver. The registration license they hold should be deemed invalid from June 1, losing the qualification of a legal person of the company and stopping the use of the company name to restrict them.

### Sweden Holds Large-Scale Exercises

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: A large-scale national defense exercise was held in the central eastern coastal area of Sweden for about a week last month.

### Soviets Continue to Attack in the Middle Reaches of the Siret River, Germans Believe it is a Prelude to a Major Battle

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) After the Soviet army launched a new offensive in the middle reaches of the Siret River in eastern Romania on the 2nd, the German authorities explained the battle situation in the area on the 3rd as follows: On the 2nd, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the middle reaches of the Siret River area with a large number of infantry divisions and about 350 tanks. The focus of the Soviet army's attack was on both sides of the Siret River and the Târgu Frumos area (west of Iași). The Soviet army continuously attacked the German-Romanian positions between Pașcani and Târgu Frumos along the Iași-Chișinău railway line. At the same time, they attempted to enter and exit the cities of Roman and Piatra Neamț and reach the foothills of the Carpathians, but the Axis forces defended the vertical and horizontal positions in that area and repelled them. On the 1st, the Soviet army dispatched a total of 350 tanks to launch an offensive. As a result of the fierce attack by the German-Romanian air force, the Soviet tank group suffered a devastating blow, with more than 240 tanks lost. At the same time, in that battle, the German air force shot down 32 Soviet aircraft, and the German army lost 3 aircraft. After the failure of the Soviet army's attack on the 1st, it did not stop its attempts. It continued to attack on the morning of the 3rd. Although it cannot be determined that this battle is the beginning of a major Soviet offensive, it can at least be regarded as a prelude to a major offensive. In addition, the front line southwest of Kovel has gradually become active. The vanguard of the large Soviet troops assembled in that area has begun to approach the German positions.

### Soviets Will Attack Along Three Routes

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) Regarding the war situation on the Eastern Front, although the Soviet Information Bureau once said: There have been no major changes in the twelve days since April 22, but a comprehensive review of the front-line news from the German and Soviet armies knows that the time for the decisive battle is gradually approaching. According to Reuters Moscow News, the future Soviet offensive will have the following three routes: The first is to attack the three Baltic countries in a southwestern direction from the northern front. The second is to attack Warsaw from Minsk on the central front. The third is to pass through the Carpathian Mountains and Romania, and form a pincer attack on the Balkans. According to military observers, the second point is the most likely. During the third winter battle, because there were no large-scale battles on the central front, the large salient area in front of Minsk, which maintained the area from Bobruisk to Mogilev, still belonged to the German army. In order to defeat the German army in this salient area, the Soviet army advanced from Narva towards Lithuania, and covered the offensive of the captured front line from the side. According to recent German news, the Soviet army is currently gathering a large number of troops on the central front and actively preparing for war. The Soviet army is responding to the deployment of the Second Front in Western Europe and mobilizing such a large army, it is conceivable that its intention is to challenge the German army. According to German news, the German army mobilized German labor teams and soldier teams a few days ago to build solid fortress lines in the main war zones on the Eastern Front. The fortress lines were built with reference to the Atlantic fortresses. The German army is waiting for the opportunity to crush the Soviet offensive according to this new defense line.

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Communists attempted to incite a general strike here, but it was unsuccessful. The Communists distributed leaflets yesterday to incite a general strike, but the workers ignored them and continued to work as usual.

### Palel Encircled on Three Sides; Thousands of Enemy Troops' Retreat Cut Off; Japanese Artillery Inflicts Heavy Damage

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese base on the Burma front reports: The elite of the Indian National Army on the Kaladan front, after breaking through Taung Bazaar and entering the territory of the motherland, has become increasingly vigorous. Recently, they continued to advance towards the Mayu Mountains and have achieved great results. In addition, the Japanese and Indian forces on that front have also made great progress.

Rangoon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese and Indian allied forces have occupied the high ground north of Palel and have now completely occupied Chakur, southeast of the high ground. They continue to attack the enemy's defensive positions in Laiching and Leibanklei and other places north of Palel, defeating the enemy in one fell swoop and threatening their retreat. As a result, about 3,000 enemy troops in Senam, Kataklam, Kataklam, Kankuno and other places east of Palel were attacked on three sides by the Japanese and Indian allied forces, and their retreat was completely cut off, forcing them to form a circular formation and resist reluctantly. At dawn one day, hundreds of people were dispatched, with tanks taking the lead in an attempt to open a bloody path. The Japanese artillery opened fire and bombarded them, and after thirty minutes of fierce fighting, inflicted heavy damage on them, completely shattering their attempt.

### New Economic Advisor Ogura Expresses His Thoughts

Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, and Aoki, the Chief Economic Advisor, left for Nanjing on the 3rd after staying in Shanghai for a week. Advisor Aoki met with reporters on the afternoon of the 2nd to express his thoughts and aspirations as follows:

What we expect from China is the confidence they hold. In this era of international trade stagnation, the Chinese economy cannot rely on foreign countries. It should make full use of its abundant domestic resources to achieve good results. This is the attitude that the Chinese economic circles should adopt. I will frequently travel between Shanghai and Nanjing in the future to convey the opinions of the Shanghai economic circles to the National Government, in order to achieve close ties between the economic circles of Shanghai and Nanjing. The so-called new policies towards China and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty will gradually be realized. I believe that issues such as Shanghai's price countermeasures, currency recovery, increased production, and control methods should be resolved comprehensively. At the same time, the prerequisite for currency recovery should be to increase production first. Furthermore, Advisors Ogura and Aoki will set up advisor residences in Shanghai so that one of them can be stationed in Shanghai permanently.

### The Rent Arbitration Committee Bans Disguised Rent Increases

### The Central Reserve Bank Abandons General Commercial Banking Business to Strengthen its Position as a National Bank

In view of the rising prices in recent years, the Central Reserve Bank has repeatedly supervised its fellow banks to rectify their operations in its capacity as a national bank, in order to curb speculation and hoarding and suppress prices. On the one hand, it also seeks to address the root cause by focusing on increasing production. In March of this year, it formulated points to note for lending to fellow banks and sent a circular to all banks and money shops through its Financial Affairs Inspection Office, requiring them to comply with the regulations for adjusting the market and lending to fellow banks when necessary: (A) The use of funds must absolutely adopt a mortgage system, and the assets and liabilities of each fellow bank should be reviewed and its limit set. Each fellow bank may apply for loans for these funds and use them for various industrial and commercial sectors at any time, or retain them for their own emergency use. (B) Production loans should be based on re-mortgaging by fellow banks. A separate limit should also be set in accordance with the previous provision. The selection of production loans, the borrower's purpose, collateral, the quantity of raw materials purchased, the production situation, the quantity of product sales inventory, and the production capacity should be thoroughly investigated and supervised. If it is discovered that the borrower is misreporting production or that the borrowed funds are not used for direct production, they should be immediately recovered and severely punished. Since the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the bank has gradually reduced its general commercial loans, and production funds can be balanced and adjusted. It is also heard that in order to strengthen the bank's position as a national bank, where the financial institutions in the locations of its various branches and offices are generally organized and sound, the bank has abandoned the business of general commercial banks.

### A Record of Japanese Soldiers on the Indian Front Fighting Against Nature

The operations on the Indian front are also a battle against nature. Rivers, grass, trees, the moon, and wild beasts change their original appearance when combined with war.

Water

The Japanese soldiers advancing into India sought both the enemy and water. In the dense forest area of the northern Arakan Mountains, with the arrival of the dry season, everything became dry and arid. After the rainy season, not a single drop of rain fell for half a year. During this dry season, all animals desperately sought water. It was crucial not to urinate in the dense forest, as leopards, craving water, would approach from afar.

From Gonedi Pike to the Indo-Burmese border of Dunzain, and to Jika, the two areas of Surajpur in India had only a few water sources within several square miles. Clear water gurgled out from deep mountain valleys hundreds or even miles away from the positions. This water had to be divided among the units, and the amount used each day was fixed. In the battle near the Poshi White fortress, which reached an altitude of 8,000 feet, the battle lines were drawn around the water source for several days. The enemy took water during the day, while we took water at night, taking turns using the same water source. A sign was written on the steep slope saying, "A beauty is not far from here." Several comrades sacrificed themselves for transporting water and searching for water sources.

Grass

Grass is not food, but it can be eaten. Crossing three mountains also makes it taste good. Grass leaves and tree bark, these forest vegetables, are common knowledge on the front lines. The nature of trees and the types of green grass have turned the soldiers on the Indian front into botanists.

Moon

The moon is bright, illuminating the mountain peaks and streams. Half of the month is illuminated by the bright moon. On moonlit nights, enemy bombers attacked precisely on schedule. Even the commander of the rapidly advancing Japanese northern unit said to his soldiers, "How comfortable is the dark night!" So they marched in the dark. The moon, how unfavorable it is to the transport units! The moon, the shadow of surprise troops, the moon, the benchmark of all operations, gives light to the front lines, but no matter how beautiful the moon is, in the Indian operations, it will change its face, not only having no effect but hindering progress.

Wild Beasts

On the way to India, elephants, horses, oxcarts, wild goats, and dogs participated in the teams. Each animal had its own task. The labor of elephants never exceeded four hours a day, and they were left in the dense forest for the remaining twenty hours to eat a hundred bananas. But when they worked, they could carry 120 kilograms of weight at a time and travel twenty miles. The elephant herds dragging artillery and transporting luggage, and the ox teams, unfazed by the bursting shells, were often used for transport and food, crossing the dense forest with the Japanese army and entering India.

This topic of the animal front extends to the wild beasts living on the Indo-Burmese border. Sentries or advancing units often encountered tigers or leopards. Some units hunted elephant calves and ate their meat, while others dared not eat it. Moreover, where people gathered, crows gathered. As the saying goes, "Where crows gather, the enemy is there." This was even more convincing here. In the Indian battlefield, the enemy was also used by us. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, April 15th.)

### Enemy Wooden Aircraft Over Burma and India

The enemy British wooden "Mosquito" aircraft have recently been reported to appear over Burma. This aircraft is the most superior of the British military aircraft, possessing various special features. The British have boasted that it is "the world's fastest bomber. At the same time, it is second to none in any use, whether as a fighter, reconnaissance aircraft, or attack aircraft."

The biggest feature of this aircraft is that almost the entire body is made of wood. Its advantages are: Metal aircraft can be detected by radio wave weapons from two or three hundred kilometers away, but wooden aircraft, when flying, are not subject to the reflection of radio wave weapons, so they are an excellent surprise weapon. When metal resources are not available, wood can be used to replenish them. The manufacturing process is simple, and it can be mass-produced.

The aircraft has a wingspan of 16.51 meters, a total length of 12.43 meters, and a total height of 4.65 meters. The maximum speed is 605 kilometers per hour, and it can carry 900 kilograms of bombs. It can also fly for long periods at an altitude of 10,000 meters. In addition to being used as a bomber, it can also be used as a reconnaissance aircraft or attack aircraft, fully utilizing its characteristics. (Translated from the February issue of "Flying Boy")

### Erosion

— Xin Lu

In the misty drizzle, dusk quietly rushed into the house early. Mr. Pei wiped the lenses of his presbyopic glasses, straightened his hunched back, gently sighed, and buried his head again to read the express letter sent by his second daughter from his hometown today:

Dad:

Counting the days, it's spring, but the weather seems unable to turn around, still so bleak, with a wind blowing sharp and bone-chilling.

Mom still coughs and wheezes all night, sometimes coughing so hard that tears stream down her face, as if she is coughing up her intestines and stomach. Only when she coughs until her whole body is limp, does she regain a breath.

Grandma's body is getting worse and worse. Eating some thin porridge every day is of no use, but she is always worried about Dad, thinking about her older brother and sister-in-law, and remembering her sister. During the day, she still stubbornly supports herself to clean the house, asking me to stand and watch her. So, pretending to smile (but how can this be considered a smile?) she says to me: "Lifang: You have neglected half a year of your studies for Mom, go back to Dad, go back to school to study! Can't I take care of myself?"

Mom wants me to come back, she has realized that she is a candle flickering in the wind, which makes me feel very uncomfortable.

Prices in the countryside have risen two or three times more than at the end of last year, and it seems that the money on hand won't last many days.

Mr. Pei's heart was as heavy as an iron hammer. He didn't finish reading the letter, and tears had already fallen from his lenses. He tasted a true sorrow. He had worked hard for the cause of education for more than thirty years, and in the end, he only ended up with a fragmented family. In thirty years, he had educated countless disciples, but he could not support the education of his own children. Serving society for thirty years, he could not save his dying wife. For the sacred cause of education, he had shed all his blood and sweat for thirty years. But what reward did he get? His virtuous wife, who had accompanied him for twenty-nine years, had to watch helplessly as she was taken away by death because they didn't have the money to stay in a sanatorium or get air injections. His intelligent eldest daughter, Huifang, would also be forced into the vortex of the professional world to support the family. What the family had in abundance was a large group of children who appeared weak due to malnutrition.

Mr. Pei supported his chin with both hands, staring blankly at the dim corner of the house, letting sorrow devour him like a poisonous snake.

"Grandpa! Grandpa!" Yao'er approached his grandfather's knee, calling affectionately.

"Hmm! Good child! Are you home from school? Where's your brother?" Mr. Pei took off his glasses and touched his grandson's cheek.

"Brother is downstairs helping Mom make coal balls, it's fun! Rolling them round and round!" The child's excited words pierced the grandfather's heart. The fate of the third generation was even worse than that of the second generation.

"Dad!" Huifang came from school, with rain on her hair and her single shirt slightly wet, but her spirit was obviously very excited. "Look! This mouse is what I dissected myself in today's biology experiment class at school. The teacher said I have superb dissection skills. None of the small structures of the small animal's internal organs were damaged!" Saying that, she handed her masterpiece, with its limbs nailed to a cardboard, to her father to see.

Much to Huifang's disappointment, her father did not give her any praise, but only moved his lips and forced a kind smile full of fatigue.

Huifang couldn't help but shiver, feeling that the air in the house was a little strange today.

Sure enough, she saw a letter from Lifang from her hometown.

She quickly walked to the desk and woodenly fell into a chair beside her, silently reading the letter.

It had been half a year, and then she remembered the scene of her mother returning to her hometown to recuperate last autumn:

The night before going back, Mom decided to take her younger sister with her.

The next morning was a foggy and overcast day. Huifang, along with her father and brother, saw her off on the boat. Her brother had entrusted the luggage to Ah Rong, a fellow villager who worked as a waiter, in advance. When her mother's swaying figure disappeared into the crowd pushing and shoving into the cabin, Huifang suddenly felt a sense of emptiness, and her eyes blurred. She vaguely saw her mother turning her head back again. She anxiously forced a smile, thinking of this, Huangfang could not help but shed tears again.

Mr. Pei wanted to comfort his daughter, who was immersed in distress, but he couldn't think of a suitable word. In addition, another thing was troubling his mind: Should he tell Huifang? Her cousin had already introduced her to work as a bookkeeper at the ×× Enterprise Company.

Mr. Pei swallowed the words that had already rushed to the tip of his tongue several times. As a father, he seemed that he should not deprive his excellent daughter Huifang of her right to study. Since Huifang entered middle school, she had never paid tuition once. She received scholarships every term. Last year, when he went to Huifang's school, her homeroom teacher, Mr. Zhang, had praised Huifang in person: "This child is very talented and willing to work hard. If the teacher educates her well, she will have a bright future!"

So, Mr. Pei, with sad love, stood up and stroked Huifang's head with a hand full of affection: "Good child, you should have the right to receive education!"

Huifang was trying to understand the origin of her father's words, but she was inadvertently attracted by a piece of paper on the desk:

"Hereby introduce Ms. Pei Huifang to your company to take up a position. Please grant her a suitable position. Sincerely, ×× Enterprise Company, × General Manager ××, Ming Zhengsu"

On the other side was printed the word "Xie Xu."

"Dad: Cousin has been here?" Huifang was bewildered by the unexpected discovery.

"Yes! Your cousin said, this is... an opportunity. Being a bookkeeper is quite busy, but the company supplies food, and you can get more than a thousand yuan a month including allowances," Mr. Pei spat out these words with difficulty. He was afraid of hurting his daughter's heart.

"Tomorrow, just tomorrow, do I have to say goodbye to school?" Huifang asked herself this. This unexpected thing grabbed Huifang's heart.

"Is it really so soon that I have to say goodbye to school life?" Huifang asked herself repeatedly, almost in disbelief. She instinctively thought that this was impossible, but in order to reduce her father's burden, wasn't this a real opportunity? What's more, she had mentioned to her father about finding a job herself first.

She raised her head and looked at her old father, and noticed that the wrinkles on her father's face today seemed to be even deeper. Underneath this full head of white hair was a record of how much sadness he had accumulated! Her father taught thirty hours of classes a week and also worked as a tutor in two families, and he couldn't get three thousand yuan a month. Her father was too tired. In order to help her father reduce the burden on the family, she felt that besides agreeing, she was not allowed to have other considerations.

Huifang held back the tears in her eyes, suppressed her emotions, and tried to say in a cheerful tone: "Dad! Then I'll go to contact them tomorrow!"

In fact, her pale face could not hide her sad expression.

"Child! Dad has stifled your talent!" Mr. Pei stroked his daughter's drooping head with trembling hands.

"But I'm still young! If I work for a year or two, when the situation gets better, can't I still have time to study? Besides, studying doesn't necessarily have to be at school, I can study on my own," Huifang could only comfort her father with her confidence in the future.

After dinner, Mr. Pei corrected a stack of test papers and, as usual, called the children to sleep peacefully. Perhaps he didn't want to disturb Huifang's troubled thoughts today, so he exceptionally allowed his daughter to continue to ponder at her desk. The house became quiet, with only the sound of the pattering rain and the evening wind playing a tragic song.

Huifang began to caress her beloved schoolbag, inadvertently opening her test papers. She softly breathed a sigh of relief, "Goodbye, my dear partners, from tomorrow, I can't help but leave you and go to a new environment." She silently bid farewell to her books and test papers.

"I should go to work," Huifang thought: "If the company provides meals, the family can reduce one person's expenses. Besides, I can give some money to support the family every month when I get my salary." She thought that she could get a salary of one thousand yuan at the end of the month, which seemed to relieve the tight feeling in her heart a little, and she was planning how to use this one thousand yuan: send half of it to her mother in the countryside for treatment, leave the minimum amount of money, and give the rest to her father. However, she suddenly felt that she was thinking too far ahead, because she was leaving school tomorrow, which was almost unbelievable to her.

So the shadows of school life appeared vividly before Huifang's eyes:

Tomorrow is Friday again, and there will be a debate after class as usual. Every week begins with the academic affairs committee of the class deciding on a topic, and the students will participate on either side, collecting materials separately. During the debate, they each repeatedly extended their arguments, consulted their own opinions, bluntly refuted, and frankly criticized. They often used the laws of contradiction and non-contradiction that they had just learned in logic class. After several red-faced climaxes, they finally found the truth, and then the emotions of both sides returned to unity.

However, at tomorrow's debate, she cannot use the materials she has prepared to argue fiercely with the other side. So, she turned her head uncomfortably and inadvertently saw the dissected mouse from today's class.

Biology experiments are really vivid subjects! What's more, her dissection skills are excellent, and everything can be seen clearly under the microscope, allowing them to appreciate the fun of theoretical verification.

But what about geometry? That is the best lesson to train thinking. Layer by layer, you think from the topic, exploring the core from every angle. The solution of difficult problems brings unspeakable happiness.

Due to her strong desire for knowledge, there was almost no subject that she did not love. Therefore, she couldn't help but think of the beautiful sounds of the English teacher reciting poems, which immersed the whole class in a quiet realm. But when the teacher taught Lincoln's speech, their blood boiled.

The history and geography teacher's broad and vivid materials often made them listen with fascination, but the teacher often suddenly stopped and asked a question, not letting their mouths be too lonely.

Finally, she thought of the Chinese language teacher, who had extremely deep literary attainments. He liked to tell them the learning stories of the world's great writers, telling them to seek knowledge from real life and to practice writing more. Even if it was abdominal pronunciation that did not pass through the throat, it showed a naive beauty and was a voice of justice.

The tension in the classroom did not forget outdoor activities; after class and after meals, they were also active beside the ping-pong table and on the volleyball court.

Spring break is coming soon, and it's their season for expeditions to the suburbs again!

But those vivid scenes that shone before her eyes could not be visited again from tomorrow. Tomorrow she will break into a completely unfamiliar company to do work that she is not familiar with. What she will see every day will no longer be lively young classmates and kind teachers, but she will have to walk into a spacious office under the gilded city sign, tread on the shiny floor, lean over a glowing desk, and waste her life in the clamor of abacuses and telephones, filling endless account books with endless numbers.

The complex thoughts consumed Huifang's heart. She raised her head and breathed a sigh of depression, her eyes falling on a mirror frame on the board wall. She saw her father's photo from his youth, so heroic and handsome! But the ruthless years took away her father's youth. Her father was old, especially in the half year since her mother returned to her hometown, he seemed to have aged even faster. And what about her mother? Because she didn't have the money to treat her tuberculosis properly, she was afraid that she couldn't live much longer. A dark shadow flashed before her eyes, and she couldn't help but shed tears again.

The clock had struck twelve times, and her father called from the next room: "Huifang! Go to sleep! It's getting late."

"Dad! Coming!"

She hurriedly stacked the books that she had messed up while meditating, turned off the lights, stood up, and heard the rain falling harder and the wind blowing so hard that the glass windows were rattling. Far away in the alley, there was another sound of a miserable and sharp beggar. In the tragedy of life, the pace of life is too difficult!

She sighed again and walked into the bedroom.

### Song of the Warrior

— Hong Ying

Use your reason,
To swallow all sorrow.
Rekindle a torch in the heart,
Destroy the pain!

In the guise of a warrior,
Appear in the dark wilderness.
Shake up your spirit and draw the bowstring,
Shoot the arrow of fire there.

Wave your sword,
Boil your blood,
With your steadfast and unyielding will,
To the sinners of the world,
Make a brave great plundering!

Rather strive for truth,
Rather sing for destruction;
For struggling to live,
The warrior marches forward heroically,
Until the last drop of blood is shed!

### The Daylight Is Still Bright Today

— Jiang Fan

The daylight is still bright today, why do you keep directing
Those who come to worship place infinite empty hopes
What's different about another day?
Could it be that you can immediately ascend to heaven?

How many flowers are left on the road of life,
Only that final resting place
Can you escape, and when you go there soon
You still have to bring a full load of old age!

Do you just sigh for dreams like this?
Don't even plant a flower, just rush back to your old home?

### Map Explanation

The location of the second front that the British and Americans will open in Europe is most likely to be in the English Channel area, according to general observers. Regarding the recent bombing by the British and American air forces, the strategy is focused on the Calais area in the north of the area of activity. The German defenses in this area pose the greatest threat to transport operations in the English Channel, and the enemy must destroy them no matter what. From this, it can be seen that the French coast, from Dunkirk in the north to Bolo Niaise and Apuville in the south, that is, the so-called English Channel area, will become a candidate location for invading Europe.

However, the Germans are well prepared for the enemy. They have stationed 700,000 troops along the Atlantic coast from Norway to the French-Italian border, and built strong and impregnable fortresses, ready to give the landing enemy a headache. (Please refer to the article "Focus of the Second Front" in the first section of today's newspaper.)

### Women's Mobilization in Various Warring Countries: The Number of Women Mobilized in Various Warring Countries

The highest number of women available for mobilization in various warring countries: the Soviet Union with 53 million people, the United States with 30 million people, Germany with 22 million people, and the United Kingdom with 11 million people. The ratio of the mobilizable population to the total female population: the Soviet Union with 59 percent, the United States with 45 percent, Germany with 62 percent, and the United Kingdom with 40 percent.

The women's employment rate, with voluntary employment and labor patriotic teams, is compared with the mobilizable population. The United Kingdom has reached 100 percent, or 11 million people. Germany is second, accounting for 77 percent, or 38 million people. The United States accounts for 60 percent, or 18 million people. (Translated from Jitsugyo no Nippon, No. 1106)

The All-Shanghai Open Basketball Group A Finals will be held at Zhongqing on the evening of the 10th of this month at 8:30 PM. Members of society are encouraged to donate generously and benefit poor students.

The Shen Bao's charitable act of providing scholarships benefits young students, cultivates talents for the country, and has long been valued by all sectors of society, who jointly support this good cause. Since its inception, it has received enthusiastic support from members of society and the efforts of the Shen Bao staff. The achievements of this effort need not be elaborated on. Recently, the Shen Bao, in view of the flourishing of ball sports, where the audience at each game far exceeds expectations, with unprecedented grand occasions, decided to hold Shen Bao Scholarship Fund football and basketball charity matches. President Chen of the Shen Bao has liaised with all relevant parties, and all parties, considering that this matter concerns public welfare, are happy to accept, so progress has been quite smooth.

### Football Charity Match: Invitation to Donghua Overseas Chinese Federation

On the football side - contact has been made with the Donghua Overseas Chinese Federation, who has readily agreed, which is commendable. The date of their participation and everything else will be announced later.

On the basketball side - the All-Shanghai Open Basketball League Group A Finals, Zhongbei vs. Renyu, is scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month (Wednesday) at 8:30 PM in the gymnasium of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao. The officials of the Basketball Committee are altruistic and public-spirited, and use the finals as a Shen Bao Scholarship Fund charity match, achieving two things with one stone, which is deeply appreciated by the Basketball Committee's good planning.

Zhongbei and Rensheng, two teams, each with famous players, won the championships of the first and second divisions of the All-Shanghai Open Basketball Group A respectively, and will hold the finals. At that time, it will also be a charity match for the scholarship fund. Ticket prices are bound to be slightly increased. Except that the original price will still be submitted to the Basketball Association from the ticket revenue, and all expenses will be borne by the Shen Bao, all the ticket revenue will be contributed to the scholarship fund. Therefore, the reporter predicts that fans will definitely rush to be the first on that evening, because they can enjoy the ball skills and jointly support a good cause, which is something everyone is happy to do. The reporter would like to express their gratitude to the students who will receive assistance.

### Central and Northern Technical Skills are Unparalleled in Shanghai

The members of the Central and Northern team, with the exception of Chen Xuechong, are all athletes from the North. Their style is distinctly Northern, making them the only Northern team in Shanghai, hence their popularity among the general fans. The most prominent feature is their exceptionally good individual skills, which is undoubtedly a reason for their repeated victories over strong opponents. Furthermore, thanks to the excellent leadership of Wang Zhongtao and Dai Changling, their pre-match and post-match critiques, as well as their on-the-spot adaptability, are all unique. This time, they joined the First Division of the All-Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament and were invincible, with only one game remaining against China United Pharmaceutical. Originally scheduled for the 25th of last month, it was unfortunately canceled due to order issues at the venue, which is a great pity. Now, with China United Pharmaceutical voluntarily relinquishing their rights, Central and Northern have won the championship of the First Division. Here is an introduction to the team:

Wang Zhongtao - Captain of the team, serving as a guard, he is extremely experienced. Remaining calm in the face of big situations is most commendable. However, recently, it seems that his physical condition is not strong enough to support the entire game, which is a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the team relies heavily on Wang's off-court coordination, so he should be considered the central figure of the team.

Li Zhenzhong - Very tall and with superb ball skills, he is currently the most popular player among Shanghai fans. The team's offense and defense depend on Zhenzhong alone. His interception of the ball under the basket is almost flawless. The accuracy and agility of his passing are unmatched by other players. And the beauty of his long-range shots is rarely seen in the basketball world. Therefore, Zhenzhong is indeed a darling of the basketball world, and it is not an exaggeration to call him the "King of Basketball."

Shen Yugong - A player in the Chinese World Games, his level is self-evident. His only special feature is his ingenious left-handed corner shot, which appears and disappears unpredictably. The more he is blocked, the more he can achieve unexpected victories, truly a prodigy and the key to the team's scoring.

Chen Xuechong - The only Cantonese player on the Central and Northern team. Xuechong's style is the same as the Northern style. Everything about the former China Star team has sufficiently proved that there is no difference in tactics. Xuechong has ample elasticity, and his high jumping gives him the upper hand in getting the ball under the basket.

Xu Zhaoxiong - Attended the World Games with Yugong, but in recent years, his body has become somewhat overweight, leading to a feeling of being unable to keep up. Observing his skillful passing and resourceful assistance, he still maintains the demeanor of a veteran.

Zhao Yalin - The leader of the former North Star team. Although still young, he is already experienced in everything. Not only is he capable of dealing with the team's players appropriately, but his interpersonal skills are also impeccable. People call him an old soul in a young body. His bravery during combat is like a bold and decisive warrior, completely different from his composed demeanor off the court.

Li Baozhong - A Northern style player who has adapted to the South. He always has a smile on his face while playing, and his moves use softness to overcome strength. However, within that smile and gentleness, he never easily lets his guard down against opponents. Fans call him the "Smiling Tiger," and he deserves the name in the game.

The remaining players, such as Zheng Guichang, a former Fudan star who is as famous as Zhou Dayun, and Pan Jianhua, a pillar of the former Shanghai Bank team, all possess extraordinary ball skills.

### Renyu Has Many Tactics, and Players Apply Them Effectively

The Renyu team is led by Tan Xingbo, with the planning assistance of Liang Guogui, a former Shanghai Jiang champion, and Xia Zeren, from the heyday of Chizhi. Additionally, Yu Huanzi is willing to study the game. Whether in offense or defense, the team has considerable methods. At first glance, it may seem like there are no gimmicks, but upon closer inspection, their ability to apply methods is commendable. This time, they joined the Open Basketball Tournament, drawing in the Second Division. Wherever their skills reached, everyone submitted. Especially the final victory over the foreign team, the Monoc, proved that their methods surpassed others and are worth praising. The team has a strong understanding of gaining possession of the ball and never wastes it on unnecessary shots. Therefore, games against this team are mostly close, with fewer points scored. Now, let us introduce the team members:

Yu Huanzi - The instigator of using methods, everything about offense, defense, left, and right, comes from Yu's command. Old Yu is systematic and rarely makes mistakes, and he is respected by his teammates. His shortcoming is that he suffers from slight nearsightedness, which significantly affects his shooting.

Li Zhaohe - Also nearsighted. He wears glasses with a protective cover on the court. The line of sight is not significantly hindered. Li serves as the center, relying on his height and sufficient elasticity, he is very capable of rebounding. His masterpiece is a reverse shot in front of the basket. He has no long-range shooting ability, which is a disadvantage, but it's also one of his strengths.

Lin Weicong - Nicknamed "Little Lin," which shows he is in the prime of his youth. Relying on his abundant energy, he fears nothing. His style is fierce and ruthless, those who face him are crushed. His shooting is inconsistent, so there is no definitive conclusion. In short, Little Lin is undoubtedly a good forward prospect.

### Simple Exercise Training Methods (10) (6)

— Written by Tom, translated by a German

Exercise Three

Extend your right arm forward. Hold a dumbbell or stick as if grasping it tightly. Sweep it downwards close to your side, then continue backwards and upwards, and return to the original position, drawing a large circle. Do not bend the elbow joint.

After extending forward five to ten times, repeat the exercise in the opposite direction, i.e., from back to front, drawing a large circle. Do not bend the arm; it is better to twist the whole body at both ankles.

The movement of the left arm (from front to back and from back to front) is the same as that of the right arm. The hand must draw a perfect circle. Imagine a line on the wall in front of you, starting from the floor, then continue backwards and upwards, passing over the ceiling, and returning to the starting point.

Shoulder and Chest: Right arm extends forward, circling (10 times); reverse circling (10 times). Left arm extends forward: circling (10 times); reverse circling (10 times).

Note: For special practice, each arm should circle forward and backward at least twenty times.

Shoulder and Chest Exercise One

Shoulder and Chest Exercise Two

Shoulder and Chest Exercise Three

Ma Canxi - Experienced and reliable, he serves as a guard, relying on his excellent positioning and sharp vision. Thus, he has the advantage of waiting for the enemy's attack and lightly blocking their advance. He is also good at long-range shooting, a standard guard.

Zhuo Guorong - Together with Old Ma, they form a pair of guards, like an iron gate. Zhuo's jumping to grab the ball is marvelous, and his dribbling is extremely skillful with excellent speed. He can occasionally rush into the opponent's basket to assist in the attack, compensating for the team's forwards' lack of shooting. Players like Ji Youkun and Wang Chuqing are all veterans, and replacements are available, making it a well-rounded team in all aspects. (Skinny Reporter)

### Table Tennis Should be Promoted Quickly

Sports in this city have always been highly developed. Since the Shanghai War, various sports have been affected by the war and have been suspended one after another. In the past two years, with the organization of the Municipal Sports Association, various sports have gradually become active. Various ball games have been held one after another. However, table tennis has remained in a slump to this day. The author hopes that the Table Tennis Association will implement its established plan as soon as possible. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about sports will provide practical support so that table tennis can be promoted and developed in the near future, restoring its past enthusiasm. (Chen Lingsheng)

### Tidbits from the Sports Scene

Miss Shi Ruijuan, a star player of the Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang women's basketball and volleyball teams, became engaged last month to Mr. Lu Peiyuan, an employee of the Siming Bank. Miss Shi has not forgotten about sports. Her progress in both the China Youth basketball and the Western Youth volleyball is increasingly evident.

The Tongren Basketball Team has expanded into the Tongren Sports Association, and it will soon establish a small football team, which will surely make new contributions.

The fact that Fu Zhen followed the Suhuai Football Team on an expedition to serve Donghua, while Fan Qinggong followed the Beixing Team to Shanghai but stayed with the Central and Northern team, are both great stories.

Jia Youliang, the right winger of Donghua, is most beloved by fans, which is certainly due to his excellent ball skills, but also due to Youliang's amiable and approachable manner.

Yan Taowen of the Green Team always has a smile on her face during games, hence the nickname "Sweet Girl."

The Star Basketball Team is organized by people from the Star Perfume Factory. It is said that Miss Zhou Wenji is in charge.

Zhu Tufang is not a member of the Green Team, but is in charge of management. Miss Zhu is enthusiastic about sports and never seems tired. The Green Team owes its current status not only to the team leader, Xie Yiqin, but also to Miss Zhu. (Hu)
