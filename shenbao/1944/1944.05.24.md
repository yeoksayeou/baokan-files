### On Shanghai's Financial Problems

Finance is the mother of all governance. To improve administrative efficiency, it is imperative to first rectify finances and make them sound. The way to rectify finances lies in two major principles: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, representing both active and passive approaches. However, the city of Shanghai's finances are currently operating at a deficit. Therefore, seeking to improve administrative efficiency and rectify finances is a matter of utmost urgency.

The city's general budget for the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), excluding the first district, projects a recurring revenue of 260,990,374.70 yuan. Among these, land tax revenue ranks first, accounting for 40.7%, while special tax revenue from the Nanshi gambling houses ranks second, accounting for 15.6% of the total revenue. Next comes subsidy revenue, accounting for 14%. These three items already account for 70% of the total amount. From this, it can be seen that, apart from land tax, which is a normal source of revenue, the second and third items cannot be considered normal sources. Moreover, with the Nanshi gambling houses already banned and closed, this revenue can no longer be included. If we use a human analogy, if a person's living expenses must be maintained by improper income and subsidies from others, then the danger of that person's life is evident. The same holds true for government agencies.

In terms of increasing revenue, actively increasing tax rates is the main approach. However, increasing taxes increases the burden on citizens, and increasing the burden on citizens must be directly proportional to increasing the benefits to citizens, so it should be decided with great caution. Regarding land tax, according to the Finance Bureau's 31st year (1942) "Financial Practices," the current land tax levied in the city averages 24.39 yuan per mu (unit of area). However, the actual burden of land tax on farmers is definitely more than 24 yuan per mu. Secondly, it is hard to believe that the income from the city's donations, taxes, and special taxes is less than that from the special tax on gambling houses. Public utilities and central market operating scales are not small, but monthly revenue averages only 175,381 yuan, even less than a common store, which is also doubtful. Therefore, to rectify city finances, in addition to increasing revenue, adjusting institutions and systems, which is closely related to increasing revenue, is particularly important. If we talk about increasing revenue without first making adjustments, it is difficult to ensure that the increased revenue does not flow into private hands, and the result will not benefit the public. As for the way to adjust, as far as I can see, I will state it as follows:

Abolish the tax farming system and rectify tax collection. The tax farming system was originally created because the organization of financial institutions was not yet complete, and tax collection was difficult. Therefore, people were contracted to collect taxes, which was a temporary measure. However, since the organizational structure of the city's financial institutions is not yet perfect, and there is no reason why the tax farming system must be adopted, all tax revenue should be directly collected by the financial authorities. Moreover, there have always been many abuses of the tax farming system. Obtaining the right to contract is always dependent on connections. Whether the contractor makes a profit or a loss is unreasonable, not to mention that the amount contracted is often far less than the actual amount collected, which is a major loss to the city's treasury revenue. In the past, the First District Public Office inherited the former Public Works Bureau's method of directly collecting and paying taxes, which was relatively successful. It is hoped that the tax revenue of the entire city's finances will abolish the tax farming system as soon as possible.

Unify tax collection and strengthen the powers of tax collection agencies. The Municipal Finance Bureau has established tax management offices in each special zone to handle the collection of taxes. However, taxes on tobacco, alcohol, bamboo, wood, and pigs are all collected by separate special tax collection offices in the same urban area. Establishing multiple tax collection agencies not only increases expenditure, but if the management is not sound, it is equivalent to having several more loopholes. Since tax management offices have already been established in each special zone, all tax revenue should be handled by the office in a unified manner, with one authority and dedicated responsibility. It is hoped that the municipal finance authorities will promptly abolish redundant agencies and unify powers.

After implementing the abolition of the tax farming system and rectifying tax collection, revenue can be increased; after implementing the consolidation of redundant agencies and reducing redundant personnel, expenditure can be reduced. For the entire city's finances, it can be expected to be vigorous and sound. Then, for civil servants, security teams, and police treatment, and education funding, a sufficient increase can be made, so that every civil servant can maintain a minimum standard of living before we can realistically talk about improving administrative efficiency. This is the grand principle of distinguishing between the fundamental and the superficial, the urgent and the secondary.

### Remnants of the Enemy Near Barel Attacked by Japanese Forces from North and South, Japanese Forces on the West Bank of the Nujiang River Achieve Major Victory

Central News Agency, Yangon, 23rd - The enemy's 20th Division near Barel has been somewhat reinvigorated by reinforcements from the 32nd Brigade in the Xinde Wan area and is currently putting up stubborn resistance. Since the start of the battle, the city has suffered heavy losses due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian Allied forces. Near Dammo Le, they were attacked by Japanese forces from the north and south, losing one brigade. The remaining two brigades were subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese forces near Jiji and Xiakenobaer, as well as near Barel, suffering heavy blows. In total, the city has suffered more than 8,000 casualties, and it has almost collapsed.

Central News Agency, Yangon, 23rd - The remnants of the enemy south of the Barel Highway have been gradually surrounded by Japanese artillery fire and close combat. At dawn on the 11th of this month, Japanese forces broke into a corner of the eastern heights of Highland 5185 and launched a heroic attack on the enemy stronghold there. They finally occupied it at 4 a.m. on the 19th, posing a direct threat to the enemy's central stronghold, Xiannamu, and securing a favorable location. Subsequently, the enemy launched several counterattacks in an attempt to regain the highland, but after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, they finally collapsed and retreated.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd - According to a report from Kandy, the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Forces Command has announced the battle situation: Anti-Axis forces are attempting to encircle Bixian Bor from the northwest and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese forces.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd - In order to conceal its repeated defeats, the enemy has recently actively promoted the success of its Southern Expeditionary Force's attack on the west bank of the Nujiang River, but the facts are just the opposite. The Chongqing army in the wilderness on the west bank of the Nujiang River is currently being severely attacked everywhere by the elite units of the Japanese army and is showing a tendency to be annihilated. The elite units of the Japanese army have controlled the battle line from Maanshan to Liuku, and another unit has secured the position from Paomashan to Hongshuteng. Another unit is responding to the above-mentioned Japanese army to annihilate the enemy army that has advanced to the west bank of the Nujiang River. Since the end of last month to the 19th of this month, the Japanese army has inflicted a profound blow on the enemy army, and the bodies of the Chongqing army that have been confirmed have reached 744.

### General Nakamura Comments on the Pacific War Situation

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Japanese Navy General Nakamura recently commented on the war situation in the Central Pacific in the May issue of the Pacific Magazine, saying that there is no reason for the rapid progress of the war on that side. The main points are as follows: At this stage of the Central Pacific War, the main purpose of the United States is, as Nimi said, to open the gateway to New Guinea, open a blood path directly to China via the Philippines, cut off the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and isolate Japan from the resource areas in the South. Therefore, the war in New Guinea and the war in the Central Pacific are based on the same principle. Here, we should clearly understand the geographical situation of the South Sea Islands and the distance between the islands. If we recognize this point, we can know that the so-called US Navy's capture of part of the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands can lead to a long-term attack on the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands is entirely nonsense. When the US Navy attacked Kuezelin Island and Roth Island in the Marshall Islands, it mobilized 2 million tons of ships. Therefore, to attack Caroline and Mariana, it must be increased several times. After the enemy forces landed on Kuezelin Island, enemy mobile units attacked Tuck Island, which is 950 nautical miles away, after only 17 days. However, this is the essence of the fleet's actions. Although it appears and disappears unpredictably, it is not surprising. The problem is still whether the base is within the effective bombing range of the aircraft. According to the premise of landing operations, it is necessary to grasp the air control near the landing site and also obtain a base within 200 to 300 nautical miles of the side of the target. If only mobile units are used to attack or seize the Japanese air force base, there is no hope of success. The US military will never expose its mobile units in a place where air control is unstable and adopt a landing operation method that makes them vulnerable to threats. The US military is currently trying "gradual progress" and adopting an all-in-one approach to break through the Japanese army's southern first line of defense. Judging from the enemy's operations so far, it can only use ordinary mathematics and has not been able to exert the wonderful use of the commander's genius. However, this kind of mathematics has already taught the enemy fleet not to enter the Japanese air control area. Therefore, the enemy's fundamental concept of this operation gives me the impression that there is no reason for the rapid development of the Central Pacific War.

### Mr. Ogura Gives a Speech in Tianjin

Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd - Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, arrived in Tianjin from Peiping on the night of the 21st. On the 22nd, he visited various related parties and attended a cordial talk meeting hosted by the Tianjin Japan Economic Research Institute. At that time, he had various cordial talks with many representatives from the Japanese industrial and economic circles and met with reporters at the institute to give a speech. The general idea was: "All major issues at present should take the victory of the war as a prerequisite. If the war fails, Japan will perish, and China will not be spared. Therefore, in order to strive for victory in the war, we must strengthen our combat power. In order to strengthen our combat power, we must stabilize people's livelihoods. The harvest of rice in North China this year is still good, which is of great help in stabilizing people's livelihoods. North China has always been known as an agricultural and vegetable area. In order to fully develop it, we should fundamentally implement water management and engage in afforestation. Secondly, regarding the solution to the price problem, we are currently planning to recover currency for adjustment. However, before recovering currency, we should first prevent hoarding. A large amount of roaming funds are used for hoarding goods, which is a problem. Therefore, the authorities should fundamentally solve this in the future."

### President Chen Visits the Party Training Corps and Gives a Speech on Behalf of the Chairman

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd - President Chen of the Legislative Yuan personally visited the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd and gave a speech on behalf of the chairman, discussing "Regarding the Review of the Party." He recalled that since the return to the capital, there has been no significant progress in political and military affairs, all because the party itself has failed to fully play its leading role. He cited the painful experiences of the German Nazi Party and finally encouraged all the trainees to use the greatest determination and courage to study how to transform the party, enrich the party's strength, and complete the party's historical mission.

### Exchange of Legal Tender in Huaihai Province About to Be Completed, Use of United Reserve Bank Notes Prohibited After the Deadline

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd - The currency system in Huaihai Province has been quite effective since it was adjusted several times by the financial authorities. It is especially helpful to the great cause of the National Government in regulating finance and smoothing material circulation. The deadline for the exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes in the province is the end of this month in the four major cities of Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang. For other counties and districts, the deadline is the end of September this year. The exchange has been very enthusiastic since it started with rice every day. Therefore, according to statistics from relevant parties, the exchange figures are about to be completed. Therefore, it is certain that the exchange will be completed as scheduled by the deadline set by the authorities. Therefore, in order to prohibit the use of United Reserve Bank notes after the expiration of the exchange period, the financial authorities have specially formulated prohibition methods. It is hoped that all the people in the province will support the government authorities' implementation of a unified currency system and stabilize finance, and give full cooperation. If there are still those who have not exchanged, it is hoped that they will exchange them as soon as possible. After the deadline, do not neglect the laws and regulations and use them again without authorization, so as not to commit the crime of hindering the currency system and disrupting finance. Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance gave an important speech on this matter yesterday to clarify the government's intentions. The speech of Minister Zhou and the prohibition measures are recorded below:

Minister Zhou's Speech

Regarding the adjustment of the currency system in Huaihai Province, the government has gradually implemented it and has gradually achieved results. All Central Reserve Bank notes and China United Reserve Bank notes in the province will be fully exchanged. The deadline is extended to May 31 this year in the four cities of Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang. Other areas in Huaihai Province are extended to September 30 this year. When the period expires, their use will be prohibited separately. I have already issued a statement before, and now I have specially formulated the Measures for Prohibiting the Use of United Reserve Bank Notes in Huaihai Province to facilitate implementation. According to these measures, after the expiration of the above-mentioned full exchange period, the use of China United Reserve Bank notes in all regions of the province should be prohibited. If there is any violation, in addition to confiscating the United Reserve Bank notes and turning them over to the public, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances in accordance with the law. The term "use of United Reserve Bank notes" refers to the use of the notes as currency. For the sake of clarity, the following usage behaviors are listed again: (1) Purchase and sale of goods, (2) Payment of expenses, (3) Clearing of debts, (4) Exchange of currencies, (5) Use of deposits and collateral, (6) Use of loans and gifts. Anyone who uses United Reserve Bank notes for the above behaviors, regardless of whether they receive or give, will be punished in accordance with the law. Although self-preservation or handing over to non-financial institutions is not a usage behavior, those who attempt to use United Reserve Bank notes under the guise of borrowing, carrying, or transporting will still be punished. Please pay attention to compliance, this is very important.

Prohibition Measures

Article 1: In accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of these measures, the use of China United Reserve Bank notes entering and exiting the province should be prohibited, unless specially approved by the Minister of Finance. Article 2: Anyone who violates the provisions of the preceding article, in addition to confiscating the China United Reserve Bank notes used and turning them over to the public, those whose circumstances are minor will be punished in accordance with the Violation of Police Punishment Law, and those whose circumstances are serious will be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Harming the New Legal Tender. Article 3: The confiscated China United Reserve Bank notes should be reported to the Ministry of Finance at any time.

(2) Other areas in Huaihai Province: implemented from October 1, 1944. Article 6: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Wartime National Banquet Restriction Guidelines

Central News Agency, Beijing - In order to emphasize the importance of frugality during wartime, the Ministry of Social Welfare has recently drafted the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Guidelines. It was passed by the 209th Executive Yuan meeting and the 47th Supreme National Defense Conference on the 20th. The full text contains 22 articles, which are excerpted as follows:

Minister Zhang Goes to Tianjin

Central News Agency, Peiping, 23rd - Zhang Yi, Minister of Justice Administration of the National Government, came to Peiping to inspect the judiciary in North China. He has now completed his official duties and went to Tianjin and other places to inspect yesterday.

### Suzhou Cracks Down on Opium Trafficking Agency

Special Dispatch from Suzhou - It is reported that in the Suzhou-Wuxi area, a well-known private opium trafficker has established a large-scale opium trafficking agency. Guo is the main person. Since the government announced the three-year ban, most private opium traffickers have slightly converged, but recently a private publication agency in Suzhou City has transported a large number of private opium to the countryside, hoping to sell it. The first batch of more than 2,000 taels has been transported away, and the second batch of more than 1,000 taels was loaded into a car and escorted by Guo. When they arrived at the Pingmen Bridge pier, they were spotted by the newly established anti-smoking bureau's anti-smuggling personnel, who considered their actions suspicious. They went forward to check and captured them on the spot. The bureau considered the case to be serious and telegraphed the department for instructions.

### Responding to the Western European War: Germany Has Confidence, Possessing a Large Number of Armored Units

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The Berlin Financial Newspaper states that the German artillery line along the Western European coast, in addition to strong fortified positions with fortresses and deep trenches, also has other defensive equipment. Besides the passive defense line, there is also the most important active offensive weapon, namely the armored divisions. The main defense of the Western Front will undoubtedly be based on accumulating strength for offense, as in the past. Mobile armored units are ready to counterattack or concentrate firepower to sweep through enemy breakthrough points. The enemy's landing attempt takes the initiative because the enemy is in a position to choose an attack location and concentrate a large army on that point. The defending army must quickly mobilize troops to maintain balance. Therefore, large armored units and artillery must be ready for deployment at any time. The main task of armored vehicles is to repel the threats of airborne forces or paratroopers. Therefore, German armored forces are stationed in the French hinterland to detect enemy airborne landings. As for other secret measures to prepare for the counter-attack of Axis airborne troops, naturally, they cannot be revealed. Although the anti-Axis forces have numerical superiority, it will be difficult to match them with an equal number of German armored forces after landing, because even the largest transport aircraft can only carry light artillery and light tanks. To prevent air attacks, Germany's armored forces are completely different from those on the Eastern Front. The terrain of France and the dense transportation network provide sufficient secret cover for troop movements. In general, the overall armored forces in Western Europe are ready to thwart enemy attempts. The number of reserve armored forces is far greater than what was used in France in 1940. The war machine that the British and American forces will encounter when landing in France will be far more powerful than what they encountered in Sicily and the United States.

Breaking Through the Diversionary Tactic Strategy

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency military correspondent, Orpei, reports: Although the Soviet Union has announced that it has joined the major war related to the invasion of Europe, and the United Kingdom has repeatedly stated that preparations for the Western European offensive have been completed, in fact, the anti-Axis forces still show no signs of starting an offensive on all fronts simultaneously. The Soviet army's southern front is still east of the Dniester River, so the deduction of a general offensive on Europe from that area is inevitably premature. In the past few days, the Soviet army has fiercely attacked the bridgehead positions in Grigoriopol and Buda, proving that the Red Army values ​​this area as a starting point for future offensives. Large German air force units are heavily bombing the troops concentrated in Corsica. The anti-Axis forces concentrating large armies there and concentrating 3.5 million troops in southern England are using these areas and the southern coast of France to contain the German forces in Western Europe. However, this diversionary tactic strategy was long foreseen by the German High Command, and it will inevitably crush their plan. The German High Command has sufficient military strength and full confidence in the outcome of the war.

Roosevelt Sees European Offensive as Imminent

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports from Washington: President Roosevelt, when submitting the fifteenth report on the Lend-Lease Act to Congress yesterday, stated that the European offensive is about to begin. He said that the United Nations will now attack Europe from bases in the east, west, and south.

King George of England Inspects the Three Services

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports from London: General Montgomery, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the anti-Axis invasion of Europe, explained the final details of the invasion plan to King George VI. This morning, it was announced in London that the King inspected the troops commanded by Montgomery. These troops are currently in a certain location in England and will participate in the European offensive under the command of General Eisenhower. The King also inspected the domestic fleet and the Royal Air Force last week.

German Generals Confer on Defense

Vichy, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Vichy radio broadcasts, Field Marshal Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of the German forces in Western Europe, conferred on defense with Field Marshal Rommel, one of his subordinates.

Sudden Train Stoppage in London

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: London news, yesterday, thousands of citizens waiting for trains at various stations in London suddenly heard that many trains were stopping, which was quite perplexing. The authorities have not issued a statement explaining the sudden stoppage of trains on most important trunk lines, and railway authorities have hinted that civilian travel may be completely banned.

The Rice Control Committee will determine the purchase price of rice based on the actual situation in various regions, in order to enhance the quantity of purchases and reform the distribution system. It is reported that this matter has been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan.

Japanese Allied Navy Memorial Day Special

### The Battle of Tsushima

— by Mutō Sada

At that time, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Tōgō, was full of melancholy, not for any other reason. In the Battle of the Yellow Sea, although the enemy was caught, it could not be annihilated and escaped into the port of Port Arthur. The Battle of the Yellow Sea in August of Meiji 37 (1904) certainly thwarted the enemy fleet's attempt to escape from Port Arthur and suffered considerable damage, winning a victory, but it was not a complete victory.

Why couldn't a complete victory be achieved? At that time, the Combined Fleet did not go all out. Indeed, the Baltic Fleet was on its way east. In order to wait for this second enemy, when hitting less the first enemy (Far Eastern Fleet), extreme was taken to avoid injury. In the Port Arthur blockade, Commander Tōgō did not dare to launch a large-scale attack with the main fleet. If foreign reporters criticized Marshal Tōgō for being too cautious and lacking decisiveness before the Battle of the Yellow Sea, it might be a reckless judgment. But once the enemy in Port Arthur was annihilated, both body and mind were worn out, and when he was about to intercept the second enemy, the Baltic Fleet, Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō's great wisdom suddenly blossomed here.

The marshal's awe-inspiring courage had already had the ambition to swallow the enemy before the battle. Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama drafted the first report to the General Staff Headquarters, the first sentence of which was: "Received a report of the discovery of enemy ships," and the second sentence was "Planning to immediately launch an attack to intercept them." After seeing this, Marshal Tōgō immediately used a pencil to delete the "intercept" character from "intercept", adding the "annihilate" character.

At 3:30 AM on May 27th of Meiji 38 (1905), Admiral Tōgō had no other expression than a slight smile. He did not hesitate to go through fire and water. Now he was only focused on crushing the enemy to pieces. Here, he first issued an order to the entire fleet: "Discard fuel." In order to prepare for the event that the enemy fleet might turn to the Pacific Ocean and flee, he burned his boats, lightened the ship's body, and made a desperate all-out decisive battle.

It was almost time to confront the enemy, and the west wind was quite strong. To make the shooting accurate, it was first necessary to obtain the conditions of ship position and wind position. So he ordered the flagship Mikasa and the entire fleet to turn around in front of the enemy. Tōgō was taking a risk. The enemy was caught off guard, not knowing what mysterious tactics the Japanese army had, and was terrified, thus losing the most important opportunity to win. "Annihilation" had already succeeded at this time.

From our layman's point of view, when the time was so urgent, why use the beautiful descriptive words "The weather is clear, but the waves are quite high"? But with just this sentence, the General Staff Headquarters was already prepared to sing a triumphant song. If the weather was clear, it was evidence that the Combined Fleet did not have a "fog fleet" that was more annoying than the enemy. "The waves are quite high," the Japanese fleet had become accustomed to during normal maneuvers, but for foreign navies, it was a difficult situation that was rarely encountered and only recently experienced. Fortunately, "the waves were quite high" became an excellent condition for the Japanese Navy, while the enemy saw it as a fatal wound. This was probably the protection of the gods! The shocking waves raised the ambition to swallow mountains and rivers. But the enemy was panic-stricken and unable to fire its cannons.

"The weather is clear, but the waves are quite high," Admiral Tōgō had already predetermined the record of victory when he sent this telegram. (Translated by Xiang from Yomiuri Hochi)

### Admiral Tōgō

— A Collection of Golden Words

### Fulfilling One's Duty

Fulfilling one's duty is the most important thing for a human being, and it is especially important to first see what one's duty is.

### Do Not Abandon People

All people have strengths. If one thinks like this, they can definitely be used. Those who will never forget loyalty and honesty should never be abandoned.

### Careful

When crossing the street, keep a distance from vehicles.

### Knowing Shame

The so-called knowing shame is a word that can be big or small and has a deep meaning. This is what the samurai of the past engraved in their hearts and never forgot. In a big way, when the country is in a difficult situation for the sake of righteousness, failure is the shame of the country. In a small way, one should never lag behind others in the way of sincerity.

### Beware of Clever Words and Flattering Expressions

There are times in life when one must be straightforward.

### Talented People Lack Sincerity

Talented people tend to rely on their talents and be arrogant, lacking sincerity. Therefore, although they can deceive others for a while, it is impossible to make them sincerely convinced.

### Trust

Trust is the most important thing. The ancients placed it at the end of the five constant virtues, thinking that it had a deep meaning. No matter loyalty or filial piety, if they are not carried out with trust, it will be difficult to gain the trust of others.

### Famous Writing and Insight

To be close to the truth of things, one must have insight. If one does not have it, even if the writing is famous, it is not worth reading.

### Changes in People's States of Mind

People's psychological state is quite wonderful. In some situations, even life and death are not a problem. But this is even more true when responsibility is not heavy.

### Endurance as a Virtue for Women

Things in the world cannot all be done as one thinks, so endurance is especially necessary. There are especially many unreasonable things that cannot be explained in the family. If everything is explained reasonably, there will inevitably be flaws. Therefore, one must have the first awakening of endurance. Nowadays, as women's rights are gradually increasing, the so-called endurance may be out of date, but once one becomes a wife and has a direct relationship with the family, even if one was self-willed when single, one should think deeply about it.

The so-called endurance mostly arises from sincerity. Therefore, if one sincerely cares for one's parents-in-law and husband, one can enhance one's endurance.

### Women Should Be Careful of Stubbornness

If a woman is stubborn, it is most regrettable!

It is good to be careful to avoid stubbornness. To adhere to righteousness and act accordingly is correct. It is good to follow the teachings of parents and teachers. It is a pity that today there is too much willfulness!

### A Laissez-faire Policy is Not Feasible

If the world were good, then it would be okay to let it be, or one could learn good things from it. However, it is especially impossible to implement it today. Mothers must pay the most attention to the education of their children. Even if fathers care, because they are often away, it is necessary for mothers to fully educate their children. The affairs of children are truly the most important things for mothers. (To be continued)
