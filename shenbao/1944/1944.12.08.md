### The Key to Victory in the Greater East Asia War Lies in the Efforts of the Home Front to Increase Production: Prime Minister Koiso's Broadcast Speech on the Third Anniversary

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - As the decisive battle of the Pacific war, the Battle of Leyte, is raging, it also coincides with the deeply significant third anniversary of the Imperial Rescript. Prime Minister Koiso reverently received the Imperial Rescript at 6:30 a.m. and then delivered a broadcast speech, explaining that the opportunity to crush the enemy's ambition to retake the Philippines is maturing. The key to victory lies in the home front's production base supplying the war effort. He called on the nation of one hundred million to rise up and embody His Majesty the Emperor's sacred will with utmost sincerity and the conviction of victory. The following is a record of the broadcast speech:

East Asian Construction

Three years ago, on December 8th, when we received the news of the Japanese military's large-scale air raid on Pearl Harbor, we also received the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States. At that moment, the spirit of Japan's one hundred million people was stirred, which is hard to describe in words. Today, this kind of emotion has been revived in our hearts, making us more solemnly grasp the determination to complete the holy war. As we look back over the past three years, the path of Japan's war effort unfolding with great glory, we deeply feel the immense and boundless significance of the Greater East Asia War. Today, the newly emerging Philippines and Burma in East Asia have broken free from the oppression and control of Britain and the United States and proudly raised the banner of independence. Furthermore, the people of the East Indian islands are also filled with bright hope for the completion of their independence in the near future. As for the British and American concessions in East Asia, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, they have also been cleared, and the extraterritorial rights that symbolized the contempt of East Asians have also been swept away. The Republic of China, with its great history and glorious traditions, has embarked on the path of autonomy and independence. After restoring its original East Asian form, Thailand has swept away the strong colors of Britain and the United States from the past. Thus, a new world of righteousness is increasingly entering the path of construction in East Asia today. The noble Eastern spirit and culture are also being revived day by day. The good Eastern peoples were deceived by the sweet words and hypocrisy of Britain and the United States, who harbored ambitions to dominate the Orient, which led to the plunder of their spiritual and material wealth and even the independence of their nations for a long time. The Greater East Asia War is to enable these Eastern peoples to recognize the true face of the enemy, while also awakening the spirit of the East Asian nations to rise up and overcome their difficult fate, and to enable the East Asian nations to cooperate today and resist the powerful aggressors.

Enemy Ambitions

We are now determined not to be deceived by all the sweet words of Britain and the United States. In the past three years of the war, Britain and the United States have spent tens of billions of dollars and sacrificed the lives of millions of people. However, what have they gained from this war? It is simply that they lack clarity in their grand cause. However, it is only natural that they lack a grand cause because they have no reason for war. They are merely trying to extend their power to the East and West Oceans with their vast territory and inexhaustible resources, so as to ensure their national defense security. However, the reason why they cannot but fight, the answer to this question, is very simple. In other words, they have no other purpose than to hold the ambition to dominate the world. But in order to cover up their ugly ambition, they have also made various false explanations. These explanations cannot even be understood by their own people. However, in order to arouse the national enemy's anger, they must make a major propaganda statement that Japan is an aggressor or a challenger, and the cause of the Greater East Asia War is clearly due to this ambition of theirs. In order to achieve their ambitions, they have carried out economic and military challenges, forcing Japan into a position where it must either fight or perish. Therefore, in order to survive and defend itself, Japan had no choice but to rise up to gamble on its survival. As for whether they are an aggressor country, this can only be clarified by the judgment of gods and demons. The United States is indeed the world's number one propaganda country, often exerting its amazing propaganda power, calling a stag a horse. In addition to exaggerating the damage it inflicted on the Japanese army by astronomical numbers, on the other hand, it does not lightly publish its own losses. As a result, the United States completed the war victory anesthetic, paralyzing the tendency to not recognize defeat. At the same time, they are even more unaware of the price they paid for being sacrificed for Roosevelt's ambition. The United States continues to force its citizens to engage in war, and recently, it has repeatedly decided to send air forces to bomb the Japanese mainland, especially Tokyo, fully exerting its inhumane behavior and seeking to engage in a decisive battle in the short term.

Production and Supply

However, the Japanese people, in order to protect the national polity, have the belief that they will fight to the last person, vow never to surrender, and will win. Therefore, it is ridiculous to think that indiscriminate bombing can make the Japanese people tremble. From our point of view, every enemy bomb is not enough to prevent our indomitable efforts. Our task, especially the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, not only causes the sacrifice of innocent lives, but also destroys shrines and lofty historical monuments. Under these circumstances, the Japanese people will surely rise up and take revenge on the United States with their blood. Every time we inspect the situation of the victims of indiscriminate bombing, we increase our anger and raise our spirit of courage. At the same time, the Japanese air defense will never allow the enemy to jump. They have repeatedly attacked, but they can only return in vain. Secondly, both sides are bombing the battlefield centered on Leyte Island day after day, achieving amazing results. Every time we look back at these results, we will increase our belief in victory. Only the decisive battle of Leyte can determine the future of the Pacific war. We should drive the intruding enemy out of the coast. The opportunity to crush the enemy's dream and Philippine ambition is maturing. In order to respond to the do-or-die courage of the soldiers on the front line, our people on the home front should continue to produce and assist the soldiers in combat as much as possible, because the key to victory lies in our home front's production and supply war.

European War Situation

Looking back at the European war situation, in August and September of this year, not to mention the enemy countries, even some neutral countries in Europe believed that Germany was about to be defeated, or changed their attitude, or discussed post-war plans. People all believed that a major change would occur in Europe. The allied country, Germany, is in this difficult situation, and the people under Hitler's leadership are becoming more united. Under the enemy's air raids, they are still striving to increase production and arm the people. Now, they are defending their country's borders against the enemy's large army, which has made the front line fall into a stalemate. On the other hand, in the southern Italian, French, and Belgian countries occupied by Britain and the United States, the people are forced into poverty and hunger. The phenomenon of social and political unrest is increasing all the time, and the international situation in Poland, the Balkans, and other countries is extremely complex. The enemy's British and American troubles and anxieties are also profound. Today, it is difficult to predict when Germany will collapse. Due to Germany's nationwide efforts, the hopeful observations made by the enemy have turned out to be the opposite. The situation in Europe can be said to have significantly improved towards the Axis powers compared to September of this year. We take this opportunity to express our deep respect to the people of our allied country, Germany, for their solid unity and fighting spirit, and we hope that they will continue to fight bravely under the leadership of President Hitler, vow to kill Britain and the United States, and carry out the expected goal.

### One Billion People Rise Up in Unity to Complete the Great Task of Defending East Asia: Chairman Chen's Statement on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Today (the 8th) is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Chen issued the following statement:

Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back on the past, the war situation has developed favorably day by day, the unity of the East Asian nations has become stronger day by day, and the close cooperation between China and Japan has increased day by day. At this time, Chairman Wang was unable to complete the war and passed away, leaving us forever. Looking forward to the future, we feel an even greater responsibility.

Before the outbreak of the war, the allied country Japan declared that the purpose of this war was to strive for the common survival of the East Asian nations, and the Sino-Japanese Incident also changed from this to a war to defend East Asia. Japan has repeatedly stated that its operations on the mainland are not to be an enemy of China, but to drive out Britain and the United States. Its significance is extremely bright and upright. For this reason, it is necessary to awaken the spirit of all East Asians to fight against the common enemy. For three years, the righteous army has been invincible, which lies in this. Recently, the operations on both the sea and land have achieved brilliant victories, which is by no means accidental. This is indeed something that all East Asian nations deeply feel encouraged and admire.

In January of last year, the National Government, based on the determination to live and die together, resolutely joined the war. Since then, it has actively engaged in the establishment of a wartime system, and has done its best to cooperate with the war. Although Chairman Wang has passed away and left us, his great spirit of saving China and protecting East Asia will always lead us to continue to struggle. In the future, we should still follow the established policy, encourage the military and civilians across the country, not avoid any hardships, strive forward, and strive for the final victory to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven.

Now the war has entered the decisive stage. In order to save their past decline, Britain and the United States will inevitably struggle to the death. The intensity of the future war is certainly to be expected. However, with the strong efforts of the allied land, sea, and air forces, and the superior situation, coupled with the belief in victory throughout the country, and the determination of all East Asian nations to live and die together, we will be able to ensure victory, which can be asserted.

China is now one of the allies and should fulfill its obligation to participate in the war. The urgent task is to consolidate the rear, supply the front, and crush the remaining forces of the enemy, so that they abandon their ambition to invade East Asia again. Promoting peaceful unification, saving Chongqing, making it get rid of the shackles of Britain and the United States, and returning it to its original appearance is another important task. I firmly believe that the compatriots across the country will be able to recognize the seriousness of the situation, rise up together, and go through the difficulties together. At the same time, I firmly believe that the one billion East Asian nations will be able to unite and become an impregnable wall of bronze and iron to defend East Asia, and then create a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity.

Editorial

### Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

The Greater East Asia War has reached its third anniversary today.

Over the past three years, there are naturally many things that can make us excited. However, there seem to be quite a few places that should be reflected on. At the same time, in addition to excitement and reflection, we also need to be more vigilant in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.

What are we excited about? The first is military victory. In the Pacific, the enemy America has suffered repeated heavy blows. The enemy American naval and air forces currently invading the Philippines, under the heroic counterattack of the allied forces, have also become the end of their rope. The enemy British army on the border of India and Burma has always been restrained by the allied forces. As for the Chinese mainland, the allied forces are making steady progress, and now they have broken into the territory of Guizhou Province, and Chongqing's situation is becoming more and more precarious. In the political field, under the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the unity of the Greater East Asian countries is becoming more and more consolidated. Burma, the Philippines, and other countries have completed their independence, and Malaysia and other places have also laid the foundation for autonomy. All aspects have progressed very quickly. As for production and construction, the speed at which the allied countries' productive forces, with aircraft production as the center, have increased has shocked the world. The economic construction in other places, especially the southern region, has also developed rapidly. With such a huge force in Greater East Asia, it has full confidence in defeating Britain and the United States. But as has been pointed out earlier, we should also reflect on our excitement. It is undeniable that China, as an important member of Greater East Asia, has more places to reflect on than others. How much strength have we exerted in the war? On the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War last year, the editorial of this newspaper pointed out that we should actively exert the strength of the people across the country to cooperate with Japan. The first is to improve national politics and concentrate the power of the people. The second is to awaken Chongqing's delusion of relying on Britain and the United States. To cooperate with friendly countries for the total liberation of the East Asian nations and thoroughly eliminate the forces of Britain and the United States. Also, on the second anniversary last year, we pointed out that to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, we must make our own country sound. First, the people should have the right to participate in politics so that the people and the government can work together. Second, the people should be stable and willing to be used by the country. Third, the economy should be developed and resources should be developed and utilized as much as possible.

Although we have contributed a lot to the Greater East Asia War in terms of manpower and resources in the past three years, after careful reflection, we have not really done our best. Manpower has obviously not been fully utilized, and resources have obviously not been fully utilized. The current hardship of people's livelihood can be said to have reached its peak. People's livelihood has not yet been stabilized. How can we concentrate the power of the people and awaken the people under the rule of Chongqing? How can we develop economic resources to the fullest extent?

We feel that the reason why people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, manpower has not been fully utilized, and resources have not been fully utilized is that the fact that politics is not as ideal as it should be accounts for a very large part. In the past three years, whether in terms of institutions or personnel, it can be said frankly that our country's politics has progressed too slowly. At the same time, the imperfect personnel measures have resulted in incompetent and even derelict officials in the government. In the opposition, there are many capable people who have not been fully employed by the authorities and have been buried. On the one hand, there are also those who consider themselves to be "wise and protect themselves" and are unwilling to devote themselves to the country, which is also a major obstacle to sound politics.

The closer the war is to the final stage of victory, the more difficult it becomes. We should step up the mobilization of talents and materials to cooperate with the allied countries. I hope that the authorities will improve political affairs as soon as possible, appoint virtuous and capable people, and stabilize people's livelihood as soon as possible, so that the people and the government can truly work together to complete the thorough victory of the Greater East Asia War and the great mission of national independence.

### Unite One Billion People to Complete the Victory of the War: Ambassador Tani Issued a Statement Yesterday

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, issued the following statement on the 7th:

Three years have passed since our country issued an imperial rescript declaring war on the United States and Britain. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers of our army and navy who, under the Imperial Majesty, have bravely fought in the vast war zone of thousands of miles on land, sea, and air, and to the heroic spirits who died in battle. Looking back over the past three years, the various nations of Greater East Asia have declared that they will support each other, be autonomous and independent, or have risen up and declared war on the enemy America, and are advancing with the Empire to defeat Britain and the United States, complete the Greater East Asia War, and complete the great cause of Greater East Asia construction.

Among them, the Republic of China, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, has vigorously promoted various measures based on the spirit of peace and national construction, with the aim of completing China's autonomy and independence. At the same time, it has abolished unequal treaties with allied countries, especially with Japan, and concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, etc., so that the relations between the two countries can be advanced in a landmark way and jointly advance towards the common enemy. However, the United States and Britain are currently forcibly launching reckless counterattacks. The Greater East Asia War has now entered the stage of a great decisive battle for the rise and fall of Greater East Asia. Especially in China, in order to complete its selfish ambitions, the United States and Britain will turn China into a battlefield and make the Chinese people the victims of blind bombing by American aircraft. On the contrary, the purpose of our military operations has been clarified as entirely to crush the ambitions of the enemy America and Britain. The Chinese people are our friends. If we exclude those who cooperate with America and Britain, even the troops of Chongqing are not our enemies. Such righteous Japanese soldiers and the people in the rear exist in a strict and upright manner. If we can obtain the strong support of one billion people to complete the Greater East Asia War, then the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is certainly in our hands.

### US Fleet and Aircraft Carriers Suffer Crushing Blows

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - After the Taiwan air battle and the Philippine naval battle, the US fleet has been severely damaged. Subsequently, the Japanese army launched successive attacks by the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, resulting in the US fleet and aircraft carrier groups suffering crushing blows, and the recent movements have become passive. Regarding the remaining strength of the American aircraft carriers, Minister Kurihara of the Press Department told reporters: The current situation of the enemy's remaining aircraft carriers cannot be judged by their numbers. Before the Taiwan air battle, the enemy had thirteen or four standard aircraft carriers, nine 10,000-ton converted aircraft carriers, and fifty other merchant ship-rebuilt aircraft carriers in the Pacific. They attempted to attack Taiwan and the Philippines in one fell swoop. In addition, there were some British aircraft carrier groups cruising in the Pacific. Since the Taiwan air battle, the enemy fleet has suffered considerable losses. The remaining forces are about ten ships. In addition, more than half of the auxiliary aircraft carriers have been sunk and destroyed and cannot be used. According to my judgment, the total number of American aircraft carriers has been reduced to less than half.

### The Situation of the Greater East Asia War in the Past Three Years

Minister of Information Kishi's Broadcast Speech Nanjing, 6th (Continued from yesterday) What is the true intention of Britain and the United States in the war? No matter how they publicize it, their war aims do not need to be repeatedly discussed. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the cruelty of the British. It is really worth talking about how they want to deal with our Greater East Asian nations. Although Americans claim to be cultured people, their cruel behavior has been found in the history of the world. It is truly shameless for Americans to boast of being noble people. American people use the remains of Japanese soldiers as toys and drive tanks over Japanese wounded soldiers. People all over the world are very surprised by this move. On the other hand, when the Japanese passed by the remains of American soldiers in the Solomon Islands, they not only did not insult them, but also saluted them. For example, the Burmese Dan military unit erected a monument next to the downed British aircraft to comfort the spirit of the British pilot in heaven. Because from the perspective of the Japanese Bushido creed, those who sacrifice themselves for their country are heroes, and in this situation, there is no distinction between the enemy and us. However, what is the motive behind the American military's desecration of Japanese soldiers' corpses, attacking Japanese hospital ships, and shooting innocent schoolchildren? It is nothing more than their superior bewilderment. Commander Halsey of the Third Fleet of the United States once called the Japanese and East Asians "apes." Americans have been holding the belief that they should dominate the colored races. They have forgotten that when we East Asians were already living in complete houses, their ancestors were still living in caves or primitive huts. When their ancestors used their fingers to grab food, Chinese and Japanese men had already been using bamboo chopsticks. How could they not know these facts? Now they regard the East Asians who are more excellent than themselves as "apes," which is indeed an act of trampling on morality. (To be continued)

### Strive for Decisive Victory; The Home Front Works Hard to Increase Production; Eloquent Words from Army Minister Kawamoto

Major General Kawamoto, Minister of the Japanese Army in Shanghai of the Japanese Dispatch Army to China, delivered a speech on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows:

Invincible Stance

"Today, we happily welcome the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The war situation is entering a period of major transformation. Three years ago today, the Empire could no longer tolerate it, and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor marked the beginning of the war. The accumulated resentment of many years was vented in one fell swoop. The Japanese army was invincible, and established remarkable war achievements at the beginning of the war. The war situation has been fluctuating since then, especially since the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal in February of last year, until the complete sacrifice of the garrison on Saipan in July of this year. This period was a period of arduous trials for us, and also a period in which we aroused new determination against the Anglo-Americans. During this period, although the strategic stance of daring not to fight, which was established at the beginning of the war, seemed to have undergone changes in form, it remained unshaken. In particular, the alliance work of various friendly nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become increasingly consolidated, and they are advancing towards opening up difficult situations with the firm intention of sharing life and death with our Empire. The belief in victory is becoming increasingly strong.

Furthermore, the enthusiasm of everyone on the home front in our country echoes the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front lines. As a result of focusing on strengthening war capabilities, we have now grasped the divine opportunity in the overall development of the war situation, creating a major turning point. Now, the time has come to re-emerge after more than a year and a half of dormancy, and challenge the enemy America and Britain in order to strive for final victory.

Continental Operations

The continental operation that began in April of this year with the Henan operation has swept through most of Hunan Province, and is connected to the operation launched from Guangdong in South China, attacking the entire Guangxi Province at the same time, destroying the base clusters of Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, which had been the strongholds of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and completely crushing the enemy's plan to surround and bomb our mainland from the mainland, and the enemy's ambition to use this as a base to invade the Chinese mainland. At the same time, by opening up the north-south communication lines on the continent, we will further pursue and destroy the American bases that are retreating further inland, and establish a strategic mobile posture. Furthermore, we have now inflicted a thorough blow on the war capabilities of the anti-Japanese Chongqing army. With the Japanese army advancing rapidly from Guangxi and penetrating deep into Guizhou Province, the war situation has posed an unprecedentedly great threat to the Chongqing regime, causing major turmoil within it. The developments in mainland China are echoing the war operations, which is a very important aspect. At this time, all compatriots active in mainland China should have a renewed determination and move towards the path of achieving major missions.

Decisive Battle in the Philippines

On the other hand, the war forces intercepted the enemy Pacific forces seeking a quick victory in the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines. With the special attack force as the vanguard, they launched a heroic and fierce battle unprecedented in war history, severely damaging the enemy's forces and completely thwarting their attempts. The offensive war power of this battle line is the result of the desperate efforts of everyone on the home front to increase production. This result is manifested in the achievements and special merits of the aviation corps like gods. However, it goes without saying that the determination of victory is tied to future efforts to increase production. That is, the decisive production on the home front is immediately connected to the decisive battle in Leyte Gulf. The enemy's long-distance bombing of our mainland and key areas on the mainland is gradually increasing, so the home front has also suddenly turned into the front line. After the fourth year of the war, the war situation is becoming increasingly severe, and the urge to determine the final victory is closely linked to the increase in production. We must be aware that we must continue to make desperate efforts under enemy bombing."

### Uphold the Belief in Certain Victory; Thoroughly Annihilate the Enemy; Speech by Minister Izubuchi

Minister Izubuchi of the Japanese Army in Shanghai delivered a speech yesterday: Looking back on December 8th three years ago, it was a decisive time for a completely new departure in East Asian history. Today, on the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the entire war situation is undergoing a major transformation and has reached the decisive stage. The year and a half between Guadalcanal and Saipan was a period of patience and concealment for our side. However, this hardship of the trial was by no means unintentionally imposed on the Japanese people. Our 100 million people can endure hardship and persevere in their belief in certain victory.

Thoroughly Destroy American Military Bases

The outburst of anger from the vigorous Japan as a result of the trial was the great war result of annihilating the American fleet in the waters off Taiwan recently, and also became a great contribution to crushing the enemy in the Philippine area, centering on Leyte Island. The incomparably loyal and brave posture of our special attack force on Leyte Island is nothing more than the crystallization of the struggle of 100 million people, and is only the righteous anger towards the enemy America and Britain. Therefore, the entire war situation, with Leyte Island as the decisive battleground in front, has gradually shown a rapid degree of change. On the other hand, on the continental war front, the large-scale operation launched by the Japanese army from Henan in April of this year has passed through Hunan and Guangxi provinces, and has continued to advance deep into Guizhou province. Moreover, the troops that have started a new offensive from the Vietnam side have already been prepared to join forces with the Japanese army fighting in the Nanning area and on the mainland, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. So far, the Chinese mainland has been completely cut off into two parts by this line of Japanese troops running north and south, sweeping away the enemy's American points in the southwestern region that were invading the Chinese mainland, and at the same time, in order to thoroughly destroy the American bases that have retreated inland and stubbornly plan a comeback, a strategic mobile posture has been established.

The Enemy's Delusions Have Been Shattered

Since the Chongqing regime's incident, it has experienced a great threat that it has never experienced before, and major turmoil is also occurring within the regime. Recently, the Chongqing regime's stance has also undergone subtle changes on both the internal and external fronts. The situation in mainland China will have a major situation presenting along with the war's movements. To compatriots who are active in mainland China, it is hoped that today you will renew your own understanding and determination, and strive to complete the major tasks you are shouldering. Those involved in the United States and Britain have also recently declared that "the war against Japan can by no means be concluded in a day or two." The enemy's delusions of boasting of defeating Japan with a quick victory have been shattered, and they have had to decide to prepare for a long-term war.

However, the enemy still relies on its material quantities, and is forcibly attacking in the Pacific region, centering on the Philippines, and at the same time is placing B29 long-range bombing battles on the main island of Japan and the mainland China's areas along the mainland, saying that in order to prevent our country's increased production and disrupt the country, we must further resolve to thoroughly attack them to prevent them from rising again. The real war is in the future, but the one who decides the final victory is connected to the increase in decisive battle production on the home front, whether it can be strongly conducted until the very end.

The enemy also knows this point deeply, so they are bombing our main island in an attempt to prevent our increased production. From now on, it is of course impossible not to know that the territory and the areas along the territory are in fact becoming the front lines. The strengthening decisive battle production on the home front must be carried out desperately under enemy bombing. Not a single one of the 100 million people must have the awareness of a special attack team member.

### Japanese Army Closely Cooperates to Complete Operational Objectives; Speech by Commander Kondo

Commander Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China delivered a speech on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: "Today, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, looking back on the past three years of the Japanese army's heroic battles and thinking about future responsibilities, I sincerely feel a myriad of emotions. Under the Emperor's prestige, the great achievements of destroying the Anglo-Americans are progressing daily. The Greater East Asia countries are also moving towards the path of construction, establishing their foundations. However, the Anglo-American ambitions are constantly strengthening their counter-offensive. At present, with the Philippine area as the center, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is becoming increasingly intense. At this time, the fleet in the China area is closely cooperating with the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, carrying out the Emperor's instructions, and advancing to complete the operational objectives. According to the past year's war situation, the strategic position of China in the war has become more and more important. The future attempts of the enemy Anglo-Americans and the movements of Chongqing should also be given close attention.

The Chinese land and sea armies are carrying out a preemptive strategy on the mainland, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy's offensive. However, in the future situation, there will be no room for even a minute of complacency. All our officers and soldiers, inspired by the gracious imperial rescript, vow to complete the operation.

On the other hand, the implementation of our new policy in mainland China and the progress of Sino-Japanese cooperative construction are breaking through various difficulties and being innovated and enriched with the determination to live and die together. The wills of Mr. Sun Wen and Mr. Wang must be carried out to the end in order to achieve the eternal welfare of the Chinese and Japanese nations. Finally, I would like to express my deep condolences to the fallen soldiers of China and Japan, and express my gratitude to the people of the allied countries for their friendship and assistance."

### Secretary-General Wu Exhorts Citizens to Cooperate in the War; Secretary-General Wu Delivers a Speech

Today is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government delivered the following speech: "It has been three years since our ally Japan launched the Greater East Asia War. In these three years, the allied land, sea, and air forces have been invincible, crushing the Anglo-American forces that occupied East Asia. Recently, great results have been harvested in Taiwan and the Philippines, and we have truly entered the decisive stage. Recalling the beginning of the war, our central government issued a statement to share the joys and sorrows with Japan, and went on to declare war on the Anglo-Americans. With the determination to die together, we seek to realize co-prosperity. The war has progressed smoothly because of the close cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. Other East Asian nations also recognize this war as a revolutionary struggle to win the liberation of the entire East Asian nation, and they have risen up together, taking the same action, sharing the hardships and working hard to eliminate the remaining forces of the Anglo-Americans and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. The achievements of the past three years have been more than ideal. Because we have been able to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as we step into the fourth year, in addition to paying our highest respect to the great achievements of our ally Japan over the past three years, we should deeply realize that the closer the victory of the war approaches, the more we should endure all hardships and overcome all difficulties. Only by adhering to the instructions of Chairman, following the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, and making the greatest effort, can we welcome the coming of light. All my citizens, please encourage each other."

### Tomorrow's Air Defense Day Drill: Air Defense Combat

Tomorrow, the 9th, is the 12th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will conduct various air defense drills as usual. The timing of the alarm drills has been set and published in the newspapers on the 4th. However, in issuing the training alarms, if there is a situation that requires issuing a real alarm, the following measures will be taken: (1) If a real alert alarm situation occurs during the training alarm issuance, no further training alarms will be issued; instead, the real alarm will take precedence. If the training alert alarm issuance exceeds the prescribed time, it will be considered that a real alarm state has been entered. (2) Even if the training alarm has reached the release time, if the air defense situation has not yet ended, the training release alarm will not be issued. (3) If a real air raid alarm situation occurs during the training air raid alarm issuance, no further training air raid alarms will be sounded. In other words, if the training air raid alarm issuance exceeds the prescribed time, it will be considered a real air raid alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it.

Simulated Enemy Aircraft Air Defense Combat

In order to thoroughly implement evacuation drills, during the first training air raid alarm from a certain time to 9:15 AM tomorrow, simulated enemy aircraft will take off and fly over the area, conducting intense air defense combat. Citizens should quickly seek shelter from harm. Police officers and Baojia air defense personnel should further guide citizens to implement evacuation. Streets and lanes should be deserted in order to ensure proficiency. At this time, when the air defense observation posts detect simulated enemy aircraft approaching, they should quickly notify the liaison teams to report to the entire area and implement evacuation drills.

Citizens Must Participate in Training

At the same time, in order to ensure that citizens are proficient in various necessary measures, it is stipulated that when various comprehensive key drills are carried out in various areas, all citizens at the training locations must participate and assist Baojia air defense personnel in implementing rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, evacuation, and other air defense work. They must absolutely not stand idly by, let alone applaud and cheer. Among them, emergency rescue work requires personnel and technology. Whether it is home air defense or group air defense, it is necessary to prepare a full set of equipment and select qualified personnel to take charge. On this day, Huangpu, Old Zha, and other districts will conduct large-scale rescue drills. In short, citizens must conscientiously implement various air defense drills, as well as traffic control and light control, and must not evade or neglect them.

### First Phase of Cotton Cloth Rationing: 700,000 Bolts Issued

The first phase of temporary cotton cloth rationing in the Shanghai Special Municipal District ended on November 30th. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Industry Wholesale Joint Operations Office, 3.45 million ration certificates were issued for this city-wide rationing, and 700,000 bolts of cotton cloth were sold. As for the second phase of cotton cloth rationing, it is still under review by the Commercial and Trade Committee for transfer to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### The Enemy is on the Verge of Collapse: The Road to Certain Victory is Open: Remarks by Naval Attaché Zhenhai

As the decisive battle in the Philippines unfolds, and as we welcome the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we are filled with infinite emotion. Looking back on the achievements of the past three years, our army and navy have carried out incomparably magnificent operations. Now, with absolute confidence in victory, we are closely connected with our allied nations in order to accomplish the goals of the Holy War.

The enemy has occupied Saipan Island, broken into Leyte Island, and repeatedly launched air raids on our homeland. However, viewed from the overall trend of the war situation, we are maintaining an absolutely invincible posture. We have established brilliant results on the Chinese mainland and are gradually moving towards the path of annihilating the arrogant enemy. To this day, the enemy's ships, aircraft, and personnel have suffered enormous sacrifices. Furthermore, in the recent operations in the Philippines, they have suffered a huge blow. The enemy is now nearing the point of collapse, and we deeply feel that the path to our army's certain victory is even more open, and the conviction to realize the ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is even more profound.

At this time of decisive battle, the Chinese side's fleet and army, working closely together, are also shouldering one wing of the Pacific decisive battle, bravely moving forward, in order to break through difficulties, complete important missions, and further realize the prosperity of East Asia, pouring in the efforts of a lion's advance, and with the allied German nation, breaking through unprecedentedly difficult situations in history, daringly aiming for final victory, and striving hard.

The enemy, Britain and the United States, often boast of the collapse of Japan and Germany, and recently exaggerated the war results of the anti-Axis forces, but in reality, they are using this to cover up their defeats.

As we enter the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, we must thoroughly annihilate the arrogant enemies, Britain and the United States, in order to realize the eternal ideals of the 1 billion people of East Asia and the nations of our European allies.

### Reader Aid to Education News: Special Solicitations Come in an Endless Stream: Achieving the Goal Still Requires Collective Effort: The Enthusiasm of Cambridge Seniors and Tailai Team is Commendable

Yesterday, the Cambridge Seniors Team and Tailai each agreed to form a special solicitation team, each donating 40,000 yuan, for which we are deeply grateful. We have long heard of the Cambridge Seniors. The seniors are very enthusiastic about active public welfare, especially in cultivating talent and helping talent, possessing unique insight and courage. In addition to forming their own team, they also agreed to solicit widely. Mr. Luo Hongyi, chairman of Tailai Bank, is eager to help others and is fully committed to social welfare. He has donated large sums to this newspaper's education fund in previous years, benefiting poor students, and his lofty righteousness is admirable. We firmly believe that the wealthy people of Shanghai will definitely not lag behind. We respectfully ask them to initiate a kind thought, record the name of the special education fund solicitation team under the "purpose" section of their checkbook, and subtract an extremely small fraction from their deposits. They will certainly not begrudge this small amount. However, if we obtain this one kind thought, we can accumulate little by little. More than 4,000 excellent poor primary school students will not suffer the pain of being lost. It all depends on your "one kind thought"!

Greater East Asia War Third Anniversary Special Edition No. 1

### A Review and Outlook on the Continental Front: Commander of the Chinese Fleet Reporting Department, Keizo Matsushima

On the continental front, we joyfully celebrate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Under the brilliant war results, we are able to move towards the construction of Greater East Asia, and we feel unparalleled glory. The mission of the Chinese Fleet is to assist the army units in China, to complete the objectives of the Greater East Asia War with land, sea, and air operations, and at the same time to promote the necessary policies. The main tasks are to blockade the 2,850 nautical miles of the Chinese coast, suppress the enemy's sabotage of commerce, ensure the transportation lines of the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and other river basins, and assist the army in annihilating the Chongqing army and eradicating British and American instigation. In this Greater East Asia War, if the Pacific is the surface, then the Chinese coastline is like the lining.

The Pacific and Continental Issues

Looking back at the war situation of the past year, we can see the connection between the Pacific issue and the continental issue. After Italy surrendered last September, the world situation changed. Since December, the German-Soviet war has taken a sharp turn. On the one hand, the United States, with its rapidly advancing material strength as its background, launched a counteroffensive in the Pacific, which had a complex impact on the Chinese front. Therefore, the British and American annihilation war on the Chinese mainland changed from a static state to a dynamic state. The Chinese battlefield, with the Pacific as its surface and lining, is now unfolding in an extremely important scene on both offensive and defensive routes. Especially because the current situation in China is complex, in terms of political strategy and ideological warfare, it is the hottest scene in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, China is the root of the disease of the Greater East Asia War. Because the source of the disease is worsening day by day, it has become inflamed and spread to most of Asia and the Pacific. All the changes in the world have a sensitive impact on China. From this, we can know the importance of the Chinese front.

Japanese Army and Navy Strike First

Looking back at the past year, although the Chongqing army often called for a counteroffensive, it has always been preempted by the Japanese army and remained in a passive position. Important southwestern towns such as Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning have been successively captured, and the enemy is showing its last struggle. As for the American military's actions, they have gradually taken a more active stance, mainly by having the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and U.S. submarines appearing along the Chinese coast disrupt the Japanese transportation lines. Starting in early July, they began using B-29s to bomb the Japanese mainland. What should be especially noted is that the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Nimitz, and others declared that they wanted to cross the Pacific and land directly on the Chinese mainland. Also, on March 1, Stilwell also claimed that the U.S. Army and the Chongqing army would move on the India-Burma front, secretly intending to invade the mainland by land. Subsequently, U.S. military officers gradually inserted themselves into the Chongqing army. The preparations for Nimitz's offensive are progressing day by day. Compared to the actions of these enemy troops, the Chinese Fleet and the Army, working closely together, have been destroying the Chongqing army and eradicating the enemy's air force and submarine activity. Furthermore, they preemptively defeated Nimitz's offensive, launching the Changde Campaign from November to early December. In mid-April, the elite army went along the Yuehan Line, and the navy also opened up extremely difficult boat routes in the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, and Xiang River areas, taking responsibility for transportation and supply, until August 25, when the Xiang River waterway was opened, fighting with all their might under hot, malarial, and air force activity.

Overcoming Difficulties and Completing the Mission

In early August, they attacked the Leizhou Peninsula, and starting in early September, they began operations along the southeastern coast. In Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places, they assisted the army from the sea and air. On the one hand, they also assisted the army units that went up the Pearl River. The naval units in the South China and Hainan Island areas countered the enemy's air force. Furthermore, they also removed the mines laid by the enemy one by one in order to ensure the waterway. During this time, the activity of enemy ships or sailboats was virtually non-existent under the strict action of the Japanese navy. However, the enemy's Yuan warships responded to the progress of the U.S. military's Pacific counteroffensive operation, and their activity became more frequent day by day. They coordinated with the air force to disrupt the Japanese transportation lines. This fleet, which was ordered to protect the sea, overcame difficult situations and was able to complete its mission. On the one hand, because of the special environment of Hainan Island, bandits still resided there. In addition to sweeping away enemy elements, the Japanese army in the area also shot down enemy aircraft and defended maritime transportation. After the realization of the European Second Front in early June, the U.S. military extended its reach to the Mariana Islands in July, making the war situation on the Chinese side the center of the Greater East Asia War.

Ideological Warfare Unfolds More Fiercely

Especially ideological warfare is becoming increasingly fierce and can be called the core of the Greater East Asia War. Every move in the Pacific or European war situation has a subtle impact on the economy, produced by the Chongqing side's political strategy. Japan's new policy towards China can expose this hostile influence. Among them, Shanghai, a microcosm of the world, is even more so. The propaganda conspiracies of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing are extremely profound, nothing more than alienating China and Japan. Their ambition and the depth and breadth of their methods are a disaster for the East Asian people, and we feel pain and anger. Eradicating this root of disaster is the value of the Greater East Asia War.

China Becomes the Final Decisive Battleground

Furthermore, it is not difficult to predict that China will become the final decisive battleground for Britain and the United States against Japan in the future, whether in terms of political strategy or military strategy. This trend has recently begun to materialize. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which numbered only 370 aircraft at the beginning of this year, has now increased to 700. Furthermore, the B-29s, using Chengdu as a transit base, often appear on the mainland and in the Pacific from India. Also, the British and American military are busy collecting intelligence and seizing bases in order to land on the mainland. On the one hand, they are accelerating the construction of the Ledo Road, which is supposedly advancing into Burma. On the other hand, they are increasing the supply of weapons to the Chongqing army, providing American-style training, and inserting a large number of cadres. In addition, important American political figures such as Hurley, Nelson, and Harriman have repeatedly visited Chongqing, playing various schemes and doing their best to prevent the Chongqing side from breaking away from the anti-Axis line, or using post-war policies to win over the Chongqing side. From this, we can see how much the British and American world policies value China.

Trends Among the People of Shanghai

As for Shanghai, enemy planes have recently come to attack frequently, mostly as a restraining action when attacking Japan, or as a psychological warfare tactic, without causing any damage. However, they have had some impact on the local morale and the economic world, and we must be vigilant about this in the future. The trends among the Chinese people are often swayed by British and American propaganda. However, today, informed Chinese people are grateful for the righteousness of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps or the Army Special Attack Corps, because they are of the same East Asian race. Patriotic young people who are worried about the future of East Asia are also worth paying attention to. For example, the movement to donate planes to show gratitude for the Japanese war results is very enthusiastic. Not long ago, the Navy Baojia donated dozens of planes.

The Battle of the Philippines is Advantageous to Japan

Now, with the Philippines as the center, the war situation is unfolding favorably for Japan. With the brilliant war results of the past and the completion of the important missions of the future, the Yamato race must exert its highest degree of strength, build a fortress of certain victory, and complete the long-cherished wish of annihilating Britain and the United States. The above is reported to the Holy Emperor, and to repay the souls of the martyrs who died for their country.

At this time, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese Fleet respectfully study the Rescript granted on November 12, are inspired and invigorated, and their morale is increasingly vigorous. They are moving towards the completion of the final goal, and they firmly believe that due to the united cooperation of all allied nations, they will definitely complete the great cause of building world peace and usher in a brilliant and bright future.

### The Expectations of Chongqing Have Been Betrayed

— Zhang Taihu

Among all the countries in the world, the one that most fervently desired and devoutly prayed for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States was the Chongqing regime. Therefore, on the morning of December 8, 1941, as the curtain rose on the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain, the long-awaited Chongqing regime immediately declared war on Japan and joined the anti-Axis alliance.

Why did Chongqing yearn and pray for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States? Today, surely everyone knows the reason. For the sake of convenience in narration, let me briefly explain the reason. Originally, Chongqing overly believed in Britain and the United States, especially the military strength and abundant resources of the United States, thinking that once Japan went to war with Britain and the United States, the powerful military force of Britain and the United States would immediately defeat the Japanese army, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally. Due to this erroneous belief, Chongqing wholeheartedly yearned and prayed for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States.

Shortly before the outbreak of the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain (the Greater East Asia War), the situation of the Chongqing regime could be said to have been on the verge of collapse. Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, more than four years had passed, and under the fierce attacks of the elite Japanese army, it had suffered repeated defeats, losing vast territories, and falling into a state of extreme poverty, both militarily and economically. The important figures in Chongqing had also lost confidence in repelling the Japanese army and completing the "Resistance and Nation-Building," and they recognized that if things continued in this way, there would be no other way but "decline," and thus they were anxiously seeking a solution. While people in Chongqing were thinking day and night about ways to break out of the predicament and reverse the decline, Japan and the United States began negotiations. Due to the arrogance of the American side, the US-Japan talks were fraught with difficulties, and by August 1941, even outsiders felt that war between Japan and the United States was inevitable. Seeing this situation, the happiest of all was Chongqing. When, on December 8 of that year, the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain finally opened as Chongqing had hoped, according to dispatches from Chongqing at the time, upon receiving the news of Japan going to war with Britain and the United States, everyone in Chongqing was relieved and overjoyed. This was natural, because what Chongqing had prayed for had come true. However, did Chongqing truly achieve the goal it had sought? Did Britain and the United States not betray Chongqing's expectations? Furthermore, after Japan went to war with Britain and the United States, could Chongqing obtain the desired gains?

As the course of the Greater East Asia War over the past three years and the current war situation clearly show, Chongqing's hopes for the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain were completely contrary to its wishes. Not only are the facts contrary to expectations, but also the burden it bears is becoming heavier and heavier, and its position is becoming increasingly difficult.

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing expected that within half a year, or at most a year, after the start of the war, the British and American forces would thoroughly defeat the Japanese army, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally, so Chongqing could sit and wait to repel the Japanese army and achieve the goal of "Resistance and Nation-Building." Unexpectedly, the actual course of the war was not like this at all, and due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, Chongqing's predictions finally turned into fantasy. To expect that the British and American forces could completely defeat the Japanese army in just half a year and to harbor great hope was a grave mistake, a point that people in Chongqing themselves admitted and regretted incessantly. Chongqing's expectations for Britain and the United States had turned into bubbles.

After the start of the war, the British and American forces could not immediately defeat the Japanese army, and the Greater East Asia War clearly became a prolonged war. Chongqing was greatly disappointed and plunged into the depths of bitterness and sorrow, because Chongqing instinctively felt that it had to engage in an even more difficult war against Japan than before the start of the Greater East Asia War. This feeling of Chongqing was accurate, and this matter is now being increasingly realized. The best evidence is the shift in the war situation on the Chinese battlefield after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. After the opening of the Greater East Asia War, although the Japanese army devoted all its strength to engaging in fierce battles with the British and American forces on the main front, the war on the Chinese battlefield did not cease. Moreover, not only did it not cease, but also in coordination with the operations against Britain and the United States, it successively launched the Henan Operation, the Hunan Operation, and so on, and to this day has swept through the important areas of Guangxi, and powerful vanguard units have even broken through the border of Guizhou Province, advancing into certain parts of Guizhou Province with the force of a bamboo splitting. While the Japanese army was facing the strong enemy of Britain and the United States and engaging in a fierce war, it was also carrying out such large-scale operations on the Chinese front, which was something Chongqing had never dreamed of at the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Although the Greater East Asia War started as Chongqing had hoped, Chongqing's military burden was not reduced at all, and it was under high pressure from the Japanese army on all fronts, and the difficulty of resisting the war was several times greater than before, and it still suffered repeated defeats. Henan and Hunan were lost one after another, and all the important balances of Guangxi fell, unable to stop the Japanese army attacking inland like a raging tide. Today, Chongqing's prayer for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States, and the joy at hearing the news of the outbreak of the war, have become laughable. Now, Chongqing is hesitating on the path that those who rely on others must take. The mental blow they have suffered due to the failure of their wishes, and the internal anguish arising from the current situation, are more serious and profound than outsiders can imagine.

The position of the Chongqing regime has become more difficult as a result of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The reason why the spiritual and material burden has become heavier is more appropriately attributed to the inevitable result of Chongqing's hasty declaration of war on Japan and automatic participation in the British and American camp due to the opening of the Greater East Asia War, rather than the Japanese army not relaxing its operations on the mainland.

Before the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States recognized Chongqing as a nearly completely independent regime, and to some extent, respected its autonomy, providing spiritual support and supplying military supplies in terms of substance. In short, they only provided direct or indirect assistance, and did not dare to impose any serious pressure. At that time, although they had the desire to make Chongqing win, from the perspective of the United States at that time, Chongqing was after all an outsider, and they had a somewhat detached attitude towards the Sino-Japanese Incident; this is an undeniable fact. In other words, at that time, the United States certainly had the desire for Chongqing to win, but if it lost, the United States would only feel that this was something that could not be helped. However, once the Greater East Asia War began, Japan became the enemy facing Britain and the United States, so when Chongqing joined their camp, Britain and the United States, especially the United States, immediately changed their attitude towards Chongqing. That is to say, they abandoned the attitude of recognizing the independence of the Chongqing regime in the past and respecting its autonomy, and instead adopted the attitude of thoroughly utilizing Chongqing and taking its jurisdiction as a base for fighting against Japan, in order to win the war against Japan. Since the United States used Chongqing for the war against Japan and took its jurisdiction as a base, it naturally gradually imposed heavy pressure on Chongqing militarily and economically. Now, whether militarily or economically, Chongqing is under the control of the major powers. This is something that everyone already knows. In the eyes of the United States, Chongqing's independence and autonomy have completely disappeared. This is of course a phenomenon that Chongqing had not anticipated at all, but it is also an inevitable trend after the realization of the Greater East Asia War that Chongqing had prayed for.

The Greater East Asia War that Chongqing had devoutly prayed and yearned for has been going on for three full years since its beginning. However, none of the various hopes that Chongqing had for the outbreak and outcome of this war has been realized, and the facts are completely beyond expectations. It would be fine if it was just unexpected that the expectations could not be realized. However, the result of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has made Chongqing's position more chaotic, its burden heavier, and its suffering more profound. At the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, what kind of thoughts will the people of Chongqing have when they look back on the past? "Those who rely on others will surely perish themselves," this sentence speaks the truth. If they can truly realize this, it will be fortunate for Chongqing.

### General Situation of Battles of the China Area Fleet in the Past Year

The general situation of the battles of the China Area Fleet in the past year has shifted to air warfare due to the increase in the number of US Air Force personnel stationed in Chongqing.

Naturally, our Chinese naval forces have been closely monitoring their movements and actively preparing for the next operation by reorganizing war preparations. Here is an examination of the general situation of the past year as follows:

In the Yangtze River area, during the flood season in March of this year, the enemy released floating mines, and bandits also gradually stirred, in order to coordinate. By April, the enemy bandits who were stirring on the banks of the Yangtze River were engaged in attempts to obstruct traffic on the river, and certain attacks also showed a frequent tendency.

At this time, enemy aircraft's air raids on the Yangtze River area were relatively quiet, and the types of aircraft were mostly P-38, P-40, P-51, etc.

In May, the army units launched the Hunan offensive operation. The enemy's air force attacks became more stubborn. Their attack targets were also concentrated on the military facilities on the river banks, and the destruction of boats and supply lines in transit.

However, due to the close cooperation between our army and navy and the brave attacks in the Hunan offensive operation, the enemy on that side made very weak resistance, and our side gradually completed the expected operational goals.

However, the activities of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing were quite active. Since the end of May, they concentrated their actions on our rear transportation, or material accumulation points, and specialized in repeated night attacks.

However, our leisurely mobile waterway work broke through this obstacle and carried out its mission, and together with the army units' advance into the interior, crushed the remnants' intrusion into the garrison area and the enemy aircraft's guerrilla-style attacks.

On June 5, after the fall of Yingtian, the number of B-24s appearing from the US aircraft stationed in Chongqing suddenly increased, especially the attacks on the Wuhan area became more intense.

In mid-July, the enemy air force concentrated its main force to attack the Xiangjiang River basin, attempting to cut off our supply routes. Due to our brave response, their ambition was completely shattered.

In early August, due to the loss of the important point of Changyang, the enemy hastily interfered with traffic on the Yangtze River and destroyed military facilities. They even attached Hinomaru markings to aircraft and suddenly came to blindly bomb. Completely disregarding international morality, they wanted to use deception to carry out their counterattack. On August 25, our naval forces successfully opened up the difficult Xiangjiang waterway, establishing an immortal feat in the Hunan campaign.

South China Area

In the South China area, since the beginning of this year, enemy submarines have appeared slightly, and maritime bandits have attempted to disrupt security in the southwestern islands and the eastern Zhejiang area. It was detected by us, and the attack intentions of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing were still strong, but due to our strict precautions, since March, their movements have gradually become passive.

On the other hand, enemy submarine appearances were slightly more frequent in May of this year. By June and July, they decreased again. After June, the enemy's air operations gradually became more active. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Kitakyushu, echoing the active offensive of the anti-Axis forces in Europe, or the war situation in the Pacific, and gradually presented a decisive battle situation. However, due to our thorough defense techniques, the enemy aircraft were at a loss and only pretended to raid the Japanese mainland, even engaging in psychological warfare.

Recently, in order to cope with the enemy's stubborn mine warfare, we have thoroughly strengthened mine sweeping to ensure the safety of coastal routes, and when our ships are navigating, each battalion of guards, sweeping teams, and aviation units directly and indirectly complete the duty of escorting, and patrol the routes before and after navigation. Countless ships in danger have been assisted.

Hainan Island Area

Regarding the battle progress in the Hainan Island area, first of all, since mid-April, enemy aircraft have adopted a stubborn air raid tactics using moonlit nights. The situation of their attacks also tended towards the north and south campuses. However, their combat power was quite moderate, mainly B-24s, specializing in attempting to attack ships at anchor.

The communist bandits on the island reorganized their remaining forces and gradually expanded their power to expand their territory. However, since late June, our side took the initiative to launch a suppression campaign to prevent their stirring. In addition, the lack of food and clothing further promoted the enemy's surrender.

Central China Area

The progress of operations in the Central China area inevitably reduced the number of attacks on this island area by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. However, the enemy did not stop their reconnaissance of ships and port facilities. They were bravely attacked by us, and each intrusion was repelled. Since July, their actions have been limited to reconnaissance to the extent of reconnaissance, and they have been panic-stricken.

Since early August, the enemy has attempted to smuggle weapons and supplies to this island from the Leizhou Peninsula and the mainland, but because it was blocked by us and the smuggling sailboats in the vicinity were thoroughly eliminated, it has been quite effective.

In addition, since October, the number of attacks by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has increased again, mainly with P-38 and P-40, attempting to reconnoiter and bomb. Due to our strict precautions, there was no effect, and their attacks were only tactical of a psychological warfare nature.

### First Year Record of the Greater East Asia War

— Jin Xing

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8, 1941, Japan's international situation was unfavorable. On the one hand, Britain and the United States intensified their blockade of Japan and adopted the "Far East Active" policy. On the other hand, they made the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, and the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, appear in a pro-Japanese posture, carrying out the so-called "appeasement policy" towards Japan. Japan was also aware of this, and launched a diplomatic offensive against Britain and the United States. Nomura and Kurusu's visit to the United States was certainly aimed at achieving true peace, but the Japanese side had made thorough preparations.

After the start of the German-Soviet War's Operation Typhoon, the German army surrounded Moscow, but due to the severe cold weather, the sharp offensive was changed to a defensive posture of consolidating positions. Britain and the United States took this opportunity to strengthen their pressure on Japan, and the imperial rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States on December 8 was finally issued like lightning.

At 6:00 a.m. on the 8th, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters of the Army and Navy announced: "The imperial army and navy are in a combat state against Britain and the United States in the Western Pacific."

Pearl Harbor Naval Battle

The Japanese Navy suddenly broke through the United States' lifeline—Hawaii. According to the detailed report of the Pearl Harbor battle published by Reuters, the United States Navy on the defense side has been annihilated. The main war results: (1) Battleships 5, armored battleships 2, transport ships 2. (2) battleships 4, cruisers 2, light cruisers 4, destroyers 2. Enemy land and sea air force losses: approximately 5 planes, and over 4 ships. Also, Japanese submarines sank 1 battleship.

The victory at Pearl Harbor opened the first page of the Greater East Asia War history. At 11:00 a.m. on the 8th, Japanese army and navy units in Shanghai entered the public concessions on both sides of the Suzhou River. The weapons of the American marine teams in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao were also disarmed on the same day. On the Guangzhou front, the Japanese army also entered the Shamian British Concession on the same day.

Entry into Thailand

Japan's entry into Thailand obtained a base for attacking Malaya from Vietnam. Japan isolated land communications between Malaya and Burma, while also threatening the Yunnan-Burma Road.

On the 11th, the Thai government announced a defense alliance between Japan and Thailand. The following November 15, it officially declared war on Britain and the United States. In the Greater East Asia War, Japan had the Thai army as an ally.

Malaya Naval Battle

Within three days of the start of the war, the Japanese naval air force captured the main force of the British Far East Fleet off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, sinking the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse, the so-called unsinkable ships. The British and American general staff were greatly shocked, and the people of the two countries were greatly criticized. As a result, they had to reorganize the air and sea forces and combat command system in East Asia and stop the Second Front in Europe.

At the beginning of the war, in addition to the large-scale attack on Hawaii, the Japanese army also destroyed British and American military bases such as Manila and Singapore, and annihilated their main fleets. Within a week, the United States' route of attack on Japan in the central Pacific was completely destroyed.

Occupation of Hong Kong

On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army air force in South China attacked the Kowloon Airport. On the evening of the 9th, the army had entered the defense line on the back of Kowloon. On the 12th, it advanced towards Kowloon and eliminated the British army. On the morning of the 14th, it launched a general attack on Hong Kong. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Governor of Hong Kong surrendered unconditionally, and on the 26th, the Japanese army entered Hong Kong.

Philippines Campaign

On December 8, the Japanese army and navy air force suddenly attacked the American airfields and air forces in the Philippines, giving them a fatal blow. On the morning of the 10th, the enemy began to land at Xiaparan on the northwest coast of Luzon Island, but was unable to land. On the 22nd, the Japanese troops landed at Lingayen Bay, north of Manila. From the 24th to the 27th, landings occurred one after another in various places. On New Year's Day, the Japanese army completely occupied Manila. By early May, the Japanese army had taken possession of the entire Philippines.

Borneo Campaign

Borneo is the second largest island in the world. British territory accounts for two-sevenths, and the northern coast is an oil-producing area. On December 16, the Japanese army landed on this island, echoing Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Philippines, and controlled the entire South China Sea. After a month of bloody battles, it completely occupied British Borneo by February 4.

Singapore Campaign

The Japanese army landed on the Malay Peninsula on December 8 and occupied Penang on the 17th. On January 3, it occupied the Kota Bharu air base. On the 23rd, it occupied Ipoh, the world's largest tin-producing area, crossed the Panla Sea, and captured Ipoh. On January 31, Johor Bahru fell. In more than fifty days, the Japanese army advanced 1,100 kilometers with unprecedented speed.

Singapore was a military fortress for British aggression in East Asia. It took a long time and 400 million yuan to finally become the target of the Japanese army. On February 8, it began to attack Singapore. On the 11th, it captured Bukit Timah. On the 14th, street fighting in Singapore began, and it was completely occupied the next day. According to estimates, this battle resulted in the capture of 95,000 British troops and a large number of military supplies. This gave Britain a great shock, and Churchill's cabinet was once in crisis. This is considered to be an extremely glorious victory in the history of the Greater East Asia War.

Dutch East Indies Campaign

The Dutch East Indies is a major link in the ABCD line. When the Japanese army was conducting good consecutive bombing runs in British Borneo. Large-scale bombing raids were also carried out on various parts of the Dutch East Indies. On January 11, the Japanese army landed at Tarakan on the east coast. On the 25th, it occupied the Balikpapan oilfield area, and on January 27, western Borneo was also pacified.

By mid-March, the entire Dutch Borneo had been occupied.

In addition, on January 26, the Japanese army entered Celebes in the Sunda Islands, posing a major threat to Australia. In late February, the Japanese army occupied southern Sumatra. After the Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese army landed on Java from three sides on March 1. On March 5, Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, was completely pacified, and three days later, the Dutch East Indies Governor and the Allied commander surrendered to the Japanese army.

Burma Campaign

In late February 1942, Japanese army units launched a deep attack into Burma, and the navy also decided to eliminate the British fleet in the Bay of Bengal. In early March, Britain suffered heavy losses in the Bay of Bengal. Japanese aircraft also raided Ceylon Island, constantly bombing warships in the port, and sinking cruisers and aircraft carriers one after another. Since then, Japanese special submarines have also been anchored on the western shore of the Indian Ocean, and have achieved considerable war results.

In the land battle in Burma, the Japanese army launched a general attack on Rangoon from March 3 and occupied it completely five days later. Chongqing immediately sent troops to relieve the siege, but before the camp could be established, the British army was retreating in large numbers. On April 29, the Japanese army occupied Lashio, and in early May, it captured Mandalay and entered Cao. The Chongqing heavy team was cut off. On the 4th, the Japanese army entered Longling, and in less than five days, they attacked Tengchong, threatening the safety of Yunnan Province. The Japanese army has poured into the gates of India. The oppressed nations of India are starting to stand up in the Greater East Asia War.

Attack on the American Mainland

Maritime traffic on the American Pacific coast also began to be threatened by Japanese submarines during the Greater East Asia War. On December 8, a 100-mile American transport team was attacked. On the 11th, the American authorities reported that an American oil tanker had been attacked. On December 30, the Japanese submarine I-26. On February 24, the Japanese army began shelling American military facilities along the coast of California, achieving significant war results. The entire United States was shocked.

Expedition to the Aleutians

The Aleutian Islands are cold and snowy all year round. Dutch Harbor is the largest naval base in that area. On June 4 and 5, 1942, Japanese aircraft carriers launched a sudden attack on the Dutch Harbor airfield, inflicting heavy damage.

Battle of Midway

On June 5, 1942, the Japanese air force began to attack the Midway Island air base. American ships were also discovered in the ocean north of the island, and they were bombed, achieving considerable war results.

Various Battles in the South Pacific

While the battle for the East Indies and Burma was being waged, the Japanese army was advancing into the South Pacific.

On January 24, 1942, the Japanese army landed on New Britain Island and New Ireland Island in eastern New Guinea, controlling the throat of Australia. On March 8, the Japanese army landed in Salamaua and other places on the north coast of New Guinea, and subsequently, the western half of New Guinea and most of the Solomon Islands were occupied. Forming an arc with the East Indies. Britain and the United States suffered repeated losses and were forced to concentrate their fleet in Australia, luring the Japanese army to the Coral Sea to the north. The Japanese army waited for an opportunity, and in early May, the Battle of the Coral Sea took place, with Britain and the United States losing battleships, aircraft carriers, and aircraft.

Three Naval Battles of the Solomon Islands

In order to compete with Japan for control of the southwestern Pacific, their joint fleet attacked the central Solomon Islands on August 7, sending troops to land. In the air battle, the British and American flagships were sunk. On the evening of the 8th, a fierce night battle lasted for half an hour, and sixteen British and American flagships were reported to have been sunk or destroyed.

Second Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands: New American warships appeared one after another, launching a strong attack on Guadalcanal Island. On August 24, the two sides encountered each other in the eastern Pacific of the Solomon Islands. Aircraft from each side bombed the other, and two American aircraft carriers caught fire. In the two months after the second battle, there were occasional conflicts in the Solomon Sea. The enemy aircraft lost more than four times as many as the Japanese.

On October 26, a new American large fleet encountered the Japanese army in the northern ocean of Santa Cruz Island. Two American aircraft carriers, one battleship, one destroyer, and three cruisers were sunk, while the Japanese side suffered minor damage to two aircraft carriers and one cruiser.

On November 12, the Third Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands was triggered: Japanese aircraft attacked American ships in the Sealark Channel. Two American cruisers and nineteen aircraft were sunk. Only three transport ships were burned. On the evening of the same day, the fleets of both sides bombarded each other, resulting in the sinking of eight American cruisers and the heavy damage of six destroyers. The battle continued on the 13th. Both sides suffered damage. On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army successfully landed on Guadalcanal. At night, the fleets of both sides engaged in a fierce battle again in the waters of Savo Island. A Japanese destroyer single-handedly penetrated the enemy's formation for close combat, sinking one American heavy cruiser and destroying three destroyers. Other Japanese ships also engaged in close combat with the American fleet, achieving great war results.

From the first Solomon Sea Battle on August 7 to the third Solomon War on November 14, the dire situation of the three major battles in the South Pacific can be imagined. Japan has already seized control of the Pacific, achieved unprecedented victory, and established an invincible position.

### Record of the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War

— Zi Wan

Before and after the Anglo-American major counteroffensive in the Solomon Islands, the achievements of the Japanese Navy can be described as unprecedented, breaking the Anglo-American's major combat power in East Asia and establishing an invincible foundation in the Pacific. In the first phase, the comprehensive location where the Japanese naval power was brought to bear was the Solomon Islands. Furthermore, in order to completely cut off the connection between the United States and Australia, and the connection between Australia and Hawaii, it was necessary to establish an important supply base in the South.

Afterwards, the inevitable entry into the second phase involved increasing naval bases, securing the Southern Treasure House, and occupying various strongholds to crush the Anglo-American counteroffensive. Looking at the Greater East Asia War in 1943, the Japanese army adopted a "defensive offensive," actively preparing for the military and political forces for continued war, in order to seek victory in the future decisive battle. By 1944, the focus of the American counteroffensive was focused on the Central Pacific, resulting in major battles in the Marshall Islands and Truk Islands, attempting to advance from there and recapture Guam and the Philippines. However, upon closer examination of the strategies and tactics of both sides, the Anglo-American counteroffensive was difficult to achieve.

The various battles of the Greater East Asia War in 1943 are described below:

(1) South Pacific Area

Outer Perimeter Operations

After several disastrous defeats in the Solomon Islands campaign, the American side had to change its strategy, implementing the so-called "base hopping," establishing points, strengthening supply lines, and capturing base points. The Japanese side, of course, also made every effort to assist its bases, bombing American transport convoys to weaken their combat power. Therefore, in early 1943, foreign operations in the South Pacific were extremely active.

(1) Battle of Guadalcanal and Buna — On August 7, 1942, the Americans landed on Guadalcanal, and the Japanese army fought alone; the Japanese army in Buna also assumed the task of containment. In early January 1943, the Japanese army achieved its goal and withdrew.

(2) Battle of Rennell Island — On February 30, the Japanese air force carried out a surprise attack on the American fleet off the southeastern coast of Rennell Island in the southern Solomon Islands, with considerable results.

(3) Battle of Isle of France — On February 1, the Japanese air force attacked American maritime forces off the southern end of the island, and engaged in aerial combat, sinking an American cruiser and a destroyer, and shooting down eighty-six aircraft.

(4) Battle of Florida Island — On April 7, large formations of Japanese aircraft launched a major bombing raid on Tulagi Harbor and other locations on Florida Island, sinking an American cruiser, a destroyer, and ten transport ships, and shooting down thirty-seven American aircraft.

(5) Air Battle of Espiritu Santo — On June 5, American aircraft attacked, and were intercepted by the Japanese naval air force, which shot down more than twenty American aircraft.

(6) Air Battle of Nauru Island — On May 13 and early June, Japanese aircraft attacked Nauru Island four times, shooting down a total of one hundred and forty-five American aircraft.

(7) Air Battle off Lunga Point — On June 16, the Japanese naval air force, in large formations, fiercely attacked American transport convoys off Lunga Point, resulting in a major battle in which approximately 53,000 tons of American ships were sunk. On the night of August 13, Japanese naval aircraft launched another strong attack on the same sea area, with remarkable results.

(8) Japanese Air Raids on American Bases — In addition to eliminating American forces in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army also continuously attacked American rear supply bases, especially the attacks on Canton Island, Funafuti, and Penrhyn Island.

Death of Commander Yamamoto

Marshal-Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku was honorably appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet in 1940. During this Greater East Asia War, he assisted the army in occupying various parts of the South Seas, and annihilating the main force of the Anglo-American Pacific Fleet, achieving great meritorious service. In April of this year, while personally going to the front line to command the war, he unfortunately died in action, which is extremely regrettable. His heroic spirit is deeply felt throughout Japan. His position was succeeded by General Koga Mineichi.

Battle for Bases

(1) Battle of Rendova Island — On June 30, strong American forces landed, and the Japanese naval air force bombed them repeatedly for five consecutive days. On August 1, another fierce bombing was carried out, causing significant losses to the American side.

(2) Battle of New Georgia Island — In early July, American forces reappeared on the island and on Roviana Island, and fierce fighting immediately broke out, among which the Battle of Kula Gulf and the American landing on Munda were the most brutal.

(3) Battle of Vella Lavella Island — On the evening of August 14, American warships entered and exited the area, and the Japanese army launched a head-on attack, totaling more than ten times. By the 21st, the results were confirmed to be the sinking or destruction of three American cruisers, eight destroyers, and twelve transport ships. After this, the war continued.

(4) Night Battle off Kolombangara Island — On the night of July 12, the Japanese naval flotilla engaged in a night battle with American cruisers north of the island, and many American ships were sunk. After that, naval and air battles continued in the area. (To be continued)

### Aspects of the Inevitable Victory of the Greater East Asia War

— Zhang Qian

(1) Modern warfare is a total competition of politics and economics.

The so-called "politics" refers to domestic and foreign affairs; the so-called "economics" refers to manpower and material resources. The foundation of military victory is built on the two pillars of politics and economics. Therefore, to judge who can achieve final victory in the war, we must not only pay attention to the evolution of the military situation, but also pay attention to whether both sides of the war can ensure that their human resources are not lacking, the supply of material resources is constantly replenished, and whether there is unified domestic politics to support the war, and flexible diplomacy to assist the war.

The Greater East Asia War began on December 8th three years ago, and what is its future? In these three years, its destiny has already been determined. On this point, we can review it based on the above-mentioned political and economic conditions.

(2) First, let us examine whether the first category of economics in the Greater East Asia War—the content of manpower—has the confidence to achieve final victory.

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, following Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and India successively joined the war, using the people of the entire East Asia as the backing for the Greater East Asia War; this occupies an overwhelming advantage in manpower, thus establishing the foundation for defeating the British and Americans in manpower.

East Asia has one billion people. This one billion people accounts for the vast majority of the world's population. Using the manpower of one billion people to defend East Asia and resist the few British and Americans who need to take care of both East and West, it is undoubtedly possible to complete its mission.

Mencius once said: "A few cannot resist the many."

Using such a "many" manpower to eliminate a part of the evil forces of the British and American aggression against East Asia, its victory is inevitable.

—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the first reason.

(3) Is the second category of economics in the Greater East Asia War—the quantity of material resources—sufficient to lead to final victory? This also needs to be examined.

It is a well-known fact that the British and American homelands lack various production resources and need to extract them from their colonies. As for the British and American lifelines that they rely on for production and supply—their colonies—most are scattered on islands in the South Pacific, such as the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, New Guinea, Borneo, and the Philippines... However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, these East Asian territories containing abundant material resources were all transferred from the hands of the British and Americans to the hands of the Japanese army in no time. From then on, the Japanese military cut off the British and American lifeline of material resources.

The British and Americans lost the material resources they relied on to contend for hegemony in the Pacific.

Japan has added the material resources needed to defend East Asia.

As such, one positive and one negative, the material resource difference between the British and Americans and Japan has become increasingly huge. The Greater East Asia War, with this huge supply of material resources, is bound to win.

—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the second reason.

Next, we need to talk about the first category of politics in the Greater East Asia War—the domestic policy issue.

The "domestic policy" issue here does not refer to the domestic policy issues of individual countries, but rather to the internal issue of the unity of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia.

Then, can all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia be on the same front and align their steps?

Iron-like facts are before our eyes—

Japan declared: The Greater East Asia War is a war in which the entire East Asian nation seeks co-prosperity and co-existence, ensuring eternal peace in East Asia; therefore, China vowed to sincerely express "co-existence and co-death," and Manchuria expressed firm cooperation. Subsequently, from Thailand, Burma, the Philippines... to all ethnic groups throughout the East Asian region, the "Greater East Asia Declaration" expressed their enthusiasm for unity and their determination to align their steps. This is tantamount to a giant fist thrown at the British and Americans, this giant fist is telling the British and Americans: All ethnic groups in East Asia are united in sincerity, fighting the British and Americans to the end to seek liberation together.

An ancient saying goes: "Heaven's timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony."

The Greater East Asia War has the superior condition of "human harmony," so what doubt is there about victory?

—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the third reason.

Then what about the second category of politics—the diplomatic situation?

The diplomatic issue after the entire East Asia became a "one-country group" is not a question of how countries within the group should hold their cooperative hands tightly and always adhere to their original intentions, but rather how to obtain powerful allied countries outside the group.

Regarding this, the place we should focus on is the connection between the East Asian Axis and the European Axis.

The connection between the East Asian Axis and the European Axis has always been so strong, which is a brilliant achievement of the Greater East Asia War in diplomacy. We will not discuss how the European Axis is encountering today, but the formation of the European Axis has created a huge pressure on the British and Americans. This is an undeniable fact. This fact has added infinite confidence to the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

The British and Americans have been restrained by a large part of their military power under the bombing of the European Axis, even if they still have the ambition to use a part of their power to harass East Asia. Then how small is it in front of the total power of the entire East Asian Axis! "Halsey led the Third Fleet and Spruance led the Fifth Fleet... Since October 10th, operations have been launched in Okinawa... After the battle, the main force of the Third Fleet has been annihilated; next, the American MacArthur invaded Lei Qin Bay via New Guinea, and since October 19th, from the waters of Hao Bay to the waters of the Philippine Sea, through the brave battles of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force, and the dispatch of the Japanese Combined Fleet, the enemy's elite has been eliminated."

——It can be seen that the Greater East Asia War has not only achieved military victories by establishing a diplomatic alliance, but also has acquired many allies overseas.

—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the fourth reason.

(6) The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, having already been fully equipped with all the conditions, the last question is how to gather total strength to use all these superior conditions to strive for final victory.

The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War is not only a matter of the prosperity and decline of Japan alone, but rather a question of whether the entire East Asia decides whether it will be a slave or a master. Understanding this, then except for those who are willing to be slaves, everyone should align their steps, move forward towards the path of light, and contribute everything to the cause of eternal peace in East Asia, with an absolutely sincere heart, be united as "co-existing and co-dying" East Asian brothers, without distinguishing between each other.

The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, as long as the East Asian brothers forever hold their fists that do not yield to the enemy before, and give blow for blow!

### Settling the Blood Debt of the Nation

— Wu

Three years have passed since the Greater East Asia War! During these three years, the army, navy, and air force of our allied country Japan have been fighting bitterly with the stubborn British and American enemies at all times. Their glorious achievements of bravely killing the enemy and regarding death as going home can truly shock the heavens and make the ghosts cry! And China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, India, and the Philippines have either contributed materials as much as possible to enhance military production, or organized national volunteer armies to personally go to the front line to cooperate in combat! This kind of strong front of one heart and one mind, with everyone pooling their wisdom and efforts, is of course due to the spirit and practice of the Greater East Asia Conference's joint declaration, and also due to the awakening of the East Asian peoples and their uprising in self-defense, which is a fact that cannot be ignored. Relying on this point of national self-awareness, Japan was able to exert its divine courage and strength at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War to defeat the bases where the British and Americans were attempting to control East Asia one by one, and it is also relying on this point of national self-awareness that all the oppressed and small ethnic groups in East Asia believe that the Greater East Asia War is the only opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the British and Americans. Therefore, although the war is still in a stalemate, the foundation for a decisive victory has indeed been firmly established, which is something that no one can deny.

Tokutomi Sohō once said: "The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has three stages: first, for the self-defense of the imperial country Japan; second, for the liberation of the East Asian peoples; and third, for the construction of a new world order. These three stages are not mutually exclusive. From a flat perspective, they are three in one; from a three-dimensional perspective, they are three stages in one reality." The late Toyama Mitsuru also said: "In the past long period, the world led by Britain and the United States has degenerated into a world of materialism, utilitarianism, and excessive development of selfish psychology. Now that Britain and the United States are about to decline, in order to refresh the world, the entire human race in the world should abandon the gains and losses of their own immediate interests, place their minds and bodies in a state of selflessness, and strive for others, competing with each other in a friendly manner, so that every place on earth becomes a happy land for all people." Both elders, with their years of wisdom, spoke out as famous words and theories, from which we can know that this Greater East Asia War is a war that is "correct in name and fair in language," and is a war concerning the life and death of the entire East Asian nation. All people with blood and energy should firmly believe, vow to kill the enemy to the death, this is without needing any further explanation.

If we look at the history of British and American aggression against East Asia, then among the East Asian countries, except for Japan, India was lost to Britain in 1858, Burma was also lost to Britain in 1886, and the Philippines was secretly changed to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1898, and our Republic of China has also been setting up concessions, administrative powers, customs administrative powers, and consular jurisdiction by Britain since the Treaty of Nanjing concluded in 1842 due to the Opium War, so that the powers have also sought these illegal rights, so the national sovereignty of our country has been obviously infringed; The United States again forced China to recognize the principle of "open door, equal opportunity" in 1899, and in 1902, it enacted a law that not only applied to the mainland of the United States, but also to its territories such as Hawaii and the Philippines, permanently banning Chinese immigrants from entering the country. Other countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Iraq, and Arab countries are nominally independent but are actually controlled by Britain; others such as Malaya, North Borneo, Ceylon, Aden, and Cyprus are all British colonies. Therefore, before the Greater East Asia War occurred, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in Asia accounted for 19.6% of the total area of Asia of 42 million square kilometers, of which 8 million square kilometers were divided by Britain and 3 million square kilometers were divided by the United States. The Asian population is 111.3 million, and those enslaved by Britain account for 77.3% of them, and those enslaved by the United States account for 11.5% of them. And among the population enslaved by Britain, four-fifths are Asians, and among the population enslaved by the United States, Asians account for more than four-fifths. What a disgrace this is! Moreover, since the British and Americans invaded East Asia, the suffering of political restraint and the tragedy of economic exploitation suffered by our East Asian nations are simply too numerous to count! Fortunately, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the heroic achievements of the Japanese army, the deeply rooted forces of the British and Americans in East Asia were broken one by one, so that the weak and small nations of East Asia who had been under oppression for a long time have been liberated from now on, and Burma, the Philippines, and India have also successively announced the establishment of independent countries, adding a glorious and splendid page to the history of our East Asian nation, which is very gratifying.

However, looking at the above situation, our East Asian nations have been the object of British and American aggression and oppression for hundreds of years. In the past few centuries, Britain has seized colonies all over the world through its cunning policy of cunningly seizing and taking by force, and has alienated the Asian countries, using their mutual opposition to reap the benefits. The United States took the Spanish-American War as an opportunity to carry out aggression in the Pacific and Asia, and after World War I, it shared its ambition to dominate the world with Britain. And the various wonderful theories of international justice and world peace that Britain and the United States usually advocate are completely helping to promote the division and struggle of East Asian countries, in order to continue political aggression and economic exploitation forever, and even to use education and culture and other beautiful names to make the ethnic groups lose their national self-awareness and self-confidence, so that they can conflict with each other and kill each other, in order to achieve their hope and maintain their superior position. Therefore, although the East Asian countries and ethnic groups have individually and continuously revolted against the aggression of the British and Americans, due to the lack of unity and strength, or being suppressed by the British and American military forces, or being alienated and divided by the British and Americans, they have all failed one after another. In the years before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the ambition of the British and Americans to enslave East Asia became more and more undisguised and more and more vicious. The most important thing was to obstruct the national relations between China and Japan and promote the Sino-Japanese Incident, and then to hinder the solution of the Incident, all the way to the present, Chongqing still remains unchanged in its policy of relying on the British and Americans, which is deeply rooted in the sinister trick of the British and Americans!

Now, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Tokutomi Sohō said in National Inevitable Victory: "All our citizens must know that this war has absolutely no possibility of compromise. There is only one road, victory, victory, and victory to the end!" The significance of this decisive battle is not only that the Japanese citizens should know it, but also that the East Asian people should deeply understand it! Because this war is an opportunity for our East Asian nations to settle hundreds of years of blood debt with the British and Americans, only victory is allowed, and defeat is not allowed. Victory means being the master of East Asia, and defeat means being the slave of the British and Americans forever! In the past, an Indian girl, Binoda Das Habenger, was arrested and sentenced to death for assassinating Provincial Wei Stale Jackson. She shouted passionately, "I am ashamed to be born as a slave of England, and I hope to die as an independent Indian!" It is deeply believed that this is not only the call of an Indian girl! It should be the call of all human beings in East Asia who have the spirit of independence and autonomy! All of you, the various countries and ethnic groups of East Asia! I hope that you will all rise up together, strive to fight hard, and today it has become a situation of either you or me, and there is no room for hesitation!

### The Greater East Asia War and the Kamikaze Spirit

— Hua Zhi

Like a collapsing building, a noisy disturbance, and the failures of the Three Kingdoms, today, the allied nation of Japan resembles silkworms consuming mulberry leaves, tirelessly manifesting the "Kamikaze Spirit" to inflict fatal blows upon the enemy. Enemy warships, under the power of the Kamikaze, are utterly destroyed at the bottom of the sea; the enemy's manpower and material resources are largely annihilated in the roar of the Kamikaze.

The so-called Kamikaze spirit is to seek the certainty of our death to achieve the certainty of victory, and to repay the nation's kindness even in the slightest. This is a spirit of utmost greatness, strength, purity, loyalty, and sincerity, the embodiment of the Japanese national soul, and the crystallization of Eastern spiritual civilization.

The Kamikaze spirit of Japan has a long history. Looking back to the era of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition, the Mononobe clan and other tribes did not dare to stand against this Kamikaze spirit, and it became the driving force for establishing the nation. In more recent times, such as during the Mongol invasions and the Russo-Japanese War, this spirit was also promoted and glorified. However, the unprecedented manifestation of the Kamikaze spirit began with the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a liberation war unprecedented in ancient times, and the Kamikaze spirit is a spirit of sacrifice unprecedented in the history of warfare. With such a heroic spirit combined with such a large-scale war, brilliant results are naturally produced. The special attack squadrons have taken the Kamikaze spirit to its peak.

The first instance was on the morning of December 8th of the Showa 16th year (Republic of China 30th year), the very day the Greater East Asia War broke out, when the Japanese special attack squadron ventured to break into the enemy's Pearl Harbor and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's main Pacific fleet day and night, achieving great results. Among them, the sinking of the American Arizona-class battleship with a torpedo is a glorious deed worthy of remembrance for centuries to come.

The brave warriors who participated in this special attack squadron were all the most outstanding soldiers of the Japanese Navy. Their sacrifice was voluntary, but they were determined never to return. Let us look at the last words of the nine heroic martyrs, such as Lieutenant Commander Iwao Shinji's words written on a painting for his mother: "The cherry blossom should fall when it is time to fall, and only then will it be worthy of being a great Yamato flower admired by all." Major Okuyama Masaji's final poem: "Aim for the target, make sure to buy, weak mouth 觔 (unable to translate), then great joy, the bright moon is also bright." Sergeant Seijo Kiyoshi's words: "As long as there is still breath, I must be loyal to my duty. The place to seek meeting will be the Yasukuni Shrine." Only with such a tragic determination could they lay the foundation for the prelude to the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

The second special attack was on May 31st of Showa 17th year (Republic of China 31st year), when the Japanese Navy gave a heavy blow to the enemy's navy in the southwestern Pacific in the Coral Sea, and then used special submarines to sneak into the distant Diego Suarez port in Madagascar, west of the Indian Ocean, to launch torpedoes at the British battleships and cruisers in the port. At the same time, they also attacked the port in Australia, sinking warships and greatly alarming the enemy. Three submarines returned from this mission, but those brave warriors who became martyrs will always be the object of people's respect and admiration.

The third special attack squadron was the Kamikaze attack squadron, which first achieved success on October 25th of this year. Its impact on the world was no less than, and perhaps even greater than, that of Germany's new V-1 weapon. The members of the Kamikaze squadron were young men aged 19 to 24. With their sincere determination to sacrifice themselves for the nation, they decided to use themselves as human bombs along with their planes to crash into enemy ships and die together, fulfilling their slogan of "one plane for one ship." The Shikishima squadron, the first Kamikaze attack squadron, set off from its base early and achieved victory, sinking one aircraft carrier and one cruiser, and damaging one aircraft carrier. Such lightning-fast results could only be achieved by Kamikaze warriors. After that, news of victories by the second and third Kamikaze units continued to arrive.

At the same time, special attack units from the army also went into action, including the Mandara, Fugaku, Yasukuni, and Hakko units, all of which achieved remarkable battle results. The greater the battle results, the more people volunteered to join, all determined to continue the legacy of the fallen heroes and inflict even greater and more fierce blows on the enemy, the Americans and British.

The infinitely loyal and brave, relentless actions of the Japanese Kamikaze warriors have made the enemy tremble with fear, and have amazed the world. However, the Kamikaze spirit not only fills the front lines, but also permeates the rear. The people in the rear who are responsible for military production, hearing the frequent reports of victories from the front lines, are even more determined to increase aircraft production at all costs. The warriors on the front lines are displaying the Kamikaze attack spirit, and the warriors in the rear are displaying the Kamikaze production spirit. The combination of the two creates a permanently great spirit.

During this Greater East Asia War era, the allied nation of Japan is displaying unprecedented... How about the silk circles of "True Life and Death"? We have already... with Japan's... alliance treaty, have already declared war on Britain and the United States, and have already participated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. Everything said on paper has already been done. Everything that can be written on paper has been written down. But... what about...? We shouldn't say that we don't have the Kamikaze spirit of certain death, we don't even have the spirit to dare to die. We shouldn't say that we don't have the spirit of certain death, we don't even have the spirit of selflessness. The slogan of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is sung loudly, but what good does it do?

The Kamikaze spirit is originally the crystallization of Eastern spiritual civilization. Japan has it, why doesn't China have it? I think it's not that China doesn't have it, but it has been buried and lost due to the poisoning by the British and Americans in the past, and due to its own degeneration within. How can we awaken our own Kamikaze spirit, so that it can merge with the Kamikaze spirit of our allies and generate a real force to advance the war? I think we must start from today and strive to achieve the following three points first:

1.  Firmly establish the will to win. The enemy, the British and Americans, are now at the end of their rope, making a last-ditch effort with their remaining material and human resources, but they have suffered disastrous defeats on both the Pacific and mainland battle lines, and are attempting to disrupt people's hearts with B-29 aircraft and propaganda tools. The result will be futile. We must be perceptive of the enemy's conspiracies and firmly believe in victory, so that the war can be advanced quickly and victory can be achieved soon.

2.  Work hard in our respective positions. Our army has not yet directly participated in the war, but there will be a day when it does participate, and our work in our respective positions can directly and indirectly contribute to combat power. When the armies of the participating countries are not on the battlefield, the citizens of the participating countries should double their efforts to contribute to the war with materials and manpower. We fear only that there are not enough materials, and that our strength is not enough.

3.  Promote the spirit of loyalty and martyrdom. The Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness. The entire nation of Japan, united in hatred of the enemy, with one hundred million hearts as one, is fighting bravely. Our country should also eliminate the decadent atmosphere from now on, promote the spirit of loyalty and righteousness, and keep pace with our allies. In particular, we hope that the people under the Chongqing regime will realize the wrongfulness of protracted war and return together to participate in the war of righteousness.

Although we cannot immediately become Kamikaze warriors, if we can achieve the above three points, then we have at least been inspired by the Kamikaze spirit. We should strive for progress, and not give up on ourselves. Mencius said, "Seek and you will find it, abandon and you will lose it." The war situation has reached its final stage. If we don't strive hard, when will we wait?

### Song of Victory

— Zhang Yanling

We must emit a resonating belief from our cells.

We must shoulder the national crisis from hardship!

We should unite to resist foreign invasion.

The Greater East Asia War is a national liberation war.

A century of humiliation will be wiped away.

The people here are preparing for great sacrifices,

But we must dedicate ourselves to the motherland.

Light the deep shouts from the depths of our souls;

To reconquer the rebel nations!

Leyte, Pearl Harbor

What glorious battles these are.

There is the true meaning of life in the darkness

A bloody place can be one’s own burial ground!

We are the descendants of the Han and Tang dynasties...

The spirit of the Han and Tang dynasties must be preserved by ourselves.

### Our Roar

— He Tuofu

Black smoke pillars rising from the fire,

Rolling up snow-white giant waves,

The earth's fire has erupted!

The entire world

The entire people

Are going crazy!

Roar! Roar! Roar!

Hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia,

Our roar shakes the nine heavens.

Our iron crows, giant ships, and submarines form a Great Wall at sea;

Hurricanes, torrential rain,

Sulfur smoke, gunpowder mist,

The collision of human bombs,

The giant spirit of East Asia roars,

And the waters of the Pacific boil!

Bury the greedy ambition of the British and Americans

In the giant waves of the Pacific.

Roar! Roar! Roar!

This is the roar of hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia,

The oppressed break free from centuries of shackles,

Today, we need independence,

Freedom, and light!

### Annihilate England and America

— Shi Yinsheng

England and America, white demons,

Using opium as the vanguard, enticing

Using guns and cannons as the shield, coercing

They treat China as a slaughterhouse

Creating piles of white bones

Ancestors weep in the ground

We must rise up

To annihilate our enemies

The Japanese navy is the first to raise its head

Howling and calling, hearing the wind

The old China -- has already

United the small and weak nations of East Asia

With the spirit of righteousness

With proper battles

The king's army is invincible

The death knell of the Anglo-Saxons has sounded

### Ode to the Kamikaze Warriors

— Hua Zhi

The Pacific Ocean is roaring,

Mount Fuji is howling,

Our Kamikaze warriors,

Cannot bear the burning passion to serve the country.

They are healthy young men in their twenties,

Saying farewell to their loving mothers and wives,

Holding an iron-like will,

They proudly enter the cockpit.

Before leaving, they smile and say to their comrades,

"Watch my last appearance carefully!"

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. Human bombs ride the Kamikaze,

Blowing towards the skies of Leyte,

In the trembling instant of the enemy's American warships,

Relentless sparks descend from the sky,

Boom, the enemy ship turns into ashes at the bottom of the sea,

Long live, the martyrs celebrate their success in the darkness.

The Kamikaze warriors are our models,

The human bomb heroes are our vanguards,

We offer incense and pray for them,

May a billion people in Greater East Asia turn into Kamikaze!

### Quality versus Quantity, Spirit versus Matter

— Chen Boxiong

The Greater East Asia War, from its outbreak to this day, has passed three full years. The Pearl Harbor raid, the very first thunderous dragon's roar, single-handedly sank five American battleships and twenty other ships, and destroyed five hundred aircraft. Before the war, the boastful Americans used it to intimidate Japan, the Pacific fleet then utterly collapsed. Following this was the naval battle of Malaya, which destroyed the main force of the British Eastern Fleet, the "Prince of Wales," a warship touted as unsinkable, and sank its high-speed battleship, "Repulse," rendering the British fleet silent and invisible, afraid to look directly. These two battles have already laid the initial foundation for certain victory. Subsequently, with the lightning advances of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, they successively captured key locations such as Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, India, and Burma, sweeping across other islands and bases in the Pacific, completing a vast defensive line as solid as iron in a short year and a half. The speed of its victory and fruitfulness has broken all previous war records. For example, the fall of Hong Kong took less than two weeks; the conquest of the Malay Peninsula took less than a month; and the unconditional surrender of the enemy commander of Singapore took only seven days. If the Japanese army is not superhuman, how can its advance be so rapid? It is not anything else, but as the art of war says ★Using troops is about」striking while the iron is hot, preemptive attack; it also says that the number of soldiers is not important, but the quality is. This is clear evidence of the Japanese army's skill in using troops, emphasizing quality over quantity, and emphasizing spirit without overemphasizing material things. After these heavy blows and lessons, the Americans and British actively prepared and replenished in various ways to seek revenge. By last August, the American forces responsible for the Pacific campaign against Japan began a counterattack, fought hard battles, and managed to land, but although they occupied some islands and bases, the cost was extremely high, outweighing the gains. Initially, the enemy relied on its abundant resources, blindly advancing, sacrificing a large amount of manpower and equipment to occupy islands such as Saipan, while simultaneously deploying air force to bomb northern Kyushu and other places, vainly hoping to eliminate the Japanese military and civilians' will to fight through a war of nerves; seeing that this strategy failed, they then mobilized their mobile forces to attack Taiwan and the Philippines, resulting in the loss of more than half of their forces. Although a portion of their forces landed in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, after bloody battles to this day, there has been no progress, and the loss of soldiers and generals, and the destruction of aircraft and ships, is already countless. Examining the war situation to this point, we can already judge who will win.

The progress of modern warfare relies on the entire nation as its backing. Frontline soldiers and civilians in the rear are united as one, working under the guidance of the government, each in their own position. In my opinion, the victory or defeat of a war, in addition to the three major elements – timing, location, and human harmony – and other material conditions, the most important thing is the superiority and inferiority of the national character of the parties involved. Let us examine this point to elaborate as follows.

War relies on manpower and material resources as its basic tools. Although the two go hand in hand and are indispensable, manpower is more important in comparison, while material resources are secondary. This is because material resources must rely on manpower to control and operate them in order to exert their effectiveness. Manpower is further divided into "quality" and "quantity." Let us now judge the trend of superiority and inferiority between the two sides from the aspect of "quality."

The Japanese people's national character is loyal, brave, resilient, and hard-working. At every war, they are able to display their unique nature. The Russo-Japanese War has already shown its signs. In this Greater East Asia War, its brilliance is even more evident, shining through the ages. Japanese soldiers are even more outstanding on the battlefield, surpassing their peers and praised by the world. Conversely, the arrogance and complacency, pampered and privileged lives, the strong bullying the weak, and the rampant selfish desires of the British and American soldiers are differences that cannot be measured. From the Battle of the Aleutian Islands to the bloody battles of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, the Japanese garrison units all fought bravely with fewer soldiers and ultimately sacrificed themselves for their country. Although such loyal and heroic deaths have occurred in the past, those who died were mostly local officials, and such examples are even fewer in modern history. After the release of the Saipan battle report, the world was shocked, both admiring and hating. This is because what was presented to the world was definitely not an accidental event, but an inevitable manifestation of national character. From this, we can infer that even a small piece of land will be defended to the last person, not like the Westerners say, "fight to the last bullet." This one point alone is enough to frighten the enemy and chill their hearts. Seizing the initiative first has a profound and far-reaching impact on the development of future battles. Not only that, but in addition to being good at defense, the Japanese army is also good at offense. Examining the Pearl Harbor raid, there was the meritorious service of the "Nine War Gods" who served as human bombs, the heroic feat of Lieutenant Colonel Kato Tateo of the Japanese Air Force on the India-Burma front, and the recent storming and attacking of the Special Attack Units of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force in the bloody battles of the Philippines, the great feat of one plane against one ship, and the body against armor, which repeatedly produced great results.

Looking at the enemy, there was the "fear of death and unwillingness to fight" spirit displayed in the battles of Hong Kong and the Philippines, and recently there was the attack of the American planes that blindly bombed from high altitude, harming innocent people, and then there was the island landing campaign, which was delayed again and again, replenished again and again, with no hope of a quick victory, instead presenting a stalemate, failed encirclement, and being surrounded, all kinds of things, just making a laughingstock. This shows that relying solely on abundant quantity is not enough to make up for the lack of quality; quality can easily overcome quantity, but quantity is difficult to control quality; the judgment of victory or defeat is already clear to the wise.

### Naochui (Military Music) with Preface

— Yuan Shaoming

The Greater East Asia War, in the blink of an eye, will be three years old. Thunder and lightning sweep, eliminating enemies in the vast ocean. Falling... Yang. Establishing special merits in..., the barbarian children's hearts are broken. The brave soldiers' merits are high, illuminating the radiance of the rising sun. Demonstrating majestic wind throughout the universe. Clearing the world is within sight. Permanently tranquil with belts and grindstones. I respectfully offer the words of Naochui and the sounds of drums. It is a slight offering for a peaceful sea and a clear river.

Thunder and lightning sweep the vast ocean, the merits of the sweaty horses shine on history. Millions of barbarian children are all brokenhearted, waves are bloody on Pearl Harbor.

United in hatred of the enemy, lining up in the military ranks. The ocean-crossing warships attack... Zhang. American rain and European wind blow at will, righteousness flies across the Pacific Ocean.

A thunderous sound on Leyte Island, enemy ships are paid to ashes. Eagles soar across the ocean, drums compete. The Kamikaze squadrons soar through the sky.

Rushing waves and fierce battles for three years. Vowing to kill whales and return in triumph. Waiting to see the light of the rising sun shine brilliantly, auspicious clouds illuminate the long sky.

### Happily Composing This Poem on the Alliance's Continuous Victories in the Greater East Asia War

— Liu Yaoqing

Happiness comes from the sea with countless warships, tens of thousands of miles of banners in a single glance. Countless barbarians lament the defeat in battle, many brave soldiers come from... The green mountains and red trees are old on the battlefield, the brave soldiers are spirited. What can the jumping clowns achieve? Where the victory song is played, special merits are established.

Pointing at the three mountains floating green, wanting to cut off the river with a whip. It is useless to transport Huacan for thousands of miles. How can... light overwhelm a boat? (Enemy American fleets are mostly destroyed by bombs) The rising sun... the sky is red like brocade, the smoke and waves reflect the eye, more emerald than oil. (Barbarians... are called blue-eyed children) Where will the decaying and rotten return? The remaining enemies will not be allowed to leave a single armor.
