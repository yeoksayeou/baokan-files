### India Actively Promotes General Mobilization Plan
Rangoon, Burma, 5th (Central News Agency) – Indian Chairman Bose issued a statement on the 4th, stating: Indians have begun armed struggle to obtain the freedom of their motherland. At this time, all necessary preparations must be made in advance militarily, and the organization of the provisional government must be strengthened. I hereby give the following three instructions regarding our future policy: We, on the common front, for victory, must hold a deep belief in certain victory and penetrate into Indian territory. Therefore, we must strengthen both aspects. The activities of the Reconstruction Department in the liberated areas will inevitably expand in the future, and therefore the key members of the Reconstruction Department must also be increased. We must strengthen the rear, and therefore it is necessary to promote the mobilization of people, wealth, and materials in all aspects.

Germany and France Negotiate to Strengthen Combat Power
Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United Press reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said yesterday that Germany and France are currently negotiating to discuss France stepping up assistance to Germany in combat.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The German leader received leaders of the munitions industry and gave a speech on the theme of the tasks that German industry should complete during wartime and peacetime. He stated that this war cannot be decided by temporary developments, and temporary victories and failures are of no decisive importance. At this time when the fate of the nation for centuries is being decided, every German has only one task, which is to constantly fight and work for victory. The leader then greatly praised the bravery of the German army, saying that this kind of heroic spirit allows people to understand its unchanging belief that the Germans will receive courageous assistance, will certainly overcome current difficulties, and will ultimately achieve victory. This war is not only a war of soldiers, but also a war of technicians. The inventive genius of the Germans will restore the technical balance and change the war situation in favor of Germany.

Enemy Reinforcements in the Caen Area
Tank Battle Unfolds
American Forces Launch a Responding Offensive in Southern Cotentin

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports, military intelligence: The great tank battle west of Caen resumed on Tuesday evening. British forces attacked south of the Bayeux-Caen road with reinforced tank formations in an attempt to rescue their tank formations trapped by the German forces. This enemy tank formation has been blocked in front of the German artillery and is in an isolated position, currently being bombarded by tank guns. North of Caen, British forces have regrouped a powerful tank formation, and it is expected that the British Second Army will use this force to participate in the fierce battle for Caen today. The offensive and defensive battles in the American war zone south and southwest of Carentan have become more intense, and the same is true in its fourth section, but most of the American offensives have either failed or been intercepted during the German counterattacks, and local gaps in the German positions have been closed.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United Press reports: The long-awaited large-scale offensive of the British Second Army under the command of Dempsey has finally been realized. The battle for Caen is currently taking place along the Caen-Viller Bocage road. After intense artillery preparation, the enemy forces are fiercely attacking along the seven-kilometer front on both sides of the Caen area road. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with 37 tanks destroyed, and the anti-axis forces are landing on a large scale at the mouth of the Orne River. Therefore, there must be battles on the east bank of the river, and the American offensive towards the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula is only of secondary importance.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United Press reports: Anti-axis warships concentrated at the mouth of the Orne River last night, including the French battleship "Courbet" (22,000 tons) and the battleship "Lorraine" (33,000 tons), as well as several heavy cruisers, protected by multiple destroyers, which frequently released smoke screens to avoid bombardment from coastal artillery. German officials said that these warships will assist the army in the battle of Caen.

Naval Battle Occurs in the Waters of Holland

A team of British boats that launched an ineffective offensive near Terschelling was repeatedly repelled. In this battle, one enemy boat was directly hit and severely damaged. Although the enemy boats used German signals to confuse the German ships, the German ships suffered no losses. From 4 AM to 5 AM, a similar naval battle occurred again in the waters near Texel. One enemy boat was severely damaged and caught fire, and then disappeared from view amidst heavy smoke. One German ship was attacked by a torpedo, but was still able to fight.

Central Soviet Forces Advance to Seize Railway Lines
Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United Press reports: Heavy fighting is still taking place in the central part of the Eastern Front, generally speaking, it is a war to seize railways. Stolpce and Molodeczno are the focal points of the battle, and also the railway centers. Both sides are fighting with artillery, tanks, and aircraft. German forces are resisting strongly everywhere. German forces who temporarily lost contact are fighting westward. German forces are still in the Leśna area southeast of Minsk. The German rearguard units are fighting bravely. The German forces on the Eastern Front are all veterans and are responding calmly.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The new targets of the Soviet offensive after the German retreat from Minsk have turned to the Baranowicze, Wilno, and Dvinsk areas. The Soviet forces in the Plock area had reached Dziisna, 25 kilometers northwest of the city, and Drissa, 70 kilometers away, on the 3rd, and also launched an offensive on the new positions in the Plock area, and fierce battles are currently underway. As a result of German reconnaissance, Soviet forces have begun an offensive in the Kovel area in recent days. Soviet mechanized units that advanced southwest via Slutsk broke into the southern flank of the German positions, but were repelled after a fierce counterattack by German reserve units. The tank counterattack of powerful German forces northeast of Baranowicze is currently progressing smoothly.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: According to strategic measures, German forces have withdrawn from the city of Kovel (in the central part of the former Polish territory), and the Soviet forces were completely unaware beforehand.

German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Comments on Soviet-Turkish Relations
American Ambassador to Turkey Returns Home

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson does not attach importance to the claim that Turkey has political intentions to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. Turkish newspapers recently commented on Soviet-Turkish relations, saying that Turkey must supplement the Anglo-Turkish alliance agreement before it can freely establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. Judging from the attitude of the Turkish newspapers in discussing this matter, this kind of consideration for making an agreement with the Soviet Union gives people the impression that it is only theoretical and propagandistic in nature.

Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency) The United Press reports: American Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, departed today to return home on official business. It is reported that Mr. Steinhardt will return here as soon as possible.

Good Planting Conditions for Crops in Various Parts of Manchuria
Xinjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The planting conditions of crops in Manchuria, the food base of East Asia, this year are good due to favorable weather. According to a survey, the planting conditions in various parts of Manchuria at the end of June are as follows: The good areas are Beian, Jilin, Binjiang, and most of Siping, known as the granaries, as well as the entire Tonghua, Andong, and Fengtian provinces. The secondary good areas are Xingbei, Yudong, Xingxi, Longjiang, part of Binjiang, and the entire Xingzhong area. The other areas are roughly the same as in previous years.

The rapid evolution of the times tells us many undeniable facts.

The beginning of the facts is the Henan Campaign. Optimists—those who are stubbornly advocating resistance—say: With the "buried head in hard work" of Chongqing in recent years, and the "whole batch and huge amount" of assistance from British and American arms, this resistance war will no longer be the "losing troops and territory" routine of the past. The front-line aircraft have so many, the Chongqing-US pilots have so many, the B-24 and B-29 bombers are how able to "defeat ten with one" to give the invading enemy the most serious blow. The mechanized units on the Henan front are equipped so beautifully and fully, as if the decisive argument that the Japanese army will be defeated is without a care and will be realized. The tense eyes are all cast on the strict reports on the front line. The news of the Chongqing army retreating and retreating again actually gives the optimists the optimistic illusion of "luring the enemy deep and annihilating them in a concentrated manner." It was not until Luoyang fell that they were a little surprised, and re-examined their consistent optimistic thinking, and more firmly decided on their optimistic beliefs. "Victory or defeat is a common occurrence for soldiers," and the loss of a place is irrelevant to the overall situation. The self-consolation of Ah Q emerges spontaneously. Moreover, Henan is a plain in mainland China, easy to attack and difficult to defend. There is a need to adjust the lineup and determine the main battle force. This is what happened not long ago, and everyone knows it.

However, obvious facts continue to evolve one after another. As soon as the Henan battle ended, the Hunan battle came next. Changsha fell, and Hengyang was in urgent need of help. The optimists were a little anxious this time, telling each other and complaining to each other. Was it that the Chongqing army's front-line soldiers were unwilling to fight? Did the American planes refuse to help? Or was there not enough arms and equipment? One question mark after another arose in the optimistic thinking, and the result of the fall of Changsha was to make the optimists temporarily suppress the inner contradictions and come to the conclusion of watching the development of the facts, because Changsha had several experiences of gaining and losing again. Maybe this time the Japanese army's re-acquisition of Changsha is still the scorched earth of the past, and Chongqing will take it back again.

If we take a look at the current Chinese situation map, we will immediately know that the gain or loss of Weisha has the closest relationship with controlling the key northwestern transportation line of the Yuehan Railway. Pointing south from Hunan, the gateway of the Yuehan Line, Weiyang, will leap onto the map. If you want to get Hengyang, you must first seize Quzhou. So the expected battle has become fierce at these two key points. It took forty-five days to take Luoyang, and more than thirty days to take Changsha. Now it only took two weeks to even take Quzhou and Hengyang. To quote an old Chinese saying, it is "like splitting bamboo." The heroic (?) resistance of Chongqing gave the Japanese army the reaction of only "destroying the old and decaying." So the optimists exclaimed, and the idea of resistance, which had always been regarded as the only supreme method to save China, was completely shaken, from shaking to disillusionment. The mood of regret and annoyance intertwined the entire inner heart. Can "resistance" save China? They dare not believe it at all, and think of the bad aspects. If this situation evolves again, then it can't be straight down to Guilin in Guangxi and then into Kunming in Yunnan...how terrible is that?

The undeniable fact is that before this Henan-Hunan campaign, the Chinese people's minds still believed that Chongqing could get the final victory, but after this epoch-making campaign, this idea was undoubtedly hit by a knife three times. Various doubts and accusations followed one after another. Even the most loyal comrades in the resistance camp shook their heads and sighed, and dared not deny the current facts anymore. So as a result, it produced some tricks that British and American aid was just using to manipulate. The entire China was shattered under this dream of external aid. Not to mention the misery of the people's livelihood, the suffering of hunger and displacement due to resistance was in vain. Hundreds and thousands of different current situations and facts, summed up, are only one consistent and simple conclusion: "China should no longer resist." If we resist any longer, even China will be finished. Not only is there no hope of restoration and unification, but there will only be the consequences of being people as knives and I as fish. We dare not say that this conclusion is correct, but facts speak louder than words. China, except for the road of truce, all one thousand and one roads are dead ends. The unanimous conclusion is so, and only when it is broken and fragmented to this point today can this conclusion be produced.

The 400 million Chinese people unanimously need a truce. This most serious issue is coming to the time when it should be decided.

Situation of Rice Transported to Shanghai after Implementation of Procurement
Rice Control Association Issues Survey Report

After the Shanghai Rice Control Association temporarily allowed free transport of rice without levying the rice that should be paid, citizens and rice merchants transported rice into the city, which became increasingly prosperous, and the market price once fell below eight yuan. Since the association established various temporary license issuing offices on July 1st and began to handle procurement and other matters, rice prices have soared in recent days, approaching the thirteen yuan mark as of yesterday (the 5th). According to the association's survey report, the average daily index of rice prices in the city per stone is: (June 30th) 9,700 yuan, (July 1st) 10,600 yuan, (2nd) 11,200 yuan, (3rd) 11,200 yuan, (4th) 12,300 yuan. The quantity transported in: (1st) 4,154 stones, (2nd) 4,530 stones, (3rd) 5,263 stones, (4th) 5,683 stones, totaling 19,630 stones in four days. The quantity purchased by the association: (1st) 12 stones, (2nd) 12 stones, (3rd) 6 stones, (4th) not detailed, totaling 30 stones in three days. The entry points are Jianghai Customs and the North Railway Station. Minhang Road, Changan Road, Hongqiao Road, and Majiaqiao are the most. The sources are Qingpu, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Chongming, Jiaqiao, and Xingang. The average price per stone in the source areas is about 6,500 yuan in Qingpu, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Jiading, and about 5,500 yuan in Chongming, Jiaqiao, and Xingang. Compared with the rice price in the city, the ratio exceeds 50%. Even considering the difficulty of transportation, extortion along the way, and increased costs, the difference should not be so large. The association believes that it is necessary to review the purchase prices set by the Rice Control Association. It is most regrettable that the amount of rice purchased in recent days is very small, and a group of unscrupulous merchants are using this as an excuse to take the opportunity to raise prices. Furthermore, the purchase prices set by the association were implemented on July 1st before central approval, which seems to be lacking in thoroughness in the measures, and is the main reason for the current resurgence of rice prices, which is not helpful to both military needs and civilian food. It is hoped that the association will quickly adjust to meet public expectations.

Minister of Justice Zhang Actively Rectifies Law and Discipline
Strictly Prohibits Public Officials from Abuse of Power and Accepting Bribes

Minister of Justice Zhang Yipeng has been actively rectifying government affairs since taking office, sparing no effort. Now, Zhang has issued an instruction to strictly prohibit subordinate public officials from engaging in conduct that violates their duties, saying: "It is clearly stipulated in Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law that public officials who solicit, promise, or deliver bribes or other improper benefits regarding conduct that violates their duties shall be punished. According to the legislative intent, the so-called solicitation, promise, or delivery of bribes must come from the original intention of the bribers. If public officials force, induce, or use their power to threaten and coerce, thereby promising delivery, then it should be considered separately. Because people often have no fixed ideas when they encounter accidents, and unscrupulous public officials may take the opportunity to defraud or threaten by virtue of their power, causing the parties involved to have to reluctantly lose money in the hope of benefiting themselves. In this situation, the party involved is actually a victim of fraud and intimidation, and not a criminal of soliciting, promising, or delivering bribes, which is very obvious. In the future, when encountering such cases, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the intent of the crime, and must not be done hastily. Even if the solicitation, promise, or delivery of bribes is from the original intention, if they can confess before being discovered, or confess during investigation or trial, they should also be given leniency or exemption from punishment in accordance with the relevant provisions, so that greedy officials and clerks will know what to fear because bribers dare to report them. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby given for compliance, and all subordinates shall be instructed to comply.

Circular on Rectifying the Conduct of Lawyers
The Ministry of Justice ordered the Higher Courts in various places to instruct their subordinates and lawyers' associations that lawyers who are entrusted by parties to mail petitions must indicate the name of the drafting lawyer and affix their seal after the petition. Recently, some lawyers have submitted petitions on behalf of parties, using only the lawyer's envelope without signing or affixing a seal. Whether they are entrusted to handle the matter is not sufficient to prove, and submitting directly to the Minister has the suspicion of boasting and alluding, which is related to conduct. Now, Minister Zhang has issued a circular stating that if the above-mentioned situation is discovered again, disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with the law.

Military Criminals in Wuxi Released on Parole
The Wuxi Prison under the Ministry of Justice originally held 70 military criminals, including Wang Xuecheng. Minister Zhang Yipeng is now reorganizing prisons in various places to reduce the number of deaths of prisoners. After consultation with the relevant parties, these criminals were released on parole in accordance with the Amnesty Ordinance to give them a chance to start anew. The Kikuchi unit has sent personnel to the prison to count the names and release them. This is an unprecedented fact in the judicial prison sector in recent years, and it is sufficient to show the spirit of the friendly army assisting the judiciary.

Tang Yinghuang's License Revoked
Also, the lawyer Tang Yinghuang was applying for a lawyer's certificate, and the Ministry specially instructed the Shanghai Higher Court Procuratorate to revoke the lawyer's certificate. The original order said: "The Ministry issued lawyer's certificate No. 689 to Tang Yinghuang on September 11, 1943, and his academic qualifications stated that he graduated from the Law Department of the Zhejiang Public Law and Political Science School. It has now been verified that there is no Tang Yinghuang among the graduates of the school. His application for a lawyer's certificate is inappropriate. This order is hereby given for the said court and procuratorate to comply with, quickly cancel the registration of the said person in the original case, and revoke the previously issued lawyer's certificate and submit it to the Ministry for cancellation. At the same time, instruct the Shanghai Lawyers Association to comply, and report the handling situation for record."

Future Clearing of the Countryside Work
Xiong Jiandong

On July 1, 1941, the National Government launched the work of clearing the countryside. Time flies, and it has been three years now. Over the past three years, thanks to the appeal of Chairman Wang's virtue, the efforts of the working comrades, and the assistance of the allied countries, the work of clearing the countryside has progressed smoothly, and the areas cleared have gradually expanded. Initially, Suzhou was the center, and then it was extended to the northern Jiangsu area, the Zhenjiang area, and Shanghai, and Zhejiang Province. Currently, the work of clearing the countryside in Guangdong and Anhui provinces has also begun. Initially, it was a local clearing of the countryside, and now it has progressed to a comprehensive clearing of the countryside. Those who are complacent about its progress are overjoyed. Obviously, if we only make complacent remarks here, it will not help the current situation. We must examine the mistakes of the past and use them as a lesson for the future, so that it has a positive meaning and does not flow into empty commemorative statements.

When the work of clearing the countryside was launched, the Chairman marked the purpose of clearing the countryside as: "Establishing security and improving people's livelihood." These two are mutually cause and effect, and the main purpose is to love the people. In the past, clearing the countryside gradually eliminated the bandits and communists in the rural areas, and the local security gradually became stable, and its merits cannot be denied. However, there are quite a few who have failed to win the hearts of the people, and even in the areas of Suzhou and Changzhou, the people have a feeling of talking about tigers when they mention the two words of clearing the countryside. This is our honest saying, and it is also what some people want to say but dare not say. The work of clearing the countryside, which is based on loving the people, has ultimately led to the people's fear of asking about clearing the countryside and fear of talking about clearing the countryside, which is very painful. In the future, when talking about the work of clearing the countryside, we must fully develop the spirit of the original intention of loving the people. Confucius said when discussing politics: "Love what the people love, and hate what the people hate." Only in this way can we gain the sympathy of the people, and then we can expect the people's hearts to be directed, and the reason for ensuring peace areas and expanding peace areas can be obtained.

Originally, the government launched the work of clearing the countryside with great expectations, and will use it to promote the realization of comprehensive peace. Therefore, this is not just a simple military operation, but must be combined with political, economic, and cultural forces. In the past, the work of clearing the countryside focused on military operations, and political, economic, and cultural aspects lacked coordination. In some areas, the troops arrived and the bandits and communists retreated, but the people's thoughts were still not corrected, and the people's lives were still not improved. It only had passive results and did not receive positive effects. There was even a cyclical phenomenon of soldiers going away and bandits coming back, which must be paid attention to and corrected in the future.

Eliminating bandits and communists is the main task of clearing the countryside, but this is only one end of the main task, and it cannot be regarded as the overall situation. All local evil forces should be included in the example of clearing them. Only when all evil forces are completely eliminated can we expect to correct thoughts, ensure security, and improve people's livelihood. Military operations are indispensable for eliminating bandits and communists, and the power of political, economic, and cultural aspects must be coordinated to clear all local evil forces. Military affairs are destructive actions of a passive nature, and the work of clearing the countryside pays more attention to constructive actions of a positive nature. In terms of construction, the comprehensive development of political, economic, and cultural forces must be used.

Over the years, the people's livelihood has been difficult to the extreme. If bandits and communists are not eliminated, security cannot be ensured, and the people's livelihood cannot be improved. However, if the people's livelihood cannot be improved, security is difficult to ensure. In the future, the work of clearing the countryside must proceed simultaneously in this regard. Regarding the issue of improving the people's livelihood, such as devising ways to facilitate transportation and protect its safety, so as to facilitate the flow of materials, and earnestly studying countermeasures to suppress and stabilize prices, so as to relieve the actual difficulties of the people's livelihood, and protect the development of light industry and the safety of farmers, so as to increase production. All of these points may not be entirely within the scope of the work of clearing the countryside, but they are all of great relevance to the promotion of the work of clearing the countryside. What is relied on is that all relevant parties rise up to struggle, and what is especially hoped is that the allied countries will provide assistance.

Since the allied countries launched the Greater East Asia War, and our National Government announced its participation in the war, the work of clearing the countryside has become more important. In modern warfare, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Killing the enemy and achieving results in the front, and ensuring security and increasing production in the rear, are equally important in the meaning of war.

Before that, clearing the countryside was the government's simple work of ensuring security. After participating in the war, clearing the countryside has been coordinated with the Greater East Asia War and has become one end of the war work. In order to achieve the early completion of the war victory and the early liberation of the East Asian nations, the work of clearing the countryside should be more correctly struggled and more actively promoted in the future.

I am undertaking the affairs of clearing the countryside in Shanghai, and I think I am ignorant and ashamed of making achievements, and what I have worked hard for is about as above. Shanghai is a major town in the country, and also a major town for defending East Asia. Shanghai's clearing of the countryside is not only to eliminate bandits and communists in the countryside, but also to focus on the first district, so that we can seek the overall health of Shanghai. This matter is of great importance and cannot be borne alone by one person's foolishness. We need to pool our wisdom and efforts to coordinate. On the day of the third anniversary of the clearing of the countryside, I sincerely look forward to the guidance and assistance of all virtuous people.

The City Commemorates the Third Anniversary of Clearing the Countryside
Mass Rallies Held in Various Districts

The National Government believes that reconstruction and construction cannot be delayed, and ensuring security and improving people's livelihood are the most urgent tasks. In the summer of 1941, it gathered the entire military, political, economic, and cultural forces to launch the great work of clearing the countryside, and took the Jiangnan area of Jiangsu Province as the first to launch it. This month's 1st is the third anniversary of the work of clearing the countryside. To celebrate the third anniversary of the work of clearing the countryside in Shanghai Special City, mass rallies will be held in various special administrative regions this morning (the 6th). Also, Xiong Jiandong, Director of the Shanghai Special City Clearing the Countryside Affairs Bureau, and other officials have published articles.

Unified Collection of Baojia Expenses
In the past, the collection of Baojia expenses in various Baojia districts was difficult to comply with the provisions of laws and regulations. In order to cope with emergencies, many even created other names and collected them without authorization, so that the citizens did not understand the truth and did not understand the difficulties of the officials. In addition, it is inevitable that there will be incidents of breeding malpractices. The Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau of this city is aware of this, and in order to take care of the people's strength and rectify the collection of fees, it has formulated unified measures for the collection of Baojia expenses, which will be implemented from July 1st of this year. In the future, the collection of Baojia expenses in various Baojia districts must be carried out in accordance with the unified measures, and all chief Baojia chiefs have been notified to comply.

The Second Police Bureau Ordered to Inspect Theater Scripts
The Municipal Second Police Bureau was yesterday ordered by the Municipal Government that the Propaganda Department's draft of the regulations on theater inspection in this city, after being reviewed by Director Zhang, ordered the Special High Division to strictly handle it in accordance with the inspection regulations. If there are dramas that do not comply with the regulations and are harmful to public morals and promote superstition and heresy, they should be banned at any time in conjunction with the Propaganda Department in accordance with the violation of the theater inspection regulations.

Special Aid Measures
This newspaper's previous aid funds have been generously donated by enthusiastic people to establish "special aid funds." In the previous session, there were nine types of names, including "Baizhi," "Dacheng," "Runfu," "Tingxin," "Zhendan," "Fusheng," "Xingbo," "Bingzhao," "Yuwen," and "Dingfu," totaling 138 students who received aid. Among them, some were designated to subsidize those who were at the top of each grade, some were designated to subsidize those who were studying a certain subject, and some were designated to subsidize outstanding students of a certain school, or subsidize them until graduation from university, or subsidize them to a certain grade, or fully subsidize or partially subsidize them. The method is very good and the intention is very beautiful. This office will handle it in accordance with the wishes of the donors. However, the tuition fees of various schools in the next semester have increased sharply, about four to five times more than the previous session. I wonder how the donors will handle the next session? Will the number of places remain the same, or will the aid funds be appropriately increased? This office very much hopes that the donors will send a letter to this office within a few days to show their instructions, so that we can review and handle it. In addition, this office will send letters to inquire separately tomorrow, and it is fortunate to reply as soon as possible.

Yuanyuan Asks People to Raise Funds to Aid Students
Yesterday, Yuanyuan Hardware Raw Materials Company sent a letter saying: "At a time when the cost of living is high and tuition fees have increased sharply, students who are unable to study will lose their studies again. The aid fund organized by your newspaper is afraid that it will not be enough to allocate. Our company and colleagues will do their best to donate 20,000 yuan in national currency to help. It is hoped that other companies can also rise up in response, so that thousands of out-of-school youths will sing praises and be grateful."

Yesterday, we received aid funds: 1,441,800 yuan for ordinary tickets for the football charity match, 841,200 yuan for honorary tickets for the football charity match, 20,000 yuan from Chen Rongxin, 10,000 yuan from Sheng Youzhi (Ding Mocun's birthday gift transfer), 10,000 yuan from the Central Reserve Bank's congratulatory gift transfer (sent by this newspaper), 20,000 yuan from Yuanyuan Company, 10,000 yuan from Li Menghuai, 2,000 yuan from Madam Jia, 1,000 yuan from Miss He Na (school exam first place award transfer), 500 yuan from Li Hongqing, 165 yuan from Yu Xinssen, 100 yuan from Wu Yuanliang, 50 yuan each from Kuang Dai, Zhang Jialin, Zhao Hongyuan, and Bei Rongfu, 1,000 yuan from Jia Qipei (ancestor's birthday gift transfer), 500 yuan from Feng Zhen, 200 yuan each from Ma Shirong and an anonymous person, and 20 yuan from Pu Qiting (wishing Mr. Sheng Youzhi and his family good health), totaling 2,358,885 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 6,284,159 yuan.

Cracks Occur in Two Bridges on Suzhou Creek
Public Works Authorities Implement Reinforcement Works

The Sichuan Road Bridge and the Henan Road Bridge have each had two cracks since the end of last year, as wide as 20 centimeters, and you can see the turbid currents of the Suzhou Creek under the bridge. Both bridges were built about 20 years ago and are reinforced concrete structures. This material was originally supposed to last for 100 years, but now it has only been 20 years and this phenomenon has occurred. The biggest reason is actually the incompetence of the British engineers, who did not take into account the severity of the subsidence of the Shanghai foundation. The designer of the Sichuan Road Bridge was Jameson, the original director of the Public Works Bureau, and the designer of the Henan Road Bridge was his deputy director, Clark. In order to prevent future troubles, the head of the Handa Road Section of the First District Public Office is implementing reinforcement works, which can ensure safety for the next 15 or 16 years, and the cracks have also been filled.

Talk by Engineer Handa
The following is the talk by Engineer Handa: The situation of the bridges that are in danger is not limited to the two bridges mentioned above, but their condition is not obvious yet. The biggest reason is actually the subsidence of the Shanghai foundation. I started measuring from 1937. The south bank of the river has subsided about 15 centimeters, and the north bank has subsided about 14 centimeters. If it subsides evenly, then the subsidence of the entire foundation is originally not a problem. However, the two bridge piers standing in the river have only subsided 6 centimeters, resulting in the bridge girders on top of them gradually becoming skewed. Moreover, the central bridge girder of the bridge is not supported on the bridge girders extending from the bridge piers, but on the bridge girders extending from the two sides of the river bank, so there is a risk of collapse. In the design of the alluvial soil in Shanghai, the friction coefficient of the foundation works must be calculated. If the design is slightly meticulous, then no matter how the Shanghai foundation subsides, it will not be like this. In addition, there are many points that are insufficient in terms of mechanics. After this reinforcement, if there are no natural disasters or earthquakes, it will not collapse again.

Hong Zhen Takes Over

### Editorial: Awaiting the Opportunity to Defeat the Enemy

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a veteran figure in the Allied news media, stated in the Mainichi Shimbun on June 17th: "The German war situation has begun to change due to the landing of British and American forces in northern France. Our land and sea warfare is also undergoing a major transformation. We look forward to a bright future and patiently await the arrival of opportunities. We must not be negligent at this time." This year is the decisive year, and recent developments further indicate the intensification of the war. The war has already entered its most fierce stage.

Strategically, both Japan and Germany are adopting an "awaiting the weary enemy" strategy, incorporating offense within defense, thus achieving more with less effort. The aim of Japan and Germany is to annihilate the enemy within the defensive areas. The more enemies there are, the more opportunities for annihilation. The deeper the enemy penetrates, the longer their supply lines become, and the easier it becomes for us to annihilate them. Under this situation, the enemy must utilize their manpower and resources to the highest degree, while we must continue to make relentless efforts to kill the enemy until their manpower and resources can no longer sustain them. Only then can East Asia and Europe be liberated, and only then can they achieve permanent independence and freedom.

The opportunity to defeat the enemy has arrived, and the time to defeat the enemy has come. The military work at the front and the support work at the rear are the most decisive factors. If there is no supply and replenishment from the rear, the front has no way to continue killing the enemy. People in the rear, listen! This is our only opportunity to serve the country, this is our only time to serve the country. We must dedicate all our strength to the nation. Only with the nation can there be individuals. Only if the nation can win, can the people turn over a new leaf.

At the same time, the government is the leader of both the front and the rear, as well as the liaison between them. Once the strategy at the front is decided, it must be implemented with all efforts. Once the work at the rear is determined, it must be implemented immediately to coordinate with the military operations at the front. The most crucial thing for those responsible in the government at this time and place is to lead by example. They must share the joys and hardships with the soldiers at the front, and they must share the joys and hardships with the people in the rear. It is hoped that the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear will exert all their strength and first contribute all their strength. What Fan Zhongyan said, "Be the first to worry about the world's troubles, and the last to enjoy its pleasures," this is the usual mindset of the government. In times of war, the government should even more put it into practice and set an example for others. Only in this way can there be unity between the top and bottom, and unity between the military and the people. This is the creed of the wartime government, and the responsibility of the wartime government is to implement this creed.

China has been at war for a year and a half. A year and a half is not a short time, but the work of the government and the people in the past year and a half cannot yet be said to have reached the standard of wartime work. Although there are difficulties in the environment, the biggest reason is still the lack of human effort. Now that we have reached the most critical juncture, and the decisive battle is imminent, the government and the people, everything, must absolutely not maintain the status quo, but must catch up head-on. The whole country, from top to bottom, should reflect on how much responsibility we have fulfilled as a country at war. To reduce the shame in our hearts, we must first show the reality. In the process of jointly defeating the enemy, we must do our best to do the work of jointly defeating the enemy. Only in this way can we be worthy of the nation and the country, only in this way can we be worthy of the allied soldiers.

### The Japanese Government Issues a Statement: Expressing Confidence in Victory and Hoping to Complete the Eternal Friendly Relationship Between China and Japan

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau issued a "Statement by the Japanese Government" at 3:00 PM on the 5th, expressing confidence in victory and stating that the purpose of the current military operations in China is to destroy the enemy's British and American invasion attempts. The full text of the statement is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has been striving for the liberation and stability of Greater East Asia and the construction of a new order in the world, cooperating with the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia and with the allied nations in Europe, to destroy the ambitions of Britain and the United States. Now, the war situations in both the East and the West have entered a decisive stage. The enemy's counter-offensive in the Pacific is also becoming increasingly fierce. The Imperial Army and Navy are now exerting all their efforts to destroy it. On the mainland, the enemy Britain and the United States are increasingly showing their ambitions for invasion and domination. The Imperial Army and Navy, with pre-emptive offensives, are now seizing their bases in various places, destroying their forces everywhere, and burying the enemy's plans. The purpose of the Japanese army's military actions in China this time is to destroy the enemy's British and American invasion and domination attempts. The Chinese people have always been our friends. If they can refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing troops will not be regarded as enemies by us. What Japan hopes for the Republic of China is to respect China's independence and autonomy based on the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to complete the eternal good neighborly and friendly relationship between China and Japan. Japan, under this decisive war situation, will further demonstrate the essence of the Imperial Country to further achieve the final victory.

### The National Government Simultaneously Announces its Determination to Promote National Unification and Complete the Greater East Asia War

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Propaganda Department of the National Government issued a "Statement by the National Government" at 5:00 PM on the 5th, stating its determination to promote national unification, complete the Greater East Asia War, so that China's freedom and independence can be established as soon as possible, and further exert the strength of an independent nation to stabilize East Asia. The text is recorded as follows: The purpose of the National Government's return to the capital is to seek peace, and its most significant meaning lies in building an independent nation, sharing the responsibility of stabilizing Greater East Asia with Japan. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the National Government resolutely led the people to participate in the war on January 9th of last year, based on the principle of building an independent nation, and concluded the China-Japan Alliance Treaty with Japan, and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, cooperating in the task of establishing Greater East Asia. In terms of economics, military affairs, and national affairs, the National Government has made every effort to stabilize the rear, which is what the National Government pays special attention to.

Since Britain and the United States used the Chongqing area as a base for air force to disrupt the rear of East Asia, the National Government has determined that unless the British and American air force and its remnants are eliminated, the security of Greater East Asia cannot be ensured, and it is determined that the National Government's task of participating in the war, stabilizing the rear, is as important as going to the front line. Today, the Japanese Imperial Government reiterated in its statement that what it expects from our country is to respect our country's freedom and independence based on the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to complete the permanent good neighborly and friendly relationship between China and Japan. Therefore, the purpose of the Japanese military action this time is to destroy Britain and the United States' attempts to invade Greater East Asia. Its purpose is not only not to be an enemy of the Chinese people, but even the Chongqing troops who understand the great righteousness and break away from the bondage of Britain and the United States are considered friendly forces. All the people of the country and all the soldiers should grasp the progress of the current situation, understand the current task, promote national unification, complete the Greater East Asia War, so that China's freedom and independence can be established as soon as possible, and further exert the strength of an independent nation to stabilize East Asia. This is what the National Government hopes for.

### The Japanese Army's Launch of Mainland Operations is to Destroy the Enemy's American Attempt, Which Has Caused Deep Concern Among the Anti-Axis Camp

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – In order to thoroughly annihilate the Chongqing army that was stirring up trouble in Henan, the Japanese army crossed the New Yellow River from April 17th and started the Henan Operation. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. More than 30 divisions of the Chongqing army were annihilated one after another. The Japanese army in Central China also echoed remotely and launched an annihilation war in Hunan. Changsha and Liling were captured successively, and then Hengyang, the air base of the US forces, was also controlled by the Japanese army. This was a heavy blow to Chongqing, to say the least, and it was also a shock to the British and American camps. However, the Japanese army's offensive has not stopped. On June 10th, the Japanese army in Shanghai suddenly started attacking the Third War Zone of Chongqing again. The Japanese army's swift actions were like a gust of wind sweeping away the remnants of leaves. By June 26th, they had occupied Quzhou and are still continuing their attack. At this time, the Japanese army in South China, in response to the operations of the Japanese army in Central China, suddenly began to move north on the 27th. At present, the Chinese battlefront, north, central, and south, are attacking together, and the three sides of the Japanese army will make contact. Therefore, the Japanese army's overall operation has reached its climax. Due to the Japanese army's repeated infiltration operations, the defensive posture has reached the point of collapse, showing a chaotic and unmanageable situation. The Japanese army's occupation of Luoyang, the location of the headquarters of the First War Zone, is enough to show the Japanese army's great strength. In response to this, the Chongqing Central News Agency specifically stated in a commentary on May 5th: "The fall of Luoyang is nothing less than a major setback for Chongqing militarily and politically." Also, a reporter from the British Daily Mail said, "The defeat of the Chongqing army this time is the most frequently seen in the six years of resistance." Since the Luoyang operation, the war has continued to expand outward. The suffering of those who are experiencing an unprecedented major defeat across the board is unimaginable. According to the overall observation of this operation, it can be roughly divided into four stages: the first stage is the Henan operation, the second stage is the Hunan operation, the third stage is the attack operation in the Third War Zone, and the fourth stage is the northward operation in South China. The overview of each stage is recorded as follows:

(Henan Operation) On April 17th, the Japanese army crossed the New Yellow River and started the Henan Operation. On May 9th, the Japanese army in North China and Central China joined hands in Queshan and completed the great achievement of opening up the Beijing-Hankou Railway. On the 25th, Luoyang was occupied, causing the destruction of Tang Enbo's First War Zone army. Also, several divisions coming to aid from the Eighth War Zone were forced to retreat towards Tongguan, and most of them were annihilated. Therefore, the initial operations of the Japanese army have been completely realized.

(Hunan Operation) Following the Henan Operation, the Japanese army in Central China started attacking from the west side of Dongting Lake on May 27th. After June 10th, Changsha and Liling were occupied successively. On June 26th, they further occupied Hengyang Airport, a forward base of the Chongqing-American Air Force.

(Attack Operation in the Third War Zone) When the elite of the Japanese army's front line launched the Hunan Operation north of Changsha and Liling, the Japanese army waiting in Shanghai also suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Third War Zone of Chongqing on June 10th. The Japanese troops departing from Jinhua occupied Longyou and then attacked the main force of the Third War Zone located in the east of Quzhou, and successively defeated them. Then they turned to Quzhou and started a general attack, completely occupying it on the 26th and are still continuing their attack.

(Northward Operation of the Japanese Army in South China) The Japanese army in South China has been silent for a long time since occupying Hong Kong. This time, in response to the operations of the Japanese army in Hunan, they suddenly launched an offensive against Yu Hanmou's army in the Seventh War Zone of Chongqing, which was entrenched in Guangdong, on June 27th, and are still advancing rapidly north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway.

The above four major battles are what truly cause deep concern to the anti-Axis camp. "China is not only unable to connect north and south, but also separated east and west." From this argument, the grief of the anti-Axis side can be imagined. Looking at this operation, the decisive measures taken by the Japanese army and the magnitude of the operation have to be called the largest since the Sino-Japanese Incident, that is, the so-called great operation that started in North China, connected Central China, and then opened up to the South, connecting the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, and uniting North China and Central South. During the operation, the Chongqing forces that were annihilated included Jiang Dingwen and Tang Enbo's troops in the First War Zone, Hu Zongnan's troops in the Eighth War Zone, Sun Zhen's troops in the Sixth War Zone, Xue Yue's troops in the Ninth War Zone, Gu Zhutong's troops in the Third War Zone, and Yu Hanmou's troops, who are currently struggling. Among them, most of the generals are prominent figures in the Chongqing camp, and hundreds of thousands of troops among them are the elite and strong backbone of Chongqing, but they are ultimately unable to withstand the fierce attack of the Japanese army and are annihilated one after another. The strength of the Japanese army can also be known from this. The battle on the mainland of China in the Greater East Asia War cannot be regarded as an independent battle detached from the overall war situation. The United States, in order to aid Chongqing, not only supplies weapons and ammunition, but also attempts to counterattack Japan from the mainland, and to respond to the Pacific counterattack, strongly press on the transportation of Japan's southern resource areas, deplete war resources, so that Japan cannot develop strong modern warfare, and further attack the Japanese mainland. The above is completely the basic strategy of the Eastern Operations since the Cairo Conference. Therefore, this Chinese operation has the task of destroying the US base in Chongqing and destroying the Chongqing combat power that has been turned into an American running dog. It can also be said to be a decisive battle between Japan and the United States. At the same time, the defeat of the anti-Axis forces can be said to be a collapse of a part of the Cairo Conference.

### The Agricultural Construction Committee is Established in the Qingxiang Area of Northern Jiangsu

Nantong, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Rural Construction Committee of the Qingxiang area in Northern Jiangsu, after three months of preparation, convened its inaugural meeting and held an inauguration ceremony on the 3rd. Many guests were present, including Commissioner Zhang of the Commissioner's Office, Director Zhang of the Secretariat, and several foreign guests. First, Chairman Zhang delivered an opening speech, followed by speeches by Yoshikawa, the first director of the Liaison Department of the Nantong area, and Sonoda, the director of the Nantong Branch of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai. The Nantong County Chamber of Commerce also gave a congratulatory speech. The first committee meeting was then held to discuss the organizational rules and regulations for rural construction planning, as well as budget estimates. The members expressed broad views and were very enthusiastic. After the meeting, the Commissioner's Office hosted a banquet with new national dishes for all attendees to promote fellowship.

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raid Zhijiang Airport in Xiang, and Bomb Chongqing Troops in Hengyang City

A certain forward base of the Japanese army in Hunan, 5th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese bomber squadron fiercely bombed Zhijiang Airport, the forward base of the Chongqing-American Air Force in Hunan, late on the 3rd, thoroughly destroying its military facilities and achieving great results. After losing Hengyang Airport, the Chongqing-American Air Force used Zhijiang Airport, about 300 kilometers west of Hengyang, as a base for continued attacks. The airport is located in the middle of a basin, with good terrain and natural cover, making it difficult to spot its target even during the day. However, on that night, the Japanese army, with experienced nighttime navigation, safely arrived at the airport when there was a thunderstorm with thick dark clouds. The first batch of Japanese aircraft identified the covered area and dropped bombs and took off, and then carried out aerial bombing. At that time, a small fighter plane was hit and caught fire. In the red light, it was clear that there were still a dozen planes parked side by side on both sides of the runway. After the Japanese Air Force's second and third batches of continuous bombing, the Chongqing army fired machine guns from all sides of the airport, but the Japanese aircraft took the opportunity to fiercely attack them. As a result, several small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and thirteen were damaged. It was said that it was not possible to determine other things due to the dark weather.

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Central News Agency: On the night of the 3rd, several times, the Zhijiang Airport in western Hunan was attacked urgently, and another team bombed Changde. On the 4th, they bombed Badong and Shishi in eastern Sichuan Province.

A certain front line of the Japanese army, 5th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 2nd, a Japanese aircraft, a fine bomber squadron, bombed the 10th Division and the 74th Division of the Chongqing army surrounded by the Japanese army in Hengyang City. The Chongqing army suffered heavy casualties, and the Japanese aircraft all flew back to the base safely.

### The Completion of the Sanzang Memorial Pagoda

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency)

The entire project of the Sanzang Memorial Pagoda has been completed, and a capping ceremony was held on the 5th. Hundreds of people including Chu Minyi, Xu Suchu, and the allies Ikuo Ohtani and the Ambassador of Manchukuo attended, and Chu Minyi presided over the ceremony. It is also learned that the inauguration ceremony of the pagoda will be held in September.

### Chinese and Japanese Officials and Civilians Should Cooperate to Promote Economic Policies

——Counselor Ogura's Speech in Japan——

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Ogura Masatsune, the Highest Economic Counselor of the National Government, met with a group of reporters at the Tokyo Hall a few days ago after returning to Tokyo for official business. He delivered a speech centered on the current economic situation of the National Government, as follows:

### The first feeling

I have is that the economy of China today is a war-zone economy, which cannot be compared with the economy of Japan and Manchukuo at the same time. There are still battles being fought on its territory. After the war, it will directly affect the economy and will affect the war effort. The Henan Operation is a good example. Although the operation did not have a clear economic impact, it has been of great help to the promotion of economic policies in North China and Central China in the future. At present, the focus of economic policy in North China is the exploitation and increased production of underground resources such as iron ore and coal. The focus of the policy in Central China is the purchase of agricultural products such as rice, cotton, wheat, and rapeseed. This is a powerful link in the policy of strengthening the war efforts of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. However, there are obstacles in the political and economic aspects during the implementation of this policy. Therefore, Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians should cooperate more closely in the future. The biggest problem in Central China at present is

### The Rice Problem

If there is no rice, the local economy cannot be promoted smoothly. If there is a shortage of rice, it will inevitably affect wheat flour. Once wheat flour is affected, the development of underground resources in North China, which relies on rice and wheat for food, will be affected. However, the rice problem has already become an abstract discussion. Therefore, the people of China and Japan should grasp the reality and cooperate to promote the solution of this problem. What I admire most is the Chinese light industry. At present, it is entirely the Chinese who are using their own creativity to rely on their own efforts. The Ministry of Commerce and Trade of the National Government has three control associations under it: cotton, rice, and wheat flour. The success of the wheat flour control association is obvious. The purchasing agency of the wheat flour control association is composed of the flour companies that were established before the war. However, the rice control association is newly established, so it is quite difficult. What the authorities of China and Japan are constantly striving for is

### The Stability of People's Livelihood

And to maintain and cultivate the Chinese economy. These two major policies have always been important. Japan is sincerely helping China, so it is implementing new policies. One of these concrete policies is the restoration of agriculture. This policy is also the best way for the National Government to grasp the hearts of the Chinese people. The purpose of the Qingxiang work is also in this. The National Government's control has gradually expanded from points and lines to surfaces. Secondly, the industry and productivity in Shanghai and other places are improving. The reason for the lack of industrial productivity is due to the lack of raw materials, especially coal and electricity. If the problem of low productivity is not solved, the supply of materials to rural areas will be lacking, and even the policy of maintaining banknotes will be affected.

### The Coal Problem

Is nothing more than insufficient transportation capacity. In order to solve this shortage, we are planning to supplement the development of small and medium-sized coal pits. The third is to ensure the food supply for the Chinese people. At present, although the food supply for the army, civil servants, and other employees has been ensured, it cannot be said to be satisfactory. The thorough attitude of cooperation is very obvious. Fourthly, in order to maintain the value of currency and other economic policies, it is hoped that people in the Chinese economic circles will further realize that it is quite profound, and will further promote the operation of the controlled economy and other current situations, and actively cooperate in the promotion of the National Government's policies. The above is what I have talked about

### The Impressions I Got

In order to seek the stability of the people's livelihood in China and the maintenance and cultivation of the Chinese economy, I am determined to work hard with sincerity.

### The Japanese Army on Saipan Island is Fighting Fiercely in Hand-to-Hand Combat with the Enemy, Enemy Aircraft Attacking Omiya and Yap Islands are Heavily Damaged

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the situation on Saipan Island at 5:00 PM on the 5th as follows: The overwhelming enemy forces, under the cover of aircraft and ship artillery fire, are advancing with tanks towards the Japanese army's positions in the northeastern part of the island. Fierce battles are erupting everywhere, and the Japanese army and navy are fighting hand-to-hand with them.

A certain Japanese base, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's mobile units are still continuing to operate near Saipan Island. On the 4th, several enemy aircraft carriers were discovered in the surveillance area of the Japanese army on the island. The enemy aircraft from Aslito Airport on Saipan Island are constantly launching attacks. The land battles are continuing intensely between the two sides.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Washington, a certain US Navy Lieutenant Colonel, after participating in the landing operation on Saipan Island, returned to the United States on the 3rd. Talking about the fierce resistance of the Japanese army during the Saipan Island operation, he said that when our ships approached the coast of Saipan Island, the Japanese army's artillery fire was dense, like raindrops. When we arrived at the coast, we were lying behind the embankments because the Japanese army's machine guns were sweeping, making it impossible to open our eyes. The Japanese army disregarded whether we landed or not and kept firing. Our mission was to sweep away the Japanese army's resistance strongholds in the valleys. The ingenious defense of the Japanese army used land mines and flame throwers. The bloody battle on Saipan Island was even more fierce than Guadalcanal.

A certain Japanese base, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese fighter squadron and ground troops on Omiya Island repelled the enemy's carrier-based aircraft that attacked the island on the 3rd, shooting down 20 of them instantly and causing the others to flee. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

A certain Japanese base, 5th (Central News Agency) – 23 enemy aircraft attacked Yap Island on the 4th. The Japanese troops stationed there engaged them, shooting down 6 and destroying 5.

### Fierce Battles are Underway in the Ogasawara Islands Area, Enemy Aircraft Attacking Iwo Jima are Heavily Damaged

Central Pacific Base, 5th (Central News Agency) Since an enemy force appeared in the Ogasawara Islands area on the 3rd, the sea there has suddenly turned into a fierce battlefield. The enemy force has been deploying from near Chichijima and Iwo Jima on the ocean, and continues to repeatedly attack Iwo Jima with hundreds of ship-based aircraft from morning to evening. The local Japanese guard units are engaging them, shooting down more than 18 of them. The two sides are currently engaged in combat. Furthermore, since this morning, up to hundreds of enemy aircraft have repeatedly attacked Chichijima several times. In the afternoon, its cruisers, destroyers, and other ships also came to bombard. The battle between the two armies is currently underway.

### Japanese-German Political Talks Will Continue to be Held

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Dentsu News Agency reported: A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer held talks with Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu in Tokyo, and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima Kouji also held talks with the German leader and Foreign Minister. This is a kind of parallel political talk. Japanese officials informed the German ambassador of details of the Japanese war operations perspective and Japanese war efforts, and the German head also informed the Japanese ambassador of German details. These parallel talks will continue to be held in the future. The spokesperson said that the German head met with the Japanese ambassador many times, and not every time was announced.
