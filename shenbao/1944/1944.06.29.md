Mariana Islands Naval Battle

Question: The recent battle off Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific has drawn worldwide attention and is called the prelude to the great Pacific decisive battle. What is its actual significance?

Answer: This battle in the Mariana Islands is an unprecedented large-scale campaign in terms of size, number of troops mobilized, and the intensity of the enemy's ambitions since the beginning of the war. Considering the strategic situation of the US's attempt to capture Saipan, the island is 2,400 kilometers south of Tokyo and has long been the center of Japanese naval operations. Tokyo, Yokohama, and Osaka to the north, Oshima Island and most of the Marshall Islands to the east, important islands from the Bismarck Archipelago to New Guinea to the south, and southern Kyushu and most of the Ryukyu Islands to the west are all within a 1,000-mile radius of the island. Therefore, the island is actually the central area for defending the entire Greater East Asia region. This battle in this area has great significance for the entire East Asian war situation.

Question: From this perspective, the enemy venturing deep into Japan's largest defense center to take action is a most foolish adventure. Why would the enemy take such a great risk so foolishly at a time when the European invasion operations have just begun?

Answer: The enemy's motive for this adventure can be analyzed from both political and military strategies. Strategy follows politics, so let's look at the political aspect first. Regarding the East Asian operations, the US and British authorities have made extremely rash statements in the past, resulting in repeated failures of the US and British military, and the public's faith in the government has greatly diminished. Now, in order to maintain its domestic and international credibility and to show that the United States is capable of fighting on both the East and West fronts simultaneously, it has to take a reckless gamble. Secondly, the Japanese army has recently launched a large-scale offensive on the mainland, and the Chongqing army has suffered disastrous defeats in Henan and Hunan, and is on the verge of collapse. US Vice President Wallace, who bears a special mission, arrived in Chongqing at this time, which is truly a situation for both laughter and tears. The US leaders are therefore more willing to take risks in order to boost the morale of Chongqing and ease domestic criticism.

Question: What is the strategic intent?

Answer: The political aspect is completely passive, and in essence, it is just a reckless gamble. Therefore, there are many errors in the strategic aspect as well. First, the enemy has long held a fear of the Japanese navy, but mistakenly believes that the Japanese navy only knows how to defend the homeland; and mistakenly believes that the Japanese navy can be lured out and annihilated; hence this adventure. Second, because the "island hopping" strategy has been completely defeated by the Japanese army in the past two years, they are thinking of changing their approach, willing to make greater sacrifices to attack the base closest to the Japanese mainland, in order to reverse the entire East Asian war situation.

Question: The enemy's political and military strategies are so out of touch with reality, no wonder they have suffered severe blows. Can you tell us about the progress of the Saipan Island operation?

Answer: On the morning of June 15th, the enemy army approaching the Mariana Islands attempted to land on Saipan Island twice, but was repelled on the sea. By the afternoon, after seizing a corner of the island, they gradually increased their forces, but were ambushed by the Japanese garrison and suffered heavy losses. At the same time, the enemy appearing near the Mariana Islands was a large mobile unit mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships, and most of the Pacific Fleet was concentrated in that area. The Japanese air force actively launched attacks. By June 19th, part of the Japanese Combined Fleet surrounded the enemy mobile unit in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, and by the 20th, it had sunk and destroyed five enemy aircraft carriers and more than one battleship. On the 23rd, the Japanese air force became more active, sinking and destroying four enemy battleships, more than eleven aircraft carriers, and six cruisers one after another. By this point, the enemy fleet had no choice but to retreat.

Question: I heard that the enemy dispatched eighty percent of its fleet this time, showing great determination and ambition in its operations. Why was it so easily defeated?

Answer: I have already said that this time, the enemy's operation against the Mariana Islands was full of adventurous psychology, but their political and military strategies were without any basis, so their failure is not surprising. From a political point of view, the United States is actually trying to restore colonial slave rule, which is well known to all ethnic groups in East Asia. Secondly, from a strategic point of view, as former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Suetsugu said: "In the past, fleets that ventured out far from the motherland's fortress have always brought about their own destruction." "Looking at the historical examples of the Yuan dynasty's invasion, the Baltic Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, the Spanish Armada, and the Battle of Sarannis, although relying on material strength, there has never been a case of good fortune when operating far away." Now the enemy is still 3,300 nautical miles away from its supply line, Pearl Harbor, while Japan is as close as the doorstep. The Japanese army is well-rested, waiting for work, and the navy, army, and air force are cooperating, ready to give the enemy a severe blow at any time. Therefore, the victor and loser have already been determined.

Question: So what is the trend of the Mariana Islands operation?

Answer: According to our observation, although the enemy's attack on Saipan Island this time has great ambition, the purpose may be to lure out the Japanese main fleet. However, when part of the Japanese main fleet arrived, it first used the air force to bomb the US fleet, inflicting heavy damage, and finally forced it to retreat. Colonel Kurihara, head of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, said it well: "The damage inflicted on the enemy this time is already quite significant, but compared to the enemy's forces that invaded this time, it is only a part, and it cannot determine the battle situation. Therefore, in the future, in that area, we must thoroughly eliminate the invading enemy with the full force of the navy, army, and air force." We, standing in the position of one of the allied nations in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation, must redouble our efforts to assist our allies, prepare for the final decisive battle, and welcome the final victory. I can borrow the words of General Suetsugu Nobumasa to offer to the people of the country:

"Every moment from now on is precious time for Japanese soldiers to kill the enemy. May you all calmly await the good news!"

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Aslito Airfield; Air Raids on Islands Around Saipan Intensify

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in the Saipan Island area, cooperating with ground troops, also launched a night raid on the Aslito Airfield in the southern part of the island on the 26th, bombing it fiercely, destroying it and setting it on fire. The Japanese side suffered no damage. On the same day, Japanese aircraft also bombed the enemy supply accumulation point south of Garapan in the western part of the island, hitting many bombs, causing explosions and a major fire. The Japanese army safely returned to its defense amid triumphant cheers.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Air raids by the US Air Force on islands around Saipan Island have become increasingly intense, especially on Pagan Island. On the 27th, a total of sixty to one hundred carrier-based fighters attacked the island, but the Japanese garrison immediately repelled the enemy aircraft. In addition, another sixty enemy aircraft attacked Rota, and were repelled after being met by the Japanese army.

### Torrential Rains in Longchuan and Shijiang, Yunnan; A Major Battle on the Plains is About to Unfold; Supply Difficulties for Chongqing by Land and Air

A certain Japanese army base on the Nu River Front, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the Yunnan Expeditionary Force crossed the Nu River and invaded the Longling and Tengchong areas of Japanese-occupied Yunnan, it is suffering due to the rear supply lines being hampered by bad weather. The main force of several divisions of the Chongqing 20th Army Group, which crossed the river upstream of the Nu River, is now moving south from Longchuan and Shijiang. The Japanese army is also gathering new elite troops, preparing to inflict a major blow on the Chongqing army on the muddy Yunnan plains during the torrential rains. According to prisoners, Chongqing launched only two fierce counterattacks before being defeated. The 21st Regiment recently called for a third counterattack, and a division of reinforcements was transferred, but these were mostly wounded soldiers who had been reorganized. Since the start of the Nu River operation, as of June 23rd, it has been confirmed that Chongqing troops left behind a total of over 1,450 corpses, and more than 20,000 were killed, wounded, or captured. Chongqing's second intensive offensive against the Nu River front was completely ineffective.

Rangoon, 28th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in northern Burma previously drove the combined Chongqing-US forces to invade the Hukawng Valley area, attempting to open a route to invade Tonkin (Vietnam), but after attacks by the Japanese army, they have suffered heavy losses after half a year of fighting. Their attempt to recapture Burma is unlikely to be realized with the arrival of the rainy season. Therefore, in his anxiety, Stilwell ordered the Chongqing army airborne troops stationed in India, who had undergone a short period of training, to parachute into Myitkyina, a key point in northern Burma, in an attempt to seize the area. However, due to continuous attacks by the Japanese army, lack of air supply, and the prevalence of infectious diseases, these airborne troops have lost their will to fight, and recent surrenders have been numerous. The airborne troops are now in a state of disintegration and collapse in the dense forests of northern Burma. As of the 23rd, Chongqing airborne troops had left behind more than 4,500 corpses. If the officers, wounded, prisoners, and surrendering soldiers are included, the losses of the Chongqing army actually exceed 10,000. Currently, various units of the Japanese army are launching surprise encirclement operations everywhere to wipe out the defeated and remnant Chongqing forces. Due to the arrival of the rainy season in northern Burma, Chongqing's supply is difficult by both land and air. In terms of supply, the US army has priority, while most Chongqing troops can only eat the leftovers of the US army. On the 24th of this month, eight Chongqing soldiers surrendered to the Japanese army, claiming that the American soldiers were treacherous, eating meat and drinking milk themselves and hiding alcohol in their clothes, while giving Chongqing soldiers only a section of sugarcane every day, without caring. They also said that if Indian soldiers wanted to smoke, they had to clean the rust from the American soldiers' iron equipment. The American soldiers' inhumane behavior was often seen on the battlefield. They only received three or four months of military training in their own country. They had very little courage, and dared not travel alone in the dense forest. When moving at night, they often placed Chongqing troops in the front. When Chongqing soldiers contracted diseases or typhoid fever, American doctors would not treat them, but let them recover naturally. Therefore, the Chongqing army airborne troops stationed in India only know that resistance is hopeless, and their hatred of the American army is growing day by day. The entire Chongqing army is on the path to surrender or destruction within the Japanese encirclement.

### Japan's Ideological Decisive Battle Association Officially Established Yesterday; Regular Meetings to be Held on the 18th of Each Month

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ideological Decisive Battle Committee decided to appoint former Ambassador to Italy and current member of the House of Representatives, Shiratori Toshio, as chairman. The establishment ceremony was held at the Kaikan at 2:00 PM on the 27th. Chairman Shiratori and more than a dozen key members attended, and it was decided that the committee's objectives would be to: 1. Promote the Imperial Way. 2. Thoroughly instill the idea of sharing destiny with allied nations. 3. Research poisonous and evil ideas. 4. Expose enemy strategies and propaganda. 5. Study financial and economic policies. 6. Conduct concrete research on a new world order. The committee then discussed each issue in detail and adjourned at 5:00 PM. The committee will hold regular meetings on the 18th of each month and will provide the authorities with the drafts it has decided on at any time.

### Information Officer Yokoyama Gave a Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Yokoyama, Information Officer of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with Chinese reporters stationed in Japan on the afternoon of the 28th and gave a speech on US Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing and British Production Minister Lyttelton's slip of the tongue: "US Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing has resulted in a joint statement with Chiang Kai-shek. What we find most noteworthy and interesting in the statement is the granting of autonomy to Asian nations within a certain period of time. However, since the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration last year and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, Asian nations such as Burma, the Philippines, and India have already become independent one after another. Therefore, what they are declaring, we have already implemented. The United States is using China as its military base, which is the reason for Wallace's visit to Chongqing. However, whether their plan to use China as their military base can succeed or not can be clearly seen from the battles in Henan and Hunan. Regarding British Production Minister Lyttelton's slip of the tongue that the United States provoked the current Japanese-American war, it is not just Lyttelton alone, but also 30 people within the United States who have been charged with treason, because they all said, 'Japan is by no means the provoker of this war; in other words, it is actually the United States.' The above-mentioned 30 people have now been sentenced to ten years in prison or a fine of 100,000 dollars."

### Ambassador Yoshizawa Delivers a Speech

Saigon, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa visited Governor Decoux in Dalat on the 20th, returned to Saigon on the 25th, and met with the Japanese press corps at his official residence on the evening of the 26th, delivering a speech: "When the US and British landed in Europe, I was in Hanoi. At that time, I received an official letter from Governor Decoux hoping to meet as soon as possible, so I rushed to Dalat ahead of schedule. The meeting went smoothly. Governor Decoux repeatedly stated that no matter what happens in his country, the local area will never change its policy of cooperating with Japan. At this stage in Vietnam's support for the Petain government, the Empire's policy towards Vietnam will also absolutely not change. On this point, my opinion and Governor Decoux's opinion are completely consistent. The US and British plots against Vietnam are about to become increasingly fierce, and I have requested the Vietnamese authorities to actively seek countermeasures. Governor Decoux has issued orders to all parties to instruct methods. The French people in the area are not without concerns about the recent situation in their own country, but France itself now seems to be very calm. The situation of the Vietnamese authorities is also extremely calm."

### High-Grade Aviation Fuel Does Not Produce Deadly Poison; Invention by Dr. Akatsuka of Japan

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Akatsuka Kyoji, a technician at the Research Institute of the Japanese Ministry of Military Affairs, has made significant contributions to the mass production of high-grade aviation fuel. The Director of the Naval Ministry's Ordnance Bureau awarded the doctor a letter of commendation. The commendation ceremony was held in the Director's office on the afternoon of the 27th, with relevant officials in attendance. Dr. Akatsuka has succeeded in making high-grade aviation fuel, which had previously relied on foreign countries, domestically produced. The most difficult issue was the production of deadly poison during the production process. To this end, he continued to research scientific prevention measures in his spare time, and finally established a successful anti-poisoning measure. As a result, Japan's high-performance aviation fuel, which is praised around the world, has seen a large increase in production due to the perfection of anti-poisoning facilities. All production soldiers have been able to devote themselves to production work with peace of mind, free from tragic occupational diseases. Dr. Akatsuka stated in Fukushima Prefecture: "The content and method of research is not to inject or administer drugs to the poisoned workers, but to fundamentally improve the overall factory facilities, such as preventing the deadly poison produced in the work process from coming into contact with the workers who work hard, and ventilating and replacing air to immediately disperse the deadly poison, and absorb it with ultraviolet rays, so as to prevent the occurrence of poisoned patients. I am confident that this type of facility in our country can be praised around the world. I am very pleased that not only has the goal of increased production been achieved, but also that the workers are not being poisoned."

### Gandhi Continues Anti-British Struggle

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Relations between the Indian government and the Gandhians have recently deteriorated due to the government's provocative attitude. The Gandhians seem to have adopted a resolute attitude, and are continuing their anti-British struggle without fear of arrest by the British Indian authorities. According to a Reuters dispatch from Poona, the Gandhians resolutely demanded on the 26th that Governor-General Wavell meet with them to review the current situation, but it remains to be seen what measures Wavell will take in response to this request from the Gandhians.

### Ministry of Personnel Affairs Changes Review Methods

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the Ministry of Personnel Affairs of the National Government began handling the review of civil service appointments in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China, it has made changes to the procedures in consideration of civil servants who were collecting documents after the Incident. The Ministry issued a list of required supplementary documents and notified the original reviewing agency to forward them for supplementation, so that they could be qualified in accordance with the law and be remedied. However, since the implementation, there have been cases where the documents were delayed for several months, or even overdue and not supplemented, which is contrary to the original intention and expected effect of the Ministry. It is now learned that in order to thoroughly clear up the backlog of cases that have been handled but not completed, the Ministry has sent separate letters to the original reviewing agencies, strictly urging them to complete the supplementation within a limited time. In the future, when central and local agencies submit civil servants for review, they must submit all documents together with the application form. If the documents are incomplete, even if the information filled in on the form is consistent, no further notice will be given, and the original documents will be reviewed in accordance with the law to quickly determine whether they are qualified or unqualified. Those who are unqualified may apply for a review within one month of the receipt of the notification, in accordance with Article 16 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Civil Service Appointment Law, limited to one time.

### Commander-in-Chief Hata Inspects Japanese Air Force Frontline Base; Reviews Various Fighter Squadrons and Commends Them

A certain Japanese army base, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since occupying Hengyang, the Japanese army has continued to advance and is now approaching the outskirts of Hengyang. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing military forces will be completely eliminated, all thanks to the cooperation of the Japanese army's air and ground forces. General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, arrived at a certain base on the 26th, braving the heat, in order to commend the Japanese Air Force units that are covering the friendly forces' advance, bombing US Air Force bases in Chongqing, and thoroughly destroying the enemy's combat power. He first listened to a report on the new fighter aircraft, and then reviewed several team members, from officers to privates, of various fighter squadrons. After the review, he gave a speech, mainly saying: "All the brilliant achievements on the mainland battlefield are due to your struggles. However, the war situation is becoming more urgent, and I hope that you will make further efforts in the future." These words gave all the members great inspiration, and their heroic posture was written on their faces. Commander-in-Chief Hata then left the base amid enthusiastic farewells.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, previously inspected the front lines in Hunan and gave guidance on operations. Now, on the 26th, he inspected the frontline base of the Japanese air force squadron on the same front and gave instructions on operational matters. Due to the progress of the Hunan operations, the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing are becoming increasingly active. The Japanese air force squadron in the area is now actively engaging in air combat to eliminate this US Air Force and is increasingly determined to fight. The results of the battle are now expanding. Regarding this point, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued a proclamation at 1:00 PM on the 28th, stating that General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, inspected a certain frontline base of the Japanese air force squadron on the 26th and gave instructions on operational matters.

### Japanese Troops Suddenly Enter Hengyang; Chongqing Faces Major Threat; Statement by Press Chief Izumi

Central News Agency Report: The press department of the Imperial Japanese Army in Shanghai held a routine meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 28th) at a Chinese restaurant on the Bund in Nanjing Road.  Press Chief Izumi spoke on the rapid progress of the Japanese army in the recent operations in southern Hunan, having broken into Hengyang, the expanded base of the enemy's American air force in Chongqing. He also discussed the military significance of occupying Luoyang and Changsha, which greatly caused Chongqing to lose its protective screen and suffer a severe blow, urging Chongqing to quickly realize the situation. Finally, he deemed the Allied invasion of Europe and the American military actions in the Pacific as unworthy of attention and not progressing as ideally as they had hoped. A record of his statement follows:

Significant Impact: Minister Izumi began by saying that according to news from the front lines regarding the situation in Hunan, on the morning of the 24th of this month, the Japanese army swiftly broke into the Hengyang airfield. The Chongqing troops defending the area, numbering about two divisions, were engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. He believed that the situation could be resolved in a short period. Hengyang is the largest forward base for the American air force in Chongqing, and since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing and the United States have desperately engaged in the construction of various bases in Hengyang. Furthermore, the name Hengyang has recently gained considerable international prominence. Therefore, the Japanese army is determined to launch an offensive on this crucial point, causing no small military and psychological impact on Chongqing. The significance of the Japanese army's attack on Hengyang lies not only in dealing a deadly blow to the enemy and achieving important military gains but also in gaining control of the Pinghan-Yuehan railway lines after occupying Hengyang. Thus, Hengyang will become the center for securing these communication lines (including railways, highways, and waterways), exerting pressure on the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Today, the Japanese army has already achieved considerable success in the central part of the Chinese mainland, having broken into Hengyang, occupied Luoyang in northern Henan, and Changsha in Hunan. This means that Japan has deeply penetrated the important protective screen of Chongqing, further threatening the eastern provinces of the Chinese mainland, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Guangdong. Foreign journalists stationed in Chongqing have repeatedly reported that the fall of Hengyang is more serious than that of Changsha in military and economic terms, urging rapid reflection. In the context of the anti-Axis alliance, this has created a state of anxiety and embarrassment, with deep fears that Chongqing may break away from the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, serious consideration is being given to reversing this declining trend. Furthermore, the United States is particularly impatient. The fact of Chongqing's military failure has completely shattered the plans of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US Pacific Fleet. Nimitz advocated using the Chinese mainland to attack mainland Japan, but Chongqing's military failure has led to the collapse of his plan. At the same time, the island-hopping strategy advocated by General MacArthur, commander of the US forces in the Southwest Pacific, has also been severely threatened from the side, making it difficult for their plans to be realized in the short term. As a result, major disagreements may arise in the American war effort in the Pacific. The weak performance of the American air force in Chongqing has further caused them anxiety and unease. Moreover, the Chongqing regime's corruption, reliance on foreign forces, and use of concealment to cover up its own failures, combined with its excessive expectations for the US Navy's battle in Saipan, while underestimating the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, reveal a self-satisfied and self-destructive attitude that will ultimately lead to its own downfall. Therefore, caring about the anti-Axis invasion of Europe and the progress of the American forces in the Pacific while forgetting the loss of important strongholds and placing the serious threat aside, entrusting all life and property to others, is foolish and deeply regrettable.  The delusion that they can join the ranks of the victorious nations as long as Britain and the United States win should be deeply reflected upon as soon as possible. The anti-Axis invasion of Europe and the American military actions in the Pacific will certainly not achieve the ideal progress they envision.

### China Railway Decides to Assist in Grain Transportation

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) To alleviate the food shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, the authorities have formulated temporary measures for food grains in the two cities and instructed the China Railway to provide convenience. However, progress has not been satisfactory so far. This reporter interviewed the relevant authorities, who stated that the China Railway, being under military administration during wartime, prioritizes military transport, and civil transport inevitably takes a secondary role. The general public should understand the difficulties of the times. However, the authorities will provide convenience within possible limits to assist the authorities and effectively suppress the rising rice prices.

### Fierce Fighting Near Hengyang

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) According to Chongqing Central Broadcasting, the Japanese army is advancing southward on the east and west sides of the Yuehan Railway, converging east of Hengyang. Then, they divided their forces into two routes, one attacking the northeast corner of Hengyang, and the other attacking the Hengyang airfield. Intense fighting is currently taking place near Hengyang.

### North China Establishes Second Directly-Administered Administrative Region

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Zhang Zhongzhi, Vice Minister of General Affairs of the North China Political Affairs Commission, met with a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building on the morning of the 27th to discuss the establishment of the second directly-administered administrative region. He stated as follows: Since the designation of Yongqing, Gu'an, Anci, and Daxing counties as the first directly-administered administrative region in late November last year, the reconstruction has been exceptionally successful. The authorities, encouraged by this, have further designated the ten counties and one city of the entire Jidong Circuit as the second directly-administered administrative region, which is broader in scope than the first region and has special political significance. This is an important area of Hebei Province, bordering Manchuria. The important industrial areas include the Kailuan coal mines, and the industrial center of Tangshan. The characteristic of the directly-administered region lies in concentrating the overall strength of the military, government, officials, and people to promote administrative implementation. In particular, the communist bandits are deeply rooted, making it necessary to concentrate the overall strength to eliminate them.

### Prices in Beiping Gradually Decline

Beiping, 28th (Central News Agency) Prices in Beiping rose sharply in early spring but have gradually declined since late March. Recently, daily necessities such as cotton textiles, rice, firewood, soap, cigarettes, and cooking oil have plummeted in price, much to the delight of the general public. The price decrease is attributed to the change in rice distribution to ten kilograms per person per month, and the crackdown on merchants hoarding goods, which has been effective. The confiscated hoarded goods are distributed to citizens at publicly determined prices. As a result, the price of millet in May fell by nine-tenths compared to February, and the price of corn fell by 17%, indicating that prices are becoming more stable. German Artillery Effectively Bombards Enemy Deployment Lines

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: Fierce fighting continued throughout the 26th in the Tilly area. Although the British suffered heavy casualties, they continued to press south between Hottot and Norrey, but all attacks near Hottot were defeated. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division and the British 3rd Infantry Division on both sides of Tilly suffered serious losses in the battle. Enemy engineers attacked German fortresses with flamethrowers and were subjected to heavy artillery fire, and some of the engineers were killed when their flamethrowers were hit. No major battles occurred along the Caen to Vigny line. The movements of the large-scale enemy deployment were effectively disrupted by German artillery fire, revealing their offensive plans in the area. At the same time, the US Eighth Army, which recently landed at the bridgehead, is fighting in the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula. Since Sunday, the artillery fire has become increasingly intense. Although a general offensive has not yet been launched, German artillery fire has been effective in bombarding the enemy's entry points and deployment lines. London announced last night that Major General Saunders, commander of the Allied Marine Corps, had been killed in action on the Normandy front. German authorities announced that within the city of Cherbourg...

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) Reuter's reports from London: Allied military authorities have mobilized the best British and American engineers and salvage ship workers in an attempt to restore the destroyed docks of Cherbourg. Reuter's military correspondent Setorius is deeply concerned with the sea and air power of the Allies, which can now be transferred to other military operations. Whether the enemy will take large-scale landing operations at other locations along the Atlantic coast or temporarily use the Normandy bridgehead as an offensive base depends on future developments. The latter requires replenishing its landing forces in Cotentin and Calvados and expanding the Calvados bridgehead to the south before launching large-scale offensives eastward and southward. However, it is also possible for the enemy to carry out large-scale landings elsewhere to serve as the main force for the invasion of Europe. The German command has been preparing for this, and the German army's ability to maintain its strength during three weeks of invasion operations is evidence of the military authorities' effective response.

### Soviet Forces Launch Pincer Movement, Reaching Minsk Area; German Forces Break Through Encirclement in Orsha

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: The Soviet forces' large-scale summer offensive in the central sector clearly aims to conduct a large-scale encirclement under the cover of tanks and mechanized units. The enemy's units attacking the German positions in Bobruisk and increasing pressure on Bobruisk from the Vitebsk area have forced the German defense line there to retreat from several strongpoints. The enemy's repeated attempts to break through towards Bobruisk have been blocked south of the town, causing heavy enemy casualties. The German forward positions in Mogilev have also had to retreat to the edge of the town, and the German forces in the surrounding areas are also retreating to the Dnieper River line.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report, military source: Vitebsk in the central sector of the Eastern Front...

(Wuhan News) The Japanese army has been operating in the Henan and Hunan regions for several months. The operations have been proceeding smoothly, with the successive fall of Chongqing's important strongholds such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Changsha. The war is still ongoing. Recently, a Japanese war correspondent returned from the front lines due to some business. The press reporting unit here invited the correspondent and reporters from Chinese news agencies and newspapers to a symposium on June 24. The war correspondent spoke about how the Japanese army sympathizes with the general public of China, which is admirable. The minutes of the symposium are recorded below: War Correspondents: Hideo Umino (Special Correspondent for Yomiuri Shimbun), Kiyomi Qinzeji (Deputy Councilor of Domei News Agency), Usuke Oshima (Chief of the Hankou Branch of Asahi Shimbun); Press Reporting Unit: A Senior Military Officer; Chinese Reporters: Reporters from Da Chu Pao, Wuhan Pao, Shen Pao, and Central Telegraph Agency. Press Reporting Unit Member: Thank you very much for your presence today. First, I would like to ask Mr. Umino to explain the situation in Henan.

### Japanese Army Commits No Offenses

Umino: I have been serving in North China for two months. This time, I followed the Pinghan Railway south. I remember that in the past, when the Japanese army occupied a city or village, the residents would flee to the surrounding countryside and would not return to their original homes for several months. But this time, the situation is very different. No matter which city or village, within two or three days after the Japanese army moved in, many residents returned one after another. Young women were also walking on the streets without fear. What is the reason for this? Because the Japanese soldiers treat every Chinese civilian with love and care, so that the Chinese people feel that the Japanese soldiers are not their enemies. I can give a few examples. Originally, when the army moved into any place, it would usually borrow civilian houses as temporary dormitories. This time, the entire army stayed outdoors, and not a single soldier entered a Chinese civilian's house to disturb them. Not only a single soldier, even the highest-ranking commanders spent the night in tents on the road, even on rainy and muddy nights. There was one incident. In the rural areas of Henan, the wheat is now ripe, and the farmers are looking forward to the harvest. When the Japanese army passed through the rural areas, there were landmines buried by the Chongqing army everywhere on the road, which was very dangerous. So if they walked through the wheat fields, it would be the safest. However, they could not bear to destroy the hard work of the Chinese farmers, so they still walked on the retreat routes, knowing that there were dangerous objects there. Once, because I was short of food, I saw many ripe cucumbers in a vegetable garden and wanted to pick them to fill my stomach. Just as I was about to step into the garden, I was suddenly stopped by a military officer. If a unit's headquarters needed tables and chairs, they would want to borrow them from civilian houses temporarily. However, because the residents had all fled, they could not ask for permission and had to take them. But when the unit was ordered to depart, all the borrowed furniture was returned to its original place, and not a single item was lost. The above-mentioned situation is unprecedented in past operations. It is easy to imagine how disciplined the Japanese army is this time. After Zhengzhou fell, the Japanese army entered the city in a very orderly manner. So in just a few days, the residents came back one after another. A week later, the public security maintenance committee was established. Ten days later, the city was completely restored to its original state. In other places, it took no more than a month at the latest for the city to return to its former state.

Nishijima: Mr. Umino has explained very clearly how well the Japanese army in Henan treats the Chinese people. Now, please ask Mr. Qinzeji to explain the situation of the Japanese army in the Hunan area.

### Residents Return One After Another

Qinzeji: I also served in the Hunan area. I also saw the same things as Mr. Umino said. When we arrived at any village that the Japanese army's vanguard had passed through two or three days before, the roads, rice paddies, and houses were not damaged at all. Farmers were drying their washed clothes in front of their homes, and there were also cattle, pigs, sheep, and other livestock. Seeing this scene, one could hardly imagine that a large number of troops carrying weapons had stayed here two or three days ago. This is all proof that the Japanese army cares about the lives of the Chinese people after they return home and has not touched a single blade of grass or a single tree. When I arrived at a village on Dongting Lake, I took a boat with a friend from the army to play around because I had some free time. I saw several Japanese soldiers on the shore grabbing a calf, tying its four feet, and trying to kill it. Just then, a military policeman walked by, saw this situation, and severely scolded them and released the calf. The Chinese farmers knew that the Japanese army was coming, so they had to flee. They watched the situation from a place seven or eight kilometers away from their villages. Later, they learned that the Japanese army did not harm the people, so they returned to the place where the Japanese army was stationed after three or four days, which shows how much they trust the Japanese army.

Nishijima: Now please ask Mr. Oshima to speak.

### Facts of Friendship

Oshima: I am also a reporter who served in the Hunan region. The unit I served in was stationed in a certain place, and there was a village nearby. The soldiers took their food and other items to the village. I saw chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. I thought they had caught them to eat for dinner. Unexpectedly, those loving soldiers opened the cans and took out the contents to feed the chickens, ducks, etc. I thought that the Japanese soldiers loved the scenery of Hunan as much as they loved their hometowns. Once, the army was about to depart, and everyone was busy preparing. When they were about to depart, I saw a soldier in a Chinese civilian's house giving him medicine that he had brought with him. I asked him why. He told me that their family had been very kind to him and the other Japanese soldiers, making tea and sending fruit to express their condolences. Now that our unit is about to move forward, because I cannot speak Chinese, I took the medicine I brought with me and gave it to their mother. This is my way of thanking them. I think that in the anti-Japanese war zone, no one has ever taught the Chinese people to practice Sino-Japanese friendship, but if they treat each other with human love, then the facts of friendship will naturally occur. (To be continued)

### Measures for Passage in Traffic Blockade Zones Announced; Announcement by Japanese Army and Navy Authorities

The Shanghai Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command recently issued a notice amending the traffic control regulations at the time of the notice. From now on, when an alert is issued, all vehicles and pedestrians should stop for five minutes to avoid traffic chaos. In the past, the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, the Shanghai Garrison, and the Shanghai Military Police originally issued a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit." Holders of this permit were allowed to pass even after an alert was issued and during unexpected events when passage was prohibited. However, as of now, there seems to be a considerable number of holders of this permit, and the styles of the permits are also diverse. Therefore, to avoid causing confusion, the above three organizations have decided to unify the handling of this permit. All previously issued passage permits will be invalid from July 7. Anyone who truly needs to use this permit must reapply to the First or Second Police Bureau for issuance. The Marine Corps Garrison and the Military Police will strictly screen applicants and only issue permits to those deemed necessary. The above three organizations issued the following notice on the 29th:

### Announcement

The measures for passage in traffic blockade zones are stipulated as follows:

In traffic blockade zones after an alert is issued and when terrorist incidents occur, only the following personnel are allowed to pass:

A. Army and Navy military personnel and military affiliates, etc., wearing uniforms or holding identification cards.

B. Employees of consulates, police stations, the First and Second Police Bureaus, and the Jianghai Customs Port Police Bureau wearing uniforms.

C. Those holding a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit" issued by the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, the Shanghai Garrison, and the Shanghai Military Police.

For general residents to apply for a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit," they should fill out an application form, attach two photos, and submit it through the First or Second Police Bureau for application. After strict selection, permits will only be issued to those deemed necessary for air defense or security.

(Note) All previously issued "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permits" will be invalid from July 7 of this year.

### City's Banking Industry Holds General Membership Meeting Yesterday; Six Important Motions Passed, Re-election of Directors and Supervisors

The Shanghai Special Municipality Banking Association, in accordance with the provisions of its charter, held its 15th general membership meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). More than ten members attended. The meeting was chaired by Ye Fuxiao, Chairman of the Association, who delivered an opening speech. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the Association's affairs. The following were discussed and passed: Revision of the banking industry regulations; Approval of the Association's financial statements for the first half of this year and the budget for the second half; Approval of increasing the special fees for the second half of this year; Approval of adjusting the number of representatives per member; Approval of the Minyi Bank's application for membership; Approval of strengthening the internal organization of the Association, changing the secretariat into two departments: General Affairs and Auditing. The re-election of directors and supervisors for this term then took place, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.

### Report on Association Affairs

Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the Association's affairs, stating: It has been half a year since the 14th general membership meeting was held on December 29 last year. During this period, the Shanghai financial market did not see a relaxation of credit, and stock prices continued to fall. However, due to a slight decrease in speculative hoarding, general floating capital tended to normalize, so the financial situation as a whole was generally stable. In the past six months, the government has promulgated about twenty laws and regulations related to the financial industry, such as the "Provisional Measures for Restricting the Registration of Company Capital Increases," the "Deadline and Measures for Banks and Qianzhuang Organized as Companies in North China and Central China to Complete Supplementary Registration with the Ministry of Industry," the "Abolition of Restrictions on Remittances between North China and Central China," the "Issuance Measures for the First Series of Construction Public Bonds," the "Regulations on Food Grain Treasury Vouchers of Types A and B for the 32nd Year," the "Adjustment of the Currency System in the Huaihai Province," and the "Joint Exchange of United Reserve Certificates and Central Reserve Certificates." Among these, several are of utmost importance:

Prohibiting Banks from Purchasing and Hoarding Goods: The government has ordered the Association to thoroughly investigate and report violations for punishment. At the same time, the Economic Department of the First District Office of this city issued an order that the industry association should supervise the business operations of its members, and if there are violations or concealment, the person in charge of the association will be punished. In order to stabilize the social economy and maintain the financial market, in addition to distributing the order to all members, the Association specifically emphasized the importance of paying close attention to this matter, and all members should be able to deeply understand this purpose.

Implementation of the New Income Tax Rate: The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office implemented the new tax rate on March 1. It was learned that the business income tax of the first category A and B for the 32nd year was being collected. The Association believed that because the banks had already completed their year-end financial statements and had held shareholder meetings, and had already distributed the profits, retroactively collecting the tax would cause many difficulties. In terms of the tax rate, there were also some aspects that could be studied. Therefore, the Association and the Qianye Association jointly submitted a document requesting a one-year extension of the implementation, but because the case had been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, it was difficult to change, and the request could not be granted.

Prohibiting the Redemption of British and American Currencies: The buying and selling of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, etc., and remittances have been prohibited since July of the 31st year. However, in terms of foreign currency deposits and debts in banks, customers may not be very clear about this and may request to settle accounts by converting them into Central Reserve Certificates. The banks found it difficult to handle this. Therefore, the Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Later, it was approved that before foreign exchange trading is restored, the deposit and withdrawal of the above currencies are prohibited, and it is not allowed to settle accounts by converting them into Central Reserve Certificates. All banking associations in various places were also ordered to comply. Other reports on association affairs related to all members are omitted.

### Section Chief Matsushima Delivers Radio Address to Chongqing and Australia: "The Annihilation of the American Fleet is Increasingly Near"

Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet in China, delivered a radio address to Chongqing and Australia from Shanghai at 10:10 PM on the 27th, titled "The Annihilation of the American Fleet is Increasingly Near." A summary of the main points is recorded below:

### Decisive Battle Momentum Increasingly Intense

Since the appearance of the enemy's American forces of a substantial mobile unit in the Mariana Islands on June 11, the Pacific war situation has become even more significant, and the momentum of the decisive battle is increasingly intense. The current situation is that the enemy forces, having sustained heavy damage in the two naval battles of June 19 and 20, have temporarily withdrawn from our army's attack range. However, to support the two divisions of troops that landed in Saipan, they are still lingering in the nearby waters, intending to support the land operations on Saipan Island and to cut off our army's supply lines, intermittently attacking Iwo Jima by air.

### Preparing to Repel the Attacking Enemy Forces

Currently, the fierce battle between Japan and the United States on Saipan Island is intensifying daily, and it can be said to determine the future fate of the Greater East Asia War. To conceal their significant damage and operational disadvantages, the enemy, Britain and the United States, are single-mindedly engaging in false propaganda, and their methods are truly vicious and should be paid considerable attention. A general counter-offensive by Britain and the United States in the Pacific has long been anticipated, and Roosevelt has also claimed that it will be launched simultaneously with the invasion operations in Europe. However, regardless of the enemy's propaganda, our country's war power is only increasing daily. For example, at the graduation ceremony of the Army University on May 20, Chief of Staff Tojo instructed the students, stating that the war situation has reached a major turning point, and the elite troops of the Japanese army have adopted a decisive battle posture, preparing to repel the attacking enemy forces. Although the enemy has repeatedly engaged in large-scale propaganda since entering the Marshall Islands on January 30, they have only wasted time and made no progress. This is because they have learned that Truk and other important strongholds of our side are heavily defended, and the so-called central breakthrough in the Pacific is not easy. Since the enemy invaded Biak Island in New Guinea on May 27, the focus of the war has shifted to that area. However, the enemy has suffered strong resistance from our army in that area and has had to change its route.

### Political Drama, Utterly Tedious

The Anglo-American European invasion operation officially commenced on June 6th. However, facing the strong German army, they were completely helpless and suffered great losses. To salvage their credibility among the anti-Axis nations and neutral countries, Britain and America were eager to change the situation. In desperation, they decided to have the U.S. military attack the Mariana Islands. In other words, the U.S. military's attack on the Mariana Islands was not driven by the intrinsic mission of war, but purely a political drama to rescue the stalemate in the European war and to echo Wallace's visit to Chongqing, etc.

### Elected Directors and Supervisors

Elected Directors and Supervisors: Chairman of the Board: Ye Fuzhi; Managing Directors: Wu Zhenxiu, Tang Shoumin, Zhu Rutang, Zhu Boquan; Directors: Pan Jiufen, Chen Zipei, Xiang Shuchi, Chen Duoru, Sun Hegao, Wu Yunzhai, Sun Ruihuang, Shen Shuyu, Wang Boyuan, Wu Shiqin, Chen Zhenjiu, Zhou Wenrui, Lu Yunsheng, Xu Jingfu, Wang Haibo, Sun Zhongli, Liu Jisheng, etc.; Supervisors: Wu Weiru, Liang Guanliu, Jin Guanxian, Wang Erfan, Cheng Zhongfan, Yin Huanzhi, Huang Yuqi, Xu Rongfu, etc.; Alternate Directors: Li Zuji, Shen Changming, Xu Maotang, Liu Pinsan, Hong Zhenliang, Wu Shaoting, Lin Hanfu, Chen Runyong; Alternate Supervisors: Tong Shendao Yi, Li Gongti, Ding Shangui.

### Business Control Council to Hold Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors

The National Government's Executive Yuan has decided to reorganize the National Commercial Control Council, and has issued an explicit order to appoint Wen Lanting as Chairman of the Board. The original Chairman of the Board, Tang Shoumin, has been transferred to the position of Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In addition to the original directors and supervisors continuing in their positions for another year, Chen Zi and Luo Nazhai have also been newly appointed as directors. Furthermore, it has been announced that under the Business Control Council will be five control committees for rice and grain, cotton, flour and wheat, oil and grain, and daily necessities. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Business Control Council has instructed its subordinates to expedite the completion of the closing procedures, and the handover will be carried out on the 30th of this month. The new Chairman of the Board is scheduled to arrive at the council on July 1st to take over. It is reported that all the new and old directors and supervisors of the council are scheduled to hold a temporary joint meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon (the 29th) to discuss and improve the organizational structure and policies.

### Daily Necessities Control Committee to be Established Soon

The Outline for the Adjustment of Material Control and the Organizational Rules for the Various Control Committees Under the National Commercial Control Council have been approved by the 214th meeting of the Executive Yuan. Under the Business Control Council, in addition to the existing four committees for cotton, rice and grain, flour and wheat, and oil and grain, a Daily Necessities Control Committee will be established to handle matters related to the control of daily necessities. It has been announced that Luo Nazhai will be the Director of the Committee, and the members will be selected from leading figures in the industry. The scope of control will initially focus on major daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles, striving to achieve significant progress in production and unified distribution. It is reported that the committee will be formally established in early next month.

### Shanghai Branch of Central Reserve Bank Moves to New Location

Business will resume at the new location on July 4th. It is learned that the Survey Office and the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank's head office, which were originally located in Shanghai, have already moved into the new location yesterday (the 28th). All departments and sections of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, as well as the Foreign Exchange Bureau and the Issuance Bureau, will move to the new building starting from July 1st.

After the opening of this line, the abundant resources along the Huai River will be smoothly transported, and it will also make a great contribution to the strengthening of combat capabilities. At the invitation of the company, the press in this city has organized a delegation to depart on the 27th and travel to Bengbu on the 29th to participate in the opening ceremony.

Yesterday's News Broadcast Time: 6:50 PM

### Confident That Japanese Army Will Be Victorious

The serious losses suffered by the enemy America in this battle were not only hundreds of ships. Even Roosevelt himself had to express pessimism in Congress and during meetings with reporters. Later, he even announced a naval expansion plan, adopting a feigned weakness tactic. All of these were typical tricks when the U.S. military suffered heavy losses. Although the U.S. fleet has been resupplied with a large number of ships, the decline in the morale of the crew members cannot be prevented, and the unfavorable situation is only increasing. On the contrary, our country's strategic posture, due to the large number of important islands scattered everywhere, will never suffer any damage from minor air raids. On the other hand, the enemy's battleships and aircraft carriers are more vulnerable than these land bases. We, the Japanese people, are all calm and composed during this modern decisive battle, supporting the soldiers on the front lines. No matter how difficult the situation is, we have the confidence to break through. In addition, China and other East Asian nations are also united in spirit, confident that Japan will achieve absolute victory, and actively cooperating. We anticipate that the enemy's various fabricated propaganda will become increasingly active in the future, but this will only encourage the strong morale of China and Japan and the East Asian nations, and contribute to the final victory.

News of Student Assistance for Readers; Notice to Shen Students and Recommended Schools

To save costs, the application form no longer requires a photo to be attached. Newly admitted students will submit photos later, and current students will use their previous photos. Applicants who have dropped out of school should fill out a recommendation form from Jianye School recently. Applicants from other cities should attach their most recent grade report. Please fill out the recommendation form in detail so that it can be used as a reference when selecting students. It is believed that all recommended students are poor and excellent, and should be subsidized. However, due to limited resources and a large number of applicants, it is necessary to select a small number of particularly poor and particularly excellent students from among the poor and excellent. Therefore, please cooperate fully with each school to ensure greater fairness. If the recommenders are generous and treat everyone equally, it is not a thorough solution. For example, there is a question in the recommendation form: "If the student recommended by your school can only be approved for 75%, should the student be approved? If only 25% can be approved, should the student be approved?" On every recommendation form sent by a certain school, the answer to these two questions is affirmative. The school authorities sympathize with every applicant, which is not wrong. However, the facts cannot be changed by the virtue of compassion. The whole cannot be equal to 75%, let alone 25%. If the number of applicants exceeds the number of new students several times during your school's entrance examination, what method can you use to admit all of them? In short, the office hopes that the school authorities can distinguish the degree of poverty and excellence of the applicants in their school as much as possible to supplement the shortcomings of future examinations and investigations. The application form and recommendation form must be sent to the office no later than July 1st. A receipt will be issued upon arrival. Present the receipt on July 11th or 12th to collect the registration form, distribute it to the applicants, and wait for the examination or other selection methods. For the convenience of school authorities and applicants, the office has decided to set July 15th as the date for each school to distribute registration certificates. It is of course also possible to set your own date and notify the applicants. A few schools have requested a delay of a few days in submitting the list of recommendation forms due to old test scores. This will be accommodated and will not be answered separately.

### Commemorating Deceased Son, Transferring Books to Assist

Yesterday, I received a letter from Hu Youyun Guangsheng: "My second son, Ning, graduated from the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, is proficient in English and French. He was filial to his parents, sincere in friendship, diligent in his studies, and loyal to his duties. In 1937, he went to Chongqing, and due to excessive hard work, he died of illness in the Chongqing Red Cross Hospital in October 1941, at the age of only 29. When he left Shanghai, he told his brother: 'The books must be carefully preserved, so that I can read them when I come back.' His love of learning can be seen. Unexpectedly, his ambitions were not fulfilled, which is deeply regrettable! Considering that poor children in the world are now facing a situation where Luoyang paper is expensive and buying books is very difficult, I will transfer my deceased son's books for public benefit." Attached is a list of books, totaling thirty-three. (Note) Mr. Hu's donation of books to assist Qingxiu students in memory of his late son is a very good intention. This office will definitely forward them on your behalf. The method will be announced later. This is to express our gratitude.

### Encouraging Donations, Presenting Holy Images

The China Confucian Society wrote: "Your newspaper has been handling student aid funds for many years, carefully reviewing and planning, and the results have been remarkable. In this time of extreme hardship, it is expected that tuition fees will increase sharply in the next semester. In order to encourage generous donations, the Society is offering one hundred large-format 'Confucius Holy Images' as gifts. Those who donate 2,000 yuan or more will receive one image each. (This is a beautifully printed edition from the Nanxun Hall of the Forbidden City) to leave a permanent memorial."

Oil Painting Charity Exhibition: Mr. Zheng Dingyu's oil painting charity exhibition opened the day before yesterday at the China Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road. The exhibition will last for seven days. All the works, more than seventy in total, have sold about one-third, and the proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used for this newspaper's student aid fund and poverty relief fund. In the past two days, people from all walks of life have visited in an endless stream, and orders have been very enthusiastic.

### Shanghai Special Municipality First District Government Notice No. 303

### National Forum: My Accusation

— Jiang Shoutong

Regarding the Issues of Teachers, Students, and Tuition Fees

Everyone knows that society, the nation, and the ethnicity are a continuous organic body. The cells of this organic body have a metabolic function: as old, unsuitable cells die, new, healthy cells fill in. But how can we lay the foundation for new life on the graves of the dead? This requires the nurturing and cultivation of education, criticism, and reform.

And this is precisely the problem of educating the next generation.

Especially in China, a China that has been gasping for breath under foreign oppression for nearly a century, the work of educating the next generation is urgent. But in this chaotic and turbulent era, everyone knows that education is neither a practical need nor can it reap direct combat effects. Therefore, educational problems do not easily attract attention from all parties, and it is even more difficult to find a way to thoroughly solve them from attention. In other words, today, after the outbreak of the war, people generally concentrate their energy on other issues and take a dismissive attitude towards education, forgetting the importance of education, which can stop the regenerative function of the educational organism. And now, the livelihood issue of teachers and staff, which is at the forefront of educational problems, has also arisen seriously. Regarding this, Shen Bao has proposed repeated discussions, and various parties have expressed their opinions, which can be summarized into the following three proposals: The authorities allocate monthly subsidies to teachers and staff. Student parents voluntarily donate to the school according to three levels: A, B, and C. Increase tuition fees. Regarding the first proposal, the results in the past few months have not been ideal, so it is clearly a failure. The second proposal has been implemented, but it is not universal, and it is a drop in the bucket, which does not help the actual situation. On the contrary, because "donation" and "relief" are used to help teachers, the psychology of respecting teachers is almost swept away. Therefore, recently, from the plans of Gu Xiao authorities, we have heard a chorus of "increasing tuition fees". Some people advocate that tuition fees should be calculated based on the rice price on August 1st, that is, 3 to 4 dou for elementary school, 5 to 6 dou for middle school, and 8 to 9 dou for university. Some people even advocate implementing the measure of voluntary donations from student parents at the same time.

In fact, this is not building education, but destroying it.

Here, I, as a member of the education community in Guangz[hou], raise an accusation!

Yes, some time ago, I and thousands of educators initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff. All the procedures had been carried out quite completely, but after repeated negotiations, the issue of material rationing could not be resolved reasonably. After running around for months, the result was not satisfactory. This also chills the hearts of those who are enthusiastic about education. However, I have always believed that using the form of a consumer cooperative to solve the livelihood problems of teachers and staff is the most reasonable and fundamental solution. Now that this form cannot be quickly realized, we should take a step back and engage in remedies. But "increasing tuition fees" is definitely not a proper remedy. Why? This is because first, it can cause poor students to drop out of school.

Second, it makes the fundraising movement for student aid funds in newspapers more difficult due to insufficient funds.

Third, for the wealthy with thousands of fortunes, they have not fulfilled some more obligations because of their economic affluence.

Here, especially the first point is the most serious. It makes education the patent of the children of wealthy families, making China, which cannot popularize education, fall into a situation where it cannot popularize education. Originally, education is by no means one-sided. It includes both the teacher and the taught. Without the taught and without the teacher, it is of course impossible to receive education. Without the teacher and without the taught, it is even more impossible to exert education. So for those "increasing tuition fees" proponents who only know one thing but not the other, I want to accuse!

Yes, I want to accuse, but at the same time I also want to present my humble opinion. I advocate that the salaries of teachers and staff should be increased, but the tuition fees of students should also be reduced.

Under this premise, I want to propose the collection of "education donations" from entertainment donations and special consumption taxes.

The method is as follows: All establishments such as cigarettes, alcohol, coffee shops, restaurants, movie theaters, theaters, dance studios, and all entertainment and consumption venues should add a few percent of education donations in addition to the usual collection of donations. As for "how many" percent, it should be carefully budgeted by experts. The standard of the budget is: to increase the monthly salary of elementary school teachers and staff to 15,000 yuan, junior high school teachers and staff to 20,000 yuan, senior high school teachers and staff to 25,000 yuan, and university teachers and staff to 30,000 yuan, so that they can all be at ease in their jobs and work hard to run schools. (Detailed rules to be discussed separately)

This is by no means a mere ideal. If the relevant authorities have the ability to seek educational development, if people in society can truly sympathize with Chinese education, then I deeply hope that the above proposals can win resonance, criticism, improvement, and realization.

Education is for everyone and belongs to everyone. As a member of the education community, I dare not hide my shortcomings and I am even more unwilling to remain silent. I have presented my accusation and described my hopes.

### Naval Painter (9) Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

"How is it? Perhaps it's too cramped and uncomfortable!"

Takao ran into the room first, turned on the light, and said this. Shinji laughed, and without any restraint, sat down on the nautical chart and said:

"This can't help but amaze me. On destroyers, even the captain's cabin is just like this. Ah, there are many paintings. Are they all your work?"

"They are all my practice pieces. The painting I hoped Shinji would see is actually one I took to my teacher's house today."

"I certainly don't understand art very well, but I feel that all of these are very good paintings. Where did you paint this submarine picture?"

"Of course, I painted it in this room. I saw the I-class submarine in a military logbook, and then imagined and depicted a submarine underway. No matter what, relying on imagination isn't quite right."

"Not necessarily. It's actually like that. Your brushwork is truly good enough."

Shinji's face lit up with joy. In Takao's heart, he regarded Shinji as a naval officer and his only confidant, so such praise was more powerful than anyone else's.

"Thank you. I want to work hard and not lose to you."

Later, the topic turned to the navy. Naval academy, ocean voyages, ensign candidates, and other matters were discussed one by one, endlessly. Takao listened like a fool, carefully taking in every word.

"When you were promoted from candidate to ensign, you must have been very happy!"

"Of course!"

Shinji smiled gently and began to describe the situation at that time.

Promotion from candidate to ensign wasn't just about the sleeve stripes becoming thicker, or the hem of the uniform becoming longer; at this time, one was no longer an unfeathered fledgling, but had already become a fully fledged officer, so everything was different. For example, attending sudden gatherings and drinking alcohol, candidates would not receive formal permission, while ensigns could drink freely. At the naval club, one could also swagger in and out. Naval slang could also be used freely. Hairstyles were also at one's own discretion. Once one became an ensign, one could also wear the Western-style suits that were previously called "merchant's attire" but were now called "casual clothes."

"As soon as I was promoted, I had this suit made. At the Yokosuka naval club, the Yamashiro district clothing store was eager for business."

"But wouldn't it be even more pleasant to walk around wearing an ensign's uniform?"

"Not really. If you wear casual clothes, the sailors don't have to stop and salute, so you don't have to pay attention to them."

A trace of gentle smile radiated from Shinji's face. Although he was wearing a Western suit, the naval ensign's spirit and hope could be seen from his sharply outlined eyes. (108)
