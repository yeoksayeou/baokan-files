### Grand Encoffining of Chairman Wang's Remains; Central Government Holds Memorial Service; Funeral Committee Cables Various Regions to Establish Memorial Halls for Public Mourning

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The remains of the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, were respectfully transported back to Nanjing on the 12th. Yesterday, the 13th, at noon, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, the grand encoffining ceremony was solemnly held at the National Government Auditorium. The auditorium was solemnly decorated with Chairman Wang's portrait hanging in the center. Wreaths presented by various heads of the National Government and foreign envoys were arranged on both sides. Chairman Wang's family and central government officials stood on both sides to witness the encoffining. Funeral music was played, and everyone stood in silence. The chief officiant, Acting Chairman Chen, took his place, followed by playing of the national anthem. All participants bowed three times to Chairman Wang's remains, and observed a moment of silence. After the silence, the encoffining proceeded. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, all those present circled the remains, paying their respects. Many mourners wept softly, overwhelmed with grief. Acting Chairman Chen then read the eulogy (read on his behalf by Chief Secretary Xu). The ceremony concluded at approximately one o'clock. The image and voice of our Supreme Leader have now departed from this world forever. Although Chairman Wang is gone, his spirit will endure for eternity. We firmly believe that, in the midst of our profound sorrow, our nation will strengthen its resolve, unite sincerely, inherit Chairman Wang's legacy, complete the task of national revival, and liberate East Asia, to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven. The eulogy reads as follows: "On this, the 13th day of November, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, Acting Chairman of the National Government, with deepest sorrow and sincerity, hereby offers this sacrifice to the spirit of our Chairman Wang Gong: We recall that you, sir, were born into this world, endowed with intelligence and sensitivity, gentleness, respect, filial piety, and fraternity, swiftly achieving early success. Your learning encompassed both Chinese and Western knowledge, past and present, demonstrating broad insight and profound understanding. You cherished the hunger and thirst of all people, upholding the responsibility of every individual. You shouldered the great responsibility of the world, addressing the turbulence and external threats of the time, recognizing that revolution was essential for survival. Thus, you received guidance from the Father of the Nation, serving as a vanguard of the party, emulating the virtues of Yan Hui and Zeng Shen. Through arduous efforts, you shook the world, laying the foundation for revolutionary change and completing the great task of establishing a republic. Surely, you were far superior to Jing Ke and Gao Jianli. After the Father of the Nation passed away and the revolution suffered repeated setbacks, you strived to uphold his teachings, serving as the central pillar of our party. In the early stages of the Northern Expedition, internal strife was fortunately quelled. Yet, you pondered deeply and exhorted us to uphold our ambitions. But the tide of events diverged...eventually leading to the current situation, which spiraled out of control. Therefore, adhering to the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, you faced numerous difficulties to revive the declining situation. The signing of the Basic Treaty not only established a grand plan for our nation for a century but also pioneered a new era of global peace. At this moment, when the realization of the East Asian co-prosperity is announced, you also succumbed to exhaustion, departing from our party forever. Alas! Our nation cannot be without you for a single day, nor can the world be without you for a single day. Why is Heaven so cruel, leaving such a loss to be felt for generations? How dare our party not follow your legacy, striving forward, revering your guidance as if you were still here? May your spirit never die, and may you watch over our nation and our people for thousands of years, always present. Accept this sacrifice!"

### Former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on Chairman Wang - Expresses Deep Condolences to Chairman Wang

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoe Fumimaro, after issuing the historical Konoe Statement, dedicated himself to China-Japan peace with Wang Jingwei. After the news of Wang's passing was released, Prince Konoe was deeply saddened and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Chinese National Government passed away due to illness before the great cause of comprehensive China-Japan peace was completed. I sincerely express my condolences to Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven. My first meeting with Chairman Wang was when I was dispatched to attend the Paris Peace Conference in Taisho 8 (1919). At that time, Chairman Wang was in Paris as a non-government figure. After that, there was no news from him. After my first cabinet issued a statement in December of Showa 13 (1938), Chairman Wang gladly responded and risked his life to break away from the Chongqing camp. In June of Showa 15 (1940), he secretly came to Japan, and I was able to meet Chairman Wang again at my private residence in Tokyo after 20 years. We talked candidly about the China-Japan problem. After several meetings, Chairman Wang always spoke of China and Japan standing on equal footing, firmly cooperating to build East Asia for East Asians, and liberating the entire East Asia from the influence of the United States and Great Britain. From then on, I became more respectful of his courage and strong belief. Because I was not familiar with Chinese, and Chairman Wang's Japanese was not very fluent, when we talked about our reunion in Paris 20 years ago at my private residence, we used paper and pens to communicate. The notes from that time are still preserved. When I occasionally read them, I feel as if Chairman Wang's heroic bearing is still before my eyes. With Chairman Wang's passing, the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may be more difficult. In order to realize Chairman Wang's will, China and Japan must hold hands tightly and cooperate with each other for the sake of all of East Asia. Only in this way can China and Japan comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven.

Speech by Minister of Information, Misawa

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - At the opening meeting of the Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference, Japanese Minister of Information Misawa said the following: "The Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary war of construction. The so-called revolutionary war of construction is to use the East Asian inherent Royal Way culture to resist the tyrannical Western culture, and then to promote the Royal Way culture to the whole world. The Royal Way culture originates from East Asian thought, that is, Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Great Harmony in the world. In Japan, it is the "spirit of creation" ideology. What this ideology shows is "When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. Select the virtuous and able, and practice sincerity and harmony," from which a society of "The old are cared for until death, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the lonely, widowed, and disabled are all cared for." Then conspiracies will not arise, and theft, rebellion, and change will not occur, so the outer doors are not closed. This is called "Great Harmony," which is actually the common society of East Asia. In this ideal, we have discovered the survival method of East Asian nation-states. Political independence, national freedom, common national defense, economic cooperation, and other topics should all be based on East Asian thought. The announcement of this kind of thought and the establishment of pure thought depend on the communication of cultures among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia before they can be expected. At the opening of the Greater East Asia Literary Conference, I, a mere military man, dare to express my respects to you, because you are responsible for the constructive basic tasks in communicating the culture of Greater East Asia, and I pay my deep respects and look forward to greater development in the future."

Summary of Minister Matsushima's Speech

Minister Matsushima said in his speech that literature is the source of life and has a very important mission in the progress of world culture. In the past, there was a saying that writing poetry is not as good as farming, but I always feel that poetry should be written and farming should be done. Those who write poetry have the obligation to farm, and those who farm also have the right to write poetry. In other words, great poetry can be produced in the increase of production, but when writing great poetry, there also needs to be a life of production. In the current severe Greater East Asia War, many cultural figures are active everywhere in the name of cultural warriors, creating their great literature. If we look back at the cultural exchange relationship between China and Japan, its historical depth and the remoteness of its roots cannot be compared to any other country in the world. The brilliant Greater East Asian culture illuminates the entire Greater East Asia, which is also a fact that no one can deny. Mr. Okakura Tenshin once said "Greater East Asia is one body", and Mr. Sun Yat-sen also said "Without Japan, there is no China". Thinking of this, the importance of cultural exchange in East Asia with China and Japan as the core cannot be denied. The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for the East Asian nations. Japan has achieved great results in the waters of the Philippines, laying the foundation for the decisive battle in East Asia. Standing on such an advantageous position in East Asia, how should the allied countries launch an active cultural war? This is the best opportunity for you who stand in the cultural battlefield to launch a successful offensive with strong unity.

### Japanese Army Attack Plane Sinks Enemy Battleship; Heroic Achievement in Leyte Gulf

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. military has consistently sought to use its abundant material resources to gain a favorable position in the invasion of the Philippines, continuously landing military supplies on Leyte Island. There are currently 50 to 60 enemy transport ships, as well as several destroyers, either docked or patrolling in Leyte Gulf. While cooperating with ground operations, the Japanese air force has been attacking enemy airfields or relay airfields in the bridgehead day and night, preventing the expansion of enemy land-based air power towards Leyte Island. At the same time, they have also been attacking enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, destroying the enemy's rear supply base. The 10,000th Unit of the Japanese Army Special Attack Force, making a daring suicidal attack, sank one enemy battleship and one transport ship, shocking the enemy. The Mandor Unit departed from its base in the morning and flew into the airspace over Leyte Gulf at approximately 8:00 AM. Sergeant (Staff Sergeant) Tanaka, piloting the first plane, flew straight towards one of the enemy transport ships, detonating it in the central, vital area. At the same time, the fighter plane piloted by Lance Corporal (Private First Class) Watanabe, responsible for covering the first plane, continued to crash into the ship. The large transport ship was instantly blown apart and sunk. This heroic result was confirmed by Captain Kikuchi of the escort flight. Furthermore, Lance Corporal Sasaki, piloting the second plane, crashed into an enemy battleship. Sergeant (Corporal) Kubo, piloting the third plane, crashed into the sea next to the battleship, turning into a live torpedo and detonating against the hull. Under the suicidal attacks of Sasaki and Kubo, the battleship quickly sank to the bottom of Leyte Gulf. This result was confirmed by Major Iwai of the escort flight. As for the third plane, its engine suddenly malfunctioned while flying into the airspace over Leyte Gulf, and it returned to base. These members of the Mandor Unit, who established extraordinary merit, dodged the barrage of enemy anti-aircraft fire and the torpedoes of enemy P38s, calmly chose their targets and dared to crash into them. In particular, Tanaka and Ikuta of the first plane, after accurately identifying the target, attacked three times. During the second attack, as they were diving straight towards the enemy ship, they suddenly saw that the ship was a hospital ship. They then turned the rudder and ascended. This action, compared to the enemy Americans who continue to bomb even after identifying a hospital ship, is like the difference between heaven and earth. For example, the Japanese hospital ship Hashimaru was bombed by several enemy carrier-based bombers while sailing in Philippine waters at approximately 10:00 AM on November 6th. This behavior is truly infuriating. Furthermore, Captain Wakamoto, the commander of the Mandor Attack Unit, as well as Lieutenants Sonoda, Ando, Kawashima, and Second Lieutenant Nakagawa, fought the enemy planes several days before the heroic attack and sacrificed themselves for the country.

Editorial

### Inheriting the Legacy and Promoting the Work

After the death of Chairman Wang, efforts were made across various regions to lower flags and express grief. We have already written an article expressing our respect and mourning, and put forward two points: we should express our respect for Chairman Wang's merits during his lifetime and inherit and carry forward his legacy after his death. Looking at Chairman Wang's life, his energy was completely devoted to the road of national revival. In his "Autobiography," he described how, when he dedicated himself to the revolution in his youth, he implicated his elder brother's position. He then used the name "sinner of the family" to write to his brother, severing relations with the family to avoid implicating his elder brother. The words were sincere and the spirit was vigorous. He said, "The matter has been discovered. I hereby sever myself from the family in order to avoid implicating them. There are many children in the family, why begrudge this one person? I hope they will let him shed blood for the country to fulfill his ambition, so that he will not die in vain." In his youth, he aspired to shed blood for the country. Afterwards, he struggled through hardships, risking his life, all to carry out his ambition to shed blood for the country. Therefore, today, when we remember Chairman Wang, we must understand his legacy and achieve complete success together.

We believe that among the cadres of the National Government, many admire Chairman Wang's character and learning, and have followed his work for many years. There are also those who have shared hardships and difficulties with him. They naturally have a deeper understanding and grief for Chairman Wang's loyalty to the country, diligence in his work, and the location of his legacy, compared to us. At the same time, they have an even greater responsibility to inherit his legacy and promote its realization. However, as former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoe said, "With Chairman Wang's death, the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may be more difficult." We hope that the central authorities will pay special attention to the following two things in order to cope with the more difficult future and realize Chairman Wang's will:

The first is to unite as one. There is no doubt that in Chinese political history, there have often been incidents of policies dying with the person. This is because officials often prioritize serving those who appreciate them personally, while serving the country comes second. Once the leader passes away, leadership is lost, people's hearts become scattered, and they become passive. However, the current era is different. We not only want to achieve national independence and survival but also the co-existence and co-prosperity of all countries in Greater East Asia. Therefore, the goal of officials serving is to complete the free survival of their own country and Greater East Asia, not just to serve those who appreciate them personally. Although the leaders may change, the goal of service remains unchanged. Therefore, central government officials, whether they have followed Chairman Wang's work in the past, or have shared hardships with Chairman Wang, or have worked with Chairman Wang, should prioritize the country and Greater East Asia, and should prioritize the realization of Chairman Wang's legacy. They should strengthen unity and work hard for common goals under the leadership of the new leader.

The second is to attract talents. The country's work in the future will become more difficult and the mission will become more important. The old talents are definitely not enough. Therefore, attracting new talents is extremely important. They should choose people based on virtue and employ people based on talent. Acting Chairman Chen stated at the anniversary of the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai that there would be no regional or hometown prejudices in the recruitment of personnel, and that all subordinate agencies should maintain this kind of atmosphere in the employment of personnel. At the same time, he cited the phenomenon of "no one doing anything, and everyone doing nothing" as a common problem in Chinese government agencies due to a lack of good civil servants. Now that Mr. Chen has been appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan and Acting Chairman of the National Government, he must have a clear plan for attracting talent and setting standards for employment.

Secondly, people in opposition should fully recognize the seriousness of the current situation. In any case, passively standing by is definitely not a plan for self-preservation. Ideals and reality must be actively created. We very much hope that respected figures in opposition will abandon their waiting attitude and engage in active work. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities will humbly listen, cherish talent, and provide opportunities for cooperation.

### Anniversary of the National Socialist Party in Power – Speech by the German Head of State – Striving for Freedom

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German news reports: Members of the German National People's Assault Team took their oaths of office during the celebration of the historically significant anniversary of November 192[3] (the commemoration was postponed to Sunday). The German Head of State Hitler issued a proclamation to the nation, stating: "For the rest of my life, Germany will never share its fate with European nations trampled by Bolshevism. As long as I have breath, I will concentrate my efforts to ensure that the German people resist the most terrible danger. Due to the needs of the total war effort, I have had to postpone the commemoration of November 9, 1923, to Sunday. The work of the General Headquarters also does not allow me to leave for a single day, but besides this, I believe it is my responsibility to prepare and implement the various measures necessary for the final victory in this war, which is more important than delivering a speech. (Omission) I believe that the period of hardship will be overcome by us, and the precious period will eventually arrive. Due to our work and sacrifices, the time of success is not far away. The purpose of our struggle remains unchanged, namely, to relieve the suffering of our people and to seek the safety of life for future generations. Not only is the fate of Germany closely tied to this, but also the future of Europeans and those who hate Bolshevism.

Praise for Japan

We are deeply fortunate that among the nations, there are always elements of resistance discovered. Our greatest ally, Japan, has, from the beginning, fought for survival in the guise of a courageous nation."

### Municipal Consultation Committee Members Express Condolences for Chairman Wang's Passing

The news of the passing of Chairman Wang has been met with national mourning. The Shanghai Municipal Consultation Committee members Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Quanshi, and Chen Riping have specifically issued statements as follows:

Wen Lanting

"Chairman Wang has worked diligently for national affairs despite his illness. Because of the heavy workload, he had no time for treatment, and he sacrificed himself for the country, which is deeply admired. Later, in order to restore his health so that he could take on heavy responsibilities for a long time, he went to Japan for treatment. Despite the best efforts of the medical community in the Allied nations, they were unable to eliminate the disease demon, and he eventually passed away. I express my deepest condolences upon hearing the news."

Yuan Ludeng

"Chairman Wang worked tirelessly for the country throughout his life. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, he has been deeply concerned about national affairs and the people's well-being. He fell ill due to overwork, and despite the best efforts of the medical community in the Allied nations to treat him, he was unable to regain his health and take on the heavy responsibility of restoring China. I am deeply saddened. I sincerely hope that future generations will continue Chairman Wang's unfinished aspirations. I hereby represent the merchants and residents of the entire city in expressing my deep condolences."

Lin Kanghou

"Chairman Wang embraced the spirit of giving his all until his last breath and worked diligently for national affairs. His sudden passing has been mourned by the entire nation. Although the Chairman has passed away, his spirit will live on forever. When the Chairman was ill, although he was being treated in Japan, his heart and mind were always focused on the country. I hope that his successors will follow his legacy and not report back. I also hope that our industrial and commercial sectors will continue to work as usual and continue their business amidst the mourning, to comfort his spirit."

Li Quanshi

"Chairman Wang continued Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen's legacy, taking 'Peaceful Struggle to Save China' as his mission. Unfortunately, he passed away in office before his great ambitions could be realized, and I am deeply saddened. This year, the Chairman personally drafted three major policy guidelines, namely, 'Establishing Security, Increasing Production, and Rectifying Thought.' The courts and the people should strive to implement the Chairman's unfinished aspirations, especially paying close attention to the two points of security and production, to comfort his spirit in heaven."

Chen Riping

"President Wang of the National Government unfortunately passed away on the 10th of this month. The sad news has shocked and mourned the entire nation. Since his youth, the President followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution. For decades, he endured worries and thoughts, and his spirit of sacrificing himself to save the country was respected by all at home and abroad. Finally, the revolution succeeded and laid the foundation for the cause. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the President, in order to uphold the legacy of the Founding Father and realize Pan-Asianism, resolutely issued a famous telegram advocating peace, returning to the capital of Nanjing, and devoting himself to Sino-Japanese cooperation, and then concluded an alliance, traveling for national affairs and sparing no effort. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War is just beginning and Pan-Asianism is gradually being realized, Mount Tai has suddenly collapsed, and we have suddenly lost our leader. This is not only a disaster for the nation, but also a misfortune for East Asia. Under the leadership of the President, we are in deep water and dire straits. How should we each stay in our positions and strive forward, so as not to fail the President's legacy and to bring the Greater East Asia War to an early conclusion, and to make Pan-Asianism able to be realized, so that the President's spirit in heaven can be slightly comforted."

### Secretary-General Wu Appointed to Act on Behalf of Municipal Affairs – Mayor Chen Orders Him to Act on Behalf of the Mayor's Duties

Chairman Wang's passing has been met with national mourning. Municipal Mayor Chen Gongbo has gone to Nanjing for official business to preside over central government affairs. For all mayoral duties, he has appointed Municipal Government Secretary-General Wu Songgao to act on his behalf, effective the 12th of this month. The original order is recorded as follows: "As the Mayor is going to Nanjing for official business, all mayoral duties will be delegated to Secretary-General Wu Songgao to act on his behalf from today. Apart from separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your information."

### Minister Izubuchi Broadcast to Chongqing Yesterday – Should Be Aware of the Fall of Guilin and Liuzhou

The fall of Guilin and Liuzhou has dealt a fatal blow to Yu (Chongqing) and Chiang (Kai-shek). Izubuchi, Reporting Minister of the Shanghai Army Department of the Allied Nations, broadcast to Chongqing from the Shanghai Broadcasting Station on the 13th. The original text is as follows: With the Japanese army's capture of Guilin and Liuzhou, the first defensive stronghold of Chongqing has fallen, and today Guilin, the first cultural city under Yu's rule, and Liuzhou, the second city of Guangxi Province, have both been washed by the flames of war and have become ruins. Are the people of Chongqing confused? Since our army began the Henan Operation in April of this year, half a year has passed. During this period, our army has occupied most of Henan Province and Hunan Province, half of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province, and the main parts of Zhejiang Province and Fujian Province. In other areas, there are more than twenty cities that can be described as extremely devastated by the war. In this operation, our side has occupied the entire line of the Jinghan, Yuehan, and Xiang Gui railways, cutting off the east and west connections of mainland China. The connection between Chongqing and the Pacific is completely severed, and Chongqing has lost all the resources in southern Yu, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Furthermore, Chongqing's defense line has been broken, which is enough to make Yu feel heartbroken. The purpose of this operation is to thoroughly destroy the enemy's U.S. military forces in mainland China. The introduction of U.S. military forces to mainland China by Yu is the cause of this operation, and the cooperation of Chongqing's soldiers and the U.S. military is self-inflicted bloodshed. The tragedy between Guilin and Liuzhou is just beginning. The root cause is the error and lack of awareness among the people of Chongqing. The devastation of war, the destruction of families, and the death of people are the tragic situation of innocent civilians. Our army has long stated that "Chongqing's soldiers who do not cooperate with the British and Americans but come to us are not enemies." Therefore, our army makes every effort to protect the lives and property of innocent Chinese civilians during operations. On the contrary, the enemy's U.S. air force destroys Chinese culture and economy, kills people, and causes suffering, and after the fall of Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Binyang, and Quanzhou, the U.S. air force indiscriminately carries out blind bombings, killing Chinese people, and even using machine guns to strafe Chinese refugees, which is extremely cruel. Furthermore, the enemy's U.S. air force invades peaceful areas. In short, those who suffer are all Chinese people. People in Chongqing, if you have family members in peaceful areas who have been killed by the U.S. air force, do you feel anything? In short, the purpose of our army is to thoroughly destroy U.S. forces in mainland China. Chongqing's soldiers, if you do not wake up from your dreams, there will be more bloody tragedies, causing suffering to the people. Why are you still not aware?

### Opening of the Exhibition of Japanese Art and Ancient Books

### The Fourth Regiment Suggests Building a Bronze Statue of the Chairman

Since the news of Chairman Wang's passing came out, the whole country has been shocked and mourned. The Fourth Regiment of the China Youth Model Corps has wired Secretary-General Lin of the Nanjing Corps Headquarters, requesting the initiation of the building of bronze statues in major cities across the country to commemorate him. The text of the regiment's telegram is recorded below: To Secretary-General Lin of the Nanjing China Youth Model Corps Headquarters: The leader has strived for revolution, and his contributions are to the Party and the nation. His sudden death has been mourned by the entire country! Our comrades in this country feel especially sad. The cadres in Shanghai have gathered and discussed that they propose that you initiate the construction of full-body bronze statues of the leader in the capital, Shanghai, and other major cities for people to look up to and to make him immortal. This telegram is respectfully sent to you. We await your sincere reply. The Fourth Regiment bows.

### Minister Hei Expresses His Condolences for Chairman Wang's Passing – Expressed His Thoughts Yesterday

Mr. Matsudaira, the Reporting Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, expressed his thoughts on the passing of Chairman Wang at the semi-annual reporting meeting yesterday (the 13th) as follows:

Deep Impression of the First Meeting

"I first saw your country's Chairman Wang as early as twenty years ago, in Guangdong. Since then, I have met him dozens of times. The image that impresses me the most is the meeting during the September 18th Shenyang Incident. On the following day, the 19th, at 10 p.m., I also visited Mr. Wang's private residence to report on the Six-Article Incident and exchange opinions. At that time, Chairman Wang deeply regretted the Manchurian Incident and expressed that China had no intention of escalating the matter. However, although the feelings of young people or the general public in various places towards Japan were not as good after the Chinese Kuomintang in Guangdong began its revolutionary work, Chinese politicians with considerable knowledge or responsible Chinese politicians expressed their regret for this phenomenon and were determined to change and adjust the bad situation between China and Japan. When Japan encountered a major earthquake in the 12th year of the Republic of China, some people thought it was happy after the news spread to China, while responsible Chinese politicians expressed deep concern and sympathy for the earthquake in Japan, and believed that Japan was a foreign great wall of China. China and Japan are closely related, and Japan's losses also affect China significantly. At that time, responsible Chinese politicians discussed together and transported cotton cloth and clothing materials to Japan to help the disaster-stricken Japanese people, which shows China's deep sympathy for Japan. Although disagreements between the two countries often lead to incidents, the relationship between the two countries should seek a peaceful solution and turn misfortune into blessing, which is what politicians of both countries should do urgently.

Consistently Advocated Adjusting Relations

I still clearly remember my conversation with Chairman Wang. Since then, Chairman Wang has consistently advocated seeking ways to adjust the relationship between China and Japan. After the abolition of the extraordinary meeting and the cooperation between Yu and Chiang, he served as the President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he never ceased his efforts to adjust the diplomatic relations between China and Japan. At first, the atmosphere in North China for Sino-Japanese relations did not improve, but Mr. Wang always worked hard during his tenure. Later, he had a firm belief in Sino-Japanese cooperation and suggested to Chiang Kai-shek to adjust the relations between China, Japan, and Germany. Chiang was greatly moved, and they reached a consensus. As a result, he was ordered to go abroad to Europe for medical treatment. When he was ordered to go to Germany, he discussed many diplomatic issues between China and Germany with the German authorities, which was a great task. Therefore, whether in or out of office, he made efforts and contributions to the cooperation and adjustment between China and Japan. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, he still consistently implemented his advocacy to this day. Therefore, Mr. Wang's beliefs are deeply admirable. In Chinese history, Chairman Wang's words and deeds and great will will be forever recorded in history and are worthy of praise from all Chinese people. Now, Mr. Wang has unfortunately passed away, and China and East Asia have lost a great man. It is hoped that the 450 million Chinese people will engrave Mr. Wang's legacy in their hearts in order to realize it."

### Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei

— Part 1

Anecdotes of Mr. Wang began appearing in the *Tan Hu Ke Lu* ("Records of a Tiger-Talking Guest") by Han Shuyuan (Wenju) in the first year of the Republic (1912). The text says: "Mr. Wang Zhaoming, styled Guixin." (Note: The Mr. Wang’s styled name was Jixin, also written Lixin, as seen in Ji Jie's *Jian Jia Du Shi* ["Reading Poetry in Jian and Jia"]. This says Guixin is a Cantonese pronunciation where "Gui" sounds like "Ji," hence the error.) He was from Panyu County, Guangzhou, Guangdong, with his ancestral home in Shanyin County, Zhejiang. His uncle, Wang Xinsheng, once served as a guest in the entourage of the former Guangdong Governor-General Zhang Wenxuan. He was intelligent from a young age, writing thousands of words effortlessly. His cousin, Wang Zhaoquan, styled Cuibo, a *juren* graduate, also served as a guest in the entourage of Guangdong Naval Commissioner Li Zhun. Another cousin, ××, also a *juren*, served as a guest in the entourage of the former Guangdong Governor-General Cen Chunxuan. All placed great expectations on him. At the age of seventeen, he sat for the county-level examination and ranked first in the prefectural exam. That year was Renyin (Note: Renyin was the 28th year of Guangxu, when Mr. Wang was twenty years old; this says he was seventeen, an error.) His elder brother, Zhaohong, ranked first in the county exam. The brothers both ranked first in the prefectural and county exams and were concurrently admitted as students of the Imperial Academy, truly a fine tale from the old imperial examination era.

He ranked fourth in the provincial examination and was a well-known figure among the students. During the Jia Chen year, Cen Chunxuan ordered Fan Sixuan to examine forty candidates from among those with examination credentials. They were to go to Japan to study law and political science. (Note: Mr. Wang went to Japan to enter Hosei University in the 29th year of Guangxu, which was Guimao. This says it was Jia Chen, which was the 13th year of Guangxu. This must be an error for Guimao.) Mr. Wang was selected, and he went to Japan to enter Hosei School. There were four or five hundred people in the school, and he topped the exams every term. At that time, he was deeply immersed in the revolution. Sun Yat-sen happened to be in Japan and admired his talent. He met him with courtesy, provided funds to establish *Min Bao* ("The People's Paper"), and hired him as an editor. (At that time, Wang had not yet taken up any profession.) Among the names signed in the *Min Bao*, "Jingwei" was another name of Wang. (It was taken to mean "Jingwei wishes to fill the Sea of Regret.") He graduated second in his class. (The first was Kong Zhaoyan from Nanhai, Guangdong, who once served as a guest in the entourage of the Guangdong Governor-General.) After graduation, Cen instructed his elder brother Zhaoquan to quickly have him return to Guangdong to prepare for the establishment of the Guangzhou School of Law and Political Science. Wang and his brother said that each person has their own ambitions and should not force others. He also gave advance notice and declared that he had left the Wang clan and that any revolutionary actions he took in the future would have nothing to do with his brothers, requesting that this be put on record. Zhaoquan reported this to Cen. Cen smiled and acknowledged it.

At that time, his sharp articles were published in various books and newspapers and spread widely at home and abroad. Although the major officials forbade their sale, those imported through Hong Kong continued to come in without end. By the Gengxu year (1910), Wang, feeling that the revolution had not been successful, considered assassination to achieve his ambitions. He went to the capital to bomb the Qing Prince Regent, but the plot failed, and he was arrested by detectives. Su, Prince of Min, the Minister of Civil Affairs, interrogated Wang in his department. Wang took up his pen and wrote straight away more than three thousand words. The gist of his confession covered ancient and modern times, spanning Europe and America. Prince Su was convinced by his arguments and requested from the Qing Prince Regent that he be spared the death penalty and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment instead. The case was settled and sent to the Ministry of Justice. Tingjie, the Minister of Justice, was angered by the Ministry of Civil Affairs encroaching on his authority and planned to mistreat Wang to vent his anger, wanting to put him in a dark prison cell. Su heard of this and was displeased. He even took out two hundred taels of silver, wrote more than ten letters, and ordered them to be sent to the Ministry of Justice to be given to Wang as a gesture. Tingjie was stubborn and jealous and, upon hearing this, became even more furious and ordered the gifts to be returned to Su. Su reported this to the Qing Prince Regent, who rebuked Tingjie, and Tingjie reluctantly gave up. Wang, therefore, spent his days in the Ministry of Justice reading books to pass the time.

In the autumn of the Xinhai year (1911), in the ninth month, the revolutionary army gained great momentum, and the Prince Regent was forced to pardon party members in the hope of averting disaster. On the 16th day of the month, an imperial decree was issued pardoning Wang and two others, and Zhang Mingqi was appointed to carry out the order. After Mr. Wang was released from prison, someone asked about his condition. Mr. Wang was very ill and had been silent for a long time, but he then recounted the circumstances of his time in prison. He said: "Since entering prison, I was immediately fitted with an iron cangue on my neck, which was very heavy and more than a scholar could bear. Each day, I was given only a bowl of thin congee and a piece of coarse bread. I could not even pick it up with my hands but had to eat it directly from the cangue. On this particular day, a guard suddenly burst into the room. I was in a daze, and unexpectedly, he removed the iron cangue from my neck and the iron chains from my hands, and hustled me out. My eyes were blurred, and I did not know where I was going, thinking that I was surely going to be killed. After a long time, I was taken to a warehouse, which turned out to be the Tai'an Warehouse in Gui Ma Shi. I was even more confused, wondering if I was going to be killed in the warehouse. The guard took me to a room and handed me my luggage (which had been sealed when I was arrested), along with a hundred taels of silver, saying that it had been sent by my family earlier, and eagerly asked me for a reward. I was surprised and said, "What reward should I give?" The guard told me, "You have been pardoned and released from prison." He showed me several copies of the newspaper for that day, and I became even more suspicious and then fell into a confused sleep. Now, I am still suffering from numbness all over my body. Although I read newspapers all day long, which record the wars in the southeastern provinces, I still suspect that they are not accurate, thinking that I have only been in prison for a year. Has our nation progressed so quickly?" When asked about his political views, he remained silent and refused to say a word. (Recorded from "A Record of the Deeds of Mr. Wang Jingwei" compiled by Zhang Jiangcai.)
