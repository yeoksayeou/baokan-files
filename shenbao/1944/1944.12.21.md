### Minister Chen Returns to the Capital After Completing Mission in Japan; Allied Nations Remember Sincere Talks Yielded Satisfactory Results

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Propaganda Department issued a communiqué at 4:00 PM today: Premier of the National Government's Executive Yuan departed on the 14th of this month to visit Japan. He held sincere talks with representatives of allied nations regarding problems of close cooperation in completing the war, which were extremely satisfactory. He departed Tokyo on the 19th and arrived back in the capital at 2:50 PM on the 20th. Deputy Premier Zhou of the National Government and dozens of other military and government leaders went to the airport to greet him. The senior officials accompanying Premier Chen on his visit to Japan, with the exception of Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who was dispatched to Nagoya to personally pay respects at Chairman Wang Jingwei's bedside in the hospital, express gratitude to allied government officials, civilians, and doctors, and participate in the local memorial service, all others, including Minister Xiao, Minister Lin, and Secretary Zhou, returned to Nanjing with Premier Chen. A record of Premier Chen's remarks upon returning to the country follows:

### Premier Chen Urges National Populace to Firmly Cooperate With Allied Nations With Determination to Share Weal and Woe

"During my visit to Japan, I received warm treatment from Prime Minister Koiso and the ministers, as well as the Japanese people. I held candid discussions with the officials of the allied nations, exchanging views in a sincere and harmonious manner, just as in the past, which I found deeply gratifying. The allied nations' earnestness in supporting and sincerity in assisting China are constantly increasing. It is needless to say that cooperation between the two countries will become even closer in the future. Furthermore, the strengthening of the National Government's leadership in guiding the entire population towards the goal of independence and autonomy holds limitless promise.

Allied Nations' Public Morale is Tempered and Inspired

Although my stay was very short, I witnessed the unwavering determination and inspiring morale of the allied nations, both in government and among the people, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Repeated enemy air raids have failed to inflict the slightest damage; instead, public sentiment and morale have been further boosted. The accelerated progress of production, the doubled and enriched military supplies, the diligence of labor, and the eagerness to enlist in the military create an atmosphere even more intense than before, which is truly admirable.

Unwavering Commitment to Promoting National Policy

I wish to express my sincere thoughts and encourage my compatriots to promote peace, unite Japan, and stabilize East Asia, which are the missions of the National Government's return to the capital. To cooperate in the war, to unite Asia, and to defeat the United States and Britain are the current responsibilities of China, which is participating in the war. These are all unfinished national policies of Chairman Wang. Although Chairman Wang did not live to see the completion of peaceful unification and the completion of the war, his spirit of loving China and loving East Asia will forever guide us to continue our struggle. Having experienced this great pain, the National Government and the entire nation are acutely aware of the severity of the situation and even more mindful of the arduousness of our responsibility. We vow to fulfill his legacy and will never waver.

Overcoming All Obstacles to Promote Peace

The most important tasks at present are to strengthen our cooperative resolve to fight the decisive battle, crush the remaining forces of the brutal enemy seeking to invade East Asia again, and overcome all obstacles to complete China's unification and promote comprehensive peace. From the former perspective, the allied nations are already mobilizing their national strength to act as the vanguard and shield. China in East Asia should constantly redouble its combat strength, consolidate the rear, and supply the front lines. From the latter perspective, the狰狞面目 of Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly exposed. Even those in Chongqing will gradually realize that relying on the United States and Britain is a miscalculation. The reckless and indiscriminate bombing, deliberately creating scorched earth, is something that all people throughout the country deeply resent. In this situation, we must both strive to strengthen the National Government itself, so that it can bear the great responsibility of resolving the current situation, and implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and uphold the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the utmost sincerity, in order to build the foundation for righteous peace.

Strengthening the National Government to Cooperate in the War

The way to cooperate in the war includes rectifying thought, ensuring social order, and increasing production. All efforts to supply military needs, stabilize the people's livelihood, and benefit the war effort should be given the highest priority. The way to strengthen the National Government includes building up the military, organizing and training the people, and establishing honest government. All efforts to cultivate the people's strength, accumulate national power, and consolidate the foundation of the nation should be actively pursued. These two aspects must be mutually reinforcing and cannot be neglected in any way. In short, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Sharing life and death is a historical destiny. China's freedom and equality and East Asia's independence and liberation depend on this one battle. As a member of the nations participating in the war and a pillar of the East Asian axis, China bears a heavy responsibility.

Upholding Our Beliefs and Going All Out

The National Government vows to adhere to this belief, lead the people with the determination to share life and death, strengthen cooperation with the allied nations, and strengthen our cooperation in the war. We aim to uphold the original intention of the peace movement, fulfill our oath to participate in the alliance, and not fail the sincerity of our allied friends in assisting us. We will do everything in our power to develop the wartime system of the National Government. We also believe that the allied governments and their people will provide further assistance based on the spirit of the alliance treaty and the joint declaration."

### The Significance of Mr. Yoshida and Mr. Kobayashi Joining the Cabinet is Great; They Will Contribute to the War Effort With the Strength of the Entire Nation

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - With the resignation of Military Supplies Minister Fujiwara due to illness, the Koiso Cabinet suddenly reorganized the cabinet on the 19th, appointing Yoshida Shigeru, chairman of the Kyushu Regional Council, as his successor, and requested Kobayashi Tsubasa, president of the Political Association, to become a minister without portfolio in order to establish a decisive political system integrating officials and civilians. Prime Minister Koiso received Military Supplies Minister Fujiwara's resignation on the 16th. After immediately evaluating potential successors, he decided to request Yoshida Shigeru, who is currently in charge of military supplies production and enhancement in the Kyushu region, to rush to the capital. On the 18th, he received his agreement. At the same time, in order to strengthen political power and complete the absolute connection between the cabinet and the people, Prime Minister Koiso further requested General Kobayashi Minzo, president of the Political Association, to become a minister without portfolio. After negotiations, he also received his agreement on the 18th. Thus, the vacant post of state minister was filled, completing parliamentary politics. The appointment of Yoshida as Military Supplies Minister is based on his past experience, and he will surely be able to fully exert his talents. It will also fully harmonize the personnel aspect of the cabinet and make a considerable contribution to military supplies production. Today, when the linkage between military supplies production and service personnel urgently needs to be opened, it is waiting for a person with prestigious experience in the local administrative front line to take office. He is the right candidate, and the establishment of a sure-win and invincible production system is worth expecting. In addition, the strengthening of cabinet politics and the enhancement of military supplies production are both indispensable key points in the current decisive war situation. Prime Minister Koiso, in view of this, will request General Kobayashi, the president of the Political Association, the only political organization in the country, to serve as Minister of State, but in the aspect of General Kobayashi, he is entering the cabinet in the capacity of president of the Political Association, so it has a special meaning. From now on, the government's policies will be thoroughly implemented to the lower levels of the people through the mechanism of the Political Association, so as to contribute the strength of the whole country to the Philippine battlefield.

Japanese Minister of State Kobayashi Issues Inaugural Statement

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Minister of State Kobayashi, who recently entered the cabinet in the capacity of president of the Political Association, issued the following statement at the Political Association headquarters after the inaugural ceremony: This time, I received the great command to enter the cabinet. I believe that the war situation is extremely severe and has now progressed to the final stage of national destiny. Given this current situation, it is urgently necessary to embody the substance of unity between the military, officials, and civilians, based on the spirit of the Special Attack Forces, in order to advance and complete the holy war. Therefore, politics should directly combine with the people, and government policies should be responsive to the people, in order to establish a political system. The Political Association is a bond between the government and the people, and its realization is a major mission entrusted to this association. The reason why I decided to enter the cabinet in the capacity of president is precisely for this. In addition, the various wartime policies investigated and researched by the Political Association are all appropriate matters based on public opinion. It is also an urgent task to strongly promote these policies within the cabinet and have the government implement them decisively. I will do my best to serve the country based on the above purposes.

Mr. Otani and Mr. Terai Appointed as Advisors to the Japanese Cabinet

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In October, the Japanese government reorganized the cabinet advisory system, appointing twelve authoritative figures from various fields, including former Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, as cabinet advisors to participate in political affairs. Now, it has additionally appointed former Cabinet Councilor Otani Kozui and former President of the Ship Operation Association and President of Nippon Yusen, Terai Hisanobu, as cabinet advisors. The official announcement was made on the 20th. Otani is an authority in the religious world, and Terai is an authority in the shipping world.

### Japanese Political Association Holds Temporary House of Representatives Committee Meeting

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Political Association held a temporary House of Representatives committee meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 19th to discuss various matters related to the operation of the 86th Diet session. It was agreed that in this critical situation, the Political Association should strongly promote the government's urgent tasks. The main points of the opinions are as follows: In this decisive war session, the issue of national organization should be raised. It is necessary to establish a strong combination between politics and the people. The Political Association itself should resolutely implement strong politics for national organization. The Diet committee will convene daily meetings from the 20th to study concrete measures to obtain a solution in preparation for submission to the Diet, so that the government can implement it decisively.

### Thai Prime Minister Declares Determination to Win at All Costs

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the occasion of the upcoming third anniversary of the conclusion of the Thai-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse received a group of Japanese reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 19th and issued a statement. The gist of his statement was: What Thailand seeks now is victory. Therefore, the Thai people are determined to devote all their strength to completing the war and fighting until the day of final victory. We dare not predict when the war will end, but Thailand is a special country and bears the important task of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we must first prepare and stabilize the domestic system as a prerequisite for completing the war. I would like to place the focus of policy for the coming year on domestic and national policies. What Thailand needs most now is clothing, so we plan to increase cotton production and encourage textiles at the same time. Thailand has extremely abundant food supplies, so the people's livelihood can be stabilized, and there is no need to worry about the food problem. It is also easier to implement various policies. In short, as the war situation becomes increasingly fierce, national life will inevitably feel considerable difficulties. We, the Thai people, are determined to overcome all difficulties and, in the spirit of Thai-Japanese cooperation, fight to the last soldier.

### Three-Dimensional Warfare Unfolds on the German-Belgian Border Himmler Personally Supervises the Battle on the Front Lines

Tank units penetrated deep into the battle area through the gaps in the fragmented US First Army. Trench warfare continued in other past focal points of the Western Front. German long-range weapons further strengthened their power, attacking London, Antwerp, and other places.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to front-line reports: German SS Chief Himmler is now personally commanding the German troops who are desperately defending the bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine River in southern Alsace.

German Counter-Offensive Forces are Powerful

Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a German news agency, a military observer in London said: The German army on the Western Front has launched a four-day offensive, which is currently unfolding with great strength. Eight or nine divisions, three or four tank divisions of the Tiger type and a variety of new weapons. Although it is not yet known how far the German army has penetrated into Belgium, a report from the front line of the US First Army stated that the German army has retaken Malmedy (in eastern Belgium, north of Luxembourg). The anti-axis forces do not shy away from this serious war situation.

The Front Line Extends for One Hundred Kilometers

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Eisenhower Command issued a communique on the 19th stating that the "Rundstedt Offensive," which has been unfolding on a large front line approximately 100 kilometers long from Monschau, 40 kilometers southeast of Aachen, to the border of Luxembourg, has suddenly intensified on the 19th.

According to an Associated Press front-line report, since the outbreak of fighting in the west, the large-scale three-dimensional war of air and land has gradually intensified. It is speculated that the German army will implement a fairly large-scale offensive in the future.

Editorial

### European War Situation

The year 1944 is almost over, but the European war, which the anti-Axis powers predicted would end within the year, remains deadlocked. The arrogance and underestimation of Germany by Britain and the United States have clearly suffered a major blow.

Currently, the European war seems relatively quiet on the Western Front in the Netherlands and on the Southern Front in Italy. The frozen front along the Baltic coast and in Romania and Bulgaria has largely come to an end. The most intense fighting is concentrated on the Western Front in Belgium and Luxembourg, the border between France and Germany, and on the Eastern Front around the Hungarian capital and the eastern border of Slovakia.

On the Western Front, the Battle for Aachen, in central Belgium where it borders Germany, has continued unabated. From Aachen, southward along the German-Belgian border through the Malmedy area to Trier in eastern Luxembourg and then to the Saar, the anti-Axis forces have constantly attempted to break through the Siegfried Line and advance toward the Rhineland region of western Germany. However, they have consistently been blocked by the powerful German army. Even when there has been progress, it has been minimal, and the anti-Axis forces have suffered losses far outweighing their gains. Also, along the southern part of the Western Front, from Saarbrücken in the Saar region along the German border through Saargemünd and into the narrow Alsace region, fierce fighting has been unfolding daily. This is the route the anti-Axis forces are attempting to take to attack from the southwestern border of Germany.

On the Eastern Front, the Hungarian capital Budapest remains the focus of the fighting. Soviet forces have penetrated Budapest, and the two sides are now in a stalemate northeast of Budapest, with intense fighting. South of Budapest, west of the Danube and southeast of Lake Balaton, Soviet forces appear to be adopting a similarly aggressive offensive. Recently, the Soviet forces have also focused on Slovakia, so they have also deployed many troops to fight in the eastern and southern borders of Slovakia. The line from Miskolc in Hungary to Košice in Slovakia seems to be particularly important to the Soviet forces. In addition, Soviet forces advancing southward from the Vistula River in Poland, north of Slovakia, are launching an offensive centered on Krakow. The Soviet forces appear to be launching offensives on Slovakia from the east, south, and north, with the aim of attacking Slovakia from three directions.

Judging from the current situation, the most intense areas of the European war are the German-Belgian border centered on the Aachen area on the Western Front, followed by the Saar and Alsace regions. On the Eastern Front, the focus is on Budapest, spreading to western Hungary and between Hungary and Slovakia.

The anti-Axis forces have mobilized enormous manpower and resources in both the Eastern and Western Fronts, from the summer offensive to the current winter offensive. The intensity of their offensives is truly astonishing, but the results they have achieved are far too poor. Observing that the Western Front has been stuck on the German-Belgian-French border for months and that Budapest on the Eastern Front has been difficult to capture for a long time, it can be seen that the losses of the anti-Axis forces far outweigh their gains. In recent days, the German army on the Western Front has shown a tendency to shift from defense to offense, and the German army in Budapest has also been successful in counterattacking the Soviet forces. The overall war situation is still not unfavorable to the German army.

In short, while the anti-Axis offensive is fierce, the Axis forces' resistance is even stronger. Some shortsighted observers previously underestimated the Axis powers in terms of military, economic, and political aspects, based on temporary changes in strategy. However, the recent facts - the strength of the Axis forces' resistance over the past few months - should give them a clear understanding. In any case, the anti-Axis forces are unable to force Germany to surrender, either militarily or politically. At the same time, the contradictions between the anti-Axis camps regarding the solution of European problems are becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, we should not lightly believe the anti-Axis propaganda when observing the European situation.

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Enemy Warships, Sinking and Destroying Twelve Ships in the Sulu Sea and Other Waters

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After enemy forces landed near San Jose on Mindoro Island, south of Luzon Island, Japanese air units have concentrated their main forces to fiercely bomb the enemy's core warships, inflicting enormous damage through suicide attacks by special attack units and other means. The enemy forces, unable to withstand the fierce Japanese attacks, stubbornly continued to resupply the landing forces. As a result, the situation in the Sulu Sea became increasingly tense. On the 17th and 18th, Japanese air units continued to bomb the battlefield. According to the announcement of the Imperial General Headquarters, a total of six enemy transport ships were sunk and destroyed. The general situation of the war is recorded as follows: (1) On the 17th, air units (including special attack units) bombed enemy warships in the Mindoro Sea, sinking one medium-sized transport vessel and one escort cruiser and one destroyer each. In addition, two places near the enemy landing site were set on fire. In this battle, special attack units and escort fighters crashed and detonated themselves. (2) On the 18th, Japanese air units (including special attack units) bombed enemy forces, sinking one large transport ship, destroying another warship, and damaging one medium-sized transport ship, causing it to be on the verge of stopping. On the evening of the same day, the Tekkishin Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit hit a transport ship near San Jose, which sank into the sea after seven minutes. On the 13th, the Ichiu Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit and other air units bombed an enemy convoy invading the area near the mouth of the Sulu Sea River south of Iloilo, but the results were unclear. However, after a subsequent investigation, it was confirmed that one transport ship and one large warship resembling an aircraft carrier or large cruiser were both engulfed in flames.

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air squadrons have been fiercely bombing enemy warships invading the Sulu Sea for days. On the afternoon of the 18th, two aircraft from the elite Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit took the lead, and several fighter aircraft were turned into bombs and dispatched together. They attacked the enemy transport ship group in the waters of San Jose on Mindoro Island, overcoming the stubborn resistance of about 40 enemy P38 and P47 and giant fighter aircraft patrolling the sky. One large transport ship and one transport ship were sunk and destroyed, and one transport ship was destroyed. In addition, one P47 and one P38 were shot down in the aerial battle, and one P47 and one P35 were damaged. On the Japanese side, in addition to one aircraft from the elite corps, one aircraft was crashed in a suicide attack and four aircraft did not return. At the same time, several fighter aircraft, including the leader of the Tekkishin Special Attack Unit, from separate strike groups, fiercely attacked the enemy convoy in confusion and retreat, also sinking one of their transport ships. Combining the above results, since the 13th, Japanese army air squadrons have sunk and destroyed twelve enemy ships in the Mindanao Sea and Sulu Sea.

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - The American forces that landed in the San Jose area of Mindoro Island were intercepted by the Japanese forces stationed there. It is unclear how they are progressing. The enemy forces are currently choosing a plain in the area to hastily build an airfield, but their maritime supply is facing a major threat due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units and air units. On the other hand, in the Ormoc area of Leyte Island, the Japanese Takachiho Unit and the garrison forces are still fiercely attacking the enemy forces that have detoured into the area from the Kigueon Heights, suppressing the enemy forces. There are no significant changes in other front lines on Leyte Island.

### Japanese Raiding Party Attacks Morotai Island With Success

### Lieutenant Endo of the Gekko Unit Discusses Intercepting Enemy Aircraft

Japanese Air Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Endo Yukio of the Gekko Fighter Squadron shot down one enemy B-29 aircraft and damaged two on the 18th when striking the main force of the enemy B-29 formation that invaded the Nagoya area. Commending Lieutenant Endo for this remarkable feat, the reporter visited Lieutenant Endo at a certain air base. It was learned that Lieutenant Endo was a graduate of the Type A Flight Preparatory Training Course and had performed outstandingly in the battles of Rabaul and other battles. This summer, he shot down and damaged five enemy B-29 aircraft over northern Kyushu. On the 3rd of this month, he shot down three enemy aircraft off the coast of Kashima. He has been decorated three times for his achievements, having shot down a total of eleven of the enemy's much-vaunted "air fortresses". The following is Lieutenant Endo's account of the interception battle: On that day, the sky over the base was very foggy. At 2200 hours, the battle command issued an order: "An enemy formation is heading north toward the central region. All aircraft must sortie immediately." The Gekko fighters on standby took off from the base one after another and immediately climbed rapidly after takeoff. However, at an altitude of approximately 7,000 meters, ten enemy aircraft were spotted near Mount Fuji. Unfortunately, there was still a distance of several thousand meters between us and them, so no attack was made. We continued to advance westward. At 1250 hours, visibility worsened. Upon reaching the interception destination, the sky over □□, enemy aircraft were immediately spotted. Eight enemy B-29 aircraft were sighted in formation. My aircraft charged past the lead enemy aircraft and engaged the second enemy aircraft in a head-on battle. The enemy aircraft could not withstand the attack and instantly emitted black smoke from the engine, immediately turning into a ball of fire and plunging downward. The enemy aircraft, in a state of panic, did not have time to reorganize their formation and quickly reversed course, penetrating the formation from below. Before long, our side began to concentrate its attack. With the determination to fight to the death, we attacked the seventh enemy aircraft and then attacked the eighth enemy aircraft. Both enemy aircraft were seen emitting black smoke from the engines and heading into the clouds behind the enemy aircraft formation. Although my aircraft was hit by enemy fire, it was eventually able to safely return to base.

### Three Enemy Aircraft Damaged in Attack on Kyushu

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 30 to 40 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked Kyushu from the direction of the Chinese mainland on the morning of the 19th. The sky over the area was covered in dense clouds, and the enemy aircraft were only able to carry out blind bombing, so the damage on the ground was extremely light.

### Decisive Battle on Leyte Island

Since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, the mutual offensive and defensive battles for one month have become more and more intense day by day. The enemy Americans are using the strength of seven divisions to attempt to expand the occupied area, while we are constantly sending new elite troops to the front line to block them. Some advance units have already unfolded unprecedentedly astonishing decisive battles along the shores of Carigara Bay, the central highlands of Jaro, the Dagami area, the shores of Ormoc Bay, and the Damulaan line. In addition, the remaining enemy forces have appeared on the eastern sea of the Philippines and are bombing important areas of our Philippine Islands. But our air forces on both the land and sea sides are using earth-shattering body-crashing tactics to inflict fatal blows on them. The great battle between the enemy and us, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, can be said to have reached the stage of a decisive final battle on the land, sea, and air.

Crushing Enemy's Attempt

On October 20th and 21st, the enemy Americans broke through the Japanese defense line in the Tacloban and Dulag areas, each landing one division. Later, they gradually increased their reinforcements, and now they have reached more than seven divisions. Due to active operations, the enemy Americans gradually expanded the battle line to the west, while another unit was attacking the flank of our forces from the south. The enemy's initial plan was to use the 1st Cavalry Division to disrupt our front line positions in Tacloban, and to have another army directly enter Samar Island. The main force of the 24th Division, which landed on the 27th, advanced toward the Ormoc Plain, while the division advanced westward along the left side of the Leyte Strait, taking us by surprise, and some troops advanced rapidly from the shores of Carigara Bay to the line of Manogosnos, Pinamoapan, and Limon at the entrance of Ormoc City, showing a move to go south in one fell swoop. In order to counter this attempt by the enemy, our forces, after receiving new elite reinforcements, charged into the enemy's positions in torrential rain and launched a counter-encirclement against the enemy. Another unit advanced toward the Carigara-Capoocan line, finally cutting off the enemy's retreat.

On November 19th, the enemy report said: "A unit of Japanese forces, including light tanks, attacked the American outer encirclement positions in Limon." The enemy, at a loss in that area, was quickly reinforced by the 1st Cavalry Division, and a part of the 32nd Division, which landed on the 12th, was also sent to restore the previously lost lines. A report from the enemy on the 20th stated: "A unit of the Japanese army attacked a battalion of the American 32nd Division near Pinamauhay, 3 kilometers from Limon on the shores of Carigara Bay, and also attacked a part of the American 24th Division near Capoocan, 6.5 kilometers away." This is a scene of our elite forces braving the rain to advance into the dangerous areas of Carigara and Manogosnos, engaging in close-quarters bloody battles.

However, the enemy's 7th Division and 96th Division, which landed in Dulag, advanced northward, penetrating into the Alangalang, Jaro, Magallanes, and Burauen areas. Another unit developed westward along the Abuyog and Baybay roads, and reached the vicinity of Damulaan via Ormoc Bay. This was an attempt to attack the flanks of the Japanese forces' reinforcement units. To counter this, Japanese elite forces, in the heavy encirclement of the enemy American forces, tenaciously defended Mount Catmon, while also tenaciously defending the western highlands of Jaro, Dagami, and Burauen, waiting for an opportunity to prepare to engage in bayonet battles with the enemy Americans in order to crush the enemy's ambition to advance. In the Jaro area, on the night of the 11th, our suicide squad charged in and completely destroyed several enemy American tanks and tractors. There were also other units of our side that penetrated into the enemy American artillery positions on the 8th, 12th, and 13th, instantly destroying many enemy heavy artillery pieces. This kind of tactics actually made the enemy tremble with fear, so the enemy American bombardment of the Ormoc area was greatly reduced. In addition, a fierce counterattack has been launched against the enemy American forces attacking from Damulaan since the 18th, and they are now gradually being forced to the south.

Extremely Intense War Situation

The air annihilation battle that coordinates with such land force combat is a major key to controlling the Leyte battle situation. The current war situation is tragic, fierce, and has reached its peak. It has reached a stage of kill or be killed. The enemy Americans' operation on Leyte Island is a landing battle without air cover. Therefore, when the enemy launched a land battle, they immediately worked hard to repair the occupied airfields of Tacloban, Dulag, and San Pablo in order to allow large numbers of land-based aircraft from New Guinea to arrive. In addition, the mobile unit sent carrier-based aircraft to supplement the shortage of land-based air forces. This was in order to compete for air supremacy over Leyte Island with land-based aircraft and warship aircraft. The number of aircraft in New Guinea under the command of MacWade is about 100 in Hollandia, 300 to 400 each in Biak and Noemfoor, and about 200 in Mair on the north coast of New Guinea, totaling about 1,500 aircraft. They use Palau and Halmahera as relay bases, and transfer to Leyte Island or directly carry out air raids on the southern Philippines. In order to counter these aircraft of the United States, the Japanese air force repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy American bases with a never-ending spirit of daring to die, completely destroying the aircraft that they had painstakingly acquired by bombing. Since October 27th, more than 200 enemy aircraft have been destroyed.

Active Role of Special Attack Units

Japanese Special Attack Units are everywhere striking at the enemy's mobile units, attacking the enemy's maritime power with fearless body-crashing tactics, and destroying the strength of the enemy's carrier-based aircraft. As a result, the enemy's shameless boast of local absolute superiority has been tragically destroyed. At the same time, our Kamikaze Attack Units also carry out long-range air raids on the enemy American rear area bases such as Los Negros Island, Biak, and Mair. An annihilation battle is now being conducted without interruption every day.

Enemy American's Supply Difficulties

Although enemy American ships have been subjected to our continuous bombing, there are still 50 to 60 ships anchored in Leyte Gulf, and every day there are 20 to 30 large transport ships desperately replenishing supplies. The necessary military supplies for an enemy American soldier per month are approximately six tons. If we calculate based on seven divisions of about 100,000 people, then it is necessary to replenish 600,000 tons of military supplies per month. According to enemy American reports, since the landing on Leyte, 500,000 tons of military supplies have been unloaded in three weeks. Since the landing on October 20th, until November 11th, 500,000 tons of supplies were transported, which means that approximately 20,000 tons of goods were transported every day. The enemy Americans transported only 20,000 tons of supplies per day in the operation of landing in Normandy, France, after passing through the Dover Strait, which is only 20 kilometers away. Then, looking at it this way, it is possible to know how the enemy Americans are putting all their efforts into the replenishment for the landing operation on Leyte. The enemy's supply line to Leyte Island is Hawaii, New Caledonia, using Australia as a base, and using Hollandia, Los Negros Island, and Saipan as relay bases, and using Morotai and Palau as forward bases, using a large-scale transport convoy to maintain and enhance the combat power of the supply depot. Palau to Leyte is 2,000 kilometers, Morotai to Leyte is 1,000 kilometers, and from Australia or Hawaii it is more than 10,000 kilometers. Maintaining this long supply line and constantly transporting military supplies to Leyte Island has truly exhausted the enemy Americans.

War is Advantageous to Us

Naturally, the shorter the supply line, the more advantageous the war is to us, which is well-known military common sense. And the Leyte Island, with a long supply line that far exceeds the Dover Strait by dozens of times, is such an unfavorable adventure. If this supply line is cut off by our side, then the American troops landing on Leyte Island can be completely wiped out. The Japanese Special Attack Units use their precious lives to crash into enemy American transport ships, which is a powerful weapon to cut off this supply line. Since October 19th, according to the war results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, our army has sunk or destroyed a total of 73 transport ships of various sizes. If we add in those that are missed, the number would be even more considerable. The enemy, worried about cutting off this maritime supply line, has recently been implementing air replenishment from the Palau Islands using transport aircraft, and 30 large transport aircraft transport munitions and supplies to Leyte every day. Of course, this air supply line is determined by the weather and cannot be said to be good, but the enemy cannot help but use this difficult supply line, which is precisely the spirit with which they are fighting the war. Not only are we Japanese fighting a desperate war, but the enemy Americans are also fighting such a war. (Translated by An from the Yomiuri Hochi of November 20th)

### Stabilizing the Food Supply for the Citizens of This City: Taking Urgent Measures, Secretary-General Wu Delivers an Important Speech

Recently, the black market price of rice has skyrocketed, drawing attention from all sides. It is reported that Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government has repeatedly consulted with relevant parties and the Municipal Advisory Committee on various emergency measures and is actively preparing for winter relief to assist the poor. In order to understand the truth, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu, who graciously gave the following statement:

Strict Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Rice Merchants

"Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed, and commodity prices have become expensive, threatening the lives of the people and causing social unrest. Although the reasons for this are extremely complex, the hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and the deliberate spreading of rumors by treacherous elements to disturb the public are particularly distressing. I, acting on the orders of Mayor Chen, will not shirk my responsibility during this acting period. I will use all my wisdom and do my best to cope with the situation in order to save it. After negotiations with relevant parties, various measures have been decided: (1) For illegal rice merchants who manipulate rice prices for exorbitant profits, the competent authorities have been ordered to conduct a thorough investigation. If evidence is found, they will be severely punished as a warning to those who harm the people's livelihood. (2) Additional coarse grains will be allocated to benefit the common people, and the Bureau of Goods Allocation has issued a public notice for their sale.

Priority Allocation of Household Rice

(3) After consultation with the Rice Control Association, it has been decided that household rice rations will be given priority. The quantity will remain unchanged. (4) In terms of cost, the price of rationed rice has long exceeded five thousand yuan. However, in order to alleviate the burden on the people and to facilitate the Rice Control Association's procurement of rice, the Municipal Government will maintain the price at five thousand yuan. The difference requires an expenditure of 420 million yuan per month, which the Municipal Government is responsible for raising. Meanwhile, we are seeking assistance from society. Once the plan is implemented, the price of rationed rice can be maintained in the near future. In addition, setting up factories to provide porridge to assist the poor, and opening up sources to suppress rice prices are also being prepared separately, hoping to be implemented in the shortest possible time.

First-Class Restaurants Prohibited from Selling Rice

What I hope the citizens will pay special attention to is that, firstly, each household should not store more than three months' worth of actual needs. Do not hoard excessively, or you will be punished. Secondly, first-class restaurants in the city were banned from selling rice by the former First District Public Office. This ban remains in effect. Therefore, all such restaurants must strictly abide by the ban and must not privately violate the ban or even purchase and store large quantities of rice under the pretext of making huge profits. If they deliberately violate this, they will be punished. In short, the Municipal Government has a deep understanding of the seriousness of the rice problem. It is my duty to do my best to resolve it as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life can deeply recognize the importance of Shanghai at this stage. We should know that during the war, frugality and solemnity in daily life should be the first priority. If we can attach importance to public interests, restrain personal desires, remain calm and self-possessed, and encourage each other through hardship, all unfounded rumors will naturally disappear, and social stability can be ensured. This is what the citizens of this city should be clearly aware of and encourage each other with.

Improvement of Treatment for Municipal Government Personnel

As for the military, police, and police officers who are responsible for local security, the Municipal Government, in consideration of their livelihood, has increased their salaries by 100% starting in October. The treatment of other staff members of subordinate agencies has also been improved with the addition of allowances. Although a thorough adjustment is still difficult during this period of soaring prices, the Municipal Government's concern for its staff can be universally understood. Officials are public servants of the people, and their every move affects society. In this extraordinary period, I sincerely hope that we can all share the difficulties, invigorate ourselves, and work hard to live up to the expectations of the government and society."

### Ensuring Wartime Security: Implementing Special Criminal Law, Police Authorities Issue Statement

The police authorities of this city issued the following statement regarding the application of the wartime special criminal law: The National Government promulgated the wartime special criminal law on May 10, 1943. The main purpose of its promulgation is, first, to prevent the dangers of enemy attacks, or the increase in general criminal offenses that can be foreseen during alert periods. Second, to prevent and suppress wartime political prisoners from disrupting order and other acts that disturb social order. Third, to establish a wartime air defense system. Fourth, to protect wartime special production and public utilities. Fifth, to establish a wartime controlled economy, etc., in order to complete the wartime security, maintain the stability of the people's lives, and ensure military needs.

Strengthening Laws to Eliminate Crime

Recently, the war situation has become increasingly severe, and this city has suffered several air raids, directly facing the danger of air raids, or during alert periods. On the one hand, a group of unscrupulous people and reactionary elements are taking the opportunity to commit crimes. On the other hand, a group of immoral profiteers and shameless elements disregard the welfare of the public, disrupt controls and engage in other improper acts, violating wartime special laws. They dare to boldly evade the law, which is extremely hateful. In view of this, it is necessary to strengthen this law. Recently, the authorities have repeatedly clarified the strengthening of economic controls, the establishment of an air defense system, and the suppression of rumors. In order to thoroughly suppress these activities, the comprehensive application of this law and consultations with relevant agencies have been carried out. We will resolutely issue strict orders to strengthen this law in order to maintain the dignity of the law. We hope that the general public will fully understand the intentions of the authorities, exercise self-reflection and self-discipline, and work together to eliminate such crimes.

Heavier Penalties for Ordinary Criminal Offenses

Furthermore, regarding the content of the wartime special law, some people may not be familiar with it. Here is a brief summary: (1) Ordinary criminal offenses: Among ordinary criminal offenses such as arson, flooding, robbery, rape, assault, indecency, theft, looting, and intimidation, the wartime special criminal law applies during enemy attacks or during alert periods. The penalties are heavier than those of general criminal law, roughly as follows: (1) Arson and flooding (imprisonment for three years or more, or life imprisonment) (2) Rape (imprisonment for five years or more) (3) Assault and indecency (imprisonment for ten years or more, or life imprisonment) (4) Theft (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years) (5) Looting (same as above) (6) Robbery (imprisonment for five years or more) (7) Intimidation (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years).

Regulations on the Punishment of Political Criminals

(2) Special crimes: (1) Political prisoners, disturbing order, and disrupting social order, whether during enemy attacks or during alert periods, are always subject to the wartime special criminal law during wartime. The penalties are heavier than those of the Law on the Maintenance of Security, the Security Police Law, and the Emergency Punishment Order, roughly as follows: (1) Murder for the purpose of changing the national government (death penalty or life imprisonment). Preparations and attempts are also subject to the same punishment. (2) Injury and illegal detention for the purpose of changing the national government (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years) (3) Obstructing gossip (4) Disturbing order (ringleaders imprisonment for ten years or less, accomplices imprisonment for three years or less) (5) Inciting others to violate the law (ringleaders imprisonment for five years or more, accomplices imprisonment for three years or less) (6) Secret societies disobeying orders to dissolve meetings (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years).

Circumstances of Crimes Related to Air Defense

(2) Crimes related to air defense: (1) Violence and coercion against air defense officials (imprisonment for seven years or less) (2) Harming public air defense (death penalty or life imprisonment), including sending signals to the air, etc. (3) Obstructing important industries and public utilities: (1) Obstructing communications (imprisonment for five years or more, or life imprisonment) (2) Obstructing electricity (same as above) (3) Obstructing national defense industries and important industries for civilian needs (same as above) (4) Obstructing transportation (death penalty or life imprisonment) (5) Damaging waterways (imprisonment for three years or more, but not more than ten years).

Crimes of Disrupting the Economy and Aiding the Enemy

(4) Crimes of disrupting the economy and aiding the enemy: (1) Speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering of military supplies and daily necessities (death penalty or life imprisonment) (2) Selling and buying in unauthorized similar exchanges, disrupting the market (same as above) (3) Government officials protecting the above two crimes (death penalty) (4) Supplying important materials for military or civilian use to the enemy (death penalty or life imprisonment) (5) Importing important materials for military or civilian use from enemy areas without permission (imprisonment for seven years or more, or life imprisonment) (6) Propaganda that hinders the economy (imprisonment for five years or less).

### Increased Price Limits for Cooking Oil and Vegetables

At the thirteenth review meeting, the Municipal Price Review Committee discussed the case of raising the price limit for cooking oil. The Oil and Grain Control Association submitted the price limit based on the request of oil merchants. At that time, the price was 465 yuan per catty in national currency. It was considered that the requested price limit was almost the same as the black market price. Therefore, it was decided to send a letter to the Oil and Grain Control Association to re-examine it. Now, after careful review by the Oil and Grain Control Association, it replied to the committee. Therefore, it was decided that the price limit for edible oil should be 410 yuan per catty wholesale, and 435 yuan per catty retail. At the same time, the price limit for vegetables in this bureau was also based on the price limit set by the Central Market, and a compromise was made. After review, it was calculated that green vegetables are 59.8 yuan per catty, spinach is 130 yuan per catty, long white radishes are 59 yuan per catty, potatoes are 70 yuan per catty, and fen gan (sweet potato starch noodles) are exactly 480 yuan per catty. It was found that the increase in the price limit for cooking oil was twice the previously set price limit, and the vegetable prices rose sharply in just one week. The reviewed prices also soared step by step, which tended to promote the black market. It is hoped that the evaluation authorities will pay close attention to this.

### Strict Prohibition of Obstructing the Transportation of Rice Under 8 Kilograms, Severe Punishment for Manipulation and Profiteering

The black market price of rice in this city previously soared due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, which shook the people's hearts and threatened the people's livelihood, which was by no means insignificant. After the concerted efforts of all parties, it has slightly fallen back, but has not yet returned to its original level. The Economic Bureau of this city attaches great importance to the approaching Lunar New Year. In particular, the free transportation of rice under 8 kilograms has been clearly stipulated and has not been changed. Anyone who spreads rumors in an attempt to manipulate and profiteer will be severely punished. The counties and districts have also been notified that if there are cases of obstruction and extortion along the way for the transportation of rice under 8 kilograms, the people are allowed to secretly report at any time for punishment. Secret agents have also been sent to the suburbs to investigate. If anyone is found to be manipulating and hoarding, they will be severely punished once verified. Furthermore, increasing agricultural production is a top priority. We are actively proceeding and planning to make full use of all public and private open spaces in this city and encourage citizens to plant coarse grains to replace rice in order to reduce the consumption of white rice. This will benefit both military and civilian food supplies, and the price of rice will not be difficult to fall.

### French Concession Bus to Restore Original Route

The French Concession Route 22 bus in this city shortened its route from the Bund to Nangyang Road in late last month. Residents in the Xujiahui area felt greatly inconvenienced and jointly petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the company authorities to restore the original route. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to contact the Public Utilities Bureau. Director Ye agreed to summon the person in charge of the French Concession Tram Company to the bureau for talks and ordered the Route 22 bus route to be restored to Tianping Road to facilitate citizens.

### Extension of Deadline for Household Coal Briquettes in Zhabei

The replenishment sale of household coal briquettes in the Zhabei Xuhua Fang and city center areas was originally scheduled to end today (21st). Due to delays in delivery, the deadline has been extended to the 28th of this month.

### Completion of Compilation of the Lianbao (Joint Security) District in the Nanshi Area

After the Baojia (household registration) Office of the Municipal Police Department dispatched personnel to take over the Baojia in the Nanshi District of this city, the Nanshi Office was established. Director Gu also served as the director, and Section Chief Xiao also served as the deputy director. They immediately planned to divide the Nanshi area into general Lianbao according to the Baojia organization in the urban area. The compilation has been completed, dividing it into Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts, with a total of three general Lianbao, thirteen Lianbao, and one hundred and eleven Bao. At the same time, the Baojia will be re-compiled, and the household registration will be cleared. The candidates for Lianbao in each district have also been drafted and will be commissioned by the office. The list is as follows: Yimiao District (General Lianbao Chief) Yao Wenjun, (Deputy) Feng Hanwen, Shao Zhenxiang, Penglai District (General Lianbao Chief) Cheng Hanqing, (Deputy) Wu Xuanting, Zhang Fengqi, Xieqiao District (General Lianbao Chief) Guo Liangyue, (Deputy) Zhang Run'gao, Yang Jiannian.

### Police Bureau Implements Winter Defense

As winter approaches, the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to prevent petty thieves and cunning criminals from becoming active and disrupting local security, has followed its practice of implementing winter defense, stepping up precautions, and dispatching the Police General Team and the Security Police Brigade to patrol and search all districts of the city. In particular, more attention is being paid to secluded streets and alleys. Those with suspicious behavior must be strictly questioned and their residence permits checked. At the same time, hotels, apartments, and other public places are also strictly checked for travelers to prevent criminals from hiding. The Judicial Office also convened a meeting of the heads of the judicial sections of each branch bureau within the day to discuss the winter defense tasks, and Director Li instructed on various necessary measures for winter defense. The Baotian Self-Defense Corps in Nanshi and other districts have also been working in shifts around the clock and assigning positions.

### Health Association Promotes Tuberculosis Prevention Work

The Chinese Health Association held its annual meeting of directors at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday. The attendees included Chairman Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, directors Yan Fuqing, Chen Binhe, Zhan Peilin, Shi Zhifu, Sun Shouchang, etc. The meeting was chaired by Director Yuan Ludeng, who welcomed the new directors Tang Yuhan, Lin Zhifu, Chu Linsun, and Han Zhengping. Then, Kai Lanting delivered a speech, saying that latent tuberculosis patients are like invisible time bombs, and there must be a place for them to explode. He hoped that everyone would work together to report them, which is a public safety measure. Dr. Yan Fuqing said that the new medicine of the past twenty years is absolutely preventive medicine. The cost of treating one diphtheria patient can prevent as many as sixty-five people. Therefore, the more widespread the prevention work, the more the health of the people will be improved. In any country during wartime, tuberculosis is extremely rampant, so tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations are a top priority. Dr. Chu Linsun said that the more difficult life is, the more prevention is needed. For the sake of saving medicine and personal safety, it is necessary to have an examination. Xie Yingrui, the medical director of the association, said that according to the statistics of X-ray examinations of the anti-tuberculosis loan industry reported by the Xinwen Bao, the incidence of lung disease reached more than 18%, which is a new world record for tuberculosis incidence. Therefore, tuberculosis prevention work is as urgent as putting out a fire. Finally, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying that according to the current extraordinary situation, tuberculosis prevention is as important as air defense. He hoped that all sectors of society would cooperate and support the eradication of latent patients and complete the prevention work, which is the responsibility of public welfare. Then, the association distributed anti-tuberculosis slogans and adjourned the meeting.

### Chengyi Middle and Primary School Implements "Savings Aid Education Movement"

This newspaper received a letter from all the students of Chengyi Middle School and Primary School yesterday, stating that since the beginning of this semester, they have launched a "Savings Aid Education Movement" with the aim of frugality and helping others. By the end of this month, they have saved 30,000 yuan and have initially recognized a team. They also hope that students from all schools can respond to the call and establish a culture of frugality and righteousness in the student community. The intention is very good and worthy of admiration. The attached origin is recorded as follows:

"Frugality" and "helping others" are virtues, and they are also one of the twelve goals of our school's student regulations. The so-called: "Strengthen my will, harden my heart, exert my strength, and be frugal in serving myself" means self-restraint and non-extravagance. The so-called: "Helping the poor and rescuing the weak, helping those in need" means using one's strength to benefit others. Being able to restrain oneself and being generous and charitable to the community are all-encompassing actions. Moreover, nowadays everything is expensive, and life is becoming more and more difficult. We are fortunate to be able to continue our studies in this difficult environment. We should take into account the wandering and out-of-school students and provide them with material assistance. Our school has launched a savings aid education movement. Saving can cultivate a style of frugality, and helping education can cultivate a style of righteousness. It is a win-win situation. Why not do it?

Savings Aid Education Movement Measures

(1) All students in this school should follow the principle of frugality and self-restraint, save as much as possible, and cultivate a style of simplicity. (2) All students in this school should follow the wish of being charitable and generously help education, and cultivate a style of righteousness. (3) Each week, the students will hand over the saved money to the group leader twice on Tuesdays and Fridays. After registration, the class leader will hand it over to the teaching office, and at the same time, the amount saved by each student will be announced. (4) Every Wednesday and Saturday, the savings and donations of students in each grade will be deposited in the Shanghai Bank, and the total amount of each grade group will be announced to encourage competition. Those with particularly outstanding results will be rewarded. (5) All doubts about savings and donations will be sent by this school to the Shenbao newspaper, and it is proposed that the newspaper will give savings and donation commemorative tickets, divided into red, yellow, and blue colors, with three types of 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan respectively. (6) At the end of a semester, the student with the largest total amount of savings and donations will be rewarded by this school, and the Shenbao newspaper will also determine to give rewards or souvenirs. (7) This method will be supervised and promoted by the teachers of each grade, and the group leaders of each grade will be responsible for handling it. (Note) The newspaper can also handle the method opened in Article 5. However, it is hoped that all schools will promote it together and express their opinions in advance by letter for handling.

Mr. Zhang Baocun Donates Money to Help Education

Since the special fundraising team of this newspaper has been actively promoting it, Mr. Zhang Baocun responded again yesterday.

### The Pressing Issue of Tuition Fees

— Guangyuan

Currently, the issue of commodity prices has become the most serious concern for every citizen in Shanghai. However, the issue of tuition fees has also become the most distressing problem for every parent. This semester has only a little over a month left, and the next semester is fast approaching. Many schools have already unofficially announced the tuition fees for the upcoming semester. Private universities are estimated to be around 40,000 yuan, while middle schools are around 20,000 yuan. We cannot help but express our shock at these figures. Although people generally say that money is worthless, it is not easy to come up with tens of thousands of yuan, especially for middle-class families with many children. What are they supposed to do?

We cannot deny that the private pockets of some principals are swelling up. As a university student, I am willing to use what I have seen and heard to prove that many schools are indeed tuition mills.

(1) The cost per teaching hour for professors is only at a minimum level before the semester begins. After the semester starts, it increases depending on the number of students. But does it really reach the ideal amount? Isn't this just a way of calculating profits?

(2) Some schools require students who have been granted student loans to write a promissory note, stating that they will repay the full amount within a few years after graduation. While loan repayments are necessary, this method seems overly harsh.

(3) School finances, like national finances, should balance income and expenses. However, some schools offer middle school students a 10% discount on tuition fees. From the perspective of a student, what are we supposed to think?

There are countless examples like these. The simplest thing to do is to calculate whether the tuition fees collected by the school are equal to the school's expenses. I think this is perhaps a very serious problem that must be resolved. In my personal opinion, there are three points for discussion:

First, the passive approach would be to ask the principals of the schools to muster their courage. They are all intellectuals and should know the importance of the mission of education, especially wartime education, which is even more critical. Here are a few points:

(1) The school's finances should be completely transparent, with income and expenses balanced.

(2) Students should be allowed to pay tuition fees in installments to alleviate the burden on parents.

(3) A minimum tuition fee may be set. If the budget is later exceeded, students can bear the additional cost, of course with mutual understanding. As long as we reach this point, there will be no more problems.

Second, the active approach would be to ask the relevant authorities to impose sanctions if there are one or two scoundrels in the education sector who are unwilling to give up their source of wealth. Initially, they should be advised with sincere words. If they remain stubborn, force should be used to intervene.

(1) The school's finances should be managed or budgeted by people appointed by the authorities, ensuring that they are simple, honest, and that income and expenses are balanced. The principal or school board should still be given nominal positions and appropriate salaries.

(2) Someone once proposed "capping tuition fees." In fact, in Shanghai today, it may not be impossible to implement this, although it is not a fundamental solution.

Third, a compromise approach. I don't know if this approach is reasonable or whether it will be accepted by society. That is, the school would send people to conduct a thorough investigation of the students' families, determining the tuition fees they should pay based on the students' family circumstances. The goal is to integrate the school and the students. Of course, doing this well is not an easy task, but I think it is not difficult either, as long as there are dedicated people, they will surely succeed.

Finally, I have a few contributions to make to the school: the school should minimize expenditure as much as possible, and in addition to minimizing expenditure, it should also increase revenue, in order to reduce the burden on students. For example:

(1) In terms of minimizing expenditure: the students can cooperate to share the work of the staff, and the students can provide their own paper during exams. The paper is not significant, but if the school purchases a large quantity, it is really a big ... etc.

(2) In terms of increasing revenue: in addition to tuition fees, government subsidies, and external fundraising, the school can lead students to engage in productive work based on their strengths, making it a required subject for extracurricular practice (for example, agricultural students can be made to plant crops, etc.) to increase the school's assets, which will also reduce the burden on students.

Although there are many student aid organizations in society now, they are ultimately just a drop in the bucket and do not solve the problem. I hope that the wise authorities will make some changes for the future of Chinese education. This would be fortunate for tens of thousands of students and would also be a policy to stabilize people's livelihoods.

### Mr. Zhang Hongjiu Generously Benefits Orphaned and Impoverished Children

Mr. Zhang Hongjiu wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, I pass by every day and see homeless children on the streets, their clothes barely covering their bodies, not having enough to eat, and their suffering is unbearable. These children are no different from ordinary children, but perhaps because their parents have died, there is no one to care for them, or because their families are in difficulty, they are forced to be abandoned. As a result, their innocence has not faded, but they have become wandering beggars. This kind of miserable scene is unbearable to witness. Your organization's aid for impoverished children aims to rescue and educate orphans and homeless children, providing them with appropriate education so that they can become useful people. The method is good and the intention is kind, which touches my heart. I am enclosing a check for 10,000 yuan, hoping that you will accept it and allocate it to the aid for impoverished children. The amount is small, but it expresses my sincere intentions." Mr. Hongjiu's enthusiasm for charity and his generosity towards impoverished children are truly admirable.

### Widespread Benevolence

Mr. Chen Youqing, seeing that it has been cold and freezing recently, with many corpses on the streets, and that rice, fuel, and charities are finding it particularly difficult to provide supplies, deeply moved by the difficulties of the times. He made a grand vow to solicit 40,000 yuan each from Wenkunfang and Chen Jiqing Hall, totaling 80,000 yuan, and donated 40,000 yuan in the name of the above-mentioned organizations to this organization for winter relief expenses, and another 20,000 yuan each to Xin Puyu Hall and the Holy Mother's Infant Care Center, totaling the above amount. His benevolence and righteous deeds are truly admirable.

Also, the two children, Ying Chun and Gao Chun, go to school every morning, braving the bitter wind, their fingers and skin chapped. They deeply feel that the poor have no clothes or food, how can they get through the year? They specially prepared 200 yuan from their savings to be used as expenses. The two children, feeling and empathizing with their own hunger, practice thrift and provide assistance. Their determination is commendable. It is hoped that influential people from all walks of life will rise up and respond. This is truly unparalleled merit.

### Chinese Children's Welfare Association Solicits Christmas Gifts

According to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association received donations from all walks of life in the past two days, totaling more than 180,000 yuan, including 150,000 yuan solicited by Mr. Ding Boxiong. Mr. Ding is a standing committee member of the association and has now solicited a total of 309,000 yuan. He is known for his enthusiasm in promoting active social welfare work and is particularly concerned about children's education. According to Mr. Ding, the association originally set a fundraising target of 5 million yuan, which would be sufficient for half a year's expenses. However, given the current commodity price situation, it would be difficult to maintain without raising at least 10 million yuan. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will work together to continue to assist in fundraising so that the association's fundraising can be successfully concluded.

In addition, in order to increase children's interest as Christmas is approaching, the association has decided to hold celebrations at the Orphanage and the Children's Welfare Institute on the 24th and 25th of this month, respectively. The students will perform recreational programs, and ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life are welcome to visit. If you would like to donate gifts, such as candy, biscuits, towels, pencils, etc., please send them to the association's office at 208 Zhonghui Building, Dashanghai Road before the 24th, so that they can be distributed.
