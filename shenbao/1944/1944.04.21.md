### Seizing the Opportunity for Political Reform

Since the National Government relocated its capital, over four years have passed. If we attempt a review of the actual state of central politics in the past, it is undeniable that various ailments exist. Analyzing them:

Political institutions are not yet perfect. The most obvious aspect is that a representative body has not yet been established. The central government's lack of a representative body has prevented local governments from establishing their own independently.

Political institutions are excessively large, emphasizing form over substance, and unwilling to engage in practical work. Institutions were established for temporary circumstances without comprehensive consideration, resulting in too many redundant branches, which, in terms of political efficiency, are equivalent to being virtually non-existent.

Personnel matters are unsound. The appointment of officials has not adopted a meritocratic approach, failing to achieve expert governance. Instead, harboring notions of kinship, regionalism, and partisanship inevitably leads to the bad habit of employing personal connections. The most glaring examples are the recently occurred Hou-Hu case and the entire Grain Department's corruption scandal.

Administrative efficiency is low. The main reason lies in the duplication and overlap of redundant agencies, filled with superfluous personnel. Meanwhile, civil servants' salaries are too low, and their livelihoods are unstable, making it difficult to expect dedicated service.

There is no firm conviction regarding the direction of the situation, and there is a strong tendency to harbor a "wait-and-see" mentality. Therefore, it is impossible to be grounded in reality and alleviate the unnecessary suffering of the people during wartime, or to bring politics in the peaceful areas onto the right track. Especially after rejoining the war, it has failed to exert practical strength.

If an individual develops an illness, accurate diagnosis and targeted medication are naturally required. Moreover, it is essential to seek treatment promptly to prevent it from spreading or worsening. If a nation's politics develop ailments, which are related to the rise and fall of the entire national destiny, it is ten thousand times more important than an individual. It is absolutely necessary to seek immediate treatment after an accurate diagnosis. We do not hesitate to offer advice. Regarding the past ailments of central politics, we have made the above diagnosis and must implement appropriate treatment targeting the symptoms. At the same time, we believe that the current situation has reached a complex and severe stage, and we cannot afford to hesitate and be indecisive. As the saying goes, "A quick diagnosis requires a slow remedy," and failure to treat quickly is very dangerous. Secondly, if surgery is required after diagnosing the illness, do not hesitate, lest it spread. For example, corruption is like a tumor that must be excised. We must have the determination to cut through the Gordian knot and eradicate corruption. On one hand, it is necessary to inject tonics to nourish vital energy and enhance resistance. For example, employ new talent, break down partisan biases, and eliminate notions of kinship and regionalism.

Political reform is urgently needed at the central level. As Chairman Wang of the National Government is currently recuperating and temporarily unable to personally manage central state affairs, with Mr. Chen Gongbo and Mr. Zhou Fohai jointly presiding, they should immediately take full responsibility and promote reform. Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou are outstanding political talents in the central government, possessing knowledge, insight, experience, and passion. We believe they are extremely clear about the past ailments of central politics. Furthermore, in terms of Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou's positions, this is the best opportunity to contribute to the nation. They must seize the current best opportunity to reform politics. We hope they will make a determination, considering the future of the entire nation, the improvement of the entire people's livelihood, and the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia, and no longer worry about the constraints of the internal environment. For the political malady that cannot be managed, adopt the opinions of allied nations and public sentiment, and promptly reform it. We also suggest:

Establishing a central representative body as soon as possible and urging local areas to establish representative bodies to communicate public opinion and start afresh with the people.

Eradicating corruption comprehensively and rigorously. Paying attention to strictness in rewards and punishments. Since the execution in the Hou-Hu case, the full details of the case should be announced as soon as possible to inform the nation and deter corruption. On the one hand, reorganize tax revenue and revise the tax farming system, or reasonably increase tax revenue to enrich finances. In particular, substantially increase civil servants' salaries to stabilize their lives, reduce the motivation for corruption, and increase administrative efficiency.

Merging or abolishing redundant agencies and idle personnel that do not conform to the wartime system as soon as possible.

Reorganizing local administration and establishing security to stabilize the people's livelihood.

Today, this newspaper specifically publishes an editorial by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun, "Hoping the National Government to Eradicate Politics." Allied public opinion is full of enthusiasm, expecting our country's political reform. We share the same sentiment and have presented the above commentary based on our observations. Chairman Wang of the National Government has been in Japan for over a month for medical treatment. We, standing from the people's perspective, urgently demand that the government announce a plan for political reform and the results of its implementation to appease the eager hopes of the people.

Commentary and Translation

### Hoping the National Government to Eradicate Politics

Today's China must implement increased production; this is undeniable. Even the price issue can no longer be resolved solely through economic means. It has become a deeply rooted political problem. Therefore, all parties are striving to first reform politics. For example, general corruption allows officials to extract the blood and sweat of farmers and oppress the people without reason. As a result, not only is the farmers' hard work wasted, but this increase in production is of no benefit to the nation and only enriches corrupt officials. Therefore, the prerequisite for increasing production is to eradicate corrupt officials. Before notifying materials and governing the people, the government must first control the officials. This growing call is not without reason.

The National Government's recent execution of several officials from the Stabilized Food Department is indeed a harbinger of political purification, bringing about a new atmosphere. However, if this corrective action is seen as merely a flash in the pan and does not lead to a thorough resolution, it will certainly fail to meet the expectations of the national people. Therefore, we hope the National Government can thoroughly implement the expected policies. The National Government includes various parties, factions, and non-partisans. If political correction lacks a thorough determination and is focused on bias towards one party or faction, then Party A will specifically label Party B as corrupt officials, attacking each other. As a result, the disputes among the various factions within the country will still not be eliminated and will continue to struggle. If this continues for a long time, the effort to strengthen political power through renewal will instead cause division in political power, leading to countless adverse consequences for the National Government's self-strengthening efforts.

We hope that the correction can be active and decisive, and there must be no delay. It cannot continue to hinder the production area. For example, regarding the price issue, if we wait until there is a shortage of goods before correcting corrupt officials and profiteers, it will be too late, and prices will still be uncontrollable.

We repeatedly state here, without fear of repetition: officials should strive to reduce personal consumption, devote themselves to the operation of administration. Authorities colluding with speculators, if they engage in hoarding and speculation, their crimes deserve ten thousand deaths. What Chairman Mao called the "traitors of the nation" are these kinds of corrupt officials. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the National Government can take active and decisive action against these domestic enemies.

### Active Japanese Air Force Shoots Down 41 Enemy Planes in Indian Territory and Destroys Enemy Airfield Facilities in Palel

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 20th that the Japanese air force in the Burma area shot down 41 enemy planes over the Imphal basin in April, three of which have been confirmed. At the same time, they bombed the enemy airfield in Palel, destroying its affiliated facilities. Five Japanese planes have not yet returned. Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force in the Burma area has been cooperating in the offensive operations in India for days, bombing enemy airborne troops who were parachuting in the vicinity of Kaching, completely thwarting the enemy's attempt to reinforce their main force, and operating vigorously within the Imphal basin. On the 17th, a fighter squadron, in cooperation with ground troops, launched a fierce attack on Meiktila (a key point south of the Imphal basin) over the Imphal basin. On the same day, at dusk, they attacked a large formation of enemy fighter-bombers over Bishenpur. The Japanese planes formed a unified force, broke into the enemy plane group, and engaged in a fierce air battle. In this battle, they shot down 25 Spitfire enemy planes, 10 P51s, and 6 A35s (three of which were unconfirmed), totaling 41. In addition, a joint formation of fighter-bombers also attacked the enemy airfield in Palel before and after this, overcoming the stubborn resistance of enemy fighters and hitting all the affiliated facilities of the enemy airfield, thoroughly destroying them. Three Japanese fighters did not return in the air battle over Bishenpur and the battle of Palel, but the fact that Japanese planes shot down 41 enemy planes is enough to reflect a glimpse of the battle of Imphal. Since the 18th, the number of enemy planes cooperating with the enemy ground forces in the counter-offensive has decreased significantly. Also, due to the lack of aerial resupply, the enemy's resistance has been greatly reduced, and the Japanese offensive units are continuing to advance rapidly.

### Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Occupy the Leimakhong River Valley; Enemy Troops in Shenam Have Signs of Retreat

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Indian front reports that the Japanese-Indian allied forces, which launched a fierce attack on the 405-kilometer high ground 15 kilometers northeast of Imphal, have captured the area in the Leimakhong River Valley north of the high ground on the 17th, after seizing the position of the enemy's main force since dawn on the 14th, with reinforcements from new elite troops, and have put the enemy army's life in their hands. On the other hand, the Japanese-Indian allied units that occupied the 3524 high ground 20 kilometers northeast of Imphal have been attacking the enemy who launched a counter-offensive led by tanks since the 15th. On the morning of the 17th, they echoed their friendly forces who had circled behind the enemy position and suddenly surrounded about 1,000 enemy troops, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy troops who lost the 3524 high ground are currently building positions on the 4214 high ground only 3 kilometers northwest of the high ground, continuing to resist with tanks and artillery as support. Other Japanese-Indian allied units also advanced to the rear of the enemy army on the 17th, echoing each other and launching fierce attacks on the enemy army.

Japanese Army Base on the Indo-Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese-Indian troops launched a fierce attack on Tiddim, a fortress in front of Palel, on the 14th, capturing enemy positions and high ground. As a result, the first line of strongholds has all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Although the remaining enemies are stubbornly resisting, the overall situation of the battle in that area has been decided. Since the 18th, the enemy army has shown a gradual retreat in the Shenam position 4 kilometers behind the area. The Shenam fortress behind Tiddim was subjected to fierce Japanese artillery fire. On the 18th, the ammunition depots and fuel depots in the area were hit and exploded in flames, burning for four days, which was extremely tragic. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division was thus shaken.

### Enemy Planes Thwarted in Raids on Rabaul and Other Islands

Enemy planes thwarted in raids on Rabaul and other islands Rabaul, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the Rabaul front, about 500 enemy fighter-bombers raided in succession on the 18th. The Japanese army shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered minor damage. Also, in the Buin area of Bougainville Island, 12 enemy fighters raided on the 18th. One was shot down by the Japanese army, and the Japanese side suffered no damage. Also, in the Buka Island area adjacent to Bougainville Island, 22 enemy fighter-bombers raided on the 18th. The Japanese army shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.

The Chairman reported that the case presented by the Secretariat, approving the letter sent by the Legislative Yuan regarding the political work reports for November and December of the 32nd year and January of the 33rd year, requesting that it be forwarded for record, had been approved for record. [Discussion Matters] The Chairman submitted for discussion a memorial submitted by President Jiang of the Examination Yuan regarding expanding and promoting examination methods. The Chairman submitted for discussion a case presented by the Secretary approving the letter sent by the Civil Service Office of the National Government regarding the expenses of the Special Court and the estimated budget for the opening and decision of temporary expenses, which had been first sent to the Financial Affairs Committee for review as usual, approving the letter in reply to the review opinions, proposing to reduce the regular expenses to 62,100 yuan per month, together with an additional salary of 59,900 yuan, for a total of 122,900 yuan per month, and a temporary expense of 100,000 yuan, requesting review and approval.

Huitong News Agency: German naval patrols and minesweepers in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay reported that the number of mines laid by the enemy has greatly increased. Since the 7th of March, the work of German minesweepers has increased threefold. The enemy's large-scale deployment of mines at this time can be seen as a prelude to the opening of the Second Front, in order to hinder the actions of German warships and escort fleets off the coast of Western Europe, but as a result, the enemy has so far failed to halt German shipping off the coast of France. Most of the mines used previously were magnetic mines, which are different from the previous contact mines that detonated when they touched a ship. Eden Undertakes Special Mission. Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency). According to Washington sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Undersecretary of State have left London simultaneously to consult with a senior foreign official.

Berlin Denies Rumors. Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency).

The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion a memorial submitted by the Military Affairs Commission stating that the Standing Committee of the Commission had approved the abolition of the Commander-in-Chief's Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, the establishment of the Wuhan Pacification Director's Office, and the special appointment of Yang Puyi as the Pacification Director in Wuhan, requesting review and approval.

### Focus of the Eastern Front War Will Shift Soon; Major Battle to Break Out Within Old Polish Borders

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to military commentator Harungsleben of the German News Agency, the concentration of Soviet troops north of the central-southern section of the Eastern Front indicates the Soviet intention to break into the territory of the General Governorate of Poland, established by Germany in occupied Poland. As the situation develops, the focus of the war will soon shift. The apparent goal of the Soviet military authorities is to penetrate the flank of the German northern line and cut off the German troops there, but so far, the German troops in that area have been able to cope with the enemy's frontal attacks. This is rarely done. In the past few days, the Soviet army has devoted all its efforts to attacking. Now, with the increasing activity of the German army and its allies, its offensive has greatly diminished. Although it is not possible to immediately conclude that this offensive by the Soviet army has come to an end, both sides have adjusted their front-line troops, and the outbreak of the Second World War should be at another point on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to an official announcement here, the German-Hungarian allied forces advanced yesterday towards the Carpathian Mountains and the upper reaches of the Humska River, gaining further expansion.

Southwest of Ternopil, enemy infantry and tanks launched a major offensive but failed.

### German Troops in Italy Will Launch Offensive

On the 19th, the content of the Irish Free State's Prime Minister's note and the Foreign Ministry's reply were also announced. Details are as follows: Note from the Prime Minister of the Irish Free State (March 20th): "Deeply concerned about the imminent destruction of Rome. Should one of the belligerent nations use Rome for military defense, and the other belligerent nation launches a military attack, Rome will inevitably be destroyed. In order to protect this ancient religious and cultural capital with nearly two thousand years of history, it is hoped that the belligerent nations will seek ways to safeguard it." Unsigned memorandum from the German Foreign Ministry (April 18th): "To protect Rome, the German government has decided to make Rome a completely demilitarized city, eliminating any pretext for anti-Axis forces to attack Rome. Firstly, a strict order prohibits the commanders of the German army from lodging in the city of Rome. Secondly, the railway network in Rome will be exclusively used to supply civilian needs, especially food for the citizens of Rome. Thirdly, German soldiers are generally not allowed to enter or leave the city of Rome. The German army will not only not conduct military defense in Rome, but will also ensure that there are no military targets within the city of Rome. The responsibility for destroying the holy city lies entirely with the US and British military commands."

### Vice Minister of Justice Kong Explains Mission in Shanghai

Kong Xianggu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, is in Shanghai on official business. When reporters interviewed Mr. Kong yesterday to inquire about the purpose of his visit, he replied as follows: "After the establishment of the Special Tribunal of the National Government, the internal personnel, from the presiding judge to the staff at all levels, are mostly concurrently serving officials from this ministry and its directly affiliated agencies. However, the system is completely different, and outsiders who do not understand the truth have made incorrect reports. Yesterday's news about me coming to Shanghai to investigate Mr. Hou's property is likely the same misunderstanding. I also serve concurrently as the Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office. In addition to the Deputy Director handling daily affairs, I personally oversee important matters. Currently, Minister Zhang is extremely concerned about the food rations for prisoners in detention centers and the treatment of judicial personnel. The purpose of my visit to Shanghai this time is to contact the Rice Control Committee to request the allocation of 934 shi of rice for the detention centers for March and April of this year, and to send personnel to pay the rice funds to the committee. In addition, the municipal government subsidizes Shanghai's judicial expenses with 250,000 yuan per month, which is also requested by this office on the ministry's orders. A total of 750,000 yuan for January, February, and March of this year has been requested by this office. The above is the task of my visit, which has nothing to do with the rumored investigation of Mr. Hou's property."

### Victory for Independence in This Battle: Letter from Mr. Chen Gongbo to Chairman Bose

To His Excellency Bose, Leader of the Provisional Government of Free India: I have received great news from the Indian front. Under your leadership, the Free India National Army, in cooperation with the allied Japanese forces, has broken into Indian territory, and victory is in sight. Overwhelmed with excitement, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the National Army for their successes and pray for the success of the Free India independence movement. At the same time, I would like to briefly describe the views of our country's revolutionary patriots and revolutionary people on the current situation. Three Decisive Factors

This war, narrowly speaking, is a war against the British and Americans, but in a broader sense, it is a war between the righteousness of national coexistence and international aggression. The purpose of the war is not to antagonize any one country or nation, but to smash the old order of international aggression, sweep away all vengeful and destructive mentalities, and prevent them from poisoning the world again. There are three decisive factors in the war: first, the conflict of interests among the aggressors; second, the revolutionary demand for independent survival of oppressed nations; and third, the awakening of the world's humanity to the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity. It is no coincidence that the nations of East Asia have risen up together and are fighting together. It is also no coincidence that the allied nation of Japan has resolutely risen up to aid China, India, and other nations of East Asia, serving as a pioneer in defending East Asia. We can assert that this is the inevitable outcome of historical development.

To overturn the old order of international aggression, we must first overthrow the demons that have nested in this old order for two or three hundred years, and we must also guard against the wicked accomplices who take the opportunity to stir up trouble. Even now, the mastermind who is secretly manipulating events from behind is actually the wicked accomplice, Britain and America. Opposition to the intentions of Britain and America is the expression of this. To achieve this goal, we must strike down the greatest basis for the unbridled aggression of British imperialism, defend the Pacific, and hinder the rampant aggression of American imperialism. This is a necessary process.

From this perspective, the liberation of India is not only the restoration of the independence and freedom of the Indian nation, but also has a great impact on the completion of China's independence and freedom. It is closely related to the survival and safety of the nations of East Asia.

The Inseparability of Chinese and Indian Liberation

The Chinese revolution has been going on for sixty years. Although it has experienced setbacks and revivals, it has not yet succeeded because the scope of past movements has been limited to a single revolution. The significance of the connection between the revolutions of the two great nations of China and India, and the inseparability of the Chinese revolution, the Indian revolution, and the liberation of East Asia, lies entirely in this. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this significance became even clearer. Only by winning the Greater East Asia War can the great national revolutions of China and India move forward. Only under the conditions of the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War can the demands for independent survival of the two great nations of China and India be realized.

Therefore, we ourselves must constantly strive, deeply appreciate the sincere assistance of our allies, and promote the unity of the East Asian nations, correctly recognizing the responsibilities we should bear for East Asia.

What is most distressing is that even today, some people in our country have forgotten Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, forgotten the expectations of our revolution for your country's revolution, and also forgotten the spiritual resonance that your revolution has given to our country. Not only have we failed to provide practical assistance to liberate your country's independence, but some people have even assisted the aggressors in hindering it. This is truly a disgrace to the Chinese nation. But I dare to tell Your Excellency with determination that our country's revolutionary patriots and revolutionary people can no longer tolerate this stain on the Chinese revolution. In the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the heroic victory of the allied nation of Japan and the smooth progress of the Indian people's single-minded practice cannot but serve as a final warning to these elements. We firmly believe that revolutionary China will rise up for unity, with the united strength of the whole country, following Free India and the allied nation of Japan, standing in the same battle line, sharing life and death, and launching a death battle with our common enemy for our own homeland and for a common East Asia.

This time, Your Excellency has raised this great righteousness, taken up the weapons to save the motherland, and used troops with swiftness. The will of your people is becoming more and more firm, and the enemy is collapsing in fear. The completion of the independence of Free India is imminent. The vast number of people groaning under the iron heel of the brutal enemy will receive great comfort. The unification of the Chinese revolution and the completion of the liberation of East Asia depend on your success. I wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of Free India, and a bright future for the liberation of East Asia. (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 11th)

### Financial Institutions Unify Accounting Names, Financial Inspection Department Sets Standard for Subjects

The Financial Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank believes that the names of accounting subjects currently used by various financial institutions are not uniform. Some have different names for the same category, or the same name with different realities. Each is independent, not connected to each other, disorganized and chaotic, and there are no standards, which greatly hinders success. In order to facilitate inspection and promote the sound development of financial business, the department has convened accounting supervisors of various financial institutions several times to study and discuss the standardization of accounting subjects of financial institutions. After consultation, a standard for accounting subjects was produced, and the unified accounting subjects were stipulated and sent to various financial institutions to follow the implementation methods. All general commercial banks, trust companies, savings banks, and provincial, municipal, and county local banks, except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations, shall "use the prescribed accounting subjects. (Financial institutions such as money houses, silver shops, or silver companies shall be allowed to use the bank's benefits and subjects) The department also compiled the unified financial institution benefits and subjects into a volume, which was distributed to various financial institutions for reference. The British Airlines Benefits and Subjects (including asset category, liability category, loss category, profit category) have a total of 119 types of names, and the letter The company's benefits and subjects have a total of 27 types of names. The savings bank's accounting subjects have a total of 10 types of names (the above trust company savings banks also have general benefit and subjects names that are the same as the nature of general banks, which are not listed above)

### Cotton Cloth Rationing and Children's Clothing Problems

— Wu Zheng

The implementation period of cotton cloth rationing is approaching. Before that, I have a small suggestion.

Currently, almost no school in Shanghai has students wearing school uniforms. The reason for this is of course the high price of cloth and the unavailability of materials. But I believe that the purchase of school uniforms is quite necessary for both the students and the school authorities. It cannot be denied that the reason why children in our country are not as lively and active as children in foreign countries is also due to clothing restrictions. Therefore, now we can take advantage of this cotton cloth rationing to think of a way. Let the future masters of the country not be sluggish in action and spirit due to wearing long robes and coats, which affects their health and work efficiency.

For the sake of brevity, I list five methods below:

Each student submits the set price along with the cloth purchase certificate to the school party authority.

The school authority must collect the collected funds and cloth purchase certificates as soon as possible, and submit an application (the number of cloth purchase certificates and funds can be detailed in this letter) to the Cotton Cloth Joint Management Office.

The joint management office distributes cloth of the same color to each school according to the amount of cloth needed by each school (coarse cloth with strong quality is the best)

After each school is allocated cloth, it will determine its own style: (the style of the Youth League can be used as a model, and those with unsuitable colors can make Zhongshan suits and Western-style shorts. It is quite good.) Uniform tailoring, while averaging wages and notifying each student. Each student exchanges uniforms from the school authorities for the wages that the school authorities indicate should be paid.

The school authority must fully and obligatorily implement this, because this is originally a matter of improving the school. As with the distribution of educational bureau sneakers this time, some schools have taken the opportunity to seek profit, which is a great sin! Wage accounts must also be fully disclosed.

This suggestion is probably something that all large, medium and small schools in Shanghai are happy to respond to. Although, the method I said is very simple, I hope that the Chamber of Commerce and the Cotton Cloth Joint Management Office can provide assistance. I am sure it is not difficult to do. As for the students' parents, adding clothes for their children in the same way will not be the same as calculating on the form and not agreeing!

Then, soon we can see that the spirit of the young students is even more radiant and courageous!

### The Unfalling Fortress - Rabaul

Since entering March, the South Pacific line has shown clear signs of tension, and the moment of decisive battle is already upon us. The elite Japanese troops, centered on Buin at the southern tip of Bougainville Island, have been enduring for several months in various parts of the island, preparing for the coming battle. In early November, they launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy's base at Torokina. The Japanese forces gradually gained control of the enemy's airfield and various facilities, and the enemy also mobilized large-scale air power, or used ground firepower, to desperately defend. The evolution of the situation, although unpredictable, was triggered by the counterattack on Torokina, and enemy air forces launched large-scale air raids on key Japanese strongholds such as Rabaul and Kavieng, making the battle line comprehensively intensify. The enemy's counterattack on Rabaul has become increasingly fierce since early spring this year, with two hundred to three hundred and several dozen aircraft attacking three times a day. However, the enemy realized that the most important Japanese stronghold was difficult to attack, and that bombing would result in great sacrifices. Therefore, in late January, they attempted to disrupt or cut off Rabaul's supply lines, rashly sending excited troops to the central Pacific, invading Truk Island and Tinian, Saipan Island. However, the Japanese defense in this area was extremely solid, and the enemy air force suffered a severe blow from the Japanese Navy, and then changed direction, dispatching one hundred and several dozen or two hundred aircraft a day to attack Rabaul. In particular, recently, they not only bombed military facilities, but also carried out despicable acts of bombing the city streets. Subsequently, they landed in Torokina in western Bougainville Island, Magagi in southwestern New Britain Island, Sorol in northwestern New Britain Island, and Green Island in the ocean southeast of New Ireland Island. A portion of the enemy's forces also landed on a corner of the Admiralty Islands in the ocean north of New Britain Island at the end of February, taking a position to encircle Rabaul. These enemy forces are all engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army.

### The Rabaul Fortress Stands Immovable

The enemy's intention is to isolate Rabaul and prevent the Japanese from having time to counterattack through continuous bombing. However, the Japanese army never yields, using its small air force to intercept the enemy forces, while ground troops also unleash fierce fire, achieving results every day. Now, the area around Rabaul has not only become a major fortress, but is also fully prepared for a decisive battle. It has already built strong and unyielding mechanized positions and deployed land, sea, and air forces. In addition, with complete storage methods, it has accumulated sufficient weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food to last for several years. Moreover, since the end of last year, non-combatant civilian stores and companies have been relocated inland, and the commercial organizations of third-country nationals (mostly Chinese) and local residents, or farms and coconut groves for the purpose of local self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruits, have been taken over and managed by certain Japanese troops. Eliminating civilian colors, and adopting a single military color, to reorganize the decisive battle formation. No matter how fierce the bombing, the Japanese army has complete air defense facilities. (In addition to the complete installation of anti-aircraft artillery, there are underground concrete air-raid shelters, or cave shelters using mountain recesses. Except for the collapse of a few houses during air raids, the damage is negligible. In particular, it can be said that there are almost no casualties.) Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army is becoming more and more vigorous, and they are only waiting for the opportunity to counterattack.

### The Southern Line Urgently Needs More Aircraft

What is the opportunity for a counterattack? It is when the Japanese air force is strong. Sending aircraft to the front line, this requirement is the supreme command. Aerial attrition warfare is a characteristic of the South Pacific battle line, so it can be said that everything depends on whether or not there is air supremacy. And it is determined by the number of aircraft. In this theater, because the air bases of both sides are within each other's bombing range, air supremacy can be said to only control the time of flight. And the time of flight is determined by the number of aircraft. Excellent Japanese aircraft and brave and unparalleled Japanese airmen with superb combat skills and an indomitable fighting spirit immediately deploy their wings and take off from their bases to intercept enemy forces when they come to attack. Each aircraft can kill several enemy aircraft each time. However, the attacking enemy aircraft, because their numbers exceed ours tenfold or twentyfold, even the worst American aircraft must be allowed to infiltrate Japanese airspace to some extent. Although the enemy is terrified of the bravery of the Japanese army, they often drop their bombs in a hurry and flee, or make excuses such as "bad weather" and often turn back midway. From this, we can also know the level of skill in the enemy's fighting spirit.

In the six naval air battles off Bougainville Island, and even in subsequent air combat results, everyone regretted saying: "If we had a few more aircraft, we could have annihilated the enemy fleet." Also, for example, enemy convoys were detected very early, but they could not be attacked and had to be allowed to pass, or the enemy's landing could not be completely prevented. All of this was partly due to the insufficient number of Japanese aircraft. So, how many aircraft are enough? However, for the next question, everyone should have doubts. Because the number of aircraft cannot be given a definite number. If the number of our aircraft is large, we will naturally need more. If the number of enemy aircraft is small, we can also need less. The required quantity is relative. We will only record the following example here. The number of enemy aircraft in the Solomon Islands area, deployed at the various air bases of Guadalcanal, New Georgia Island, Munda Island, Torokina, etc., totals one thousand to one thousand and two hundred combat and bomber aircraft, and they are deployed in four shifts. However, the number of Japanese aircraft is much less in comparison, and our tireless naval air force, without rotation, goes out to attack or intercept every day. We do not hope to have the same number of aircraft as the enemy. We will be satisfied with a certain number of attacks and defenses necessary for the number of enemy aircraft. The only thing necessary is a continuous supply. Because of their great production power, the enemy constantly strives to maintain a certain number of aircraft in the face of great daily losses. It is absolutely necessary for us to maintain a certain ratio to this. Even our brave and unparalleled air force sometimes suffers valuable sacrifices, or sometimes aircraft are damaged beyond repair due to air combat, bombing, etc. If we calculate one aircraft lost per day, we need thirty aircraft per month, and sixty aircraft in two months, so there must be a continuous supply.

### Enemy Women's Teams Participate in the War

The rapid increase in production and aid for aircraft also requires the training of aircraft personnel. Regarding this matter, the government is already carefully considering various measures, and we also deeply believe in them. However, in this regard, there is only one issue that needs to be paid attention to: recently, enemy aircraft also include women participating in them. In addition to pilots, enemy large aircraft have women serving as communications officers, etc., and large aircraft tenders for rescuing pilots who land midway are manned by women, engaging in rescue work. It goes without saying that it is not surprising that frivolous and adventurous American women are on board aircraft. However, on the front lines amidst gunfire and bullets, even women can fulfill a role in aviation power. Looking at this fact, and in view of the current situation where it is hoped to increase the number of aviation personnel, is it not a question worth considering? The field of women's mobilization is not limited to factories, battle positions, or rural villages. At least in the vast field of aviation, other than the front line, in the so-called civilian air transportation in various regions, they can also replace men. Therefore, the field where women should contribute can be said to be broad and large.

### The Scientific Community Should Quickly Rise to Cooperate

Finally, we must call on the scientific community to quickly mobilize and rise up. All fronts are concentrating on "weapon-mounted firearms", "wireless communication weapons", and "electromagnetic wave weapons", and are developing fierce scientific warfare, which is a well-known fact. In this theater, the progress and changes in science are worth staring at. Not only is the performance of one weapon being improved, but new weapons are appearing one after another. The development of the performance of enemy and our aircraft, compared to the beginning of the war, has been greatly improved. For example, for the firearms mounted on them, we have high-performance support, and there are great achievements in shooting down enemy aircraft. However, the enemy soon applied special defensive armor, so even higher-performance weapons are needed.

Electromagnetic waves have the most important mission as the vanguard of air warfare, or quickly discovering enemy ships, etc. However, yesterday's electromagnetic wave equipment is already old-fashioned today. In addition to airborne radar, there is now the emergence of sea radar, making submarine warfare increasingly fierce. Also, like bombs, the enemy has jumping torpedoes, and we have 〇〇 bombs, etc. New weapons are being sent out. Today, the necessity of the number of aircraft goes without saying. On the other hand, the invention of a new weapon can actually surpass the advantage in quantity, and has this kind of importance. Therefore, there is no opportunity other than now for the entire scientific camp to mobilize.

Now, the enemy is circling in the Pacific, sharpening their claws, adding importance to our inner line operations. However, the strategic position and value of Rabaul have not diminished. No, for its inner line operations, Rabaul can contain enemy fleets externally, or hold this place to the death, so that the enemy cannot obtain a single fleet base in this area, or, in the sense of giving a decisive battle "time", it can add other meanings. Therefore, the loyal and heroic Japanese army and navy generals and soldiers in Rabaul, in close communication and cooperation in the defensive posture, are burning with the belief and will to win, and are holding Rabaul to the death, and are watching for the opportunity for a fierce counterattack. Aviation will enable it to achieve this goal. The early strengthening of aviation power and the complete arming of science are one of its important things.

### Southern Germany: A Pilgrimage to the New Industrial Zone

A Cold Village Transformed into an Industrial City

The Bohemian and Moravian Protectorates in southern Germany have become a newly emerging industrial zone and have been going on for five years during the war. It has become more and more likely to follow the Ruhr region and become an arsenal for the Axis powers in Europe. The industrial cities in northern Germany have been damaged by Anglo-American air raids and have been replenished by industrial cities in the south. It goes without saying that existing industrial facilities are being expanded on a large scale; in terms of new construction, for example, cold villages whose names were not even known before the war have now been transformed into cities with a population of 50,000 to 80,000. The reason for this is to make tourists who revisit the old place be dumbfounded.

The new industrial zone has an unexpectedly large-scale coal liquefaction plant, various weapons factories, and small-scale ordnance factories that use natural terrain and are camouflaged to avoid air raids. The industrial departments of the former Czechoslovakia have also been added with new equipment, and industries during peacetime have been transformed into ordnance factories. The number of workers in the factory has doubled compared to before the attack, and there is naturally no one who is unemployed. Moreover, in terms of treatment, local workers have been completely equal to German workers since January of this year, and have obtained more favorable conditions than in the old republic era. This move is enough to prove the important position of the area in wartime industry.

The Rule of the Protectorate

In March 1939, after the German army entered the former Czechoslovakia, it divided the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia into protectorates, which has now been five years. The only issue for Germany during this period is whether the German nation can coexist and prosper with other nations. If this problem can be satisfactorily resolved, then Germany can occupy a leading position in the new European order that includes all nations. Therefore, the merits of the Protectorate’s rule are a touchstone. However, Germany's policy towards the Czechs under protection does not make them Germanize, but respects their national characteristics and culture, and strives to support their survival and prosperity within Greater Germany.

Czechs are exempt from military service and enjoy the same rights as Germans. All but one of the members of the Protectorate government are Czechs, including the prime minister, most of whom are celebrities in the political and financial circles of the old republic era. Among the various types of officials, Czechs account for more than 10,000 people, while Germans account for only 500 people. Protectorate President Frick, on behalf of President Butler, resides in the position of President. The actual political and administrative guidance of the Protectorate government and the liaison with Greater Germany are handled by a small number of National officials led by Minister Frank of Bohemia and Moravia Province. The administrative system relies on a provincial double organization, and Germany is working hard to ensure the survival of the Czechs within Greater Germany. Regardless of the various difficulties in wartime, the thorough organization of health, social affairs, and culture in Germany has been fully developed and has achieved results. For example, although paper is in short supply, 9 million Czech books were still published last year, nearly 90% of the first part before the war. The newly established youth group, the Mo group, trains the spirit, preserves the characteristics of the Czech nation, and is full of life and vigor. This is clear proof that Germany treats different ethnic groups with a true brotherly relationship.

Pioneering the Way of Coexistence and Co-prosperity The anti-German conspiracies and terrorist acts of the Czechs were subdued after the assassination of Protectorate President Heydrich last year. Although they retreated on the eastern front, people's hearts are still extremely stable. The opportunity for national harmony and the attitude of striving to participate in the war can be seen everywhere. The signer once exchanged opinions without hesitation and synthesized what the ministers, financial leaders, and relatively sharp speakers of the Protectorate said, and came to a conclusion, that is, when Heydrich first took office in the Czech Republic, the Czechs generally thought that Heydrich was the henchman of Himmler, director of the German political police, and feared that he would implement harsh ethnic policies. In fact, in order to maintain public order, it is natural to adopt strict policies, but he did his best to respect the Czech national culture and life, especially to protect the rights of the Czech people to own and manage their property.

This is to make the Jewish capital equal in the Czech Republic, so that it becomes state-owned or even nationalized, but it does not move a bit to those owned by the Czechs. For example, the Czech Republic's largest arms factory, the Skoda factory, was later operated by the Hermann Göring Company. The Czech Republic government, which was anti-German before the war, sold most of the Skoda factory's shares to the French Schneider factory. After the war began, it was subject to enemy property disposal. Today, it still recognizes the shares held by the Czechs. Recently, it expanded the factory and increased its capital, and the new shares have been publicly listed.

Generally speaking, Germany has embarked on the path of sharing and coexisting with other ethnic groups, and its internal unity has become more and more solid, which is a sign of a bright future. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun of April 5)

The sun sets in the west, and the western sky is covered with colorful clouds. The clouds move lazily forward, and the tired birds know that it is time to return to their nests. The yellow cows in the square make a long, drawn-out moo, as if calling for their masters to come and lead them home. Smoke curls from the tops of the thatched cottages, and the people in the village are busy preparing dinner.

A string of clear songs floats in the evening breeze. Along with the songs, a lively little girl jumps out of the apricot blossom grove, about sixteen or seventeen years old. She has a face as beautiful as Zhaohua, especially her eyes, which are dark, bright, and lively, revealing her innocence. She sings as she jumps: "The sun is setting, the little lambs are going home! Mom is waiting for a kiss, kiss and go home to be with Mom!" She jumps farther and farther, and gradually this lively little shadow disappears into the dusk.

In front of a thatched cottage at the foot of the mountain stood a middle-aged woman, anxiously looking east, wringing her hands tightly. A lively little girl came running, and a comforting smile appeared on the woman's face.

"Mom, look, Zhang Gong gave me this." The little girl raised the meat in her hand high and said to her mother with a smile.

"Little Apricot! You're not young anymore, how can you still be like a wild child, running around outside all day? Look, Mom will find you a husband's family next year, and let them take good care of you."

A red cloud flew onto her cheeks, and Little Apricot lowered her head in shame, but she was secretly happy in her heart, because usually when she saw her younger sisters get married, her mother would always make them some beautiful clothes. Little Apricot, she loves to wear beautiful clothes the most, but her family has no money, and her father passed away early, and all she can rely on is her mother to do some needlework to earn some money to live on. Now that life is expensive, she can't even afford to eat, so where can she have extra money to make clothes for Little Apricot, so she only dreams that one day when she gets married, her mother will make her many beautiful clothes.

The days passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the autumn harvest had passed, and every household was preparing grain, waiting for the grain collectors to come and take it away. Little Apricot's family also had some debts to pay to a Lin Lord in the city, but they had neither the property left by Little Apricot's father nor fields to cultivate, so they had no savings at all. The money they earned on weekdays was only enough to cover their daily expenses, so Little Apricot's mother was always frowning and silent these past few days. Little Apricot was no longer as happy and carefree as she used to be. She knew that something embarrassing was about to happen to them. She hoped that Lord Lin would forget about this matter and not come to force her to repay the 300 yuan. But things couldn't be so simple. Three days later, the debt collector came. He said fiercely to Little Apricot's mother that she must hand over 300 yuan today, otherwise, he would drive them out and not allow them to live in this house anymore. Little Apricot's mother pleaded bitterly, but this person pretended to be deaf, as if he hadn't heard anything. Just at this moment, Little Apricot borrowed some rice from next door and came back. When she saw a guest in the study, she hurriedly flashed into the kitchen, but she had already been seen by the guest. His pair of thief eyes stared at Little Apricot for a long time, and then nodded thoughtfully, and then said to Little Apricot's mother: "I have seen that your family is very poor. I have always been a loyal and honest person. When I know that people are suffering, I will help them. Now, look, I will throw this contract into the stove and burn it." After saying that, he crumpled the contract into a ball and threw it into the stove to burn. Little Apricot's mother shed tears of gratitude, thanking the debt collector repeatedly and then respectfully sending him away. That night, the two mothers and daughters talked very happily, saying that it was the blessing of the ancestors that they were able to accumulate so much good karma, so the debt collector would burn the contract. Who knew that good times would not last long, and misfortune would soon follow. The next morning, the debt collector came again. He told Little Apricot's mother that Lord Lin had heard that her daughter was very beautiful, so he wanted to marry her as his fourth concubine. At the same time, he would give Little Apricot's mother 500 yuan and a pair of gold bracelets as a betrothal gift, and he was scheduled to come and marry her in five days. Little Apricot's mother was about to speak, but the man had already run away. Little Apricot's mother had no choice but to take the bracelets and money to tell Little Apricot. When Little Apricot found out, she didn't eat or do anything, and cried all day long. She said that she would rather die than go to be Lord Lin's concubine. Little Apricot's mother, of course, didn't want her precious daughter to be ravaged by Lord Lin. But there was no way, people were rich and powerful, and she was so poor, so what if she didn't agree? Five days later, a colorful palanquin took Little Apricot away. Although she cried and struggled and refused to go, she finally succumbed. She let these people blow and beat her away

It was another dusk, a spring dusk. The evening breeze was blowing gently, shaking the leaves on the tree branches and the tender grass on the ground. Next to the apricot blossom grove rose a new grave, and several lonely wildflowers grew on the grave, swaying as if they were about to fall when the breeze blew. A woman came from afar, staggering to the grave, staring blankly. Suddenly, she cried loudly: "Little Apricot! In the end, you were ruined!"

Cuckoos cried mournfully on the tree. The setting sun shone on this whole village, on this dirt grave, and also on this woman—(she still stood foolishly, without moving.) She had fainted to the ground.

### A Distant Journey

— Xin Yi

I seem destined to live a life of constant motion. Day and night, I kick the earth behind me, entering another new realm, briefly glancing around, and then stepping out again. It's truly a long journey! Yet, I neither complain that I'm too free, nor do I want my two legs to stop. It's as if we glimpse a black [unclear character] suddenly streaking across the sky; what we see is its posture of flapping wings and striving to fly, and in the blink of an eye, it has disappeared into the vast sky. This image tells me, and also amazes me, that I truly don't know when it will want to stop. I myself can't help but do the same. I understand that I'm constantly walking, but I don't know what kind of image my ceaseless stride leaves behind, what image I project into the eyes of others.

And I am indeed bewitched by the unfinished journey. The "future" is always something yet unknown, and I harbor a particularly strong desire and curiosity for things I don't know. Though what is strange is that when I truly taste it, I can't help but immediately discard it, and then begin to gaze vaguely ahead. There, there are still things I don't know. Thus, I abandon the past—I am always so lost. Of course, I haven't created a schedule or plan for my life's journey. It's that, and I can't draw one up. This reason, the rushing water perhaps knows. Try asking it, but when you hesitate for even a moment, it rushes forward without the slightest attachment, carrying a head that doesn't turn back—who knows where it's rushing to? It's just like that.

Sometimes, when I see those white clouds rapidly streaming across the sky, the dawns and sunsets retreating like fugitives under the evening sun, so hasty, even jostling and bumping into each other, I almost suspect that the North and South Poles are drawing closer. And these images flash in my heart, and my heart is also enlarged several times by the surging torrent, accommodating more of heaven and earth. This is to say, I want to walk even further. Those borders? They're just like a slight edge rippling out from a point of blue scattered in the water's reflection, faint, elusive, and gradually dissipating. This should be worrying, but I don't know that the point of blue is still mixed in the water, it's just—unable to be found. I'm always like this. How vast is the heaven and earth in my heart, how distant is the journey, and yet, I who have embarked on the journey, seem so small, almost dissolving into this world and disappearing there, there! But this is irrelevant to me. In a world of "reality," what does it matter if something disappears?

If I like to laugh, then I laugh at those "fake" people living in "reality"; if I hate, then I hate those who don't even pretend to smile after turning their faces; if I grieve, then I grieve for those who don't know the fundamental elements of their own lives; and if I curse, then I only curse those whose lives are calculated like abacus beads. But this is just talk. How could I possibly feel happy? How could such a long journey give me a moment of leisure!

This is how I think: the future is accidental, the past is inevitable, and the present is adaptation. Everyone will properly and directly step on the road they stand on, even if it's as rugged as the steam rising. But in short, all of this is irrelevant to me. What's important is that I still have such a long, such a distant journey to travel!

### Soprano Singer Ms. Mao Aili

— Zhi

Those who have lived in the North probably have a considerable understanding of Ms. Mao Aili! In the past three years, she has held public recitals every year in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The characteristic of her singing voice is that it is rich in emotion, and also broad and bright. Listen! When she sings Li Qingzhao's lyrics "Slow, Slow Tune," her face, her voice, are exactly like the fourteen words in the poem: "Searching, searching, seeking, seeking, desolate, desolate, bleak, bleak, sorrowful, sorrowful, wretched, wretched, painful, painful," full of sorrow and holding back tears; but when she sings the song "Early Happiness," who isn't moved to dance and be joyful? Whose mood isn't light and happy?

Success is never accidental. Ms. Mao Aili's family environment is an extremely good place for cultivating musical talent. Her home is in Qingdao, and her father is a violinist. It is said that when Miss Aili was only four years old, she had already learned the lyrics of Su San from records: "Su San left Hongtong County, and came to the front of the street..." a segment of "Western Tune Flowing Water," if that were in an ordinary family, perhaps it would be considered commonplace and not remarkable, but her esteemed father did not think so. He was not only amazed by her talent, but also happy with her interest. Now he had a daughter to inherit the family skill. So he sent Miss Aili to school step by step, and in her spare time, he imparted knowledge of professional cultivation. These are the essential elements for nurturing that young seedling to grow. When she grew up, she was admitted to the Department of Music at Yenching University, majoring in vocal music. She had repeatedly served as the solo part in the grand chorus of "Messiah" and "Creation," earning high praise from composers. Afterwards, she returned to Qingdao to hold several recitals, thus establishing her position in the music world. In the spring of the year before last, she suddenly left her family and bid farewell to her old friends, gracefully coming to Shanghai to study under Professor Su Shilin. For two years, she has learned some of the essence of Professor Su Shilin and become one of Su's most satisfied disciples.

How many languages does one need to know to study vocal music? It's difficult to answer this question. It's not like studying science or literature, where mastering one or two languages allows you to read many books. Learning to sing is different. Singers don't have nationalities. We heard the members of the former Dong Sai Dance Troupe sing Chinese songs when they came to Shanghai, which were gentle and melodious. Similarly, Ms. Aili is the same. She often sings English "Creation," Italian opera, German Schubert songs, and the pronunciation principles of Japanese lyrics all come from the same source.

What is Ms. Mao Aili like in her daily life? Two short phrases can be used to answer this: [unclear character], straightforward, is her natural disposition; talent, hard work, are the reasons for her success. You can spot her on Yu Garden Road around 8 o'clock in the morning, riding a bicycle and speeding westward like lightning, rushing to class at St. John's. Even now, she constantly practices singing every day, learning new and reviewing old, which takes up most of her time. In addition, rouge and brocade seem to have no attractive power for her.

On the 25th and 26th of this month, she will hold another recital. The venue is at the Great China and Guanzhong Grand Theaters. The purpose of this performance is nothing more than to conduct further experimentation. She often says that learning is endless. There are naturally more people in Shanghai who appreciate music than in the Tianjin and Jin areas. She hopes that after this performance, the audience can give her some practical criticism to serve as a guide for future improvement. This statement is unavoidably overly modest, but for those living in Shanghai, having the opportunity to listen to her singing voice is indeed a piece of good news worth celebrating.

Counting the days, it's almost here. Let us bless her health and success with a sincere heart! Bless her health and success!

### Mourning a Departed Friend

— Wei

Spring rain falls continuously

It is the Qingming season

You

Cannot see the clear sky after the rain

Nor the sun rising

You painfully left this world

Having lived a quarter of a century

You struggled with pulmonary tuberculosis for ten years

You coughed up blood

But still had to get up and work

For the sake of three meals of white rice

Alas

The fresh blood exhausted the last drop

You refused to waste a single moment

You refused to squander a single penny

You never planned for your personal gain

Not even a fraction of a cent

Wealth was not your friend

Poverty was your confidante

In this era of hardship

How much torment did you endure

Your personal aspirations could not be realized

And family separation was added

Two sisters are in the West

The third brother wanders to the South

The fourth brother is seriously ill in the North

Mother spends her twilight years in her hometown

In the hospital

Your profound eyes

Your thin face

How many friends felt anxious and heartbroken

But alas, for what

No one could stay by your side

No one could reverse this crisis

Before you died

You still wielded your pen

You told us not to sigh

But to work even harder

Yes, we will always remember your words

May you rest in peace

### Farewell, Northern Star, Safe Travels! Reviewing Six Matches in Shanghai

The Northern Star basketball expedition from North China boasts an impressive lineup. The people of Shanghai, craving the artistry of Northern basketball, were overjoyed, and each match drew a tidal wave of spectators. The atmosphere was heated, and the occasion unprecedented. Over the team’s six matches in Shanghai, they first suffered defeats at the hands of the Western Youth and the Hualian Pharmaceutical teams. By the match against Zhongbei, the players gradually regained their normal form, resulting in a tie. Subsequently, during an exhibition, they defeated Huaying. Finally, they accepted the challenge from Western Youth for two matches. Thanks to the help of teammates Zhao Yalin and Li Baozhong, and the support of Li Zhenzhong, their strength greatly increased. In the first match, the soldiers gave their all, putting on a wonderful performance, and indeed made the “barbarians” bow. In the second match, it was intended to follow up with a sweeping victory, but since Chuan Jinsheng's foot injury had not yet healed, the team was greatly affected, resulting in unfulfilled ambition and causing much regret. A retrospective review of the six matches follows:

First Match, Unfamiliar Style

The Northern Star team's first match in Shanghai was held on April 10 at the YMCA gymnasium on Ba Xian Qiao, facing the Shanghai Western mixed team. The crowding of the audience was beyond description. The admiration of the fans for Northern basketball style was profound indeed. Northern Star had six players present, with Shao Weigang as backup. At the beginning of the match, both sides buried themselves in hard work, with no tactical display, only individual performance. Therefore, the first half was extremely tense, with the Western mix team winning by only two points, 14 to 12. In the second half, both sides had military advisors to give advice. The Westerners used superior tactics, while Northern Star remained the same, blindly charging forward, so they allowed the opposing team to lead from the start, unable to catch up later, and ultimately lost to the Western mix team by 21 to 30. An unfavorable start, which the commentators regretted. The reason for this was that the Western mix team was able to attack the opponent's weaknesses, while Northern Star ultimately failed to adapt, which was a shortcoming.

Second Match, Still the Same

The second match was against the Shanghai Chinese league champion, the Hualian Pharmaceutical basketball team. Hualian Pharmaceutical's combat strategy was much the same as the Western mix team’s. At the beginning of the game, the Northern Star team relied on their superior individual skills to fight the Southern force, dividing the court and confronting each other. The situation was quite shocking. Hualian Pharmaceutical ultimately used fancy moves. Xi Lin and Jin Xuan scored with every shot. The first half ended with a score of 16 to 11. In the second half, Northern Star tried hard to change its strategy, using more brain and less brawn. Northern Star did not notice, resulting in Hualian Pharmaceutical, with its many tricks, easily gaining victory. The score was 31 to 26. Judging by the close score, it can be seen that Northern Star was not incapable of winning. However, they only knew how to attack and not how to defend. Facing a strong enemy like this, failure was inevitable. In this match, Chuan Jinsheng's individual performance was indeed exceptionally brilliant, earning much applause.

Third Match, Gradually Returning to Normal

The expeditionary force faced the Shanghai North [unclear character] patriarch Zhongbei team, still at the Ba Xian Qiao Youth Association. The court was even more lively than the previous two matches because of the two Northern factions competing. In this match, both teams paid attention to fast attacks after getting the ball, and neglected strict defense. This was originally a matter of style, but also because they showed courtesy to each other. However, Zhongbei ultimately had deeper experience, winning the first half with a score of 26 to 1 [unclear character]. In the second half, the Northern Star players suddenly seemed to recover. Team leader Fan Qinggong became active, shedding the affectation of the previous two matches, and scoring with every shot. Chang Ying's center also gradually showed ease in advancing and retreating, and his posture when dribbling the ball was particularly well displayed in this match, which was admirable. The result of the match was 49 to 49, a draw. Because it was friendly in nature, both sides agreed not to extend the game, shook hands, and made peace. Northern Star was gradually recovering to its normal form.

Fourth Match, Initial Victory

This match was played in conjunction with the Huaying Sports Association, at the company's court, which was a hard court. Commentators said that the Northern basketball team was more accustomed to mud courts, so they could display their power, but I dare not casually deny this. However, the Northern Star team members themselves firmly believed that the floor and the dirt ground were no different. In order to consolidate its strength, Huaying specially invited national player Li Zhenzhong to help, so as not to let the battle situation be one-sided, but as a result, the expeditionary force ultimately won with a superior move. After arriving in Shanghai, they achieved their first victory, 44 to 32, which was quite close. Huaying focused on the get-together. In addition to the ceremonies hosted by actresses Zhou Manhua and Hu Feng, they also presented valuable souvenirs to the Northern athletes, and the atmosphere was unique. During the get-together, the exchange was a sincerity rarely seen in the sports world.

Fifth Match, Famous Generals Assist

The team received special attention from the Western Youth authorities, who sincerely challenged them. However, they were afraid that it would be difficult to deal with the enemy's frequent use of clever tactics when their strength was inferior. Therefore, old members Li Shizhong and Zhao Yalin (now affiliated with Zhongbei, previously both members of the Northern Star team) decided to help out and join the team, and invited Li Zhenzhong to join, in order to provide assistance. Sure enough, with the gathering of Northern masters, Western Youth, although still plotting for victory, could not avoid defeat. Moreover, the location of the match was at the Western Youth Association, where the enemy had the advantage of terrain. This also shows the preciousness of Northern Star's victory. In terms of argument, the assistance of Zhenzhong was a major reason. And Chang Ying's sudden burst of luck and hitting every shot was also a major key. The result was 41 to 38. Judging by the score, it was quite dangerous, which can be inferred without saying. In short, this battle can be called a successful battle.

Sixth Match, Exhausted

After the defeat, Western Youth was unwilling to accept it and invited Northern Star again. Northern Star, with only two days left before leaving Shanghai, could not refuse the invitation and resolutely agreed. In fact, after several battles, they inevitably gradually showed signs of exhaustion, while Western Youth ultimately waited at their leisure. Therefore, in the first half, Northern Star was still able to fight with their backs to the wall, leading by one point with a score of 15 to 14. Afterwards, they lacked sufficient effort, so how could they win? They only saw mental and physical exhaustion, and all efforts were in vain. Western Youth was able to manipulate victory, reversing the defeat with a score of 38 to 31, and Northern Star ultimately lost.

Technical Criticism of Each Player

In summary, Northern Star had two wins, one draw, and three losses in their six matches in Shanghai. Although the record was not outstanding, the whole team was full of energy, their attacks were like lightning, clear and beautiful. Looking around Shanghai, no one could surpass them. They were also able to pay close attention to sportsmanship, which was particularly valuable and worthy of emulation by all players. As for the criticism of individual techniques, I will describe them in turn:

Fan Qinggong——As the forward, his shooting [unclear character] is indeed remarkable. Being on the scene is quite [unclear character], before the forward, and the shot is also skilled, being the scoring pivot of the whole team. This gentleman is

Chuan Jinsheng——is the best forward, and his shooting is also skillful, being the scoring key of the whole team. This gentleman is young and strong, and his future is immeasurable.

Chang Ying——served as the center in several matches in Shanghai this month, advancing and retreating quickly, with a beautiful dribbling posture. It is believable that his basics are superb and worthy of appreciation. However, he is often seen at a loss at critical moments and shows panic.

Guo Yaosong——With his strong physique, he is the most standard material for a defender, and is incomparably brave. His shortcoming is that he is brave but lacks planning.

Guo Yongen——It is said that he serves as the center in Beiping, but he serves as the defender more often in Shanghai. He is good in all aspects, but he often defends less and attacks more, revealing loopholes. Perhaps it is because he is not used to serving as a defender?

Zhao Weiguan——Performed extremely wholeheartedly in Shanghai, so I dare not offer criticism.

Farewell, Northern Star

In short, the team's individual skills are quite remarkable, but the whole team lacks research on tactics. The "man-to-man" defense is not very effective. Once a strong enemy is in front of them, they only know how to fight desperately, and fail to adapt. This is probably because the Northern style of play sticks to conventions, and the environment makes it so. This trip to the South is a lesson. They should bring back the strengths of the South to the North, and carefully ponder them. Then, the stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade. The magic of application lies in one's heart. Reaching the peak can be foreseen. As the saying goes, "If a scholar is separated for three months, one should look at him with new eyes." If they come back again another day, and show their skills again, I know that they will be able to refresh the vision of the people of Chongqing. Encourage them! Encourage them!

Now the expeditionary force, the Northern Star, is scheduled to leave Shanghai today. Singing a song, when will they come again? Farewell, Northern Star, farewell, athletes of the North! Safe travels! Take care of yourselves!

### My Opinion on the Northern Star Team

— Yu Xunzi

In recent years, the participants in the Shanghai basketball games have all been the teams that are used to playing and are hot, and after watching for a long time, the offensive and defensive techniques of each team are well known to each other. The Northern Star team's expedition to Shanghai has given the Shanghai teams a good opportunity to learn from each other, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Although the team lost two and drew one in its first three games in Shanghai, heroes cannot be judged by temporary success or failure. The team's technical aspects are quite valuable. Let's discuss its strengths and weaknesses and use them for [unclear character]. I will express what I see as [unclear character].

The Battle of Western Youth

On that day, the Western Youth team's performance was not as pure and hot as it was in the Western Youth League before. Except for the two defenders, Brett and Othel Liao, who played more outstandingly, the rest seemed a little rusty. Why could the Northern Star still not win? It was because their offensive and defensive abilities were still not as good as the Western Youth team. The Northern Star's defense method is to use man-to-man defense as king, but its application is not yet effective, often allowing the opponent to take advantage of gaps. Western Youth wins its attacks by blocking, and Northern Star cannot quickly change and shift its position to prevent the opponent's attack. And the rebounding under the basket is often won by Western Youth, making Western Youth's opportunities to shoot under the basket far more than Northern Star's. The Northern Star's offensive method is to use fast-speed passing to allow two back attackers to sneak attack. Although the five people cooperate with considerable tacit understanding, Western Youth's man-to-man defense method is the champion of all teams in Shanghai. In this situation, the Northern Star did not know how to use obstruction or pivot to break it, so it could not penetrate the bottom of the basket and ultimately lost.

The Battle of Hualian

The Northern Star team still used man-to-man defense, while Hualian used a 3-2 style five-man joint defense. Hualian could also not use the obstruction or pivot method to attack. However, relying on its pure and hot connection, lightning-style attack, and familiarity with the venue, it was able to win. At the beginning of the game, the Northern Star forward rushed back to the middle line to receive the ball, then passed it to the defender to sneak attack the basket. The method was excellent. Unfortunately, the use of this [unclear character] tactic was very brief, and afterwards they often wandered outside the opponent's defensive zone, passing back and forth, so that the ball could not penetrate the enemy's formation, which greatly reduced the chances of shooting. Looking at the second half, the ball was passed to the Hualian basket every time, and the back-turning shot method was used to shoot, which made many great achievements, which can be known. With the Northern Star players' physique and jumping height, the Hualian two guards could not stop this type of shooting. It is a pity that this method was not used more in the first half, which was the main reason for their inability to win. When the ball is passed to the shooting area and there is no one to obstruct it, it must be shot. This is the key to shooting. However, the Northern Star team often does not shoot when it is in this area, but continues to pass, which leads to repeated loss of good shooting opportunities. In the last three minutes of the battle, the Northern Star fought with a tight pressing man-to-man defense, trying to recover the decline, but it still failed to work, but gave Hualian the opportunity to attack with lightning, leading to defeat.

The Dispute of Zhongbei

The absence of Zhongbei players Zhao Yalin and Li Zhongbei from the game caused the team's strength to be greatly reduced. However, the Northern Star still could not win because of this, which was really unexpected. Zhongbei's 3-2 joint defense attacked far faster than Northern Star. The Northern Star is known for its lightning warfare tactics, but it did not show its skills in this battle, giving the opponent a chance to return to defense. The battle was the most dull of the three battles. At the beginning of the game, Northern Star used a 2-1-2 style joint defense method. After five minutes on the field, they still changed to the man-to-man method. When Northern Star used the joint defense method, the location was not appropriate, and the movement was not flexible, making it easy for Zhongbei to penetrate the basket. In this battle, the Northern Star's shooting was mostly long-range shots. On the other hand, Zhongbei's scoring was mostly shooting under the basket. Later, the Northern Star's back attacker Guo Yongen reduced the attack, greatly affected. That night, the Northern Star's attack was greatly affected. That night, the Northern Star's entire team made more mistakes in cooperation than in the previous two battles, so even though Zhongbei's lineup was incomplete, it was still able to seize the whole game, making it impossible for Northern Star to win.

Looking at the three battles, the Northern Star generals can run and jump well, and the speed and accuracy of pushing the [unclear character] ball with both hands in front of the chest, and the agility of rushing forward to press the ball, are unmatched by the Shanghai team. Personal skills are also mostly above water, but the team's offensive methods seem to be outdated. As for sportsmanship and fighting spirit, they are mostly worthy of emulation. The two back attackers' sneak attacks are amazing and their skills are the crown of the entire team. It is a pity that they have not been able to use the defensive methods properly. Those who defend the blue must face the enemy's back basket and form a straight line. In other words, make the enemy walk the outer circle, and I retreat and walk the inner circle, and use [unclear character] as the center point. The Northern Star team's defense is that every time the enemy rushes forward, they turn around and follow the enemy, falling behind the enemy instead. At the same time, their defensive zone seems to be too lacking, often allowing the enemy to escape and rush to the basket to shoot, which is the weakest point of their defense. If the team uses the method of "the enemy advances, I retreat, the enemy retreats, I advance", when the enemy gets the ball, they face the defender, making it impossible to shoot, and making the shooting area without [unclear character] to take advantage of, then the other side will not be easy to attack. When attacking, there is no suitable way to break the enemy's five-man joint defense or man-to-man defense. In my opinion, every team must have two extremely defensive methods, such as the five-man joint defense or man-to-man methods, depending on the enemy's offensive situation, and adapt accordingly. If the other side is good at using the obstruction method to attack, then use the five-man joint defense method to deal with it. If the enemy is not good at attacking with the obstruction method, then it is appropriate to deal with it with the man-to-man method. The style of the two defensive methods can only be created when attacking, which is also necessary to break the enemy's defensive methods and become a top-notch team. With the Northern Star athletes' physique, strength, and personal agility, coupled with good guidance and improved offensive and defensive methods, they will become a strong enemy for the Shanghai teams.

### Sports Miscellany

The Minli Girls' Middle School has a history of achievements in sports, especially volleyball. For example, Zhu Shifang and Huang Xingfen have both represented China in the Far East Games. The school's director of physical education, Mr. Zhang Juefei, is even more of an advocate. The newly established basketball team has already achieved considerable results. The players Xiao Ying, Sheng Jingshu, Zhuang Jinmu are all lively and agile, not inferior to ordinary veterans. I say that if they come out to compete, they will surely expand our horizons.

Football matches are most supported by fans, but because of the enthusiasm and passion, the authorities have already contacted the racecourse for the competition. Then, the lessons of the past are still vivid in my mind. I deeply hope that the authorities will plan in detail. The most important thing, I think, is to count the votes, increase the police force, and set up more entrances and ticket windows, and so on. So that the situation of [unclear character] encirclement will no longer reappear at the racecourse, and it is fortunate that the competition does not have a stadium.
