### The Urgent Need to Focus on the Rice Problem

Since the assistance received from Allied nations during August and September to resume household rice rations, without delays or reductions, and simultaneously implementing the policy of free transport of rice under ten "shi" (石, a unit of dry measure, about 100 liters), rice prices were temporarily stabilized, bringing joy to the citizens.

Regarding household rice rations after October, it is said that the Rice Control Committee authorities have repeatedly expressed great confidence. This is the first piece of good news since the reorganization of the Rice Control Committee. We also believe that the Rice Control Committee has made good arrangements and sufficient preparations for the rationed rice after October, over the long period of August and September, and will not lose the trust of the citizens. However, during this period, the policy of transporting rice under ten "shi" was suddenly abolished, and changed to allowing free transport of only up to eight kilograms. The significance of this change in policy, it is said, is that after this restriction, it will make it difficult for rice from the interior to come to Shanghai, and the price of rice in the interior can be reduced, thus facilitating the purchase of low-priced rice in various regions.

However, our view differs. Because the restricted quantity is too small, it will inevitably stimulate the rise of rice prices in Shanghai. After the rise in rice prices, it will definitely stimulate the rise of other commodity prices, and at the same time, it will also stimulate the rise in rice and commodity prices in various regions. This is not just a theory; past experiences have repeatedly told us so. Therefore, we have always opposed the cancellation of the free movement of rice under ten "shi" before the rationed rice can be fully supplied and on time. Once it is canceled, it will inevitably stimulate the rise of rice prices on the black market and other commodity prices. And the Rice Control Committee's ideal of facilitating the purchase of rice in the interior will not be realized, and will be counterproductive. The current high rice prices on the black market are stimulated by the cancellation of the free movement of rice under ten "shi," and at the same time, rice prices in the interior have also been affected and have risen. Therefore, the Rice Control Committee initially insisted on canceling the restrictions, perhaps not expecting to get such a result.

Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee put forward two important suggestions on the rice problem, one is a symptomatic treatment and the other is a fundamental solution. Standing on the position of the people, we absolutely support them, and hope that the Municipal Government authorities will decisively deal with the first suggestion and actively implement the second one. In fact, regarding the first suggestion, we remember that when the free movement of rice under ten "shi" was announced, it was jointly announced by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee. And now the cancellation of the previous policy is a unilateral announcement by the Rice Control Committee alone. The Municipal Government has not yet clearly issued an announcement. Only the speech of Director Gojima of the Economic Security Department yesterday asked the people to cooperate and abide by the new policy. Does this count as speaking on behalf of the Municipal Government? We hope that the Municipal Government authorities should have a clear statement. If the Municipal Government agrees to the cancellation, then what did the Municipal Government mean when it announced the mobile policy at the beginning, and why did it give up so easily? We ask the Municipal Government authorities to adopt the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and deal with it decisively.

Recently, some people have deliberately slandered us, saying that we pay special attention to people's food, but not much attention to government rice. In fact, this is completely a malicious slander. In our editorial on May 15, [Further Discussion on the Food Problem], we have already mentioned: [In this wartime, government rice comes first, there is no doubt about it]. We have always advocated that government rice is the most important, and people's food is also important. What we have been arguing about is the past personnel, powers, and technical issues of the Rice Control Committee. We have always believed that if the rice problem can be completely handed over to the most appropriate Chinese personnel, not only can government rice be supplied smoothly, but at the same time, the people's food will never be so serious.

In short, rice is the most important of the people's food, and the rice problem is the most important livelihood problem. Decisions must be made in accordance with China's national conditions and public sentiment, and listening to the opinions of the masses of the people. Decisions cannot be made based on the opinions of a few people, and behind closed doors. The painful experience of last year will not be forgotten!

Finally, today, our newspaper translates and publishes the Q&A of Mr. Ueda, Deputy Director of the Rice Control Committee, regarding the general situation of the Rice Control Committee. Among them, the remarks on the media are inevitably defensive from a subjective point of view. Regarding our past remarks about the Rice Control Committee, where were they not constructive? Where did we [fail to see the forest for the trees]? We would like to listen to Mr. Ueda's advice.

### The US and Japan Are About to Engage in a Decisive Battle in the Pacific; the US Is Trapped Due to Increased Supply Lines

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Retired Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, on the 4th, published an article in the Mainichi Shimbun, stating that in the future, Japan and the US will engage in a decisive battle in the Pacific, and the reason for determining the outcome will be as follows: Fierce preliminary battles have already begun on the Pacific front, especially in the Philippines, giving the feeling that the opportunity for battle has gradually matured. However, this decisive battle is not only a battle for the Philippine Islands. Whether Japan can maintain its connection to the southern resource zone in the future depends on the outcome of this battle. Therefore, this is a major decisive battle that will determine the future war situation. However, what the people think of as a decisive battle is nothing more than the main forces of the two armies meeting each other, fighting a decisive battle, and then the overall situation of the war can be determined. However, due to the rapid advancement of aircraft, today's tactics are different from those of the past, and therefore the opportunity for a decisive battle is also different from the past. The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland in the past were all opportunities to determine the winner, but today they are not easy to obtain. In short, the situation where a war can be ended by one battle is impossible today. However, in terms of the principle of combat, in a decisive battle, we must do everything possible to completely annihilate the enemy. That is to say, there must be a determination to either win or die. This point is no different from the past. In the future decisive battle, the enemy and we will go all out. Therefore, after one battle, both armies will need considerable time to restore their combat power. However, judging from the situation of the enemy, the US military, once defeated, it will be extremely difficult to restore its combat power. Even if the enemy and we suffer equal losses, and the victory or defeat is not determined, it will be even more difficult for them to restore their combat power than for us. If the enemy tries to invade East Asia again, it will probably take at least six months or a year. This period is very favorable to Japan. Because today the manufacturing speed of aircraft has advanced abnormally, so air force power is easy to restore. Since there is a surplus time of six months or a year, even if the naval power of the Combined Fleet cannot be fully restored, the air force can rely on the air fleet to strengthen national defense. As for when the future decisive battle will occur, it is difficult to predict today. However, judging from the current situation in the Pacific, a battle is inevitable sooner or later. At the same time, I am convinced that it will be a long-term war. In future Pacific operations, it is impossible for the enemy to sweep across various places with mobile units, because the more the supply line is extended, the more limited its combat power will be. On the other hand, Japan is the opposite, that is, the closer the enemy approaches the Japanese mainland, the more fierce the Japanese army's counterattack will be. At that time, I am convinced that the enemy will eventually be lost to the point where it cannot be lost any more. As for the material that determines the situation, I think its elements are not in the tangible, but in the intangible. I am confident that the spirit of "Gyokusai" (玉砕, honorable death in battle) of the Japanese army in the Pacific will continue to the end of the war to protect the motherland.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Military experts here recently criticized the difficult battle of the US military on Peleliu Island, saying: Nimitz and MacArthur are now gradually approaching the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. Therefore, the timing of the decisive battle between our two armies is also becoming more mature. The enemy also admits that as a result of the approach, its supply lines have increased, and therefore the difficulties in combat have also increased exponentially. Although the enemy relies on the amount of supplies, it is still difficult to quickly resolve this difficulty. The losses suffered by the enemy army in the battle on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands have broken all records of losses in the Pacific War. Although the enemy's transportation volume is large, the enemy's supply of aircraft ammunition in the island battle is still insufficient. They suffered heavy losses from the Japanese army's counterattack. Also, due to the need to wait for transportation and assistance, they are still trying to avoid combat. From this, it can also be seen how low the enemy's combat power is. In order to obtain an advanced base for attacking the Philippines, they initially tried to capture the Palau Islands in one fell swoop, but now they are in trouble. Judging from today's situation, they will eventually have difficulty overcoming this difficulty in the near future.

Among them, the universities are currently preparing to relocate, and the Yu authorities are also actively requesting measures to accommodate these students. According to the Chongqing Central News Agency on the 3rd, Henan University in Zhenping in southwestern Henan Province, Guangxi University scattered between Guilin and Wuzhou, and Zhongshan University in Pingshi in the northern part of Guangdong Province have decided to relocate to Jingziguan (Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei provincial border), Rongxian (northern Guizhou Province), Linwu (southern Hunan Province), and Dongpo Pingshi (northern Guangdong Province), respectively.

### The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy

- Tokutomi Sohō

Although the war situation can be said to be critical, if we look at the big picture since the issuance of the declaration of war on December 1, 1941, the first phase would be very favorable to Japan, the second phase would be favorable to the enemy, and now we have entered the third phase. Whether the final victory or defeat will be favorable to the enemy or to us is a point to be determined. What is called critical is just such a critical situation. Let us briefly review the first and second phases. This review is entirely based on the facts announced by the authorities, and also based on the opinions observed by the authorities. For the time being, we will not use personal opinions to describe it. Please pay attention. The first phase was truly auspicious and prosperous for Japan. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the opening ceremony of sinking the American fleet were followed by the sinking of the British main fleet in Malaya, and then the army captured Hong Kong and the Philippines, swept through Malaya and Burma, and conquered Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, etc. The Japanese navy and army were like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves, and like a car driving on an asphalt road, it was truly smooth sailing, auspicious, and prosperous. Our Japanese offensive, like the destruction of dry wood, was burning like a prairie fire, reaching Guadalcanal Island. Since the retreat from Guadalcanal Island, we Japanese have retreated again and again. From the southern Solomon Islands to Bougainville in the north, and in New Guinea, the western end of Biak Island has already had traces of enemy troops. Now the enemy has penetrated into Manokwari. Rabaul is originally an easy-to-defend and difficult-to-attack fortress, but today, the enemy has landed on the Admiralty Islands and other places, and has prepared an air base. We must talk about the facts as facts. Talking about this point certainly makes people clench their fists and become furious, but according to the authorities, when Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet died in action last April, the enemy, the United States, began its counter-offensive in the Aleutian Islands, and finally our Japanese Yamazaki Detachment sacrificed heroically in the entire army on Attu Island. Kiska Island was able to withdraw safely thanks to the blessing of the Emperor. In addition, last fall, the American fleet began its counter-offensive in the Central Pacific, occupying the Gilbert Islands, and 4,500 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant General Shibazaki died together on Makin Island and Tarawa Island. The American fleet that occupied the Gilbert Islands finally invaded the Marshall Islands, our Japanese territory, from the end of January to the beginning of February this year. The United States began attacking Kuezhlin Island and Ruote Island in the north, and the intensity of the attack was something that the Japanese army had never experienced before. When attacking the Gilbert Islands, the United States also expended a shockingly large amount of material. For example, when attacking Kuezhlin and Ruote Islands, it is said that they mobilized 2 million tons of ships, two divisions of troops, and consumed 11,000 tons of artillery shells and bombs. The commanders of these two islands, Yasuda and Yamada, and 6,500 soldiers all died heroically. As for the enemy's method of operation, the large army led by General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, advances from New Guinea towards the Philippines, and then turns to advance towards the Chinese mainland; on the other hand, the troops of Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, break through from east to west, and want to seize the key points of Japan's Inner South Seas in one fell swoop. I think this judgment may not be wrong. As for the intentions of the U.S. Navy, military commentator Hanson Baldwin published the following article in April of this year: [The Central Pacific will soon become the battlefield for the major U.S. offensive. The next target of the U.S. military must be to carry out a detour in the Caroline Islands and then peek into the Mariana Islands. After occupying the Mariana Islands, they will advance to attack the Philippines, and even go north to capture Taiwan, the Ogasawara Islands, the Japanese mainland, etc. In addition, in the South Pacific, virtually make the northern Solomon Islands, New Britain, and its nearby bases completely paralyzed, and then open the door to the Philippines for the amphibious forces advancing west along the New Guinea coast.] Some of Baldwin's predictions have come true today. The target of the U.S. attack is the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. In addition, with the remaining strength, they will occupy the resources of the Dutch East Indies. There is no doubt about this.

### Japanese Army Completely Occupies Guilin's Forward Stronghold; Coastal Batteries Downstream of Min River Destroyed

South China Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - Since breaking through the border of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, a vanguard force of the Japanese army advancing on the south bank of the West River, in addition to rapidly pursuing the Yu army, also defeated the Yu army's militia and self-defense forces everywhere. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, they finally completely occupied the forward stronghold between Hengxi, Wuzhou, and Rongxian. Lingxi is 50 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou. As of the day before, the Yu army was still deploying regular troops and national soldiers in front of Lingxi in preparation for resistance, but they were soon defeated by the Japanese army. Now, the Guangxi front has collapsed, and the Yu army has no choice but to continue to retreat inland.

Japanese Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese China Area Fleet, on the morning of the 27th, when the Japanese army successfully landed near Fuzhou, went south from the landing point and subjected a certain Yu army battery on the coast downstream of the Min River and its coastal positions to naval gunfire, completely destroying them and inflicting heavy damage on the Yu army.

### Japan Will Reoccupy Fuzhou

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the Japanese army's operational situation in Fuzhou is as follows: The Japanese army's landing operation in Fujian Province and the operation to attack Fuzhou have been officially announced by Tokyo. The Yu side believes that this operation by the Japanese army is a natural action to counter the US military's landing operation on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, most of the foreigners residing in the province have prepared to take refuge, but because there are no planes, it is extremely difficult to escape to the Chongqing area. The remaining gap is currently only over ninety kilometers. In order to ensure the international communication route with Hong Kong, Japan must block this gap. The Japanese army once occupied Fuzhou, so reoccupying it is to be expected.

### Yu American Planes Blindly Bomb Guangzhou

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - For several months, the Yu-based American air force has been taking advantage of the moonlight to sneak into Guangzhou, flying over the city for a long time to show its power, and then indiscriminately bombing civilian residences without any military facilities, causing great casualties to the citizens. For example, on the 30th of last month, a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs were also dropped in the central area of the city, destroying the Red Cross Hospital, schools, hotels, and other facilities. Before the 3rd of this month, they continued to attack day after day, using this to carry out their psychological warfare to disturb the people's hearts. However, not only has the people's hearts not been shaken, but on the contrary, they have become more angry because of the atrocities of the American air force.

### Yu Admits Japanese Troops Entered Pingnan

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing news, the Yu military headquarters announced that Japanese troops had reached an area 27 kilometers from Guilin on the 3rd, and fierce fighting is currently underway in various areas 27 to 30 kilometers near the Xiang-Gui Railway line northeast of the city. Also, Japanese troops have broken into Pingnan.

### Conflicts Occur Between US and Yu Opinions

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Swedish Aftonbladet correspondent in Washington, the United States is now asking Chiang Kai-shek to actively participate in the war. Nelson, the US special envoy to Chongqing, reported to Roosevelt after returning to the country that the Japanese army's offensive was still continuing to threaten Chongqing. The US air force stationed in Chongqing had been driven out, and the bases in Hengyang, Linglu, Lishui, and Yushan had been lost. Under this war situation, there is complete opposition in opinions between the heads of the US military and Chiang. The US side, in view of the need to defend various important air force bases, hopes to train the Yu army, but Chiang believes that the United States should defend it with its own troops. On the one hand, Chiang's most elite troops are deployed in the northern border area to deal with the communist army, while the US military believes that the Yu army has millions of troops, and there is no need to send US troops to China at this time. Stilwell proposed building the Chongqing army to participate in the Burma campaign, but Chiang also opposed this, but only allowed him to train several divisions of the Yu army. Because the United States would urge Chiang to reorganize the Yu army and strive to improve relations with the Soviet Union and negotiate with Yan'an, Chiang allowed foreign reporters to visit North China and Yan'an, and began negotiations with the Soviet Union. It is reported that Chiang has agreed to the proposal to reorganize the economy in order to curb currency inflation. The Yu side has proposed to the United States to build air force bases again in the areas under the rule of Chongqing. It is also reported that the Yu side advocates adopting a formal exchange rate of one US dollar to 20 yuan of legal tender.

### Strengthening Air Defense Equipment in Guangdong

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Guangzhou Air Defense Command has recently strengthened various fire-fighting equipment in various districts and has also established close contact with various Baojia districts in the city. It has begun dispatching personnel to investigate sturdy buildings in various districts of the city to be prepared as air-raid shelters for citizens. It is also conducting a detailed investigation of abandoned areas throughout the city to build air-raid trenches and has selected prosperous areas in the city to build additional air-raid walls.

### Rising Prices in Beijing After Mid-Autumn Festival

Earnestly Hope Authorities Will Devise Countermeasures Soon Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the prices of various commodities in Beijing are showing a rising trend. Among them, vegetables and western cotton products are particularly in short supply and expensive. This situation, and its impact, is of great importance to the future of people's livelihood. The root cause is nothing more than the recent increase in the cost of train tickets and other transportation services, which has caused prices to rise across the board, affecting the costs of small-scale peddlers. On the other hand, unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the opportune time to once again employ their tricks, raising prices as usual. Moreover, with the current season deepening and the weather turning cold, the sales of cotton products and other items are increasing daily, providing an excellent opportunity for them to raise prices. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that the relevant authorities will devise countermeasures as soon as possible, to both increase the supply of goods and urgently restrain unscrupulous merchants from raising prices, taking both fundamental and symptomatic measures to stabilize commodity prices.

### Soviet Army Prepares for Winter Offensive

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - Although the Soviet military authorities have not announced the movements of Soviet troops on the Balkan front, especially within the former territory of Yugoslavia, the entire Eastern Front has entered a state of lull. According to a report by the United Press in London, military experts here believe that the Soviet army on eleven fronts will begin to regroup in preparation for a winter offensive. Thus, the Soviet army is thought to be entering preparations for a winter offensive.

### Bulgarian Army Under Soviet Command

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Sofia dispatch: The Bulgarian Ministry of War has announced that the Bulgarian government, at the request of the Soviet High Command, has decided to incorporate the Bulgarian army into the Soviet Third Ukrainian Front.

### Large Numbers of Foreign Troops Participate in Western European Operations

The Siegfried Line Defense Intensifies Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: After suffering heavy losses on the western border of Germany and in central Holland, the anti-Axis forces are now deploying more foreign troops in those areas. Canadian troops are responsible for attacking fortresses along the coast, while French, Belgian, and Dutch troop formations are fighting in other areas of the Western Front in Germany. Even Chinese and Czech soldiers have been integrated into the anti-Axis forces. According to reliable sources, conscription preparations for French men aged from 1897 to 1926 have been completed, and Holland has also begun recruitment measures. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - At the time of the annihilation of the British First Airborne Division near Arnhem in central Holland, it was anticipated that the anti-Axis forces would launch a major offensive in other areas. Now, a major offensive has indeed begun in the Aachen area on the German-Belgian border, with the intention of a frontal assault on the Siegfried Line. It is reported that the anti-Axis forces in the Aachen area have a considerable number of bombers, and the main force seems to be the British First Army, advancing continuously over an area of approximately six kilometers wide. At the same time, the American Third Army in the Belfort area of northeastern France is also preparing a general offensive. If so, the airborne attack near Arnhem can be regarded as the first stage of the decisive battle on the Western Front, and the ongoing attacks in the Aachen and Belfort areas can be regarded as the second stage. German counterattacks are also extremely fierce, so the two armies are in a stalemate on the Siegfried Line, and the war may turn into a long-term war. In this situation, the problem of winter supplies will not allow the anti-Axis forces to be optimistic about the future of the war, and Eisenhower's headquarters may also be well aware of this.

### New German Troops Deployed to the Front Lines

Fierce fighting broke out again in the Aachen area on the 2nd. Under the cover of armored units and heavy artillery, the anti-Axis forces captured the small village of Würselen, eight kilometers north of Aachen. The German army, which is defending the Rhineland industrial area, is launching a very fierce counterattack against this, and is continuously concentrating new weapons and personnel to attack in that direction. The German command announced that the German army on the Lower Rhine and the Ur River areas still maintains its advantage from the previous days, repelling the British counterattack. A fierce armored battle also took place in the area south of Nijmegen, but the front line did not change significantly. The fighting within Holland is temporarily suspended due to flooding. The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 3rd that Calais, on the Dover coast, has fallen.

### German Deputy Minister of Propaganda Declares Determination to Annihilate the Enemy in Speech

Buckingham Palace Hit by Missiles Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Roman, delivered a speech at a rally to boost morale in a major industrial city on the western border, stating that the dispersed German forces on the broad front of the current mobile warfare on the Western Front have been concentrated, and a new front line can be established, and efforts will be made to strengthen the western fortresses. Although the enemy has regained the superior position of the German army in France, the British and American armies have many difficulties and cannot achieve victory. The railway facilities in Western Europe were completely destroyed by the German army during the retreat. The German command must crush the enemy air force. If Britain believes that the German loss of the base for launching cruise missiles in France will eliminate the British air threat, this is completely wrong. The German command has never imagined that it could change the war situation solely with new weapons, but strengthening Germany's scientific forces and using the inherent ability of the world's most outstanding German scientists to overcome the country's difficulties is what should be focused on. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German army's new weapons attacks are still continuing. According to London news, the gardens of Buckingham Palace suffered considerable damage on the 2nd.

### Roosevelt Signs Post-War Bill

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports from Washington: President Roosevelt signed several bills yesterday to restore the US armaments industry to its peacetime state after the end of the war. These bills include the legal transfer of existing factories and their raw material inventories to private enterprises. The bills also prohibit soldiers from retaining their weapons to prevent unemployment.

### Chongqing Envoys Visit Roosevelt

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report: Gu Weijun, the chief representative of Chongqing attending the British-American-Chongqing talks, Wei Daoming, the ambassador to the United States, Shang Zhen, the head of the military delegation, and others, accompanied by the Undersecretary of State of the United States, visited Roosevelt at the White House on the 3rd, and the meeting lasted about ten minutes. The purpose of the visit by the Chongqing representatives and the content of the meeting have not been released.

### British and Soviet Trade Union Leaders to Hold Meetings

Berne, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports from the British capital: Six Soviet trade union leaders, led by Kuznetsov, chairman of the Soviet Trade Union League, have arrived in London. They will hold several meetings with British trade union leaders.

### Chiang and Hurley Discuss Concerns About China's Reddening

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing report, Hurley, the US military envoy stationed in Chongqing, recently held six meetings with Chiang Kai-shek. It is reported that Chiang told Hurley at the time that the Chongqing military authorities have deployed a large army in the northwest for the past six years to prevent the rebellion of the Chinese Communists in the border areas, and only now can they resist both the Communists and continue to resist Japan. If Britain and the United States ignore the current crisis in China, it is feared that the result of China's resistance against Japan will be the complete reddening of mainland China. In response, Hurley replied that the United States is not sitting idly by in the face of the crisis in Chongqing, but there is no other way to provide assistance at present except for airlift from India and Burma. Therefore, the United States' strategy on mainland China in the future will fundamentally change depending on the development of the Japanese army's operations.

### Reasons for the Breakdown of the Bombay Talks

Gandhi Issues Statement Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The main reason for the breakdown of the Bombay talks appears to be the issue of establishing an independent Muslim state, due to differences on the proposal to hold a national referendum. According to a Bombay dispatch, Gandhi issued a statement when he met with reporters on the 3rd, saying that the reason for the breakdown of the talks was that he did not agree with Jinnah's desire to immediately recognize the Northwest Frontier as a completely independent Muslim state. He also expressed hope that recognition would be obtained without first going through the procedures of a national referendum, but he was unable at that time to agree, in his personal capacity or any other capacity, to the proposal of millions of state residents regarding their own fate and future. Gandhi also argued that India should break away from British rule and gain freedom before changing the map, while Jinnah advocated immediate recognition of the partition of India. In addition, regarding the relationship between the Muslim state and the Hindu state, Gandhi hoped that the two countries would implement common policies so that they could coordinate with each other in defense and transportation in addition to administration, as this would not only benefit both countries but also not conflict with the sovereignty of both countries. In short, our talks were held in the position of friends, and I hope we can hold talks again.

### Question

The rice purchase period is approaching. What reforms have been made to this year's purchase policy compared to last year? I heard that the policy of "Inland Center-ism" has been confirmed. Is this true?

### Inland Center-ism

Answer: Although there were several reasons for the unsuccessful work last year, the most important reason was that the purchase began too late. In light of last year's valuable experience, the new office was completed in September this year, and the system of starting purchases simultaneously upon its inauguration has been completed. Therefore, at least in this respect, last year's mistakes will not be repeated. Preparations were completed approximately two months earlier than last year. We express our deep gratitude for the diligent assistance of the relevant Chinese and Japanese military and official authorities in various locations. Regarding the purchase organization and methods, it is true, as reported, that we are adopting a new policy of "Inland Center-ism." First, regarding the organization, we are establishing regional offices in each major purchase stronghold. These offices will serve as the center, concentrating the direct and indirect purchase power of various locations. They will be granted stronger authority and greater responsibility than last year, to fully leverage regional flexibility in purchasing. Second, regarding the price policy, we have also given special consideration to adapting to the organization to fully leverage its flexibility. Originally, when starting purchases, we published a public price and implemented purchases based on this standard. Unfortunately, the publicly set maximum price became the minimum price. As a result, we created a cocoon around ourselves and suffered from the price policy we had set. We have now given great consideration to this point and are adopting a flexible price policy that adapts to changes without changing its essence. However, this does not mean adopting a directionless price policy that follows the black market. A firm countermeasure has been established, but we will try our best to prevent unscrupulous merchants from exploiting this countermeasure. Third, regarding funds, we plan to fully respect inland flexibility. Each region has designated banks and designated merchants, with the offices as the center, so that funds can be utilized in a timely and appropriate manner. Methods to prevent the misuse of funds have also been prepared, and strict measures will be taken to prohibit funds from being used for improper purposes. As the inauguration period begins, the preparation of funds in various regions is almost complete, and purchasing merchants will not encounter financial difficulties when starting purchases. In short, based on last year's experience, considerable reforms have indeed been implemented in terms of preparatory work. Purchasing work is about to begin, and we wish it smooth success. However, one point must be clarified: the so-called "Inland Center-ism" is not "Inland Separatism." Shanghai and the inland are like the two wheels of a cart, and they should advance simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen communication with various regions. Therefore, we are reorganizing the headquarters and doing our utmost to provide as many conditions as possible that are beneficial to inland purchases from a national perspective. Question: How is the promulgation and implementation of the "Provisional Regulations for the Transportation and Sale of Rice and Grain in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" proceeding?

### Compliance with the New Regulations

Answer: These regulations are more powerful than the transportation and sales management policies for other materials. From the perspective of the nature of the rice and grain issue, this is a natural trend. With the united cooperation of military, official, and civilian personnel, we sincerely hope that the spirit of these regulations can be thoroughly implemented. These regulations stipulate that those who obstruct the transportation and sale of rice and grain shall be punished with imprisonment of up to ten years and fines of up to one million yuan. However, those who are working for the Rice Control Committee must earnestly implement these provisions themselves, and we are confident that the relevant authorities will provide special assistance. Furthermore, prior to the promulgation of the transportation and sales management regulations, the abolition of the original Shanghai Rice and Grain Passport measures had been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan. Some people criticized this as effectively prohibiting the transportation of more than eight kilograms of rice into Shanghai, which is inappropriate. Now, as the purchasing period begins, allowing the transportation methods that were adopted as temporary measures in the past to continue would clearly hinder the smooth progress of inland purchasing work and create conditions favorable to smuggling. We are confident that the abolition of the old passport measures is the proper action to take. Question: Since this spring, the rice and grain issue has become the focus of public opinion. Public opinion has high expectations for the Rice Control Committee, and those involved in the Rice Control Committee also place great hopes on public opinion. What are your thoughts on this?

### Humbly Accept Public Opinion

Answer: We should humbly accept constructive public opinion that focuses on the overall situation. However, public opinion that only sees the trees and not the forest is not beneficial to the Rice Control Committee or to the public. Rice and grain are different from other materials and are most closely related to the lives of the people. Therefore, people are naturally particularly concerned about the control of rice and grain. We hope that it will be constructive and not just pessimistic. We hope that people will pay full attention to constructive efforts. The opinions we hope to hear are those that are issued from the position of enabling the Rice Control Committee to succeed in its purchases. Question: Mr. Bing Shang, chairman of the Wheat Control Committee, has stated the key to establishing a unified, coordinated, and forward-moving system for the various control committees for the purchase of agricultural products. This seems to be an important issue from an overall perspective. What are your thoughts? Answer: Indeed. For example, wheat and rice have different purchase periods. Therefore, issues such as the warehouse problem mentioned by Mr. Bing Shang are perfectly reasonable. In my opinion, it would naturally be best if the agricultural product purchase agencies could be unified. There are also many issues that require cooperation, all of which are very important. Current countermeasures, such as holding liaison meetings, etc., are hoped to be realized.

### Rice Price Countermeasures

Question: What are your countermeasures regarding rice prices? Answer: The rice price issue ultimately boils down to the purchase issue and the distribution issue. If purchases can be successful, distribution can be strengthened. If distribution can be strengthened, the black market can be reduced. Now is the purchase period, which is also the time to practice the simple and clear theory that the rice price is the purchase issue. Furthermore, the rice price issue is extremely difficult to resolve solely through rice price countermeasures. Therefore, we sincerely hope to implement a comprehensive price stabilization policy. Question: Finally? Answer: At the inaugural meeting of the Jiangsu Office of the Rice Control Committee, I said the following words, and I will repeat them once again: We constantly keep the following four points in mind as we move forward with rice and grain control: ○ We purchase the rice and grain necessary in wartime to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. ○ We should treat the farmers' hard-earned crops with gratitude. ○ We, in view of rice and grain being the driving force of all material wealth, should always remember our heavy responsibility and honor. ○ We should carry out our work without selfishness and realize the true face of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Although the above is extremely abstract, we are willing to move forward to fulfill our responsibilities under this belief. (翔: Translated from the Continental New Daily, October 4th)

### Advisory Council Recommends City Government to Extend Rice Grain Movement to Allow Free Movement of Ten Stones or Less to Facilitate Rice Source

The Municipal Government Advisory Council held its eighth plenary meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. More than 20 committee members, including Yan Huiging, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and Wu Yunqi, attended. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government and heads of various bureaus and departments were invited to participate, and Mayor Chen also personally attended. Chairman Li Sihao first had Secretary-General Wu report on the establishment and work of the Municipal Tax Reorganization Committee, which was recently jointly organized by the Municipal Government and the Advisory Council. Next, Director of Finance Yuan Houzhi reported on the process of reforming special taxes, followed by Director Feng You of the Goods Distribution Office reporting on the current situation of rice distribution for civil consumption in the city. Subsequently, the Standing Committee, Li Sihao and Chen Binhe, finished their reports, and then the date of public sale was announced in the newspaper to avoid the public traveling back and forth in vain and rising rice prices. The Goods Distribution Office has replied that it will follow this advice and make improvements as much as possible. ○ Based on the resolution of the seventh meeting of the council, specialized committees on public utilities, public works, health, and small groups have been established. Letters have been sent to each committee member recommending specialized talent and requesting that each committee member widely seek recommendations and reply to the council, requesting the municipal government to appoint them. ○ The council's proposal that rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office should be handed over to the Goods Distribution Office for use by the citizens of the city has been approved by the municipal government. ○ The Standing Committee hosted the administrative inspectors of the first and second districts of the city and the magistrates of the seven counties. ○ The Standing Committee exchanged views with leaders from various sectors of the Allied nations on improving the municipal administration of Shanghai.

### Five Important Proposals Approved

Subsequently, five proposals were discussed: ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to petition the Central Government to restore the free transportation of civil consumption rice of ten stones or less in the city and to negotiate with the Rice Control Committee to find ways to facilitate the source of rice was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to petition the Central Government regarding the special distribution of rice to military police, civil servants, and civil consumption rice in the city, that the Shanghai Municipal Government and civil organizations should jointly establish a Shanghai Grain Public Warehouse to purchase rice from various places, was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to instruct the Finance Bureau to submit a monthly statement of actual income and expenditure of the city for the Council to keep confidential as a reference for research and improvement of finance was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal for actively evacuating the population of Shanghai was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to crack down on railway porters arbitrarily extorting money was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Construction and the Central China Railway Company for strict crackdown. In the end, a temporary motion was made to request the local police authorities in the city not to enforce the rule that more than eight kilograms of rice and grain cannot be freely moved within the blockade. Deputy Director Lu of the Police Bureau replied that there was no restriction on citizens transporting rice within the city blockade, but those entering the blockade from outside the blockade should also be carefully enforced in order to secure food for the people.

### Letter to the Municipal Government Requesting Extension of Rice Limit

Upon investigation, the amount of rice allocated to households in this city is insufficient, and most of it relies on peddlers. Therefore, the rise and fall of rice prices in this city directly affects people's livelihood. This council, representing public opinion, has repeatedly sent letters to your government in the case of not being afraid of being tedious. According to the Rice Control Committee's Rice Circulation Letter No. 2, after the abolishment of the method of applying for and issuing passports for rice and grain entering the city, according to the instruction of the Executive Yuan, rice prices suddenly increased. If the authorities cannot take effective measures, the livelihood problems of the people in this city will become more serious. This council hereby solemnly recommends that your government immediately telegraph the Executive Yuan, requesting that the method of free transportation of civil consumption rice of ten stones or less be restored, and to negotiate with the Rice Control Committee to find ways to facilitate the source of rice and grain to secure food for the people and stabilize rice prices. Please also notify the police bureau that, before the Executive Yuan decides to restore the free movement of rice and grain of ten stones or less, the crackdown on rice and grain movement should be temporarily carried out in accordance with the old rules to reassure people and maintain food for the people.

### Suggestions for Evacuating the Population

○ The Municipal Government, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, should issue a notice that any citizen who intends to leave Shanghai and return to their hometown may go to a designated place (preferably set up in several places) to register in detail the number of people, destination, residence permit number, and the number of pieces of luggage they are carrying. When transportation is available, it can be extended to Ningbo Station and various ports along the Yangtze River. ○ There should be restrictions on the registration period and the number of pieces of luggage. For example, those who register before a certain day may depart before a certain day, and those who register after a certain day may depart after a certain day. Each person should have a maximum of two pieces of luggage, each piece limited to a certain number of kilograms or cubic feet. ○ After the first phase of registration is completed, the Municipal Government should negotiate with the Central China Railway Company to determine a date for a special train to depart once. Tickets and luggage tickets should be sold by the Welfare Bureau together with the Central China Railway a day or two in advance, and fees should be charged strictly in accordance with the stipulated prices to prevent the occurrence of a black market. ○ After being registered and approved, citizens should report their household registration to the police station in charge before leaving Shanghai and ask the Baojia chief to provide a letter guaranteeing that the citizen will definitely not impersonate the name of returning home and secretly make a short trip, and soon secretly return to Shanghai. If such a situation occurs in the future, the Baojia chief should be responsible for reporting to the Welfare Bureau for strict punishment. ○ The Municipal Government and the Social Welfare Bureau should dispatch dozens of competent personnel, together with Central China Railway staff, to take care of and maintain order on the train.

### Crackdown on Railway Porter Extortion

It has been observed that in recent years, under the management of the Central China Railway Company on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, due to the wartime shortage of vehicles, it has been extremely difficult for passengers to purchase tickets. Any citizen who has traveled on these two lines can attest to this without the need for further elaboration. Recently, Central China Railway has implemented improved ticket sales methods and measures to crack down on black market tickets, which have been quite proactive, demonstrating the authorities' deliberate efforts to rectify railway administration and alleviate the hardships of passenger transport. However, the results have not yet been significant, and a group of porters has been added to the stations and trains. These porters wear black uniforms without any badges or numbers and specialize in extorting passengers, acting like wolves and tigers, demanding money in every possible way. According to what has been heard and seen in newspaper reports, the specific facts are roughly as follows: violating regulations, should be confiscated, otherwise they privately demand several thousand or several hundred yuan to settle the matter. Passengers who are timid fear causing further trouble and delaying their journey, so they have no choice but to bribe them, filling their insatiable greed. Even those who want to resist find it difficult to report them to their superiors because the porters' uniforms have no badges or numbers, and the passengers are crowded, so everyone dares to be angry but does not dare to speak out. ○ Under the aforementioned extortion situation, if anyone dares to resist being checked or refuses to pay an extra tip, they are often privately squeezed by three or four porters to a secluded place, such as a toilet, where they are beaten severely or stripped naked. As for the luggage and money they carry, being robbed of everything is naturally part of the deal. ○ All passengers carrying luggage, regardless of whether they are small vendors, are required to pay per item. For example, bringing a small package requires paying tens to hundreds of yuan, otherwise, the luggage may be cut to pieces with a knife. Such bad deeds occur on every train, without exception. It is understood that the current difficulty for passengers to purchase tickets and the widespread complaints are actually due to the shortage of coal and the reduction in the number of trains, which is not something that can be remedied by human effort. However, adding these porters, who are harmful and not beneficial, has never been seen to provide any service to passengers during their duties, but instead increases the various unexpected pressures on passengers. Although the Central China Railway authorities may have other intentions, it is not appropriate for outsiders to speculate. However, these obvious acts of misconduct must be reformed immediately to ensure the safety of travelers. Therefore, I dare to offer a few humble suggestions as follows: ○ In the current situation, Central China Railway porters only know how to extort and exploit passengers, and do little else. It seems that they can be quickly dismissed and disbanded. ○ If each train still needs to have porters to take care of passengers, then the uniforms should have clear names and numbers. ○ A large notice should be posted in each car, stating that only military police and conductors have the right to check tickets and luggage. Any other personnel, regardless of whether they are wearing uniforms, must not overstep their authority. If there is any deliberate violation, they can be reported to a designated location (such as the station master's office in the station or the conductor's office on the train). ○ More disciplined military police or police officers should be stationed at stations and on trains, and more senior railway staff should be dispatched to patrol at all times to stop illegal acts of violence. ○ If porters or other personnel are found to have the aforementioned violations again, they should be severely punished as a warning to troublemakers.

### ### National Day Charity Film Performance by the New United Association

Pre-sale of tickets to avoid crowding The Shanghai News United Association, in order to solemnly commemorate National Day and in view of the lack of funds for student aid and social welfare undertakings, has specially arranged a grand celebration charity performance. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will all be used for charitable purposes. The program includes three types: Peking Opera, Film, and Drama. Among them, the film convention will be held at 8 pm on the 10th at the Grand Cathay Theatre. The film has been decided as China Film's new film [Bitter Child's Paradise]. Ticket prices are divided into Honorary Seats (balcony) 500 yuan, Charity Seats (mezzanine) 300 yuan, and Public Welfare Seats (downstairs) 200 yuan. The association believes that the new film is being released for the first time, and it is also a holiday. At the same time, the cost is not high, and it is beneficial, so there will be no shortage of people. In order to avoid crowding when buying tickets, pre-sale will start at the Grand Cathay today at 10 am. It is hoped that people will be widely introduced to help it succeed, and impoverished children will benefit even more. At the same time, in order to popularize it, the association has decided to sell tickets for the charity performance of the drama (Sea Burial), which will be held at the Lyceum Theatre at 7:30 pm on the 11th, at half the current price of the theatre. It is hoped that readers will pay attention to it.

### Uniform Fare for Commercial Tricycles

In order to unify the fares for commercial tricycles, the Municipal Public Works Bureau convened a meeting on the 23rd of last month with 18 commercial tricycle dealers in the city, including Xiang Sheng, to discuss how to unify the fares for the entire city. The dealers were asked to fill out reports on rent and cost. After detailed and rigorous review and negotiation with the dealers, it was agreed that the fares for commercial tricycles in the city would be as follows: 100 yuan for a double seat for every half hour, with an additional 20 yuan for every five minutes exceeding, 70 yuan for a single seat for every half hour, with an additional 12 yuan for every five minutes exceeding. The daily rent for a double seat is 600 yuan, and the daily rent for a single seat is 450 yuan, unified throughout the city. If a driver extorts any extra fees, citizens can immediately report to the Public Works Bureau or the Police Bureau, and they will be punished according to the Measures for Punishing Drivers of Commercial Tricycles for Extorting Liquor Money. The main points are recorded as follows: Article 3: If it is a first offense, in addition to recovering the overcharged fare, the driver's license will be detained for five days, and the company's vehicle or vehicle license plate will be detained for five days. Article 4: If the offender does not repent after a second offense, in addition to recovering the overcharged fare, their driver's license will be revoked, and the company's vehicle license plate will be revoked. Article 5: If it is discovered that more than three drivers in each commercial tricycle company have extorted liquor money, indicating that the company's management is inadequate, the company will be suspended from business for three to ten days. Article 8: The above measures will be implemented separately by the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau.

### Crime Prevention Section Strictly Arrests Pickpockets

The city police bureau has previously launched a campaign to eliminate pickpocketing, mobilizing police officers and Baojia residents to cooperate and implement investigations. Recently, pickpocketing has become active again. In order to prevent and crack down on pickpocketing, the Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Office has dispatched more police officers to conduct strict investigations, and has also investigated those who have previously committed pickpocketing and have been released, in order to thoroughly eliminate it.

### Grand Opening of Western Music Program at the Sino-Western Music Convention

Since the performance of Chinese music on the 2nd and 3rd of the Sino-Western Music Convention, public opinion has been unanimous in its praise. Today, the entire program is Western music, with Mr. Li Weining and Mr. Chen Hong serving as consultants, and Mr. Liang Yueyin and Mr. Huang Yuanjun as the mainstays. Although Shanghai has not lacked concerts in recent years, solo performances are smaller in scale. This time, with the charity performance to help students, all parties have enthusiastically supported it, and more than 100 famous musicians have been mobilized, which is an unprecedented event. In addition to the 100-person chorus, famous musicians such as Ma Si-hong, Pan Mei-bo, Ge Chao-she, Ji Han-wen, Huang Yuan-yin, and Huang Yong-xi will all contribute their unique skills and play their works. Famous songs such as "Sea Rhyme," "Homesickness," and "Mountain in the Misty Void" will all be performed. It is now heard that in addition to the female three-part chorus, a male four-part chorus has been added, and the pre-sale of tickets is very enthusiastic.

### Embezzlement Case of Rice Administration Staff Concluded Yesterday

Sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 9th Rong Huiren, an office clerk in the Second Section of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Rice Administration, was entrusted by Bao Mingxiang, a Wuxi merchant, on June 20th of this year to transport 60 dan of rice from Henglin to Shanghai. Bao borrowed six citizen certificates from relatives and friends and entrusted Rong to obtain the Certificate for Moving Rice In from the Third Section of the Transportation Department of the Rice Administration. Rong did manage to obtain six Certificates for Moving In and handed them over to Bao Mingxiang. Rong did not receive any reward from Bao on this occasion. On July 9th, Bao had another 180 dan of rice that he intended to transport from Henglin to Shanghai and still entrusted Rong to find a way to borrow them, and agreed that whoever borrowed the citizen certificates would be rewarded with the sale of one dan of cheap rice. (The so-called cheap rice was about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan cheaper than the black market price in the city.) However, Rong only borrowed one citizen certificate, and the remaining 17 certificates were borrowed from colleagues by Rong through Section Chief Chen Yuan, and Chen was entrusted to explain to the colleagues that after the rice arrived in Shanghai, each person would also be able to purchase one dan of cheap rice. On July 10th, Rong handed the 18 Certificates for Moving In to Bao Mingxiang, and Bao transported 180 dan of community rice, totaling 130 bags, to Shanghai on July 15th. On July 15th, 38 bags were sold to the General Affairs Section of the Rice Administration and 91 bags were sold to the Central Trust Bureau at a price of 10,500 yuan per dan, and another 20,000 yuan was given to Rong as a subsidy for transportation expenses. Subsequently, the Municipal Economic Security Office learned of this and arrested Rong and the other two and sent them to the Procuratorate for investigation. The defendants all confessed. It was found that if more than 10 dan of rice were transported, the Rice Administration could purchase 30% at the official price. Rong Huiren, greedy for reward, borrowed 18 citizen certificates on behalf of Bao and fraudulently obtained transportation certificates, dividing 180 dan of rice into smaller quantities to avoid requisition. As a public official intending to obtain illegal benefits, he violated Article 214 of the Criminal Law. Chen Yuan borrowed the citizen certificates on behalf of others, knowing the situation but still participating in the fraud, and should be treated as a joint offender. Bao Mingxiang should also be punished in accordance with Article 216 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, Prosecutor Sun Jiajie of the District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 320, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case was opened for trial by the District Court last month. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Mi continued the trial in the Criminal Court. Each defendant only stated that borrowing citizen certificates to apply for rice transportation certificates was a common occurrence within the Rice Administration and could not be considered fraud. They also stated that according to what Yuan Ludeng, the former chairman of the Rice Administration, said in the Rice Administration's journal, it was a commercial autonomous group, so they were not public officials and could not be treated as public officials for the purpose of punishment. The court determined that the facts of the case were clear and scheduled the official sentencing for the morning of the 9th of this month.

### Air Raid Drill to Be Held This Afternoon at 1 PM

The city's air defense headquarters has scheduled a test of the alarm siren between 1:00 PM and 1:30 PM today (the 5th). Citizens are requested not to mistake this for an air raid alarm.

### Standardized Design for Alarm Flags

The relevant authorities in the city's air defense are actively designing standardized alarm flags for the Chinese and Japanese self-alert outposts. It is heard that the city needs more than 16,000 of these flags. The format is stipulated as triangular, and when used, they will be divided into three colors: green, red, and yellow. During alarm training, yellow will be used. During a formal alert or a warning alert, green will be used. During an air raid alert, red will be used.

### Personnel Changes at the Shanghai Income Tax Bureau

The vacancy will be filled by Luo Guangxu, Director of the Central Tax Police Headquarters, who was transferred by the Ministry of Finance and took office yesterday (the 4th). Internal personnel changes were also announced at the same time: Secretary Xu Songping, Chief of the First Section Xiao Cequn, Chief of the Second Section Wang Guan, Chief of the Third Section Zhou Jizhang, Chief of the Fourth Section Wu Jinghe, Director of the Xucao District Collection Office Wu Huancheng, and Director of the Hongkou District Collection Office Xu Xibao.

### Revised Ferry Schedule for Municipal Ferries

The Shanghai Municipal Ferry Company resumed operations on the 15th and 18th of last month. Because it is the busy farming season, there are fewer passengers coming and going. In order to save coal, the company has recently reduced the number of ferries to one, operating between Shanghai and Gaoqiao. The revised schedule is recorded as follows: Shanghai Departure Qingning Temple Departure Donggou Departure Gaoqiao Arrival 10:00 11:10 11:30 12:30 4:00 5:10 5:30 6:30 Gaoqiao Departure Donggou Departure Qingning Temple Departure Shanghai Arrival 7:00 8:00 8:20 9:30 1:00 2:00 2:20 3:30

### Grand Opening of the Nanjing Xingye Bank Shanghai Branch

Yesterday, the Nanjing Xingye Bank Shanghai Branch opened. From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Ningbo Road was bustling with traffic, and the house was full of congratulatory guests. More than 1,000 guests from all walks of life attended, including Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Tang Taomin, Wu Zhenxiu, Ye Fuxiao, Zhu Boquan, Wu Yunqi, Dai Ailu, Shao Shuhua, Sun Henei, Zhang Weiru, Jin Zongcheng, Zhou Zuomin, Lu Chongzhi, Xu Jianping, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Gu Ru, Zhang Deqin, Xu Maotang, Li Jinghan, Sun Yaodong, Xia Zongde, Sun Zhongli, Wang Xiaoshui, Zhu Puzhi, Ye Xuesong, Ji Yangzhou, Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Huang Jingqi, and Lu Feng. The gifts were extremely dazzling. On the day, deposits exceeded 320 million yuan, which was a rare sight in the banking industry in recent years.

### First Welfare Football Match Ended Unhappily Yesterday

Guangdong Business Community Buys Ball for One Million Yuan The first shot of this year's welfare football match, Donghua vs. Overseas Chinese Federation, was held at the Huangpi Road Racecourse Stadium at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, with no less than 10,000 people. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare performed the opening kick ceremony. During the match, Mrs. Ye Xuesong, Director of the Public Works Bureau, auctioned a charity ball, which was bought by Yu Zhijing, the representative of the Guangdong business community, for one million yuan, setting a new record for the auction of charity balls at the opening kick-off match. All proceeds from this match will be used to fund Guangdong charitable organizations in Shanghai. It is a pity that the match ended unhappily 15 minutes before the end, as the Overseas Chinese Federation team quietly left the field due to dissatisfaction with the referee's decision, resulting in no result and a great disappointment.

### Minor Conflicts Continue the Match

Yesterday, the autumn weather was clear and refreshing. At 5:00 PM, Minister Ding kicked off the match, and the match began immediately. Donghua was initially in a position against the wind, so the ball often hovered in the Donghua area. The Overseas Chinese Federation had a strong team this season due to the participation of three Tianjin tigers. Bao Jie and Bama repeatedly had opportunities to shoot, but failed to score due to their wild feet. Unexpectedly, 20 minutes before the end of the first half, a minor conflict broke out between the two teams due to a misunderstanding. Mai Nidi, the captain of the Overseas Chinese Federation team, immediately ordered all team members to leave the field, unwilling to continue the match, causing the match to stop. Fortunately, after persuasion from Minister Xi and others, they re-entered the field to continue the match. Before long, Donghua's Dai Lin, with the help of Jia Youliang, broke the record, and Donghua took the lead with one to zero in the first half.

### Mai Nidi Leads the Whole Team to Leave the Field

After the break, the charity ball was auctioned, and the match resumed. In less than five minutes, Donghua's Li Yao scored again, making it two to zero. The Overseas Chinese Federation stepped up its counterattack at this time, and as a result, Mama, Bao Jie, and Yatuomali scored three goals successively in 20 minutes, taking the lead with three to two. At this time, the performances of both sides were tense. Then, the Overseas Chinese Federation's guard committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was taken by Sun Jinshun. Because Mai Nidi moved his body before the referee blew the whistle, referee He Chunhui ordered a retake. At this time, Mai Nidi, the captain of the Overseas Chinese Federation team, again ordered all team members to leave the field, causing the match to stop again. Although various parties mediated, Mai still refused to budge. It is understood that players must absolutely obey the referee during the match. If there is any dissatisfaction, they must file a protest after the match. This can be said to be the spirit of sportsmanship. It is regrettable that Mai repeatedly used leaving the field as a threat. Fortunately, the audience was well-behaved and no accidents occurred.

### Recent Youth (1)

The next day's news was filled with the story of the nine heroic warriors, the gods of war.  Longfu thought of last night's dream and stared intently at the real person's photograph.  In his middle school days, when taking exams, the real person would often gently close his lips and stare straight ahead. After this expression, the real person would reveal his neatly aligned white teeth and smile slightly.

On the dry newspaper, a sound emerged; it was Longfu's tears, dripping onto the paper.

His eyes gazed at the photograph of the god of war for a moment. (Hey, who is this face?)

He recalled the people he had met at the Futian Inn. There were too many naval personnel, so there were many with the same name and surname, as well as similar appearances. Lieutenant Colonel Tangqian, Major Xintian—ah, he remembered, the lieutenant who loved to joke the most at the time was surnamed Tangqian. The lieutenant who led the tour of the submarine school was surnamed Xintian. Although it was impossible to fully recall the face from a single meeting, he felt as if he had seen their faces somewhere before.

(If the officers at that time were this group of people...)

Longfu was filled with boundless gratitude. Therefore, Longfu felt extremely regretful, why didn't he ask for a business card at the time, to remember their names and surnames firmly?

(No, even if it's not that group of people, as long as they are people who jointly performed this heroic feat with the real person, they are all immensely connected to me.)

He heard the radio broadcast announcing the promotion to colonel and learned about the background of the warriors, as well as the spirit of willingly embracing death, and admired them even more. Holding soda and chocolate, there was truly a sense of boundless freedom—whoever this young officer was who said these words, it was enough to represent the unwavering and righteous spirit of the nine war gods.

(Definitely not temporary courage. If it weren't for a persistent, death-defying determination, this state of mind would not be possible.)

Longfu imagined a room on an aircraft carrier in his mind, with people ready to set off, displaying joyful expressions. The scene of four officers quietly grinding ink, gathered together to write their wills, was also repeatedly reflected in Longfu's mind.

Decisive action avoids ghosts and spirits!

Naval Lieutenant Makoto Tani

Longfu stared intently at the traces of his confidant's handwriting that appeared in the newspaper.

(These two sentences were what the real person never stopped saying in his middle school days. This was originally a catchphrase of Colonel Kikuchi...)

It was as if he was vividly appearing before him again, this real person in a gray sailor uniform, a middle school student. He also seemed to see him gritting his teeth and tanning his back in Tianbao-de-hama. At the same time, there floated in his mind the earlier image of him clinging tightly to the iron bar at Yawata Elementary School. A small soul, actually accomplishing such great deeds—(148)

### Grandson's Full Month Celebration: Relatives and Friends Contribute Gifts to Charity

On the 2nd of the month, Mr. Li Guangyao's grandson celebrated his full month. Mr. Guangyao, mindful of the difficult times, did not wish to be extravagant. Therefore, he took the gifts from relatives and friends, along with ornaments, totaling 80,000 yuan, and donated an additional 20,000 yuan himself, totaling 100,000 yuan, and allocated the entire amount to charity to benefit relatives and friends. This included a donation of 40,000 yuan to this newspaper's scholarship fund, and 10,000 yuan each to the local poverty relief fund, medical assistance fund, orphaned children's fund, Shanghai Old People's Home, Holy Mother's Orphanage, and Yangjingbang Holy Mother's Orphanage. Mr. Li's dedication to public welfare is truly admirable.

### Charity Mooncake Sale Ends

The Guanshengyuan Food Company initially aimed to sell mooncakes for charity, with a target of 200,000 yuan, which was quickly sold out as scheduled, with 100,000 yuan each going to the Shen and Xin newspapers for scholarships and poverty relief. Subsequently, an anonymous gentleman purchased ten mooncakes called "[Peaceful Years]" for charity, totaling 100,000 yuan, and the Xin Yi Enterprise Company purchased one mooncake called "[Three Pools Mirroring the Moon]" for 6,000 yuan, totaling 106,000 yuan. 20,000 yuan was donated to the Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, and 86,000 yuan to this newspaper's Scholarship Fund and Poverty Relief Fund. Thank you received. The Guanshengyuan charity mooncake sale has now come to a successful conclusion.
