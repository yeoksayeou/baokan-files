### Streamlining Schools

We have consistently considered the issue of education to be among the most important, and have therefore repeatedly discussed and analyzed it, hoping to attract attention from all sectors, especially the relevant educational authorities, so that reform and advancement can be implemented.

On April 28th, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an outline of the recent streamlining of schools by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Our newspaper published a translation of it on May 20th. Four key points are worth emphasizing: Japan has designated the streamlining of schools as one of the wartime emergency measures, demonstrating that wartime emergency measures should include education, and that education should also have its own wartime emergency measures. As the center of this war, Japan's handling of the tension and complexity of various military fronts is unimaginable. Not only does it not neglect education because of this, but it also strives to streamline it with the greatest effort. The Ministry of Education, in order to compensate for the drastic increase in the operating burden of private schools due to this emergency measure, has decided to spend 2.5 million yen in the 18th fiscal year and 7.5 million yen in the 19th fiscal year, totaling 10 million yen, focusing on assisting the equipment of science and engineering departments. As for the urgent needs in science and engineering equipment, requests can be made for disbursement from the reserve fund in the future. This shows that education is a national undertaking, and the government should not only regulate private schools but also provide assistance when necessary. The adjustment of the number of students in each subject within the school should shift the original ratio of arts and sciences from 7.5 to 2.5 to an ideal ratio of 3 to 7. At the same time, as many as 17 new industrial vocational schools have been established, including aviation industry, gliding industry, radio wave industry, petroleum industry, and other industrial sectors. This shows that education must have a focus and cannot be left to fend for itself. If the technical talents urgently needed now and in the near future are not cultivated early, it will inevitably affect the lifeblood of the country. Schools with similar characteristics that are not urgently needed should be merged in order to save costs and limit the number of people. This shows that the purpose of schools is not to train high-level idlers, and the nature and number of schools should be determined according to needs. The result of shoddy work and mass production will not only destroy youth but also endanger the country.

Now, as the old school year comes to an end, with four months remaining before the start of the new school year, we provide the sentiments of others in streamlining schools for the reference of the education community. If the responsible authorities can recognize their responsibility for the educational undertaking they manage, they should immediately start planning and promoting it step by step, so that it can be implemented in the next school year. The sooner it gets on track, the sooner it will be effective and the less vitality will be lost. Those with aspirations will succeed. No difficulties are sufficient excuse for abandoning education. Precisely because there are various difficulties, greater efforts must be made, using passion and courage as weapons, in order to overcome everything, directly laying a new foundation for education and indirectly creating a new life for the nation.

Since the establishment of modern schools in our country, they have consistently failed to fulfill their due mission, and the corruption and decline of the education community are indeed most severe today. To discuss the ways of reform in detail is beyond the scope of this short article. Now, we humbly offer two points for discussion: How to ensure that teachers can truly fulfill their teaching responsibilities? How to ensure that students can truly feel the interest of learning? We hope that all relevant parties will first find answers to these questions and use them as a preliminary plan for streamlining schools, to be implemented at the beginning of the next semester. Then, on the one hand, verify its effectiveness, and on the other hand, seek further streamlining as soon as possible to complete the entire education undertaking that is suitable for China's national conditions. Then the future of the education community will be fortunate! The future of China will be fortunate!

### Enemy Landing on Biak Island - Japanese Army Engaged in Day and Night Combat - More Than Ten American Cruisers and Transport Ships Sunk and Destroyed

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on May 31st: On the morning of May 27th, a powerful enemy force landed on Biak Island, northwest of New Guinea. The Japanese garrison stationed on the island and the air force units in the area immediately engaged them in combat. Fierce fighting is still underway. The results of the Japanese air force's battle, as confirmed so far, are as follows: one enemy cruiser sunk, one transport ship sunk, six to seven small transport ships and others sunk, and three ships destroyed by bombing (one large), and two small transport ships.

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: A powerful American mobile force attacked Biak Island, 120 kilometers east of the Doberai Peninsula in New Guinea, at dawn on the 27th. They first carried out intense artillery fire and began landing at around 7:00 AM. The Japanese forces there immediately engaged them. In addition to daytime attacks, the Japanese army continued with night raids. After the enemy landed during the day, hand-to-hand combat never ceased, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. Especially on the 28th, the enemy advanced with amphibious tanks as the vanguard, and the Japanese tank units made a bold group assault, almost chasing all the enemy troops into the sea. The courageous spirit of the Japanese army is also recognized by the enemy, as stated in their war report: the resistance of the Japanese army on Biak Island against the island-hopping campaign of the American forces in the South Pacific theater is unprecedented. In addition, the Japanese air force in the area also cooperated with the ground forces in fierce fighting. They have been heavily damaging the enemy mobile force on the sea surface near the island and the enemy forces attacking the beachhead for days. To date, the confirmed battle results alone include one enemy cruiser sunk, one transport ship sunk, six or seven barges and others sunk, and three ships set on fire (one of which is large), and three barges. According to reports, the enemy landed on Aitafe and Dutch regions of New Guinea Island on April 22nd. The Japanese army in various places such as Wewak and Madang formed wedge-shaped positions near their landing sites to prevent the enemy from invading inland. From late April to early May, they defeated an enemy regiment near Islao, 50 kilometers east of Aitafe, forming a powerful circle on the side and rear of the enemy's attack route. As a result, the enemy suppressed western New Guinea. In order to consolidate its own position, they took this action to land on Biak Island. At present, the enemy forces that have landed on Biak Island number about one division. It is believed that the Japanese army on the island and the Japanese army in New Guinea will see their results in repelling the enemy increase day by day in the future.

### Rapid Progress of Japanese Army in Henan Province - Vigorous Advancement of Reconstruction - Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks

The Shanghai Army Press Department of the Allied Powers held its regular press conference yesterday (the 31st) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The spokesman of the Army Press Department spoke about the rapid success of the Japanese army in the Henan operation and the situation of reconstruction, as follows:

Miscalculation of Japanese Army Strength

First, he said that the Japanese army had achieved great success in the Henan operation, causing panic among the Chongqing government, and extreme embarrassment for Britain and the United States. The enemy was surprised by the rapid success of the Japanese army, and the remaining Chongqing army was in an unmanageable situation. Furthermore, while the Chongqing army was still in shock, the Japanese army began attacking the sixth and ninth war zones of Chongqing from both sides of Dongting Lake. The rapid action of the Japanese army made it impossible for the Chongqing army to predict, and they were even more panic-stricken. Initially, the Chongqing army miscalculated the strength of the Japanese army. Although they now understand that the Japanese army is strong and powerful, they still do not know the extent of the Japanese army's strength and its future movements. The Chongqing government feels that it is impossible to judge militarily. At present, after the great defeat, the Chongqing army is trying to find ways to recover and will make full preparations for future defensive strategies, but they feel deeply surprised by the Japanese army's counterattack.

Japanese Army First Pacifies the People When Attacking Henan

Then, the spokesman took the Japanese army's occupation of Lushi, located between Henan and Shaanxi provinces, as an example, saying that after the Japanese army occupied Lushi, the military objective had been achieved, and they completed the task and withdrew on the 20th, immediately restoring the original state. The situation was announced on the 28th. Unexpectedly, the Chongqing military spokesman concealed the facts, falsely claiming that Lushi had been recovered on the 28th. In fact, the Chongqing army did not know about the Japanese army's withdrawal until it was announced by the Japanese army eight days later. The Chongqing army was unable to judge the Japanese army's advance and retreat, which clearly showed a state of confusion. He also said that when the Henan operation began, the Japanese army immediately issued an announcement to pacify the people, the contents of which were: Exemption from people's taxes, Continued use of currency, When the Japanese army buys goods from the people, they will pay the price, Anyone, whether in the military or government, Chinese or Japanese, who commits illegal acts will be severely punished without exception, Those who engage in acts of collusion with the enemy will be severely punished according to military law. From the above content, it can be seen that there will be no harm to the good people and they will be protected.

Rapid Advancement of Henan Construction

He also said that the content of this announcement fully demonstrated the fair attitude of the Japanese army. All illegal acts are treated equally, regardless of whether they are committed by Chinese or Japanese people. Therefore, the general public welcomes and is very happy. The construction and reconstruction of Henan after the war has advanced rapidly. Taking Zhengzhou as an example, on the eighth day of the war, the Public Security Maintenance Association County Chamber of Commerce was established, and district offices were also established. So far, most of the general public have returned. Not only has public security been restored and administrative organizations are sound, but also in terms of people's entertainment and physical and mental well-being, many temporary huts have been built. Although the equipment is simple, they are full every day, which is surprising. In addition, local residents voluntarily arm themselves to assist the Japanese army. When Tang Enbo's army retreated, they were deeply concerned about the looting by Tang's army in order to protect their own property. When Tang's troops were stationed, they imposed harsh taxes on the general public, arousing resentment, fully exposing the people's disgust.

The People Dislike the Brutality of the Chongqing Army

The reason why the people are dissatisfied with the Chongqing government is not a result of one day, but a result of years of accumulated grievances. For example, a few years ago, the Chongqing army breached the Yellow River in Zhongmu County, causing the Henan floods to become a disaster, resulting in countless sacrifices. This brutal policy caused deeper resentment. At that time, the Japanese army attached great importance to water management work. The people were grateful to the Japanese army for benefiting from it. Therefore, when the Japanese army arrived, they were greatly welcomed and readily returned. Especially when the fighting started near Zhongmu, the public security was very good, and the enthusiasm of the Japanese army towards the people was also unexpected. In addition, the construction of railways and all reconstruction work were automatically cooperated and progressed very smoothly. Furthermore, when the Japanese army attacked Luoyang, they tried their best to avoid any loss to the area. There are many historical relics in Luoyang, and the Japanese army tried their best to protect them. Although there were difficulties in the combat aspects, they would never destroy them in order to speed up the attack. However, the Chongqing Tang Enbo army was different. They had no regard for anything, only knowing how to loot and set fires, stubbornly resisting, causing considerable damage to the city. The Japanese army deeply regrets this.

The Japanese Army's Spirit is Brave, Resolute, and Decisive

Regarding the success of the Japanese army's operation, the Chongqing government is also vigorously promoting that the reason for the Japanese army's victory is that it possesses a large number of mechanized units. The Japanese army did not refute this, but when possessing a large number of mechanized units, it must also have a resolute and courageous spirit. At the beginning of the war, it took 40 days, and the Japanese army walked 1,500 li, an average of 37 li per day. This brave and rapid spirit, that is, the mobility of the Japanese army, is the greatest reason for the Japanese army's victory. Therefore, the success of the Japanese army has become an ironclad fact, and the Chongqing government's propaganda is not worthy of attention. Since the Japanese army has advanced, the area is vast, and it must occupy points as strongholds. After occupying the base, it is inevitable that the Chongqing government will have small-scale guerrillas on the line. It is extremely difficult for them to occupy the area for a long time. Once the Japanese army discovers it, it will pursue and annihilate them. Furthermore, the Japanese army's withdrawal after completing the task of occupying Lushi was for the military purpose of encircling Jiang Dingwen's troops in Luoyang and cutting off Jiang's retreat routes in Lushi on the Longhai Road. When the Japanese army outflanked from Longhai Road, on the one hand, they occupied Lushi and Luoyang, making Jiang's army in a state of flux. Therefore, after Luoyang was occupied, Lushi had no military value and was abandoned. This is the strategy of encirclement and containment.

### American Aircraft Attacked Peiping - One Shot Down

Peiping, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has repeatedly engaged in guerrilla-like movements, and recently it has even affected the Beijing area. On the morning of the 30th, two North American P-51 fighters attacked. After a fierce attack by the Japanese side, one was captured, and the other was also repelled. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle. The Japanese North China Dispatch Army authorities announced the following on the night of the 30th: At 11:30 AM on the 30th, two enemy P-51 fighters attacked the northwest area of Beijing. One of them crashed near Hejin, Shanxi Province, and was captured by the Japanese army after landing.

### Kaifeng Celebrates - Allied Forces Capture Luoyang

Kaifeng, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The order in this city has been very good recently. The various circles here learned that the Allied Forces captured Luoyang on the 25th and held a celebration conference of all circles in the province on the 26th.

### Prince Yoshi Hushan Appointed as Councilor in China

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry announced on the 31st that it has appointed Greater East Asia Secretary Prince Yoshi Hushan as Councilor of the Embassy of Japan in China and concurrently as Consul General in Peiping.

### Italian Ambassador to China to Take Office

Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Italian government intends to appoint Subini as the acting ambassador to China. The Allied Power Japan has obtained the consent of our National Government on its behalf, and it is understood that Ambassador Su will soon come to China to take office. In the past, the diplomatic relations between China and Italy were extremely cordial. After the coup in Italy, due to various reasons, its embassy in China had ceased its activities. Now that the regime under the leadership of Italian Marshal Mussolini has been established, it has decided to send an ambassador to China. In the future, the diplomatic relations between China and Italy will inevitably become more cordial due to the arrival of the new ambassador. The entire nation, both government and people, place great expectations on this and extend a warm welcome.

### Talk by Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Horikiri

Manchuria, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Mr. Zenbei Horikiri, the former Japanese Ambassador to Italy, returned home via the Soviet Union and arrived in Manchuria on the 30th. He made the following remarks: I feel very emotional to have returned to Asia from Europe after completing my mission. The reason for Italy's failure is none other than the fact that there were people among the citizens who harbored war-weariness and defeatism, which allowed Badoglio's betrayal to succeed. On the other hand, there were also unsound elements among the Fascist cadres, such as Ciano, which was one of the reasons for the collapse. Furthermore, the defeat in Sicily and the surprise bombing by the American army gradually weakened the national organization under the leadership of Mussolini, leading to its collapse. Therefore, Marshal Mussolini is now concentrating his efforts and making every effort to reorganize his army in order to restore Italy to its former state. The streams of war-weariness have all succumbed before the Americans and the British. This is the primary reason for Italy's defeat. When I return to my country, I will trust that all the citizens of Japan, regardless of what happens, will not become defeatists. Although the Americans and the British are now calling for the formation of a second front, the Axis powers, centered on Germany, are focusing on the defense of the European fortress in order to counter the enemy's second front. If the British and the Americans land in Europe, they will surely be annihilated. They are fully prepared for this.

### Mr. Aramaki Inspects the Huaihai Area

Xuzhou, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Accompanied by Chief Advisor Ogura, Mr. Aramaki, in order to inspect the Xin Huaihai area, specially arrived here from Peiping by plane at noon on the 29th with his attendant Yoshioka. After a short rest, he earnestly discussed the economic situation of the Huaihai area with the liaison department, the Consulate General, the provincial government advisor, and financial relations. Afterwards, he visited various aspects. In the evening, he went to the provincial governor's residence and attended a reception banquet. The work has now been completed, and he left for Bengbu yesterday morning, the 30th.

### Good Wheat Harvest in North China

Peiping, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The wheat harvest situation in North China this year is showing a rare good harvest in recent years. According to the latest reports from various parties, the second harvest report of the North China Cooperative Enterprise Federation stated that this harvest has achieved unexpectedly good results compared to the first harvest in February this year. The total harvest volume is 1.48 million tons, almost doubling the first harvest. The results of increased harvest in other provinces are also quite good. This is due to the rainfall during the second planting period, which is the result of a richer first harvest. The insect pests in the northern part of Henan Province and the drought in a part of Shandong Province will also not cause any problems. The total increase in the harvest this time will break through the huge cloud of 1 million tons more than last year at the very least.

### Beijing Punishes Stores That Illegally Raise Prices

Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The eleventh committee meeting of the Beijing Committee for Punishing Illegal Price Increases decided to revoke the business licenses of nine stores, including Hangzhou Xinji Silk Shop on Zhonghua Road, and fine more than 70 stores, including Da Lun Silk Shop. The decision will be issued soon and will be enforced according to the decision.

### Heavy Rain in Northern Burma - Japanese Army Begins Mopping-Up Operation - Aerial Combat Near Imphal

Rangoon, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: After the enemy army dispatched air force units to land in northern Burma and rumored that they had recaptured northern Burma, the various elite units of the Japanese army fiercely attacked their flanks, and northern Burma suddenly had heavy rain. Therefore, the enemy there is mired in extreme distress. For this reason, the various units of the Japanese army began to act on the evening of the 23rd in order to completely mop up the enemy army there. According to the confirmed battle results, more than 200 enemy corpses have been confirmed, and five transport aircraft have been captured (one of which has not been destroyed), as well as a large number of other military supplies.

Rangoon, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese army fighter squadron in the Burma area carried out a large-scale air raid near Imphal on the morning of the 29th and fought with the enemy fighter squadron that came to intercept.

Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force Attempts to Cross the Nujiang River but is Thwarted

Rangoon, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force under Wei Lihuang attempted to cross the Nujiang River and invade northern Burma, but the various elite units of the Japanese army counterattacked on the spot, so the Chongqing army's attempt has been thwarted. For example, a powerful unit of the Japanese army ambushed 350 Chongqing troops carrying mortars near Hongmu Tree on the 24th at close range and inflicted a fierce attack. As a result, the Chongqing army abandoned 53 corpses, and the Japanese army also seized a large number of ammunition. Furthermore, about 250 Chongqing troops near the Manmo Bangbie Village on the banks of the Nujiang River have been defeated by the Japanese army since the morning of the 25th. To date, more than 40 corpses of the Chongqing army have been confirmed. Furthermore, on the 27th, the Chongqing army attempted to cross the river by raft at dusk in Baihua Ao Village, but was discovered by the Japanese army, which immediately attacked and annihilated them. In addition, a large unit of the Chongqing army carrying mountain guns and mortars at the Qiaotou side was defeated. On the 28th, the main force of the Chongqing army, the 193rd Regiment, was defeated, and the company commander and many others were killed.

### Ministry of Finance Decides to Strictly Crack Down on Illegal Financial Institutions - No New Banks or Exchanges Have Been Established in Shanghai Recently

Nanjing, May 32nd, Central News Agency Dispatch: It was previously reported that the Ministry of Finance had already cut off registration for financial institutions in Shanghai, but recently Shanghai newspapers often carried announcements of the founding meetings of certain banks or exchanges, or the formal opening date, and the establishment of branch offices. This reporter specifically inquired with the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance, who kindly informed me of the handling situation in the past, as follows.

It has been verified that the Ministry has already issued a statement on December 18th of the 31st year regarding financial institutions in Shanghai, cutting off registration. If it is a money exchange organized as a partnership, it has also been explicitly stipulated that it must be converted into a limited liability company before August 20th of the 32nd year, and because the names of financial institutions vary, the Ministry has also stipulated that they must no longer be named "Silver Company" or "Silver Bank," and that "Silver Company" and "Silver Bank" should be uniformly corrected. However, there are occasionally a few banks and money exchanges that have been formally opened recently or have established limited liability companies due to review and preparation matters, or that the date of their basic application was none other than before the cutoff date. The files are available and can all be reviewed. In addition, trust companies that also operate banking businesses have occasionally requested the Ministry to approve changing their name to "Bank" due to business reasons. There are no other newly established financial institutions. As for the applications from banks in various places to establish branches or offices in Shanghai, and the applications from head offices in Shanghai to establish branches or offices in this port, they have been rejected by the Ministry unless there are special circumstances. Recently, a Liangye Bank Co., Ltd., which established its head office in Changzhou, published an announcement in the Zhonghua Daily to convene a temporary shareholders meeting, stating that the bank was scheduled to convene a temporary general meeting of shareholders at 2:00 PM on May 18th at the bank's premises, located on Heng Street, Changzhou County, and that the Shanghai office was located at No. 33 Sichuan Road. As the bank's Shanghai office had not been submitted to the Ministry for approval and was established without authorization, it was a violation of the regulations. The Ministry has ordered the bank to cancel the Shanghai office immediately. If there are any similar situations in the future, they should be strictly cracked down on to uphold the law. Furthermore, the Shanghai Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise Bank and the Dazhai Money Exchange were previously revoked licenses by the Ministry due to mismanagement. The banks and exchanges have successively applied for reinstatement, but have not been approved. The Ministry is always paying attention to the operating status of financial institutions in various places. If there are any improprieties, they will be cracked down on from the rock bottom.

### Mr. Lin Baisheng Re-elected as Chairman of the Broadcasting Association - Kiyoshi Uchiyama and Others Appointed as Managing Directors

Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The China Broadcasting Association, which integrates the management of the national broadcasting industry, has been established for three years in an instant. The term of office of the first board of directors was originally scheduled to expire at the end of February, but because important association affairs needed to be sorted out by the old people, the Propaganda Department was asked to extend the term of office of the old board of directors. It is now learned that the association affairs have been sorted out, and recently, in accordance with the regulations, Lin Baisheng, Kiyoshi Uchiyama, Nai Lun Yuan, Kazuo Asano, Yin Kang Wang, Takeji Sasaki, and Renshou Zhong were elected as the second board of directors, and were submitted to the Propaganda Department for approval. Then, in the first board of directors meeting, Lin Baisheng was elected as the chairman. Kiyoshi Uchiyama, Nai Lun Wei, Kazuo Asano, and Yin Kang Wang are managing directors. Mr. Lin has been promoted to chairman since the establishment of the Broadcasting Association. For three years, he has led the association's business with exceptional enthusiasm, and has been re-elected each time, which is gratifying to all parties. Managing Directors Nai Lun Wei and Kazuo Asano were also re-elected from the old team. Yin Kang Wang was originally an ordinary director and director of the Central Broadcasting Station. This time, he was promoted to managing director and continues to serve as director of the station. Kiyoshi Uchiyama is a Japanese diplomatic expert who recently came to China from Thailand. On May 31st, he resigned from his diplomatic post to serve as the managing director of the association. It is expected that the list of directors for this session of the association will be even more well-organized, and will make greater contributions to the development of the broadcasting industry in the future. All parties have expressed intense expectations.

Washington to Convene Four-Power Conference; Roosevelt's Visit to England Undecided

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from London reports that U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday invited British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, and Soviet Ambassador Gromyko to a meeting. Afterwards, he also met with Chongqing Ambassador Wei Daoming. Hull told reporters after the meeting that the discussion was limited to the timing of convening a four-power conference. The British and Soviet representatives have been designated as Eden and Molotov, respectively. The U.S. side may be represented by himself, but this has not yet been decided.

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - A report from the German News Agency in Washington states that U.S. Secretary of State Hull revealed yesterday that a four-power conference between the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union will be held soon to discuss "the organization for maintaining peace." The date of the conference has not yet been announced. The report also states that President Roosevelt declared at yesterday's press conference that he hopes to meet with Prime Minister Churchill sometime between mid-June and January 20, 1945. It is said that this will happen before the end of his term (i.e., January 20th of next year).

### Italian Warfare Shifts Focus to the Western Flank; Germans Announce Withdrawal from Ceccano

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced that the focal point of the Allied forces' attacks on the Italian front on the 29th was the area from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Alban Hills. The Allied forces used large groups of tanks and infantry in their assault. Although they temporarily created localized breakthroughs in several places, the German army launched counterattacks to either contain or crush these breakthroughs. Allied forces attacked German positions on both sides of Ceccano with superior forces. After a valiant defense by German rear-guard units, the Allied forces succeeded in breaking into Ceccano.

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, the British and American offensive forces on the Italian front have shifted to the western flank. British and American aircraft squadrons relentlessly attacked this flank throughout Monday. The British 2nd Infantry Division, which had not been active previously, also launched an offensive against German positions in the far west under the support of an American tank division. After intense fighting, they managed to penetrate the foremost German defense line. The enemy's offensive in this area was anticipated, so the German High Command had already withdrawn the majority of its forces to pre-prepared positions. The German rearguard units also retreated to these defense lines. Allied attempts to break through the German line northwest of Apulia were thwarted by fierce German resistance. The advance southwest of Villamonte has regained previously held positions, thus averting all crises arising from sudden enemy advances towards Villamonte and Valletri. Allied forces, under the cover of strong tank units, invaded the town of Ceccano. In order to avoid a pointless and costly street battle, the German army withdrew from the town earlier, as the area is suitable for tank operations. The enemy is expected to continue its offensive.

### Italian Cities Suffer Repeated Air Raids

Milan, 31st (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that news from various parts of Italy indicates that the British and Americans have intensified their terror bombing of undefended Italian cities and towns. British and American aircraft again bombed Florence, and bombed four churches in the town of Chiaravalle, including the cathedral and St. Mary's Church.

### Forest Fire in Switzerland

Zurich, 31st (Haitong News Agency) - The Aletsch Forest in Upper Valais, located in the most beautiful mountain region of Switzerland and protected by the country for many years, is burning with a fire covering an area of 250 acres. A forest fire also broke out near Mill.

### Anxious Feelings Amidst Rumors of European Landings

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - Talk of a European landing operation has become increasingly prevalent recently. During a recent tour of France and the Iberian Peninsula, the reporter's conclusion is that, even if a landing operation occurs, it will not be as imminent as generally imagined. Currently, the topic of conversation everywhere is centered on a European landing operation. If the Allied forces were to land in France, Spain would not be unaffected. There is a sense of anxiety about the possibility of war. In France, the French people directly see the German's active preparations, so most feel that a landing operation will occur within a few days. The German army is constructing fortified gun emplacements along the banks of the Seine, and even the rear base of Paris is fully armed, so the tension among the citizens is not without reason. The transportation lines near Paris are extremely difficult to navigate. Resource conservation is currently being practiced in the area, but a large number of sleepers are piled up on both sides of the railways, so even if the railways are bombed, they can be repaired within a few hours.

### American Bomber Squadrons Attack Germany Daily

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency report: American bombers intruded into German airspace on the 30th and carried out terror bombings. Intense aerial combat ensued over central and southern Germany, and at least 45 enemy aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - German military authorities announced that 110 British aircraft were shot down during daylight bombing raids on German military installations and central Germany on the 29th. The cities of Leipzig, Poznan, and Cottbus in Germany suffered losses. In addition, German heavy bomber squadrons dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on the port of Portsmouth in southwestern England, causing fires.

### 5,000 Killed and Injured in French Air Raids

Paris, 31st (Haitong News Agency) - Parisian newspapers reported yesterday, based on reports from 20 French cities, that more than 5,000 people have been killed in recent days in Anglo-American terror bombings of French cities. According to the latest reports from the city of Nice, 20,314 people have been displaced, 316 have been killed, and 120 are missing.

### Provisional Military Government Formed in Ecuador

(Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, the Bogota government's intelligence agency reported that the government of Ecuador has been overthrown, and President Arroyo del Rio has officially resigned and fled to the Colombian embassy in Quito. British sources in Quito also report that the government of Ecuador has been taken over by Colonel Vogliano and a provisional military government has been formed. The new government announced that the Revolutionary Party has welcomed the current resident of Colombia and will transfer power soon.

### Only Localized Battles North of Iasi on the Eastern Front

### Japan and China Should Work Closely Together to Improve Agricultural Production - Professor Sasaki Gives Speech in Nanjing

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - Professor Sasaki Kiyozuna, professor at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and Doctor of Agriculture from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, was invited by the Shanghai Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao to give wartime academic lectures. He arrived in China by plane on the 18th to serve as a wartime economics lecturer. On the 28th, he was dispatched to Nanjing, where he gave academic lectures at National Central University. His answers to questions raised by reporters are as follows: (Question) What is the current state of agricultural production increase in Japan? (Answer) The general situation is very good. Taking rice cultivation as an example, its output compared to China's output is about 100 to 65. This ratio is obtained by calculating the output before the war and the recent output. The reason why Japan's output is higher than China's is that Japanese farmland fertilization is better than China's, and at the same time, attention is paid to the improvement of varieties and the replacement of improved varieties to increase yields. Secondly, the farmers' organizations in rural Japan are well-organized, and they can cooperate and divide labor to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The production of other miscellaneous grains is also very good. The most important thing is the planting of wheat, followed by the planting of sweet potatoes, because this crop can grow even on barren land, and its vines can be used as feed for livestock, maximizing benefits. (Question) What new discoveries have been made in agricultural production technology by the Japanese agricultural research community recently? (Answer) There are no significant advances in agricultural production technology at present, but there are many in theoretical aspects. (Question) How is food distribution handled during the current Greater East Asia War? (Answer) The national food distribution is progressing very smoothly. Everyone can obtain the necessary food because Japan's social organization is sound, and the neighborhood associations are equivalent to China's Baojia system. From a personal standpoint, Dr. Please give your opinion on the current agricultural production increase work in our country. But in the future, China's agricultural production increase should pay attention to both quality and quantity. When I visited the Shanghai Morning Market in Shanghai, its farming methods were very similar to those in Japan. At that time, I almost suspected that I was in the Kyushu countryside in my own country. Therefore, the improvement of agricultural technology and the selection of excellent varieties in China are no less than in Japan. Finally, he solemnly told the reporter that China has a vast territory and species, and its area is very large, occupying an important position not only in East Asia but also in the world. In the future, we should seek the improvement of crops, and the agricultural technology talents of China and Japan should work closely together to increase agricultural production in order to jointly build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In Japan and this time when I came to your country, I lectured in various schools, and I always declared this idea to all students, so as to move forward together and complete the Greater East Asia War.

Holding a Symposium

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - The Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao jointly organized a wartime academic lecture and specially invited Japanese agricultural expert Dr. Sasaki to come to Nanjing to give academic lectures yesterday. Yesterday (31st) morning, Mr. Sasaki visited the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry. At noon, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry, together with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, hosted a banquet for Sasaki at the Nanjing United Cooperative Society on Zhongshan East Road. During the banquet, there was a lively exchange of toasts, and the host and guests were very happy. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, a symposium was held at the same location, hosted by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The participating institutions included the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, the Central Agricultural Industry Institute, and dozens of other personnel involved in production increase work. First, Chen Yanshan inquired and introduced, saying that Mr. Sasaki is a famous agricultural expert in the allied country and has a special understanding of animal husbandry, so he has special expertise in breeding and other work. Then Sasaki explained the central issue of the symposium, the improvement of livestock in our country, and separately explained the breeding of cattle, chickens, etc., exchanged opinions with each other, and the discussion was lively, and the meeting did not end until about three o'clock.

### Second Invitation to Mr. Tomomatsu to Lecture

The "Wartime Academic Lecture" jointly organized by Xinwen Bao and this newspaper hired scholars and experts as lecturers. The first invitation was to Japanese agricultural expert Dr. Sasaki, who came to Shanghai and then to Nanjing in mid-May to lecture. The second invitation was to Japanese economics expert Mr. Tomomatsu Entai as a lecturer, who arrived in Shanghai on May 29th and is currently scheduling his lectures. The following is a brief biography and conversation of Mr. Tomomatsu:

Tomomatsu Entai

Professor, born on April 1, Meiji 28 (1895) at 2-2 Miyoshi-cho, Fukagawa-ku, Tokyo, currently 50 years old. Graduated from the Religious University (now Taisho University) in Taisho 8 (1919), and graduated from the Faculty of Literature of Keio Gijuku University in Taisho 13 (1924). In the same year, he became a professor at Keio Gijuku University and retired in Showa 12 (1937). In Showa 2 (1927), he became a professor at Taisho University and has been there ever since. From Showa 2 (1927) to Showa 6 (1931), he studied in Germany and France on behalf of Keio Gijuku and the Jodo sect. In Showa 8 (1933), he founded the International Buddhist Association Meiji Buddhist History Compilation Institute. In Showa 9 (1934), he established the All Japan Truth Movement Association. In January 19 (1944), he reorganized the Shotoku Taishi Hogo San'yokai and has been in charge of the association ever since. His works include Research on Buddhist Economic Thought, Introduction to Buddhism, Buddhist translation of Introduction to Buddhism, Honen, Commentary on the Dhammapada, and others.

### Conversation

This is the third time I have visited Shanghai, and I am very honored. Since the Shanghai War, although Shanghai has sacrificed many precious lives and properties, the central area of the city has not changed much from 20 years ago. The people on the road are still bustling, showing plenty of optimism and hope everywhere. This time I have gained all kinds of understanding and assistance from Chinese and Japanese friends, which I did not have in the previous two times, and I feel particularly happy.

This time, I am honored to be invited by Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao to serve as a lecturer for the "Wartime Academic Lecture" and have the opportunity to be effective in culture. What I want to talk about is the ideological significance of the Greater East Asia War. Since January 9 last year, you have been our comrades in arms, and engaged in dealing with the conclusions of the Chinese Revolution. China cannot complete its independence and autonomy without experiencing this kind of suffering. Chinese youth cannot hope to take shortcuts easily. The Greater East Asia War in progress is a war that takes blood as the price and realizes nationalism in our democracy. China has made great contributions with its 5,000 years of culture. What is this high Chinese culture itself? We should reflect on it. It is definitely not a formal return to the classics. We must restore China.

Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, and Zhuangzi

The great spirit led by them. Seventy-five years ago, Japan completed the Meiji Restoration, which was a reflection of the classical spirit of Japan. China is now cooperating with "the peoples of Greater East Asia" in a friendly manner, and its purpose is to restore China's original classical spirit to national consciousness. The construction carried out by China in the past was not "Chinese China", but "Greater East Asian China" or "Chinese Greater East Asia". At nine o'clock, scholars, thinkers, especially monks and laymen who are related to Buddhism, should discuss with each other, and at the same time, we are willing to have those who are related to Christianity discuss this issue from a religious standpoint, so that they can conduct concrete research on the "knowing Japan" and "knowing China" movements, the Pan-Asian thought, and the new cultural order of the Co-prosperity Sphere. The above is just a brief description of my thoughts. I would like to ask you for your advice.

### Shanghai Civil Air Defense Further Established; Japanese Air Defense Command Announces Results

The city's air defense training ended on the 29th and 30th. Regarding the results of this training, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced the following on the 31st: This civil air defense training was conducted continuously on the 29th and 30th. Although the citizens were in bad weather, they worked hard and enthusiastically throughout the training, making Shanghai civil air defense more established. It is a great pleasure.

However, as the training items gradually became more advanced, the defects also increased accordingly. Judging from the training results this time, it can be seen that Shanghai's air defense is still far from perfect. In particular, although the various civil guidance agencies and those engaged in training have worked hard, there are still many people who watch and look around as if they were watching a play, which is regrettable. In terms of light control, the results are the worst compared to the previous training sessions. In the future, houses with poor light control will be thoroughly strengthened. It was found that some of the usual control regulations were revised last time, causing the general public to mistakenly believe that light control has been eased. In fact, the last revision was for usual control. In addition, warning control and air raid control are still as strict as before and will never be eased. I hope citizens will not misunderstand.

Training Items

The various training items are described as follows: Evacuation training: (A) After the air raid alarm is issued, the evacuation actions are generally good. However, there is still a need to speed up slightly. (C) Many citizens still sit leisurely in trams and cars without getting off and evacuating to appropriate places. Thorough implementation of various light control methods. This item is the worst compared to previous training sessions. In particular, there are still many light leaks in skylights and other places. In addition, major company offices and other places have light leaks due to the negligence of duty officers. In the future, these poorly controlled houses will be severely punished, and their guidance will be thoroughly strengthened.

(A) The distinction between usual control, warning control, and air raid control, and the transfer of each control, has not been fully implemented. It is hoped that citizens will fully study the types of these three controls and clearly recognize them. In particular, on the morning of the 29th, the warning control was implemented, and after the air raid alarm was lifted on the night of the 30th, the warning control until the end of the training was the worst. Usual control only requires obscuring with curtains, while air raid control and warning control cannot be so simple. The distinction between these points should be fully recognized.

(B) During warning control and air raid control, the gaps in the black curtains leaked light. In the future, the edges of the black curtains should be tightly covered.

(C) The control of the sides and backs of high-rise buildings and the skylights of general houses is still poor and should be provided with sufficient shading equipment.

(D) Some people do not take light reduction measures, but only turn off the lights, hoping to get by for a while. Therefore, each defense group should thoroughly crack down on this.

(E) Flashlights should also be properly dimmed.

(F) Recently, the control of the headlights of cars has been very poor. For example, the shading paint has peeled off and should be repainted. In the future, inspections should be carried out at any time, and those with poor control should be thoroughly cracked down on. Traffic control is generally good. However, the following points should be noted:

(A) After an air raid alarm is issued, those who have no urgent business should not go out. However, there are actually many people walking around. In the future, everyone should stay in their own area and wait for orders.

(B) Under warning control and air raid control, cars that do not comply with traffic rules and have not been authorized drive arbitrarily during the air raid alarm period. During the air raid alarm period, all cars are not allowed to drive, except for "military and public use" and those holding a "non-emergency" vehicle special pass. In the future, if this happens again, the driver's license will be revoked. Work and rescue training are generally good. However, the following points need to be considered: (A) The first priority of work training is to quickly discover the damaged places, so the communication between the work team and the Yinbu should be sufficient. (B) Regarding rescue training, all citizens should be familiar with the necessary hemostasis methods, because whether proper hemostasis can be performed before being sent to the hospital is of great importance to the life of the injured. Various emergency communication links and alarm transmission methods are generally good and can achieve the expected purpose. However, the communication methods for notifying the situation of being bombed in large buildings are not yet appropriate. The person in charge must quickly study and adopt communication methods such as "whistle" signals and "hand" signals. In addition, the civil guidance agencies must quickly sort out the communication materials. To sum up, it can be seen that there are still many aspects of air defense that need to be studied and improved. The training matters that need to be carried out in each area have been notified separately for research, so as to establish a civil air defense capability that is integrated between China and foreign countries. In addition, I would like to express my regret for those who were injured in accidents during this training, and I hope that the general public will pay more attention to preventing accidents in the future. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the various guidance agencies and those who are engaged in training for their active efforts under bad conditions.

### Ambassador Tani Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki previously returned to his country on official business, and the matter has been completed. He returned to Shanghai by plane from Tokyo at 4:30 PM on the 31st.

### Provisional Measures for Food Rice Management in Shanghai Municipality Promulgated; Other Detailed Rules Still Under Discussion

The "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," which has been deemed essential, was officially promulgated by the Executive Yuan on the 24th of this month. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, after consultation with the Rice and Grain Control Committee, drafted the "Provisional Measures for Food Rice Management in Shanghai Municipality," consisting of fourteen articles, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The original text is now published as follows:

These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 4 of the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai."

For the purpose of implementing these measures, the Municipal Government shall order the registered rice shops to establish procurement groups in each administrative district, with one group leader per group, to be designated by the rice rationing agency.

According to the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," all rice merchants procuring rice through the Rice Control Committee, rice shops registered with the Municipal Government, and nearby farmers who intend to transport their harvested rice into the urban area for sale must apply for a rice transportation passport. (Applicants who have signed contracts should attach a copy of the contract for review.)

The Rice Control Committee shall, on the day of issuing the passport, record a copy of the date, location, and quantity stated on the passport and submit it to the Municipal Government for verification.

Rice storage warehouses shall be designated by the Municipal Government. In principle, all rice transported into the urban area by procurement merchants shall be stored in warehouses designated by the Municipal Government. After the government purchase, it shall be sold to registered rice shops. Nearby farmers shall sell the rice they transport in to rice shops registered with the Municipal Government.

The Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee shall send personnel to be stationed in the designated warehouses to jointly handle the weighing and quality inspection of rice when it is moved from the transport boats into the warehouses.

The rice purchased by registered rice shops must be sold according to the rationing standards, and the procedures shall continue to be handled in accordance with the record-keeping method.

If the quantity of rice purchased by each rice shop is insufficient to meet the needs of its designated rationing area, the shops shall communicate with each other under the supervision of the Municipal Government to ensure that the rationing process is not affected.

The purchase price shall be paid according to the market price, except for rice purchased by the Rice Control Committee, which shall be calculated separately. (The market price shall be determined and announced jointly by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee on a daily basis.)

The rationing price shall be appropriately lower than the purchase price in the preceding article and shall be stipulated separately. The losses shall be adjusted by the Rice Control Committee.

All rice transported into the city must be transported through the designated entry points for the purpose of statistics and distribution. (The management measures for the entry points will be formulated separately.) Rice transported in through non-designated entry points shall be treated as privately owned rice and shall be subject to punishment.

If any rice shop or procurement merchant engages in hoarding or smuggling, they shall be punished in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations upon discovery.

In principle, the funds required for purchasing rice shall be prepared by the procurement merchants and rice shops themselves.

These measures shall be reviewed by the Rice Control Committee and the Municipal Government and then approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. According to the aforementioned provisional measures, they are based on Article 4 of the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai." As for the detailed rules, they are being discussed and drafted by the responsible parties of the Municipal Government's Rice Control Committee in consultation with other relevant parties. These rules will include specific regulations on rice types, entry points for transportation, locations for issuing passports, purchase prices, purchase prices in various regions, dates for issuing rationing permits, and future rationing policies. They are expected to be finalized and implemented soon. It is hoped that rice merchants will fully understand the authorities' measures and cooperate with the government as much as possible to improve the rice procurement and transportation methods and ensure an adequate supply of food rice. This is a matter of vital importance to the entire livelihood of the city, and all parties should work together to assist in this endeavor. The authorities will strictly punish, in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations, any unscrupulous elements among the rice merchants who engage in hoarding or transporting private rice for exorbitant profits, and will not be lenient.

### Five Organizations Including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Recommend Improving Grain Administration and Wire a Report to Deputy Director Zhou of the Executive Yuan

The Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Dealers' Association, and the News Association, in view of the serious poverty situation in this city's rice and grain problem, jointly wired a report to Deputy Director Zhou of the Executive Yuan on May 18, presenting several points of difficulty for grain administration reform. The Living Necessities Subcommittee of the Municipal Political Consultation Committee also made a similar suggestion to the mayor. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" on May 24. The wire sent by the Citizens' Welfare Association and other five organizations to the Executive Yuan is copied below:

(Omitted above) Respectfully reported, currently when farmers are planting and preparing stable crops, rice prices in various places continue to rise sharply, and the future of people's food is extremely serious. The association and others all believe that it is appropriate to discuss both temporary and long-term measures. It is necessary to immediately improve the rice and grain control measures. I respectfully suggest the following based on limited views: To take into account farmers' costs and facilitate procurement work, it is necessary to reasonably increase the price of rice and grain purchased. The internal members and staff of the Rice Control Committee should be adjusted to appoint suitable talent to ensure a holistic view. The authority to purchase rice and grain should in principle be unified. The Rice Control Committee's offices in various places should be abolished as appropriate, and the responsibility for procurement work should be assigned to the local county governments to assist in the process. Procurement merchants in various places who are unable to fulfill their duties should have their contracts terminated promptly. Contact transportation agencies with vigor to assist in the Rice Control Committee's efforts to clear rice and grain. Issue a general order to all relevant agencies to strictly prohibit extortion and obstruction of incoming grain. Secondly, in recent weeks, rice prices in Shanghai have risen dramatically, more severely than in other cities and inland areas. If there are no emergency measures, prices will continue to rise, causing public panic and further hardship for the people. As a temporary expedient, without hindering the Rice Control Committee's original plan to purchase grain, obtain the cooperation of the Rice Control Committee and secretly request special permission to establish a Shanghai Rice Bureau to manage rice and grain for the purpose of rationing to households. On the one hand, it is proposed to promptly promulgate measures to reward increased rice and grain production and to protect farmers' costs and profits in order to reassure farmers and achieve practical results in increasing production in timely and concentrated ways. I respectfully request your review and implementation. I am eagerly awaiting your instructions.

Regarding the temporary rationing of cotton cloth in this city, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a plan to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. All implementation measures have been carefully considered by the Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Government. The silk merchants have decided that all processing procedures have been prepared, and sales will begin on June 1st and end on November 30th of this year.

Short Commentary

### Hoping School Colleagues Cooperate in Requesting Donations from Readers

The application procedures for the seventh session of the reader scholarship of this newspaper start today. In order to improve service efficiency, this newspaper has specially set up a reader scholarship office to be responsible for handling the scholarship. The application and selection methods are detailed in the reader scholarship news column of this newspaper on May 30th. The application and selection methods for this session have been slightly changed from previous sessions. The main change is that in previous sessions, the newspaper directly handled the application and selection, but in this session, the schools where the students are studying will be responsible for registration and preliminary review. Therefore, the principals and teachers of the schools where the applying students are studying will have more work to do and will spend more time and energy. Standing from the position of supporting the poor and cultivating talents, we believe that all school colleagues will be able to fulfill their responsibility to care for the excellent and poor students of their schools and fully cooperate with the reader scholarship office of this newspaper. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all school colleagues in advance.

Secondly, the current sharp rise in prices is an undeniable fact. The amount of scholarship funds used in this session will be even greater than in the previous session, and we are even more willing to expand the scope of students receiving assistance. Therefore, the ideal is to raise 10 million yuan, but the current accumulated amount is less than a quarter of that. I would like to appeal to all those who have given in the past to continue to do their best to donate, so that those who seek to earn a living can continue to receive assistance, and new students can be promoted to higher education. Small efforts add up, and a small number of large sums are all welcome. May all readers contribute to its success.

The audience reached an unprecedented record of over 30,000 people. Dr. Yan Huiqing performed the kickoff ceremony. The result ended in a 1-1 draw. After taking photos, the match began. Tianjin kicked off. Tianjin United's goalkeeper's ball blocking skills were excellent. Both sides engaged in a tug-of-war. Twenty-five minutes into the game, Shanghai United was too careless and was counterattacked by Tianjin United, who scored a goal. In the second half, Shanghai United replaced Bao Jie with Han Longhai and moved Zhang Lin to defense. Portuguese player Oliveira replaced Zhang. After this adjustment, Shanghai United launched a major offensive, and Li Yao and Huang Mao cooperated to score a goal, resulting in a draw. Although Shanghai United's offensive was strong, Tianjin United relied on its goalkeeper's amazing artistry to turn danger into safety. Sun Jin was penalized twice with a penalty kick, but both were saved.

Yesterday's broadcast time was 6:40 PM.

### The Value of Disease Prevention and Treatment

— Yen Fu-ch'ing

Every summer, epidemics are prevalent, especially cholera, sunstroke, dysentery, diarrhea, and so on. Moreover, the climate is hot and favorable to the activity of insects, and mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and lice are rampant, so the diseases transmitted by these insects also increase, such as malaria, typhus, and so on. At this extraordinary time, all kinds of living needs are difficult to meet, many people live in one house, the location is narrow, the air is polluted, and the diet is simple and insufficient in nutrition, which greatly affects our resistance. Therefore, the prevalence of summer diseases this summer is to be expected. In view of this, the health authorities of this city launched a summer health campaign, which will be held for a week from June 1st to 7th. The purpose is to arouse the public's attention to summer health. In addition to holding a health exhibition, this health campaign also includes broadcasting lectures to instill public health knowledge, and in order to implement health policies, there are also cleanliness campaigns and mosquito and fly eradication campaigns.

The general public mostly believes that the task of doctors is to treat diseases. We only seek medical treatment after we get sick, and we have no other requirements for doctors. This view is wrong. It must be known that the entire medical cause includes three major parts: treatment, prevention, and health care. Prevention and health care are even more important than treatment, because going to a doctor after getting sick often costs a lot of money and may not have good results. If you can hire a doctor as a consultant on weekdays to guide you on how to prevent and maintain your health, then you will spend less and benefit more. According to an estimate by a famous medical scientist, if one yuan is used for treatment, the effect is only worth two corners, if it is used for prevention, the benefit is worth three corners, and if it is used for health care, the benefit is at least five corners. In terms of the degree of progress in modern medicine, there are few diseases that can be diagnosed accurately and have effective treatments, but most can be prevented. Here, I will give three examples of typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, and diphtheria as follows:

Typhoid fever There is no effective treatment for typhoid fever in the beginning. Many patients often die, and even if they are lucky enough to recover, they have been bedridden for months, and the cost of seeing a doctor and taking medicine is not cheap. However, if you get vaccinated on weekdays, you can guarantee that you will not be infected with this disease within two years.

Pulmonary tuberculosis Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most widely transmitted disease. According to recent statistics, 90% of the world's people are infected with pulmonary tuberculosis, and 27-30% of children under the age of 15 are infected with this disease, but in those with strong resistance, the bacteria are latent and will not break out. Once the physical strength is weak and the resistance is reduced, they can be revealed. Therefore, those infected with pulmonary tuberculosis must pay attention to hygiene, rest, breathe fresh air, and eat nutritious food to increase their ability to resist disease and prevent the disease from breaking out. If pulmonary tuberculosis has developed, then there is only rest, recuperation, and attention to nutrition. Other methods only have an auxiliary effect, and they must be carried out in the early stage to have the hope of recovery. If the disease has entered the late stage, then even if a lot of money is spent, it will be ineffective.

Diphtheria Before the invention of serum therapy for diphtheria, most patients did not survive, and the disease was acute and fierce. They often died within a few hours or a day or two after contracting the disease. Now, not only is there an effective treatment, but it can also be prevented. In addition, it can also diagnose whether individuals have the ability to resist diphtheria. If it is found that someone does not have the ability to resist this disease, methods can be taken to increase their resistance and prevent them from being infected. If unfortunately infected, blood therapy can be used to heal it, but treatment that is too late is often ineffective, and even if it is cured and the poison enters the brain, it can cause paralysis. Therefore, even diphtheria therapy, which can be said to be the most reliable, must be treated as early as possible to be effective, and prevention is the best policy.

There is a cleanliness campaign in this health campaign, so I will discuss the main points of cleanliness. American hygienist Rosenau once said that if everyone can pay attention to cleanliness, human diseases can be reduced by half. Cleanliness includes personal cleanliness, clothing cleanliness, food cleanliness, public places cleanliness, etc., especially family cleanliness is the most important, because it has the greatest impact on our health. If everyone can wash their hands before meals, they can reduce the transmission of many diseases.

Cleanliness can be divided into two types: tangible and intangible. In the alley, garbage is piled up, and filth is everywhere. Everyone can see it, and everyone knows that it is unclean. This is tangible uncleanliness. However, there is also uncleanliness that cannot be seen with the naked eye. It looks clean, but in fact it is most harmful to human health because it is not noticed and kills people without them knowing it. From a health point of view, cleanliness can be divided into two categories: surface cleanliness and actual cleanliness. In other words, the standard of cleanliness lies in the presence or absence of germs, not in the appearance. Whether the surface is clean or not can be seen with the naked eye, but whether the actual cleanliness is or not can only be observed under a microscope.

There are many types of summer diseases, mainly cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. These diseases are mostly caused by unclean food and drink. From a health point of view, these diseases are the most filthy of all diseases. Because the germs are contained in the patient's feces, and after flies bite, their claws carry feces. Then they fly to food or tableware and land on it, leaving the excrement on it. If we eat this food or use this tableware to hold things, we will be in danger of contracting the disease. Although this method of transmission can still be seen and thought of by us, so it can be prevented, but the invisible method of transmission is not paid attention to and is not prevented, so it is the most severe. For example, if a well is located next to a vegetable garden or a toilet, after rain, the water flows into the well, and because it has been filtered through the soil, it looks quite clear, but in fact it contains countless bacteria. If we drink this well water or use it to wash utensils, we will be in danger of contracting the disease. However, if it is boiled or disinfected, it can be drunk with peace of mind. There are many disinfection methods, and the simplest and most effective one is to add one part of bleaching powder to one million parts of water to disinfect and kill bacteria.

To prevent the transmission and prevalence of summer diseases, we must pay attention to cleanliness, as mentioned above. In addition, vaccination is also important. I often see people who are unwilling to get vaccinated because they cannot bear the pain of the reaction, but if they think of the pain of moaning in bed after getting sick, or even the risk of death, then the mere reaction is not worth mentioning.

### Message to the Citizens for the Summer Health Campaign

Fellow citizens! Today is the opening day of the Health Movement Conference. When the word "health" is mentioned, everyone who has been educated can probably understand it, and everyone knows that it is important; however, what is the current state of health in our country? What is the health level of the people? According to experts' estimates, the mortality rate in our country is about 30 per thousand, which is twice as high as in European and American countries. The annual number of deaths is about 12 million, of which at least half die prematurely because they do not know "health." May I ask, how much does the country and individuals lose?

Some people think that "health" is a luxury and should only be enjoyed by the rich. In this year of not having enough to eat or wear, how can the poor do it? In fact, the poor are often faced with unsanitary living conditions due to economic constraints. Therefore, those who have property should pay even more attention to health. Moreover, there are many health practices that do not necessarily require money, such as having a certain regularity in all aspects of eating, drinking, and living, practicing all sanitary habits, and regularizing life, all of which are easy to do without spending money.

Fellow citizens! The above-mentioned regularization of life is only personal hygiene. Further, it should be extended to public hygiene. Promoting public hygiene should start from hygiene morality. Although promoting public hygiene is based on personal hygiene, there are still many citizens who only care about themselves and do not care about public morality. They pay attention to hygiene on their own bodies, but they can ignore it in their families, or they pay attention to cleanliness in their families, but they do not care about public environmental hygiene. They arbitrarily pour garbage, feces, and sewage in their homes on the roads, which hinders public hygiene. This kind of behavior is too childish. As a result, it not only hinders others, but also harms themselves, because the occurrence of infectious diseases is caused by many filth and garbage. Especially in summer, the countless bacteria contained in these garbage multiply quickly after the sun evaporates them. After being transmitted by mosquitoes and flies, infectious diseases are naturally easy to occur. For example, once cholera occurs, it spreads very quickly. Once one person gets sick, it can immediately spread to neighbors and even a village, a county, or a group.

The purpose of the health movement is to promote citizens' attention to public health, thereby reducing diseases, so that every citizen has a healthy body, increases their lifespan, and goes on to do great things for a prosperous country and a strong people.
