### Hygiene

The municipal health bureau is observing this month's 1st to 7th as Hygiene Promotion Week, and will hold a Hygiene Sports Meeting and a Hygiene Exhibition. The opening ceremony was grand and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. At the same time, the First District Public Works Office of this city also stated that it will strictly prohibit the construction of illegal buildings and try to reduce the flooding in western Shanghai. Detailed information from both parties can be found in the local news section of this newspaper from May 31st to June 2nd. As we are now promoting hygiene work, I would like to offer some humble suggestions for consideration.

Since August 1st of last year, citizens have placed great expectations on the entire structure of the municipal government. Therefore, there was enthusiastic public opinion at that time, with numerous articles and proposals, either outlining general principles or discussing detailed rules, in the hope that significant progress would be made within a reasonable period after the unification of municipal administration, and that the old appearance would be changed. What was mentioned in the editorials of this newspaper on August 14th and December 14th of last year has finally seen some motivation for realization today, especially with both agencies working hard in their respective positions, which makes the general public feel infinitely gratified and willing to wholeheartedly support them.

The people must be guided, so that it becomes a habit and is easy to promote. Therefore, publicity work, with its guiding and enlightening effect, must not be abandoned. However, governance is not about talking more, but about practice, and especially about focusing on effective methods. When seeing the defects revealed in reality, we should first deeply investigate the hidden roots. If the government uses its power to cut off the roots and block the source, then the appearance will be refreshed, and the expected goals will be achieved in a short period of time. This is more effective and efficient than requiring citizens to make incomplete efforts on their own. For example, the area around the garbage cans in various neighborhoods is currently littered, and the can walls are full of holes and the lids are missing. Even when building neighborhoods, the location of garbage cans was not taken into account at all. Household A pushes it in front of Household B's door, and Household B moves it under Household C's window, which leads to endless quarrels. Although this is a small problem, there should also be regulations to ensure that the placement and storage of garbage cans are the responsibility of someone, and that violations of the regulations will be subject to public sanctions, which may be more effective than the nagging of the neighborhood chief. This is just one example, and the rest can be deduced by analogy.

There are also things that citizens cannot do, but the authorities can issue orders in the morning and see results in the evening, which should not be neglected because they are trivial. For example, garbage is dumped on the main streets and thoroughfares before dusk, and garbage trucks are still running in the streets at noon, with dust flying and foul odors spreading, and the same is true for the work of sewage trucks. Such situations can be immediately eliminated if the hours are regulated and strictly enforced by the responsible departments. As for the accumulation of dirt that no one cares about for days, the dereliction of duty should be punished as soon as possible.

Closely related to hygiene requests are the issues of housing, water, and fuel. Five or six people in a family are confined to a small room, with insufficient air at normal times and no way to isolate when sick. Water and fire have the function of removing dirt and killing bacteria. If the amount used by each person is not up to standard, or the price is too high and they cannot afford to consume it, then even if they are well aware of the importance of hygiene, they will feel that it is easy to know but difficult to do. Only the authorities can explore and correct these subtleties, which citizens cannot do alone.

From the start of hygiene promotion to the day when the health goals of every citizen are achieved, there are many urgent measures to be taken. We hope that our authorities will deliberate and implement them after this week, which is what the citizens dare to hope for in addition to celebrating and following them.

### Remnants of Enemy Landings at the Tor River are Being Swept Away by the Japanese Army; Headquarters Announces Battle Situation in New Guinea

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 1:50 PM on the 4th: A strong enemy force landed near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea in mid-May. The Japanese army in the area immediately contacted the Japanese army retreating from the vicinity of Hollandia. Since May 27th, they have repeatedly attacked the enemy forces landing at the mouth of the Tor River, defeating most of them, and are currently continuing to attack the remaining enemies.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy army landed near Hollandia and Aitape on April 22nd. Due to the resistance of the Japanese army, they could not form a looting strategy. It is reported that the enemy army is trying to land in various parts of western New Guinea, centered on Hollandia and Aitape. On the morning of May 17th, an enemy division, with 60-70 tanks and armored vehicles and 50 trucks, built a bridgehead on the west bank of the Tor River, 200 kilometers west of Hollandia. The Japanese army in the vicinity immediately cooperated with the Japanese army retreating from the vicinity of Hollandia to actively prepare to attack the enemy army. On the morning of the 27th, they launched a annihilation battle, first launching a surprise attack on the enemy army near Tem, 12 kilometers east of the mouth of the Tor River, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy abandoned 300 bodies. About 800 enemy troops near Tem were attacked by the Japanese army, and they fled to Wakde Island on the sea in a state of chaos in ten boats. Another part of the remaining enemy troops fled into nearby tribes. The Japanese army is currently pursuing the defeated enemy. On the 30th, another Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack on the main force of the enemy army occupying Arara Village, 8 kilometers east of the Tor River, and the left bank of the Tor River, breaking through the enemy's tank formation and minefield, and rushing directly into the enemy's position, continuing to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and finally driving the main force of the enemy army near these places to the water's edge on the morning of the 2nd, and thoroughly destroying it. Therefore, the strong enemy force that attempted to cut off the Japanese army's battle line in New Guinea and land, except for a part that fled to Wakde Island, most of them sacrificed at the water's edge. One of the bridgeheads used by the enemy army as a base for frog-jumping operations was also wiped out. The Japanese army is currently continuing to sweep away the remaining enemies. The Japanese army units on the New Guinea front annihilated about one regiment of the enemy army near Urau, 50 kilometers south of Aitape, from April 16th to early May. On May 3rd, they annihilated the enemy landing force at Yakamel, 30 kilometers east of Aitape, and are currently preparing to attack Aitape. The Japanese soldiers are singing victory songs one after another, and their morale is extremely high. They are continuing to launch an offensive against the enemy forces that landed in Biak, and the progress is also very smooth.

### North China is Working Hard to Increase Production to Assist the Greater East Asia War: Remarks by Supreme Economic Advisor Mr. Ogura

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – After inspecting the economy in North China, Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, met with Chinese reporters at 4:30 PM on the 3rd to release his observations on the economic situation in North China and his impressions of the trip. The following is a record: I went to North China on May 19th and returned to Nanjing on June 1st, for a total of twelve days. I was in Tianjin from the 21st to the 23rd, and spent the rest of the time in Beiping. Recalling that last September, I participated in the Mengjiang inspection group as a Japanese, and passed through Beiping, but I was unable to stay for long and conduct a detailed inspection. This time, I had the opportunity to conduct a detailed survey and inspect the economic situation in various parts of North China, and I was able to meet well-known figures in the economic and cultural circles of North China. I deeply feel that this trip is of great significance. The economic situation in North China and Central China may be different due to different local conditions, so it is impossible to make a general observation. However, North China is also a part of China, under the rule of the National Government. In terms of the entire economic policy, the same pace should be adopted. The biggest problem in China at present is stabilizing people's livelihood, so that human resources and material resources can be used to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. This time, I saw that North China is rich in coal, iron, and other mineral deposits, which contribute greatly to the war, so I feel very happy. However, if North China is to fully exploit its underground resources, it must rely on increased food production in Central China to supply North China and complete this mission. This is my opinion. Everything in North China is going smoothly this year. The Henan campaign and agricultural production have performed very well. At the same time, insightful people in North China have gained a deep understanding of the Greater East Asia War, and the same is true for ordinary people. This is what excites me the most. Because we are currently in a period of war, the harassment of the Eighth Route Army has a slight impact on security measures. Promoting increased production through the joint efforts of military officers and civilians can ensure the smooth progress of the work. In short, North China has achieved excellent results in increasing production, and a large amount of coal is being produced. The reason why it cannot be transported south to supply Central China is due to transportation difficulties. In the future, all parties should work together to achieve good results. While I was in China, enemy planes attacked. The enemy is well aware of the importance of North China, so they tried to disrupt it. However, because the authorities are fully prepared, if the enemy tries lightly, they will fail. While I was in North China, I was treated to joint banquets by Chinese and Japanese people, and we had candid conversations. I deeply feel that the hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people are in harmony and without gaps, and their friendly relations have made leaps and bounds.

### The Current Situation in the City of Rome Under the Thunder of Cannons

Landing in Anzio, Trying to Invade Rome Unsuccessfully: The City of Rome Under the Thunder of Cannons. The Anglo-American forces that landed in Anzio, trying to invade Rome but failing, have launched a major offensive from the southern front since the 15th, seeking to open a road to Rome. Rome has indeed become a "capital on the front line." The correspondent of the Reader News Agency reports on the chaotic situation under Rome:

Food Problem and German Assistance

As everyone knows, Rome is the capital of Italy and the seat of the Holy See, the pilgrimage site for Catholics all over the world. This special situation gives Rome a supra-national character. In order to save this historic city from the flames of war and to respect the intentions of the Holy See to protect the holy sites, the Republican government declared it a non-defended city last September, abolishing all military facilities and withdrawing government agencies. The German army also observed the intentions of the Holy See, abolishing military facilities and passing through without hindering, respecting this non-defended city. In this regard, despite repeated appeals from the Holy See, the Anglo-American side still invaded Rome's airspace and bombed it. Recently, they have particularly focused on the city of Rome and its surroundings, day and night, with the aim of killing civilians and disrupting their nerves without any defense. However, the repeated bombing of the city's surroundings is intended to cut off the city's transportation with the outside world and block the road for food supply.

Therefore, the biggest daily difficulty for every citizen at present is the food problem. According to the national census of last December, the population of Rome is close to three million, while before the war, when the population was less than one million, food was already insufficient, so the current difficult situation is conceivable. The value of food is beyond imagination, wheat and noodles are more than a hundred times higher, and rice is forty yuan per kilogram. This may be because the front line is only thirty kilometers away and materials cannot enter, but on the one hand, the Anglo-American side does not recognize Rome as a non-defended city and carries out inhumane attacks, hindering the food supply. The trauma of the citizens of Rome being betrayed by Badoglio is also difficult to recover for a while.

The Holy See is deeply concerned and has sent its own trucks to the suburbs to search for food. These cars are marked with white and yellow signs, with the word "Vatican" written in red. However, these cars were also bombed by Anglo-American aircraft during the day. On April 29, thirty-five trucks returning to Rome from Florence were bombed at 1:00 PM, suffering considerable damage. Moreover, the number of monks and drivers who died or were injured due to previous attacks was also quite large. The German army is very worried about this situation and is trying to help within the possible scope. Previously, when the German army entered the city, they first solved the food problem and established a distribution organization. Today, after the German army's withdrawal, they are providing their own military trucks to make up for the shortage. Since April 31, they have allowed all food and charcoal to be transported into the city of Rome, and they endure all kinds of inconveniences, allowing the citizens to use military roads. Terror and Order

Speaking of bombing, there have been an average of three air raids per day recently, and the sound of cannons has never stopped. Because it was declared a non-defended city in advance, there are no complete air defense facilities, and there are many deaths and injuries, so people are very afraid of air raids. Since the gas company was bombed on March 3, charcoal has been used in kitchens. Most of the charcoal comes from cutting down street trees in the suburbs. In the former fascist era, although materials were said to be scarce, a complete rationing system was adopted. In the Badoglio era, the black market continued. After Badoglio's betrayal, it was difficult to buy materials even on the black market. This situation makes citizens unable to help but recall the golden age of fascist politics. Following the reopening of the southern front, the tendency to recall that era has become increasingly strong, and how to deal with this reality of war has become a problem. The Anglo-American side is engaged in anti-German propaganda and says that there are major riots and frequent strikes in the city of Rome, but in fact, such a situation does not exist at all. The daily newspapers only carry reports of murders and robberies. It is inconceivable that a metropolis with a population of three million, only thirty kilometers away from the front line, has no riots or organized strikes, and the lives of the citizens are stable.

Although Rome only has more than 13,000 African police officers, former military police, and former police officers guarding it, it is very orderly.

The Regeneration of Rome

The difficulty of food and the proximity of the front line have awakened the citizens of Rome. Therefore, the citizens of Rome have organized themselves to ensure food and maintain law and order. The German side has tried its best to avoid interfering in Rome's internal affairs, and the Italian Republican government has also given Rome special attention. On May 7, Interior Ministry Vice-Minister Bai Yulu Serbinuo was appointed as the highest commissioner of Rome. Under the guidance of [name], he began to discuss emergency measures for Rome. If Rome lives as a healthy city in complete order, Catholics all over the world will be at ease! If this is the spiritual center of a regenerated Italy, it is a very gratifying thing for the Three-Power Alliance as well.

In present-day Rome, the lush green leaves of early summer thickly cover the roads of the streets, and the brisk wind blows. In this bright and clear May in Rome, the people return to their true hearts and are burdened by their hometowns. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun, May 23rd.)

### Chongqing Admits Luoyang Has Fallen

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing authorities are still trying their best to conceal the fall of Luoyang. Later, because the fall was exposed, they said that the connection between Luoyang and its outer suburbs had been cut off, and the situation was unclear. According to a telegram from the Associated Press on the 3rd, a Chongqing military spokesman finally admitted the fall of Luoyang and explained it as follows: The Chongqing army that had been defending Luoyang broke through the Japanese army's outposts on May 25th and has now withdrawn to the area outside the city of Luoyang, but the troops are still surrounded by the Japanese army.

### The Current State of Historical Sites in Luoyang and Other Places

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – After the fall of Luoyang, a special correspondent of the newspaper went to the Longmen Grottoes and the White Horse Temple and described the current state of the two places as follows: The Longmen Grottoes are located 28 kilometers south of Luoyang and have a large open-air stone Buddha. The area of the Buddha is about 30 meters and has been eroded by wind and rain for more than 1,000 years. There are countless caves of various sizes in the cliff, running through them. However, among the Buddha statues in these caves, some are standing, some are sitting, some have their noses broken off, and some have their arms broken off. There are also some caves that lack such Buddha statues. According to nearby residents, in the past, when Americans visited this place, they cut off the noses and arms of the Buddha statues and transported them to Shanghai. The White Horse Temple is a famous temple located 30 kilometers outside Luoyang. There is a pagoda standing, and large temple halls and halls are built nearby. Before the coldness and depression, there was a notice posted by a Japanese military officer, which said that the White Horse Temple is the oldest temple in Chinese Buddhism. Since ancient times, many famous Japanese have come to worship Buddha. The pagoda is the center of residents' respect, and it is hoped that all soldiers will protect it. Therefore, when the Japanese army entered the vicinity of the city, it sent soldiers to guard the temple. The monks of the temple also expressed their beliefs, saying that most Japanese people have a deep understanding of Buddhism and are truly great. Now, I realize that the Japanese army is trustworthy.

### The Naval Department is Recruiting the 6th Class of Military Officer Students

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – In order to cultivate technically proficient naval personnel, the Naval Department is organizing the recruitment of the 6th class of military officer students and the 1st class of senior merchant marine officers. The registration period is from the 5th to the 20th of this month. Any young person who is physically strong, over 17 years of age and under 20 years of age, and has a high school or junior high school diploma or equivalent qualifications, may register. Registration locations: Nanjing Naval Department, Shanghai Central Naval Academy, Suzhou First Area Army Base Department, Guangzhou Fortress Command, and North China Weihaiwei Fortress Command. Those who wish to apply should register at the above locations.

### Ten Kilometers from Rome: The Battle Reaches Its Peak; American Tank Units Make Dense Attacks

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Mr. Bragner, a correspondent of the German News Agency on the Italian front: American troops dispatched a large number of powerful tank units and launched a dense attack between the Alban Mountains and the Lepini Mountains. Yesterday, the battle reached its peak. Because the enemy's mechanized units continued to pressure, the German front line had withdrawn. In the evening, the Anglo-American vanguard was completely blocked ten kilometers south of Rome. Their attempt to break into Rome has failed again due to the German army's stubborn resistance. The German army's defensive artillery fire was fierce, forcing the American troops on the front line to be replaced by reinforcements in the rear. It is not yet known whether the city of Rome, which has no defenses, has become a battlefield today.

Germany Does Not Station Troops in Rome to Preserve It

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Pope Pius XII issued a statement on the 2nd, hoping that the flames of war would not spread to Rome. The German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 3rd regarding this matter, saying: The Pope's broadcast severely criticized the anti-Axis forces' combat methods, which is unprecedented. Although the Pope did not explicitly name the culprits for the unregulated combat methods, it can be understood who the culprits are by looking at the evil acts of bombing Rome, destroying the Monastery of Monte Cassino, and other cultural monuments. In addition, the Pope has issued a statement on the anti-Axis forces' refusal to allow the transportation of food by the Via Chietti convoy. Now, in order to avoid the effects of war on Rome, the German authorities have taken special measures, namely, that there are no German troops stationed in the city of Rome.

### Anti-Axis Air Force Ravages All of Europe

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Although the date for the Anti-Axis forces to establish a second front in Europe has been delayed, their air force's bombing of various parts of Europe has not stopped, and has even intensified recently. According to news from various places, the main air raids from the 2nd to the 3rd are summarized as follows: Anti-Axis aircraft raided various parts of Germany on the 2nd, and 27 aircraft were shot down by the German air defense forces. On the night of the 2nd, several British aircraft attacked Westphalia, Germany. The Anti-Axis air force bombed various parts of the Balkans and various cities in the two countries of Romania and Hungary. An American air force team bombed Calais and Boulogne on the northern coast of France with a formation of more than 500 heavy bombers. Another team bombed the Paris area again. It has been confirmed that the losses in the area were 93 deaths in Paris alone.

### Reasons for the Resignation of the Iraqi Prime Minister

Ankara, 4th - Central News Agency Dispatch - Haitong News Agency: The resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister Said and the succession of Basha Shis have shed light on the internal political situation in Iraq. It is understood that Ba is a spokesperson for those in Iraq who are close to the Arab faction, and currently serves as the honorary chairman of the Baghdad Arab General Assembly. It is said that there are two reasons for Said's resignation: 1. The Iraqi government has encountered various difficulties in dealing with the Kurdish people, as the Kurdish people have the Soviet Union as their backing. 2. The Iraqi people admire the policies adopted by the Kuomintang, especially Jia Nani and his party members, while Said criticized Na Nani.

### US to Build Air Force Base in Soviet Territory

Ankara, 4th - Central News Agency Dispatch - Haitong News Agency, United Press: The United States began preparing to establish an air force base within Soviet territory in February of this year. Ground personnel are traveling from England and Italy to the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf. Several American bases have already been built in the area vacated by the German army, and American nurses will arrive in the Soviet Union soon.

### Bank of Communications to Establish Agricultural Economic Office

Nanjing, 4th - Central News Agency Dispatch: This year is a year of increased production, and increased agricultural production is a particularly important part of the increased production campaign. To meet the needs, the Bank of Communications previously organized an Agricultural Economic Office to handle rural finance and other businesses, in order to develop the rural economy and thereby promote increased agricultural production. Since its establishment, the office has successively signed interim measures for jointly promoting agricultural finance with the China Youth Labor Protection Corps, Commercial Savings Bank, and others, in order to promote agricultural lending. In order to promote the manufacturing of silkworm eggs, the cultivation of cotton, and the development of salt reclamation and other industries, it has consulted and signed joint interim measures with relevant departments. In order to understand the mutual lending situation in various production areas, it has successively sent personnel to Dongtai, Yancheng, Jiaxing, Shanghai, Kunshan, and other places in Jiangsu to investigate various enterprises. The total number of loan applications reached 16,684,300 yuan. After investigation and verification, all loans will be issued. Currently, the office has established offices in Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Nanjing, which have officially opened for business. It is currently planning to organize an office in Dongtai. It is generally believed that the development of the bank's business will be of great help to agricultural production in the future.

### Propaganda Department Director to Broadcast Guidance

Nanjing, 4th - Central News Agency Dispatch.

He also praised the efforts of the Buddhist community in this city in promoting culture in recent years, such as the publication of the Universal Buddhist Canon and the Huayan Commentary initiated by Sheng Youhe, and the translation of the Southern Buddhist Canon, considering them to be great contributions to Chinese Buddhism. After the speech, attendees successively expressed their opinions. Chen Binhe also suggested that the Japanese Buddhist community should provide more assistance to Chinese social undertakings to relieve the suffering of the people. The symposium ended at 5:00 PM.

### University Students' Academic Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

After the Municipal Baojia Committee was ordered to reorganize, Wu Songbi, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, was appointed as the Chairman of the committee, and Chu Ying, Director of the Second Police Bureau of the city, was appointed as the Vice-Chairman. The reorganization has now been completed, and the committee has moved from the Jinjiafang site to the original site of the former Eighth District Office on Taishan Road, as the Jinjiafang site was not sufficient for its use. The relocation was completed yesterday, with only a small number of personnel remaining to handle all document handover matters.

### Unified Handling of Wheel Registration; Public Utilities Bureau Hopes for Citizen Assistance

Since the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau took over the management of public utilities in the first district in February of this year, due to personnel issues and the failure of manufacturers to produce wheel licenses on schedule, citizens who went to obtain licenses were inconvenienced by overcharges or obstruction. In view of this, the authorities have specially and resolutely adjusted personnel, dismissed and punished employees who were derelict in their duties or extorted under the guise of business, and ordered officials in each office to provide convenience to citizens who register and obtain licenses in the future. In order to save citizens the trouble of applying for and obtaining licenses, a unified centralized registration of private human-powered vehicles and drivers will be implemented from June 1st. Citizens can complete the procedures for applying for licenses and changing licenses within one day, so citizens will no longer have to make fruitless trips back and forth to change licenses in the future. However, due to the large number of vehicles in this city, it is hoped that citizens will line up in an orderly manner and wait to be processed to maintain order.

### Doctors to Renew Licenses; Association to Handle Procedures on Behalf of Members

The Ministry of Health previously limited the time for all practicing and currently employed doctors to obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Health before June 15th in order to be legal, otherwise they would be ordered to suspend business. The Shanghai Special City National Medical Association and the Doctors Association, in order to facilitate members to apply for certificate renewals and pay supplementary certificate printing fees, can submit the relevant procedures to the association for transfer before the deadline.

### Last Week's Prices Fluctuated Sharply

The price trend in the past week fluctuated sharply, which was purely due to the sharp rise in black market rice prices. However, the reserves of various materials are still quite sufficient, and there is no shortage of future supply. However, some people in the market are using abundant floating funds to hoard and speculate, resulting in a reduction in the number of spot supplies on the market. Merchants are therefore raising prices to profit, citing "scarcity makes things valuable." Therefore, to stabilize the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai, the first step is to restore land and water transportation in various places and procure materials on a large scale.

### Short Commentary - The Contribution of the Sports Community

In the past two years, the sports community in this city has been active, especially the public's interest in ball sports, which has formed a mass movement. This is a gratifying phenomenon. Among those who have promoted this mass phenomenon, there are naturally enthusiastic sports people who have tried their best to promote it, as well as sports leaders who have worked hard to support it. In late April, to commemorate the Japanese Navy Day, the newly opened Joint Association in this city launched a sports meeting, which was open to the public for free viewing. This is also in line with the principle of mass sports. As for promoting sports and exercising the body, which can promote national health, these theories have long been understood by the general public and do not need to be explained. Ball games can attract a large number of spectators. Therefore, many social welfare events use charity matches to raise funds, and the results are very good. This is entirely because the sports community, in addition to promoting sports, also provides services to the community, which is even more admirable. This newspaper has been running the scholarship fund for six sessions, and the significance of the scholarship movement has long been understood by the public and does not need to be explained. The seventh session has already begun. In view of the sharp increase in prices, the scholarship fund used in this session will inevitably increase further. It is planned to set a target of 10 million yuan. In addition to appealing to all sectors of society for donations, we have also received assistance from Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, and the authorities of the sports association. The Donghua and Overseas Chinese United soccer teams and various basketball teams, as well as the enthusiasm of the team members, will hold charity soccer and basketball games. For the soccer games, in order to increase revenue, the price of ordinary seats will be set at 200 yuan, and honorary seat tickets will be set at 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 yuan. The net income from ticket sales will be used for the scholarship fund, and all expenses will be borne by this newspaper. At this point, some people may think that the seat prices are too high and violate the meaning of mass sports. However, we believe that since it is a charity match for the scholarship fund, then whether you buy ordinary tickets or honorary tickets to watch the game, you are expressing your obligation to contribute to the scholarship fund. The players and even this newspaper are also fulfilling their obligations to the scholarship fund. The positions are exactly the same. Since it is not for profit, it does not violate the principle of promoting mass sports. I believe that those who can truly recognize the scholarship movement and the meaning of mass sports will not have this view. Moreover, we believe that only by taking advantage of the opportunity of mass sports to incorporate the requirements of the scholarship movement and make it popular, can the scholarship movement be more widespread and make a greater contribution to helping poor students and cultivating talents for the country.

Finally, we sincerely look forward to all sectors of society fulfilling their obligations to the scholarship fund and expressing our gratitude for the assistance of the sports community.
