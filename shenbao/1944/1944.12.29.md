### Cooperation Between Japanese Naval and Air Forces: Night Attack on Enemy Ships at San Jose; Imperial Headquarters Announces Eleven Ships Sunk

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 28th: (1) On the night of December 26th, Japanese naval forces penetrated the waters off San Jose, Mindoro Island, overcoming enemy aircraft obstruction to attack four enemy transport ships and several torpedo boats anchored nearby, sinking all transport ships, one torpedo boat, and two small boats. Simultaneously, they shelled enemy airfields and material depots, turning the surrounding area into a sea of flames.

(3) In this resolute offensive, one Japanese destroyer was heavily damaged.

Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese naval air forces, from dusk to late night on the 25th, repeatedly and strongly attacked the enemy's north and south airfields at San Jose, Mindoro Island, with powerful land-attack aircraft and newly developed bomber formations. Overcoming the resistance of enemy fighters, they dropped massive bombs, turning the south airfield into a sea of flames by 5:30 PM. Enemy anti-aircraft fire gradually silenced, but the firelight was still soaring into the sky late into the night. Another unit attacked the Tacloban airfield on Leyte Island on the same night, causing a large fire. On the 26th, Japanese naval aviation units again sortied, repeatedly attacking both the San Jose and Tacloban airfields, inflicting heavy damage.

Philippine Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the night of the 26th, Japanese air forces braved dense clouds again to bomb Leyte Island. Amidst heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, they fiercely attacked the enemy unloading point north of Balunben, continuously dropping massive bombs, igniting two enemy material warehouses and unloading facilities. All aircraft returned safely to base.

### Japanese Kamikaze "Kongo" Unit Fiercely Attacks Enemy Warships; Achieves a Great Victory of Sinking or Destroying Twelve Vessels

Japanese Military Base, Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Since the 25th of last month, the enemy's mobile task force, which had been lying low, reappeared on the southeastern sea of the Philippines on the night of the 14th with a powerful transport convoy. Subsequently, its carrier-based aircraft launched air raids throughout the Philippines, and it landed on a corner of Mindoro Island. After the Japanese air forces stationed in the Philippines discovered the enemy mobile task force, they launched an all-out fierce attack. Simultaneously, the first "Kongo" Special Attack Unit, which had been waiting for an opportunity, along with the resolute second, third, and fourth Kongo units, departed from their bases one after another, colliding with warships and launching courageous and fierce attacks, hitting three enemy ships, sinking three large warships, and setting fire to four large transport ships, one cruiser, and one destroyer. The glorious battle results of the Japanese Kongo unit have been successively transmitted to the Special Attack Unit base. Because the results of each aircraft have not yet been reported, and direct cover aircraft and others penetrated the enemy fleet, the full results are still unknown. However, considering the total number of aircraft sorties from the Special Attack Unit base, which reached a considerable number, when the full results are confirmed, it can be said to be an unprecedented great victory since the birth of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit.

Japanese Air Forces Night Attack on Saipan and Iwo Jima

A Certain Base in the Pacific, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the night of the 26th, Japanese air forces braved inclement weather to fiercely bomb Saipan Island, launching a fierce attack on the enemy airfield on Aslito, setting eight locations on fire.

### Japanese Special Commando Unit Attacks Kalewa

A Certain Japanese Base on the Northern Burma Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The fighting around Kalewa remains intense. The Japanese army, using skillful maneuver warfare, severely attacked the enemy's 11th Division. Simultaneously, the Japanese Special Commando Unit, in response, first broke through enemy positions active on the east bank of the Chindwin River on November 27th, infiltrating the enemy's rear positions eight kilometers west of Kalewa on the west bank of the river. On December 7th, the entire unit bravely launched a do-or-die attack, destroying numerous enemy barracks, vehicles, and weapons, charging into the enemy ranks, inflicting heavy damage, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion, and then returning to their positions.

### U.S. Navy Authorities Do Not Release Damage Information

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, when meeting with a group of journalists on the 25th, stated that the Navy Department would adopt a policy of not releasing information on damage in the Pacific war zone. The gist of his statement was as follows: It is a fact that the U.S. fleet suffered some damage in the waters of the Philippines, but the reason why the Navy Department has not released this damage information up to now is to prevent the Japanese military from knowing what type of ships in the U.S. fleet were hit by their attacks, the extent of the damage, or how long it would take for these damaged ships to be able to re-engage in combat. Furthermore, it seems that someone abruptly claimed that all damage suffered in the naval and air battles with Japan in late October would also not be released, which is completely contrary to the facts.

### National Government Orders

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) National Government Order (December 28, 33rd Year of the Republic) The amendments to Articles 1, 2, 21, and 26 of the Organizational Law of the Capital Police Headquarters are hereby promulgated. This is the order.

The Moment of Farewell for the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit

Editorial

### A Touchstone for the Student Aid Movement

The student aid movement can be said to be one of the most meaningful and valuable things in society in recent years. It is an expression of compassion, a manifestation of responsibility. What is particularly commendable is that the fundraising for student aid comes entirely from the initiative of readers, and it is accumulated through the method of "many grains of sand making a tower" and "many fox furs making a robe". Although the donations vary in amount, the compassion and responsibility they represent are equally great and equally sublime. This situation is truly the most gratifying phenomenon in society.

I remember Mr. Gao Mengdan saying that there are two most unreasonable and unfair things in society today: one is that people who need medicine do not have the money to see a doctor and take medicine, and sit idly by as their useful bodies are trapped by disease to the point of being incurable; the other is that young people with talent and potential do not have the money to go to school, and sit idly by as their talents are restricted by the environment and cannot develop. Both are extremely cruel things in society, and the latter is an irredeemable loss to the country and society. We don't need to talk about any high-sounding ideology; as long as we earnestly achieve universal medical care and universal education, we can say that we have eliminated a large part of the various unreasonable and unfair phenomena in society. When we carefully consider these words, we feel that they are truly words of wisdom.

Some people believe that compassion is one of the basic instincts of human beings. When we are warm and well-fed, we will naturally think of the many hungry and cold people in society. When our own children have the opportunity to go to school, we will naturally think of the many young people in society who are suffering from the pain of being out of school. Adults may be said to have brought their cruel circumstances upon themselves. In any case, children are innocent. How can we bear to see thousands upon thousands of lovely young people wasting their studies and ruining their great futures? We do not expect everyone to be able to sacrifice themselves to save others; as long as we can empathize with others and share a little of our own personal enjoyment and that of our children with those in society who need help, the problem of being out of school will not be difficult to solve.

Responsibility is an even more fundamental condition for the survival and development of human society. Society is essentially a collection of individuals. Individuals and society coexist, prosper together, and are intertwined in their interests. The losses of society are the losses of individuals, and the welfare of society is the welfare of individuals. Based on this understanding, everyone should assume a responsibility to seek the progress of society and the welfare of society. The so-called "taking the world as one's responsibility" should not be regarded as "overly self-important," and individuals should not underestimate themselves because of their limited strength. As long as everyone can do their best, no matter how great or small their strength, then by gathering the strength of the masses, why worry that the cause of society will not be advanced? If everyone is passive and watches from the sidelines because their individual strength is small, then the cause of public affairs will inevitably be unattended. It goes without saying that the education of the next generation is the responsibility of the adults in society today. At present, there are thousands upon thousands of young people in society who are suffering from the pain of being out of school. May I ask whether those in society who have the power should shoulder the responsibility of rescuing those who are out of school?

The flourishing of a society depends on the mutual assistance and cooperation of all members of society. Mutual assistance is based on compassion, and cooperation relies on responsibility. The student aid movement is a cause of mutual assistance and cooperation, so whether the student aid movement can last and expand is a touchstone for compassion and responsibility in society.

### Random Thoughts on Suzhou

— Yifei

I was dispatched to Suzhou to observe everything and plan to report on what I have gained from this trip in the future. Since I have just unpacked my luggage, I will first write "Random Thoughts on Suzhou," based on my observations in recent days, for the readers of this newspaper, so that they can take a virtual tour. My writing is拙劣, please don't take it to heart.

A Glimpse of the Journey

At 9:15 AM on the 20th, I hired a car to reach the North Station. At that time, it was still early before the train departure time, so I immediately lined up among the passengers to wait for stamping the tickets. At first, it was still calm, but unexpectedly, when the ticket stamper arrived and started working, the passengers were agitated, pushing and shoving forward and backward, and the order was completely chaotic. I couldn't help but be pushed to the entrance to stamp the tickets, expending a great deal of effort. I fought my way out of the encirclement, squeezed into the platform, and quickly ran to where the train was, hoping to get a seat. Unexpectedly, the seats in the carriage had already been fully occupied by those who had arrived earlier. However, at the other end of the carriage, there was an armed person with a red armband, standing proudly and independently, occupying a seat alone, while the majority of passengers had to stand, and I was one of them. At first, I thought that this armed comrade must be keeping the seat vacant for his superiors, but even until the train had started, he was still alone. I was very close to the seat, but I could only look at it and not sit. Bored in the carriage, I felt very puzzled about this matter. When the train arrived at Kunshan, this gentleman got off and waved for me to sit down. I was already tired, so I immediately went to sit down. Such incidents need to be improved in the future. Since the Railway Bureau has military special cars to give preferential treatment to soldiers, it does not seem appropriate to "compete with the people" and occupy the seats that the public should be entitled to after purchasing tickets in accordance with the regulations.

The Scenery of Gusu

As the saying goes: "Buddhas need golden clothes, people need attire". In this era of declining morals, where "clothes are valued more than people", this saying is especially philosophical. Suzhou has always been known as paradise, and its residents must be dressed in gorgeous clothes. However, in reality, apart from a very few exceptions, the general population is actually very poor, and most are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Apart from the armed comrades, who have a unique style, the fox fur coats and high-heeled silk stockings only belong to the gold-digging women who come to Suzhou from all over the place. There are many consignment shops in the streets. Precious fine fur goods are hung in the display cabinets. When I asked the staff in the shop, they said that these fur coats were all entrusted by customers for sale, which proves that under the high pressure of life, the general public has no choice but to part with their beloved items.

The area of Guanqian Street and Taigan Lane Palace Lane, where Suzhou's teahouses and restaurants are concentrated, is quite lively when the lights are turned on. Famous Songhelou restaurant completely maintains the appearance of an old-fashioned restaurant. There is an old gentleman approaching sixty, holding an extra-large water pipe, going back and forth among the customers, loading tobacco for customers to smoke. The scenery of 30 years ago still exists. Using the same pipe for public use, in terms of hygiene, is really daunting. As for the customs of tea drinking, the leisurely mood of Suzhou people really does not give way to the banner people of Beiping. The "Wu Yuan" in Taigan Lane can be called the leader in this regard. From local gentry and celebrities to peddlers and small soldiers, everyone rushes to it. It is regarded as a place to pass the long day by the general unemployed literary scholars and gentry. In addition, Suzhou's sugar food shops are also famous far and wide. This kind of shops are everywhere in the downtown streets, but at present, raw materials are soaring, especially sugar, which is the most expensive. The heavy cost has led to a sharp increase in prices, which has greatly affected business. When I asked people in the industry, they said that the main customers who buy in large quantities are all people from other places, who use them as gifts for relatives and friends. The rest of the retail transactions are from local customers, which makes them feel the changes of the past and present.

The scenery of Wuzhong is beautiful and clear. In the past, many literati and elegant scholars, officials and celebrities, chose to live here and spend their late years in leisure. Such as Li Genyuan and Zhang Taiyan are among the authors. Since the incident, because the public security in the four rural areas is not good, those with a little property in the countryside have also led their families to live in Suzhou. Now Suzhou City is also the location of the provincial capital, and there are many civil servants, and the population has reached more than 700,000, which has long been plagued by overcrowding. It is not easy to find a house, and rents are soaring. There is a daily practice of using rice as rent. As for the nature of Suzhou's houses, except for the main downtown streets, the rest of the alleys and houses are mostly dilapidated, but they are still afraid that they will not be able to find them even if they pay high prices. As for the general famous houses and mansions with scenic beauty, they have long been searched for by those who have huge capital from other ports. The so-called real estate developers and brokers have transformed themselves into rich merchants in several transfers over the years.

All the facilities in Suzhou are becoming more urbanized, but the road administration is still very backward. People who are used to walking on asphalt roads in the city feel the ruggedness and unevenness of the cobblestone roads here. If you take a rickshaw, the price is so high that people are stunned. Because of the stone streets, "three-wheeled" vehicles are not popular, and the open carriage, which has long been eliminated by the times, unexpectedly has a lot of limelight here. I took a car for a test ride, and it only cost 80 gold for a one-way trip. In addition, there are military police stationed at the city gate of Suzhou. Pedestrians must get off and walk when they arrive here, and the coachman turns the mat and pulls the empty car through the post to show that he has no selfishness. This move has been unfamiliar for a long time, and it seems to be only a formality. I feel that it is just disturbing the journey and is nothing more than an extra effort. Because of my own experience, I go back and forth many times every day, and I have never been checked once. Is this the legacy of "all civil and military officials dismount here"?

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raid on Sui and Gan Airfields; Nine Yu Aircraft Hit and Caught Fire

### Luxembourg North-Central Battles Extremely Active; German Troops Retreat to Siegfried Line

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German authorities announced on the 27th that the battles in northern and central Luxembourg are very active. To avoid losses, German troops are now retreating to outposts in front of the Siegfried Line at several locations.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Eisenhower Headquarters, German forces have occupied 3,200 square kilometers of territory in Belgium and Luxembourg in the twelve days since the start of this offensive, advancing 93 kilometers.

Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency: According to an American journalist embedded with the U.S. First Army, the sudden appearance of the German Air Force surprised the American forces on the Western Front. Most American soldiers believed that the German Air Force was a thing of the past, and this sudden appearance was unexpected.

German Army Uses Various Weapons

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas: An officer of the German High Command stated that the German troops attacking the anti-Axis positions are not the last reserves, but only the first batch of reserves. The German offensive on the 16th of this month has ushered the Western Front into a new phase. Various weapons are participating in the German attacks. Tank units and motorized infantry are at the forefront, breaking through the American positions. The German Air Force is providing strong support. Special German guards are using automatic weapons to cut off and surround American troops and launch short-range offensives. However, it was not mentioned whether German secret weapons are being used.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London report, a German radio station broadcasted that the German army under the command of Field Marshal Rundstedt is now using high-performance bombs. According to the broadcast, everything living in the area where these bombs are dropped dies. Forests are burned, and vast areas are turned into scorched earth. Anyone who comes into contact with the blast is turned into ash.

The Final Great Battle Is About to Unfold

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Due to the urgent crisis on the Meuse River front, the American army has used all its strategic reserves for the defense of the east bank of the Meuse River, attempting to stop the German army. According to front-line reports, Field Marshal Rundstedt has gathered a new elite reserve force on the Ardennes front, completing a major breakthrough towards Antwerp. This force includes the 5th Panzer Army and the 7th Mechanized Army, totaling twenty divisions. According to Associated Press, the German High Command has bet everything on this offensive. The final and greatest battle of World War II is about to unfold.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas: The outcome of the German offensive in southern Belgium continues to affect the development of the Western Front situation. Although General Eisenhower has deployed a large number of troops to participate in the war, he has still failed to shatter the German army's initiative. German war reports state that new German weapons have destroyed many anti-Axis tanks, proving that the war is gradually becoming a war of attrition. The anti-Axis counter-offensive is now slightly more systematic, with the aim of breaking through the German vanguard from both sides of its base. However, Eisenhower has not yet fully gone through the stage of consolidating defenses, so the German advance has not been stopped on the Meuse River front. Some of the troops fighting in that area have been transferred to other areas to implement planned offensive and defensive plans. The pressure from the anti-Axis forces in the south has been considerably intensified during Christmas. The pressure in central Luxembourg and north of Cologne remains very strong. General Patton is now making every effort to break through Bastogne to relieve the American troops trapped there.

### Bankers Association Held 16th Annual Meeting Yesterday; Report on Association Affairs, Four Resolutions Passed

The Shanghai Special City Bankers Association held its 16th member annual meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). Representatives from all member banks attended. Chairman Ye Fuxiao delivered the opening remarks. After the speech, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the association's affairs over the past six months. After discussion: (1) retroactive approval of the admission of eleven banks including Hefeng, Guofu, Guangxing, Liankang, Anda, Nanjing Xingye, Zhongyi Trust, Lisheng Trust, Fumin, Sanxin, and Dacheng. (2) approval of this year's final accounts and the budget for the previous year (34th year). (3) approval of the board of directors' resolution to increase the collection of special fees in the 34th year. (4) approval of the application for membership by the Shanghai branch of Yu Su Bank. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.

Report on Association Affairs

Collective Security

The report on association affairs by Secretary-General Lin is as follows: "It has been half a year since the 15th member general meeting was convened on June 28th to handle the relocation. During this period, financial laws and regulations have been revised repeatedly, and the market situation has been fluctuating. Rising [prices] make any business feel strained, and banks are no exception. Fortunately, the overall operation of the industry is relatively stable, and maintaining it is not easy. This is a common fact. Therefore, when talking about banking business today, it can be said that there is no easy path to follow. Aiming too high and being surprised by the distance is certainly not appropriate, but adhering to conventions may also be inadequate. There is no other way but to assess the situation, be realistic, strictly abide by regulations, be mindful of the difficulties of the times, and pay attention to assisting and promoting productive enterprises and seeking collective security in the financial industry. By following this path, even if we cannot achieve prosperity, we will not lose our sense of duty and may still be able to support each other and weather the storm together.

Loan Restrictions

In the past six months, all the laws and regulations that the association has forwarded and the public affairs it has handled for the industry have been aimed at encouraging each other. A total of 24 meetings of the board of directors, standing directors, joint meetings of banks and money shops, and various subcommittees have been held. During these six months, the government has promulgated more than ten laws and regulations related to financial affairs. The more important ones include the Ministry of Finance's strict ban on speculation in gold prices in Shanghai in June and July, reiterating the three measures for restricting loans by banks and money shops. The use of loans must be strictly reviewed. If they are used for speculation to drive up prices, severe punishment will be imposed. Instructions were forwarded, and all members were required to comply. The increase in capital of financial institutions should be submitted to the Ministry for approval in advance according to law. However, in the past, many banks did not submit applications in advance and had already published announcements in newspapers and convened shareholder meetings, which was not in compliance with regulations. The Ministry of Finance also instructed that the temporary measures for managing financial institutions must be followed, and severe punishment should be imposed.

Amended Measures

The temporary measures for managing financial institutions were implemented last year. This time, the Ministry of Finance made further amendments, the main points of which are: (1) Branch offices that have already been established by financial institutions must apply for registration within one month and obtain a separate business license. (2) The affiliated organizations of financial institutions' associations, such as joint reserve warehouses and clearing houses, should also apply for approval. (3) The amount of fines for violations of laws and regulations has been increased compared to the original regulations. The other implementing rules of the same law and the relevant articles of the bank registration charter have also been amended accordingly. Recently, in October, the "Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in Shanghai" was promulgated, the main purpose of which is to bring the financial industry into line with regulations and to restrict investment channels. Therefore, there are minimum numerical requirements for bank funds and deposits. The reserve ratio has been increased to 30%, and loans to shops and factories are also explicitly limited to 3 million yuan. In addition, there are strict provisions regarding the reporting of securities investments, total deposits, and the party affiliation of important financial institution personnel. Shortly thereafter, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office revised the measures based on the outline to facilitate implementation. Because the authorities have deep intentions, the industry has complied with the implementation of a part of them. However, at the beginning, because the time limit was very short, the banks and money shops themselves had some difficulties. Although they made gentle statements, hoping to achieve practical results, there were still some cases where things were difficult to implement.

Restructuring of Organizations

It was decided at the last general meeting that the internal organization of the association should be reformed to improve efficiency and integrity. Later, the board of directors and supervisors appointed a committee to form a small group to draft a plan. The main points of the organization are to abolish the original secretariat and establish two departments: general affairs and audit. Three research subcommittees on laws and regulations, business, and management will be established to assist the board of directors in promoting association affairs. After the personnel aspects are decided, the reorganization can be completed next spring. Taking advantage of the general meeting, I would like to submit a preliminary report."

### "Not a Penny" and "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart": Nearly One Million Yuan Donated Yesterday, Hope to Continue Efforts

"Commodity scholarship, the most profound meaning." This means that industrial and commercial enterprises each use their honorary products to recognize teams and donate happily, leaving a deep impression on people's minds, forever unforgettable, benefiting themselves and others. In the past month, various factories have been promoting this, and there have been many precedents. Yesterday, Liang Xin Ji Toothbrush Factory recognized the "Not a Penny" team. These four words were originally a promotional slogan of Rong Xin Ji, but it is quite "humorous"; it seems to allude to the general rich people on the sea who squander privately and live extravagantly, but when it comes to social welfare, they "do not give a penny." There are indeed many such people. In fact, it is also quite pitiful. No matter how rich your family is, in the end, it is still a dream! A few days ago, New Star Pharmaceutical Factory recognized the "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart" team. These four words are exactly the opposite of "Not a Penny." At that time, Mr. Yao Junzhi said that "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart" is ready to sacrifice without limitation. Even if there are a thousand or even ten thousand people who donate 50,000 yuan per team, they will still donate. His generosity is admirable! I hope that people who "do not give a penny" can also change their style, keep their word, donate more, accumulate more, so that five thousand children and countless poor children will not drop out of school, they will all have books to read, and our scholarship movement will finally succeed. That is really "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart."

Hong En Hospital Nurses Help Students

The Hong En Hospital Nurses Team sent a letter to the nursing community yesterday for the scholarship movement, saying: "Dear sisters in the nursing community: We feel great joy and excitement because we have been able to do our part in the scholarship fundraising movement enthusiastically advocated by the newspaper. Although our strength is small, it contains the hard work of cooks, workers, and engine workers. The enthusiasm of patients, a loving mother blessing her young daughter to recover early in the "Ming Jue Team." Filial sons and daughters, blessing their loving mother to recover healthy in the "Health Team," may everyone in the world follow their enthusiasm! Our nursing community is not very noticeable in social welfare undertakings. Only in movies are we often made the protagonists of love stories, which is not clear enough. We hope that our nursing sisters will actively participate in the Shen Bao scholarship movement to give full play to the spirit of nurses serving the society."

Silk Industry Bank Saves to Help Students

China Silk Industry Bank wrote: "We respectfully inform you that your newspaper has been organizing scholarships to help outstanding young people and poor children in this city for many years, and your efforts have been great. After admiring you, our colleagues at the bank cannot help but sympathize, so we have strived to save from our private lives and accumulated savings of 200,000 yuan. In addition to sending half of it to the News Newspaper, we are sending only 100,000 yuan and ask that it be included under the scholarship fund. Although the small amount is like a drop in the bucket, if colleagues in the city enthusiastically respond, the amount will surely be considerable."
