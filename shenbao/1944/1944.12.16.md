### Realization of the Transcontinental Railway is Imminent: Only 800 Kilometers of Track Remaining to be Laid

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) A land route from Tokyo, through the mainland, directly to Annam, Thailand, Burma, and Malaya should, in its essence, have been realized long ago. For example, during the era of Imperial Russia and up to the Soviet Red Army, a great transcontinental railway was established to connect the barren and desolate Siberia and the unpopulated Turkestan. However, it is strange that among the densely populated and materially flowing countries of East Asia today, there is not a single transcontinental railway. The main reasons for this strange situation can be roughly divided into the following three points: First, Asia has not been able to solve major issues. Asia has been divided into several spheres of influence or colonies by non-Asian forces. These lands and organizations with different natures are all areas that repel each other and mutually exclude entry. Whether it is Annam, Malaya, or Burma, they will definitely not allow the capital of other countries to enter their countries. Furthermore, the transcontinental railways in mainland China have all been blood vessels for non-Asian forces. They were built by non-Asian forces, so although they ostensibly belong to China, they are not actually owned by China itself. The supervision and operation of the railways are also controlled by non-Asian forces. Therefore, matters related to the contact between Asia itself cannot be implemented as desired. Second, among the Asian nations today, only Japan has the ability to independently construct in terms of capital and technology in order to promote the prosperity of all ethnic groups. Third, there are the monopolistic undertakings of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, especially the maritime ambition of Britain. For example, Jardine Matheson is the company that represents Britain in managing maritime transport in East Asia. They want to monopolize the transportation of East Asian materials by sea, so they have used all their power to prevent the realization of a transcontinental route on the mainland. However, the continental transcontinental railway from the hinterland of China to the seaports is in line with their interests, so they have strongly supported its construction. Due to the above main reasons, the transcontinental railway on the Asian continent has had no possibility of being realized. Therefore, Japan has made a special effort to resolve this unreasonable situation. Since the Greater East Asia War, due to the military success of the Japanese army, the realization of the transcontinental railway on the mainland is imminent. Currently, the areas between Tokyo and Shonan where railways have not been laid are the areas between Guilin and Liuzhou and between Saigon and Bu Yuse, with a distance of only 830 kilometers. If the Japanese army clears the remnants of the Chongqing army along the railway lines between Hankou, Changsha, and Guilin, then only the problems of capital, materials, and technology will remain. By then, the difficulty of completing the Asian transcontinental railway will be easily solved.

### Tokyo Special Correspondence No. 3: The Battle for Leyte

— Toshiyuki

On October 18th, an American transport convoy invaded Leyte Gulf and bombarded the coastline. By October 20th, the army under MacArthur, under the cover of both sea and air forces, began to forcibly land on Leyte Island, centered on Tacloban and Dulag. The main force of their landing troops seemed to be Major General Magee's 1st Cavalry Division and Major General Barnwell's 24th Infantry Division. They advanced west from Tacloban along the right side of the Leyte Valley towards Carigara Bay; at the same time, a team centered on the 7th Infantry Division and the 96th Infantry Division advanced towards Ormoc from Dulag on the left side of the Leyte Valley. Their operational plan clearly attempted to bypass the dense forests and valleys, attacking from the north and south in order to drive the Japanese army into Ormoc Bay.

Contending for Air Supremacy

At the beginning of the landing, the American army, relying on the power of heavy cannons and bombs, unloaded many tanks and heavy artillery, captured the airfields near Tacloban and Dulag, and accelerated repairs, using them as bases to increase their air power in an attempt to gain air supremacy. However, the defending troops on the island, fighting against overwhelming odds, skillfully reorganized their lines, firmly defended Dagami Heights and other key high grounds along the valley, and launched surprise attacks by sending suicide squads, plunging into the enemy's rear and causing chaos in their large army. Therefore, the highlands from Carigara to Ormoc are all in the hands of the Japanese army, while the positions held by the American army are only narrow plains along the coast.

The operational strategies for the Battle of Leyte are roughly the same for both Japan and the United States: the first step is to compete for air supremacy in the area, and then cut off the opponent's maritime supply lines, preventing their ground troops from obtaining supplies and reinforcements. Therefore, since the American army began the landing battle on Leyte Island, the air combat situation in the area has become increasingly fierce. Neither side is willing to give up, and there is a stalemate. During this period of over a month, the Japanese army, based on its outstanding traditional spirit, successively dispatched the unparalleled Kamikaze Special Attack Corps to attack the American fleet and transport convoys, achieving many glorious battle results. However, although the American army has suffered serious blows repeatedly, it is unwilling to give up and is constantly drawing fresh air forces from New Guinea to compete with the Japanese air force; at the same time, its transport convoys and naval forces are also braving fierce counterattacks from the Japanese side, struggling desperately to unload reinforcements and weapons ashore.

Implementing Daring Surprise Attacks

As Japanese Prime Minister Koiso said, the Battle of Leyte is the key to the decisive battle in the Pacific. The American army is attempting to succeed at the cost of huge sacrifices, and the Japanese army, based on the so-called Kamikaze spirit of certain death, is determined to defeat the enemy. Therefore, on the one hand, they are sending large armies to reinforce the area, and on the other hand, they are implementing daring surprise attacks on the front lines. In addition to sending suicide squads to launch melee attacks, on the night of November 26th, Army Lieutenant Nakae led the Army Special Attack Corps airborne unit, aboard four transport planes, to land near the American airfields at Dulag and Buroen, and broke into the key parts of the two airfields, inflicting serious damage. Later, on the morning of December 6th, the Japanese army in the western area of Buroen broke into the American lines and advanced towards the airfield. On the same night, the Takachiho parachute unit landed separately at the American-held airfields in Buroen, San Pablo, Dulag, and Tacloban. After the branch attacking Buroen made contact with the ground troops attacking the area, they immediately occupied the airfield, while the Takachiho units in other locations also established great achievements. The bridgehead that the American army had painstakingly built was thus thrown into a state of chaos. In order to reverse the decline and boost morale, the American army landed about one division of reinforcements near Alvera, about eight kilometers southeast of Ormoc on Leyte Island, on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army intercepted and attacked head-on on the ground, inflicting heavy damage, while also dispatching air force to bombard its landing site and subsequent convoys, sinking and destroying many of its ships. On the 10th, in the Surigao Strait southeast of Leyte Island, the Japanese Danxin Special Attack Corps, braving intense defensive fire, sank two large transport ships, a cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft, destroyed a large transport ship, and set a cruiser or large destroyer on fire.

Heavy Losses for the Americans

Since the airborne units and the Takachiho unit launched surprise attacks on the American airfields on Leyte Island, and the Japanese ground troops launched an offensive, the balance in the area has been broken. The base air power of the American army on Leyte Island has weakened significantly. Currently, the airfields on the island that the American army can use are only Tacloban, Dulag, and the recently established Tanauan. These airfields have been riddled with holes due to the Japanese army's forced landings and continuous bombing. Except for the take-off and landing of a few small aircraft, large aircraft cannot use them. Regarding this situation, even the American radio broadcasts admitted: "Recently, the Japanese air force in the Philippines has greatly strengthened, and due to the attacks of the Japanese Special Attack Corps, our losses have also been very heavy."

Editorial

### On Rice Policy

Yesterday, the leading figures of the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Commercial Control Committee of this city hosted the members of the press rice-producing area inspection team of this city. On one hand, they expressed their appreciation for their hard work, and on the other hand, based on the report released by the team regarding rural economy, agricultural production, and the purchase of rice, they exchanged opinions and discussed more comprehensive proposals. However, coincidentally at the time of the reception, the rice price in this city was rising madly. Because the reception included municipal authorities, commercial control authorities, rice control authorities, and rice industry leaders, it can be said that they all have considerable responsibility for rice. Therefore, the discussion of the Shanghai food problem appeared particularly deeply concerned.

We have always believed that the soaring rice price in Shanghai (referring to the price outside the rationed rice fixed price) is unreasonable and artificial. In other words, it is caused by the government's lax management of rice prices and the opportunistic behavior of general profiteers. Based on the opinions of the gentlemen at yesterday's reception, and combined with the consistent advocacy of this newspaper, we offer the following suggestions:

First, we have pointed out before that Shanghai is a place for manufacturing rumors, especially groundless and unfounded rumors. Profiteering merchants create rumors to pursue exorbitant profits. Therefore, there are always rumors before each wave of price increases; conversely, after rumors arise, prices skyrocket. Rumors are the cause, and rising prices are the effect. For example, the recent soaring price of gold and the sudden rise and fall of stocks are all caused by the mischief of profiteering merchants. The madness of the current rice price is the same example, and the result is that rumors are after all rumors, and they collapse by themselves. However, prices do not fall back after rising, and at most, they only fall back a little after rising greatly. It is regrettable that people who easily believe in rumors suffer from them, but they are still not aware of it, and they still believe in the next rumors as the truth. The current skyrocketing rice price is due to the rice dealers shouting and raising prices at will. Of course, there are profiteering merchants behind the rice dealers to support them. Profiteering merchants are the termites hoarding rice. We advocate that on the one hand, the public should remain calm, and on the other hand, the authorities should strictly manage the rice prices outside of the rationed rice. At the same time, those who create rumors to seek exorbitant profits and those who create rumors to raise rice prices should be subject to the most severe criminal penalties. And encourage the public to report by means of incentives.

Second, the current emergency countermeasures to stop profiteering merchants from creating rumors include: (1) Distributing household rice in advance once or twice, for example, distributing it on the 5th instead of the 10th. (2) Especially increase the allocation of miscellaneous grains once for military police, public teachers, laborers, salaried classes, etc. Originally, we advocated that the rationing system should adopt the principle of focusing on key points. This is a remedy before the implementation of the key rationing system, that is, to prevent salaried classes and laborers from being affected by profiteering merchants raising rice prices. Because salaried classes and laborers are not affected by profiteering merchants raising prices, the black market will not have a socially unsettling effect.

Third, the above emergency countermeasures are temporary solutions. As for the fundamental solutions, (1) we must emphasize the rapid implementation of a key rationing system. (2) The ration amount for military police, public teachers, laborers, salaried classes, etc. must be sufficient. But it does not have to be pure rice, miscellaneous grains are also acceptable. Because rice production is limited in wartime, everyone should break the concept that they must eat rice and advocate eating miscellaneous grains. (3) The wealthy and those who make exorbitant profits should not only not receive rations, but must also bear the obligation of providing food for the people working for them. For example, the secretaries, clerks, accountants, laborers, etc. employed by the wealthy, or the partners and workers employed by profitable private stores and factories, must all bear a portion of the rice. During implementation, surveys should be conducted according to the Baojia system to achieve accuracy. At the same time, it should be strictly stipulated that anyone who commits fraud in the Baojia during the decision of key rationing, making inaccurate surveys, or any public official who commits fraud, should be subject to the condemnation of public opinion and the punishment of national law. (4) Effectively increase agricultural production. The previous production increase movement was only superficial, and a large amount of funding was spent in vain. The farmers themselves did not receive any real benefits. Even the publicity work was only promoted in the cities, and the farmers in the countryside did not know about it at all. We hope that in the future, production increase funds can give real benefits to farmers, such as fertilizers, agricultural tools, and loans, etc., and not be embezzled by cooperatives or Xiang Baojia chiefs. For example, those in Shanghai with capital or banks should not use hoarding goods for speculation as their business, but directly lend to farmers so that they do not suffer from high-interest loans. In short, the government and the people should promote practical and feasible production increase plans to ensure the actual results of production increase in the next year.

Fourth, unblocking rice sources is urgently needed, regardless of temporary or fundamental solutions. This responsibility, of course, lies with the Rice Control Committee. Now the Rice Control Committee authorities have recognized the past failures, and everything is gradually being improved. Incompetent employees are also gradually being eliminated. At the same time, they can accept public opinion, such as inviting reporters from this city to inspect the rice-producing areas, which is a concrete manifestation. We hope to go a step further, and the people must recognize the overall situation, that we are currently at war. At the same time, the Rice Control Committee should fully accept public opinion, and under the consideration of both parties, make the rice sources increase day by day.

Finally, the rice problem is extremely serious at present, but it is definitely not something that can be solved by simply sighing helplessly or by detaching from reality. We hope that the relevant authorities and social leaders will openly discuss and implement practical and realistic countermeasures to gradually reduce its severity.

Dredging of Lake Yinhu to Commence Preliminary Work; Decision to Establish an Office in Suzhou

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The former Water Conservancy and Production Increase Design Committee of the Ministry of Construction had determined four water conservancy and production increase plans last year: (1) Dongtai Lake Dredging Plan, (2) Yinhu Lake Dredging Plan, (3) Furong Dike Water Lifting and Irrigation Project, and (4) Completion of the Huayang Sluice Project. In order to carry them out in sequence, the Dongtai Lake Dredging Engineering Bureau was first established this year. Later, because the personnel of the bureau were not fully established and the construction measures were improper, the progress of the project suffered heavy losses and has now come to a standstill. Now, the former Ministry of Construction believes that water conservancy construction is an urgent need at present, so it is taking advantage of the current favorable opportunity for the Yinhu Lake dredging project to commence dredging work in that area. For this purpose, the Ministry of Construction has long begun various construction preparations, and the required funds and food for workers have already been roughly settled through communication between the Ministry of Construction and relevant parties. It has been decided to establish a Yinhu Lake Dredging Engineering Construction Office in Suzhou within a certain period. It is heard that the candidate for the director of the office will be concurrently held by Minister Fu, and 40 pumping machine boats will be rented immediately. At the same time, all the technical personnel of the Water Conservancy Department will also go to the construction site to start preliminary work.

### Establishment of Preparatory Committee for Greater East Asia Museum

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Japanese Ministry of Education has decided to establish a Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of the Greater East Asia Museum.

### "Mud and High Altitude": American Magazine Discusses the Leyte Battle Situation, Encountering Unexpected Counterattacks by the Japanese Army Everywhere

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) The American magazine Time published a report on the Pacific War on December 4th, entitled "Mud and High Altitude," discussing the Leyte Island operation as follows: The Leyte Island operation will take at least two more months. Since the beginning of the tropical rainy season, the battle has completely fallen into a stalemate in the mud. The current operations of the American army are progressing more slowly than when they landed on Leyte, so attacking Luzon has become a dream. Although Leyte is only 300 miles away from Manila, the American army's hope of reaching Manila before New Year's Eve has long vanished. The staff of MacArthur's army have no common sense and have not considered the difficult operations in the Leyte mud after entering December. The roads on the Philippine Islands have been difficult, and under the heavy pressure of new weapons, they will be completely destroyed. The maps of Leyte Island drawn by the American army are unexpectedly simple, so they are encountering unexpected counterattacks by the Japanese army everywhere. Therefore, the Japanese army is still gathering a considerable number of air forces in the Philippines, and the American Navy has to be vigilant.

### North China Resources and North China Development (1)

— Wu Gong

(1) Continued

This reporter was dispatched to North China to investigate the economy. I stayed in the old capital for more than two months. The impression I got from this trip was very deep. Especially what I felt was that in this era, if you have no economy, you have no politics. The territorial integrity and administrative integrity that were valued in the past only stated the political side of sovereignty. In addition, resource integrity and material management integrity can be said to be the economic side of a country's sovereignty. Due to the enlightenment of the war, there is no doubt that the latter will be more important than the former. No matter how good the relationship between the two countries is, simply focusing on mutual respect for their sovereignty in politics is no match for mutual respect for their sovereignty in economics. If a country loses its sovereignty in economics, this country is no different from a country about to perish. At the same time, a strong country will never be so foolish as to only want to occupy the land of other countries without thinking about seizing its resources. In order to reconcile the relationship between strong and weak countries, the term economic cooperation has emerged internationally. However, international economic cooperation, if it should completely abandon all aggressive intentions, must be mutual assistance and cooperation based on equality.

Our country and our ally Japan are now in a comrade-in-arms relationship of shared existence and death. Naturally, the economic cooperation that has always been talked about should show its importance. Due to this relationship, in order to establish a foundation for building co-prosperity and war power, our allies have continued to call for a comprehensive planned economy with China, Japan, and Manchuria as one. This comprehensive planned economy has obviously gone beyond the original form of economic cooperation. Its only major goal is to complete victory and construction. In this situation, when this reporter traveled north to inspect the economy, the first thing that should be valued is the existing resources of North China and the agencies responsible for developing these resources. Since the Incident, our country has first sought political revival, which is already difficult due to limited manpower. Therefore, the economic revival largely depends on the cooperation of our allies. Although in this cooperative posture, due to a special development at the time, it has not been as ideal as it should be, it has made the people of the country realize the importance of their national defense resources, which is not necessarily a good lesson.

Speaking of economic development in North China, we should first pay attention to the fact that in the comprehensive plan with China, Japan, and Manchuria as one, the integration of North China, Inner Mongolia, and the three countries of Japan and Manchuria is the root of East Asia's defense power. In other words, North China bears an extremely important economic mission in the final stage of the decisive battle: to form the main force for this integrated operation. Within this region, there are five components of national defense resources: namely coal, iron, salt, alum shale, and cotton. According to our allies, the success or failure of North China's economic construction is the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War!

(2) North China's National Defense Resources

Now let me briefly describe the current situation of North China's five national defense resources. The first is coal, which constitutes the standard of national power. The amount of coal buried in North China accounts for about 80% of the total amount buried in China, accounting for about 130 billion tons. According to recent figures, I am afraid that it will increase further. Even taking the total coal production in China in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it accounted for 83%. Moreover, North China's coal not only has a favorable natural environment, but also has excellent mechanical equipment and technical guidance from our allies, so the future productivity must have a quantum leap. The so-called favorable natural environment means that the coal seam is very thick, the distance from the surface is short, there is very little gas in the pit, and it can be operated even with naked fire, and the amount of water gushing is very small, and the ground is strong, and the amount of pit wood used is also small. Therefore, only one-third of the funds and materials required for development are sufficient. At the same time, the coal quality ranges from lignite to highly bituminous coal, and the styles are different, and the scope of utilization is extremely wide. Especially the strong coking bituminous coal that is indispensable for iron-making raw material charcoal, North China is extremely rich in reserves. Furthermore, North China's coal also has suitable conditions for being used as raw material charcoal for making synthetic petroleum. From this, we can know the importance of future construction.

Speaking of iron, the amount buried in North China can be estimated to be more than 300 million tons. Among them, the Longyan in Inner Mongolia is the most abundant, and its reserves account for two-thirds of the total in North China. Secondly, the Jinling Town in Shandong is also extremely important. It is said that the minable amount reaches 6 million to 100 million tons or more. In addition, there are so-called taro-shaped deposits throughout Shanxi Province, but they have not yet become planned mass mining. During iron-making, about three tons of coal are required to produce one ton of iron. Therefore, since North China is rich in coal reserves, there are great expectations for its future heavy industry development.

The importance of salt is not just for food, but because it has become a necessary material for both soda industry, dye industry, and other so-called salt-based chemical industries. Especially the materials for chemical weapons, the extent to which salt is needed is even more astonishing. Therefore, salt has also become one of North China's important national defense resources. North China has both pond salt, well salt, and rock salt, but what is currently being developed as industrial salt is sea salt. The coast of Bohai Sea and Shandong area are the main producing areas. There have always been two salt-making methods: (1) Boiling method, such as Japan, (2) Solar salt-making method, which is the current situation in North China today. The most superior condition for the latter is that the actual evaporation is very large. Therefore, today the Changlu salt fields in North China are as wide as 1,600 ch, and the Qingdao salt fields are also as wide as 816 ch. Compared with the Hiroshima salt fields in Japan (313 ch) or the Haizhou in Central China (400 ch), it is really a small witch seeing a great witch.

Alum shale is often neglected by the general public, but it is actually an extremely important part of modern military raw materials. Because alum shale contains aluminum, it has an unusually important mission in the aluminum manufacturing industry. It is said that the reserves of alum shale found in North China, which is the aluminum original ore, can be estimated at 400 million tons in the Kailuan coal mining area of eastern Hebei. In particular, there are the most that contain more than 60% aluminum. In addition, the reserves in the coal mining areas of Zichuan, Boshan, and Zhangqiu in Shandong Province are also 1.4 billion tons.

The last national defense resource is cotton. Originally, cotton is a tropical product, but temperate North China also contains many good conditions. In North China, the temperature rises immediately after spring, and the summer has a particularly high temperature. This is the first condition for cotton cultivation. Secondly, there are many sunny days and little rain, and more precipitation in the three months of June, July, and August is also a good condition. Although the loess in North China lacks nitrogen, as long as water and ammonium sulfate fertilizer are added, cotton production is more profitable than food. Therefore, cotton production will become the main agricultural product in North China in the future. At present, it is moving towards a target of 10 million dan of production. (To be continued)

### Economic Bureau Discusses Electricity Allocation Methods: Scheduled to Convene a Manufacturers Meeting on the 18th

The Economic Bureau of this city previously conducted a survey of electricity consumption and production measurement in various factories. Except for factories related to military needs and manufacturing daily necessities, which are still allowed to register before the end of this month, the bureau has scheduled to convene the chairmen of the industry associations of various major factories and enterprises in this city, and the representatives of 57 industries including food, clothing, machinery, chemical daily necessities, culture, paper, cigarette factories, and pharmaceuticals, at the conference room of the bureau at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month to hold a joint meeting to discuss the future electricity allocation methods. Therefore, the industry associations of various electricity-using factories and enterprises in this city, regardless of whether they have received a notice or not, can send their chairmen to attend and provide opinions at that time.

Installation of Engines Requires Re-inspection

Since the restriction of electricity supply in this city, the number of factories that set up their own steam engines or internal combustion engines to generate electricity has been increasing. However, if the installation and use of these engines are slightly careless, there is a risk of endangering life. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, as the department in charge, should ban these engines to ensure safety. According to Article 12 of the Factory License Rules, if there are any changes or additions to the factory site, whether or not it is a construction project, a permit must first be obtained from the bureau. (1) All factories in this city that have steam engines or internal combustion engines installed (including charcoal, firewood, and diesel engines) should apply for re-inspection at the Public Works Section of the bureau at Room 346, 180 Fuzhou Road before the 31st of this month. If they are overdue, they will be punished according to regulations for privately using machinery that has not been inspected. (2) In the future, factories that newly install steam engines or internal combustion engines or renovate existing machinery and equipment must first apply to the bureau for re-inspection and approval before they can be used. In addition, it is stipulated that factories in the southern district (former eight districts) should apply to the factory section of the bureau for a factory license before the 31st of this month. If they are overdue, they will be punished according to regulations for setting up a factory and working without a license. In the future, new factories in the district must obtain a factory license from the bureau before they are allowed to start construction.

The citizens of this city have been enthusiastically visiting the exhibition, so it has been decided to extend the exhibition by five days until the 20th.

### Education Bureau Sets Up Special Committee to Review the Registration of Private Schools

In view of the fact that many private schools at all levels in this city have applied for registration in recent months, (all schools that have not been registered must apply for registration in accordance with the law, and those that have been registered before the incident only need to submit their registration documents and complete the registration), the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Dai, has set up a Private School Registration Review Committee out of caution, and has appointed senior officials of the bureau to serve as members, responsible for handling the above matters, which was established yesterday.

### Materials Movement Control: Application to Define Scope

Regarding the registration of the movement of major items, the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special City previously sent a letter to the Commercial Control Committee and the Grain, Flour, Oil, Cotton, Daily Necessities and other control committees, requesting that they be transferred to the jurisdiction of the bureau. The Commercial Control Committee convened a meeting of the Standing Committee a few days ago and specially discussed this issue. As a result, the various control committees stated that the Materials Movement Control Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan stipulated that since various major materials were controlled by the various control committees, the tasks of purchasing, allocating, and controlling the movement of materials were all the responsibility of the respective control committees. If the materials are controlled, the application for movement should be handled by the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Committee. Therefore, it was unanimously resolved to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to define the scope of movement control in accordance with the provisions of the Materials Movement Control Regulations.

### Director of Land Administration Bureau Discusses Land and Housing Issues; Reporter's Regular Meeting Held Yesterday

The 32nd reporter's regular meeting hosted by the City Propaganda Department was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 15th) in the conference room of the Municipal Government on Jiangxi Road. Mr. Fan Yongzeng, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau (represented by Secretary Wang Zhongwen), and Mr. Shen Guanzhun, Chairman of the Business Committee for Absentee Land and Housing Owners, answered various questions raised by news reporters from various newspapers in the city. The details are recorded as follows:

Land Issues

(1) (Central News Agency asked) What is the progress of the Land Administration Bureau in the past year? (Answer) The operations of the Land Administration Bureau in the past year are still carried out according to the regulations before the return of the National Government to the capital, which are divided into (A) Surface rights registration, (B) Easement rights registration, (C) Surveying work, etc. Other surveying work such as transfer mortgages and land survey petitions range from hundreds to thousands of cases per month. As for the release of enemy property, there are more than 10,000 cases, which are also largely completed. (2) (Central News Agency asked) Why does the Land Administration Bureau need to exchange certificates for property title deeds? (Answer) Because there are frequent disputes over property rights, exchange registration is required to determine property rights. (3) (Central News Agency asked) What procedures does the Land Administration Bureau have for house sales? (Answer) A property certificate must be presented and transfer tax paid. After the registration procedures are completed, the sale is considered legal. (4) (Central News Agency asked) How does the Land Administration Bureau classify the levels of houses and land in the first district of the city? (Answer) It depends on the prosperity of the area. The current minimum valuation is 1,000 yuan per mu, and the maximum is 500,000 yuan, all taxed at 6%. However, when land prices rise, the municipal government can be petitioned to increase the valuation at any time to emphasize land administration.

Housing Issues

(1) (Central News Agency asked) How many absentee-owned houses and land are there in this city? (Answer) The statistics on absentee-owned houses in this city can only be obtained after the registration is completed. The current number under the management of this committee is 119 buildings in the southern city and 247 buildings in northern Shanghai. Land that has not been registered is difficult to count temporarily. (2) (Central News Agency asked) If the original owner submits proof of ownership, what procedures should be followed for claiming it? (Answer) It has already been answered in the first item of the inquiry from the China Daily. (3) (Central News Agency asked) How will the Housing Management Committee handle unclaimed houses in the future? (Answer) Regarding the houses under the management of this committee, if no owner submits a property certificate to apply for return after a long period of time, how to deal with it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval of the method. (4) (Central News Agency asked) How is the rent received by the Housing Management Committee for the houses under its management handled? (Answer) The rent collected by this committee for the houses under its management has been resolved by the committee meeting of this committee and approved by the municipal government. In addition to returning 50% to the owner, the remaining 50%, in northern Shanghai, 10% is used for the residency fee of the Resident Group, 20% is used for the committee's expenses, and 20% is used for the committee's staff bonuses. In the southern city, 30% is used for the committee's expenses and 20% is used for the committee's staff bonuses. (5) (Central News Agency asked) How does the Housing Management Committee determine the ownership of houses with lost certificates? (Answer) If the owner loses the property certificate, they should apply to the Land Administration Bureau in accordance with the law, and this committee can obtain the certificate from the Land Administration Bureau before the ownership can be determined. (6) (China Daily asked) After the absentee owners' land and houses are registered, what are the disposal methods? (Answer) Although the committee has investigated the houses of absentee owners before, there may be omissions. Therefore, this registration is held so that the houses of owners who are not in Shanghai can be managed and rented by the committee to ensure that they are not occupied or damaged. If the owner returns to Shanghai and submits accurate property documents, they will be returned. In addition, it should be explained that in order to investigate whether the owner is present or absent, a comprehensive registration must be carried out, and then it can be known which owners are present and which are absent. Therefore, owners in Shanghai must register uniformly. (7) (China Daily asked) It is rumored that when applying for land registration for absentee owners, it is said that the registration has been stopped. Will it continue to be handled in the future? (Answer) This committee only handles house registration. Land registration has not been held. The rumor about land registration is probably a rumor.

### British Fleet's Strength is Weak; Will Follow in the Footsteps of the US Military; Minister Matsushima Delivers Speech

The Allied Forces' China Fleet Press Department held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday, receiving Chinese news reporters. Minister Matsushima reported on the battle situation on Leyte Island in the Philippines in the Pacific, and the situation of the battle for Leyte Island. The details are recorded on the left:

Philippine Battle Situation

The battle for Leyte Island in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy US is reinforcing Leyte Island, intending to attack Ormoc. Our army units are inflicting great blows on them. There has been considerable fierce fighting along the coast of Leyte Island. The enemy US is experiencing difficulties in supplying materials due to the excessive length of the supply line, especially all the airfields on the east coast of Leyte Island have been severely attacked by our army aircraft. According to the latest accurate news, the enemy US is extremely urgent and important for the replenishment of troops. When transport ships risk delivering them, they do not even send aircraft carriers to escort them, and the damage is obviously severe. In addition, the fleet commanded by British Admiral Fraser has now become the Pacific Fleet, the reasons for which are: first, the US Pacific Fleet has suffered great damage in the Philippines, and its strength is weak; second, the UK intends to fight for the right to speak after the war, but the British group has no strength and is not worth mentioning. Considering that the British fleet was only able to open to the Pacific after sinking the German battleship Tirpitz, Germany can contain the British fleet with one battleship, which is enough to show that the British fleet is weak and powerless. As a result, after the US Navy failed, the British Navy continued, but the British air power is weak and unable to fight, and it is inevitable to follow in the footsteps of failure. In the future, there will be many difficulties in the cooperation between the UK and the US, and they will undoubtedly fail in the war against Japan in the Pacific, especially their supply bases are very difficult. Although the UK claims to have two supply bases in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, these two places are extremely far from the war zone, and the transportation of agricultural products is even more difficult. Therefore, this time the UK organized the Pacific Fleet, creating a complicated situation between the UK and the US, which is harmful and not beneficial to both the UK and the US. It can be said that the UK is only protecting its past, present and future rights in the Pacific.

Impressions of Nanjing

I saw that the general youth in Nanjing are extremely enthusiastic about patriotism, which is very admirable. If there are good guides and protectors, they will make a great contribution to changing the fate of China. When passing through Zhenjiang, County Magistrate Huang Xiugu led cadres to listen to my speech on the current situation, which shows their concern for the current situation. Recently, I heard that some important Chinese figures will donate several aircraft. The Chinese people's thinking on air raids has also changed recently. They have realized that the aircraft are not from Chongqing, but from the United States, so they have a great aversion to them. Especially for the recent bombing of Hankou, which completely destroyed the lives and property of the Chinese people, the United States' ambition to control East Asia is clearly visible. Especially for the bombing of Changsha, I am extremely angry, and I am extremely sad for the innocent Chinese people who were victimized. When I was in Beijing, I watched the film of the bombing of Changsha with Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Lin Baisheng, and other important figures on the 12th. The scene was cruel, and the whole scene was extremely angry. After the Japanese army entered Changsha and the citizens returned, the enemy US planes bombed indiscriminately, causing Changsha city to be bombed into ruins. When the Chongqing army retreated from Changsha, it ordered the citizens to evacuate within two days, and all items could not be taken away, causing hundreds of thousands of people to have nothing on their bodies. Changsha was originally a cultural city and a political center, and this catastrophe shows the inhumanity of the enemy US.

### Readers' Scholarship News; Silver and Banking Circles Responded Enthusiastically Yesterday; 400,000 Yuan in Aid Received Yesterday

The "Special Fundraiser" for the Readers' Scholarship of this newspaper was enthusiastically supported by all parties yesterday, especially the banking circle, which donated generously, which is very admirable. For example, Tang Shoumin of Bank of Communications, Pan Sansheng of Lianyi Bank, and Feng Shaozhou of Yongxiang Money Shop sent letters one after another, expressing their support and donating generously to each team. It is expected that the banking circle will do its best to promote it in the future, so the fundraising work of this newspaper can proceed smoothly, and the more than 4,000 students who are eagerly awaited will be sincerely blessed. Mr. Feng Shouzhi, a pioneer in the money industry in this city, served as a director of the money industry for many years. He was enthusiastic about public welfare during his lifetime and paid special attention to education. After his death, his sons Feng Zuozhou and Feng Maiqun, who are now serving in the financial industry, inherited his father's will and established the Feng Shouzhi Public Goods Scholarship. This newspaper has received donations for each scholarship. In this special fundraising team, He He generously approved a team, donating and soliciting a total of 100,000 yuan, still in the name of the Feng Shouzhi Public Goods Scholarship Memorial Team. Filial piety and righteousness benefit future students, which is very admirable. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to achieve the goal of 20 million yuan, then the more than 4,000 poor students will be very fortunate, and this newspaper will be very fortunate.

Lang's Photo Exhibition Receives Favorable Reviews from All Walks of Life

The Lang Jingshan couple's photography and Chinese painting charity exhibition jointly organized by the News Daily and this newspaper has been open for six days in the Daxin Painting Hall. People from all walks of life come to visit every day, and the threshold is broken. Today is Saturday, and it is expected that there will be more guests. However, tomorrow is Sunday, and Daxin Company will be closed for a day as usual. According to Lang, the ten works dedicated to the Xin Shen Daily to help with the goods scholarship are the most proud of him and have won awards in international photography exhibitions. He hopes that enthusiastic people will purchase them in full to do their best to help poor students.

Xu's Charity Exhibition Last Three Days

The owner of Xu's Dao Yi Studio is selling paintings and cultural relics at the China Painting Academy on Chengdu Road to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his collection. There are more than 100 items each. The paintings include Shen Shitian, Xu Tianchi, Zeng Bochen, Wang Lianzhou, Shi Tao, Wu Meiqing, and even Lianfu Bonian in modern times. The antiques include Tu Wei, Inkstone, Seal Box, Chen Ink, Han Jade, Bamboo Carving, Agate, Purple Clay, and Eggplant Shell. All proceeds from the charity sale, except for the rent of the venue and the meals for the employees, are completely donated to the Shen Xin Daily to help with the goods scholarship and the various charitable causes it undertakes. Although it has been raining and snowing for days, gentlemen who are happy to do good have not abandoned it and have come to visit enthusiastically. Most of the cultural relics have been ordered, and a considerable number of paintings and calligraphy have also been sold. However, the exhibition period is short, and only three days are left. Gentlemen who love painting, do not miss it.

Bank Employees Express Great Sympathy

Han Cisheng of Shanghai Industrial Bank wrote: "Respected Editor, your newspaper is enthusiastic about public welfare and runs scholarships to benefit the Qing Sai, which is indescribably admirable. I think that today's Chinese students are all the backbone of society in their youth, and they are forced by the economy to drop out of school early to do business. I deeply feel that my talent and knowledge are shallow. I will do my best and offer a spare of 3,000 yuan, which I hope will be included in the scholarship item to encourage others to donate. I deeply hope that our vocational youth will respond enthusiastically, and each will donate as much as they can."

Also, Mr. Liu Zhizhi of the bank wrote: "Dear Editor: Your newspaper subsidizes Qing Sai students and prepares talents for the country, which is extremely admirable! I am also one of those who dropped out of school, and I deeply feel the pain of having no accomplishments in learning. Now I am fortunately a small employee of a bank. Although the price of goods is rising madly, my income is not enough to cover my expenses. However, in order to respond to your newspaper's request to start a collective donation by colleagues in the silver and money industry, I specially saved food and clothing and offered a portion of my salary for this month. I know that a drop in the bucket will not help, but I hope that those who have the power in the silver and money industry will continue."

Aid received yesterday Han Cisheng 3,000 yuan, Chu Zhizhi 1,000 yuan, Mr. Tao 500 yuan, Pu Qiting (Zhu Shanshi Kang Le) 100 yuan, a total of 4,600 yuan in savings certificates were received, and a balance of 6,843,648 yuan was saved.

Special Fundraising Team for the Eighth Shenbao Readers' Scholarship

The above totals 400,000 yuan Total of 1,960,000 yuan

(Teams 36 to 394 are the Feng Shouzhi Public Memorial Team)

Yesterday, Bank of Communications, Lianyi Bank, and Yongxiang Money Shop approved a total of six teams, as described in the previous article. In addition, Taihexiang, Huang Zhendong, Fengji, Yuhua Tobacco Factory, New Asia Printing Factory, and Huachang Chemical Factory (the above three teams were solicited by Mr. Liu Jingchuan of Continental Advertising Company) each approved one team. The enthusiasm for helping students cannot be overstated.

### Preliminary Discussion on Improving National Medicine and Maintaining National Health

— Ren

Since the war, medicine has almost become a privileged monopoly; the lower and middle classes, once selected for disease, initially delay in the hope of self-healing by chance, causing treatable diseases to become incurable. Or they use harmful and useless elixirs as a life bet, alas! If we were to statistically account the number of poverty-stricken citizens dying in vain, the figure would be certain to make one sigh!

If we look again at the national medicine community, which has the vocation of saving people, in addition to a portion being exploited by privileged groups due to historical or capital reasons, the plight of medical practitioners in rural areas is no better than that of elementary school teachers, and the sluggishness of pharmacies is beyond the understanding of outsiders. Why is this tragic situation of deformity and contradiction like this? Where does the crux lie? Let us briefly state the following:

(1) Poor people lose their productive capacity after falling ill, and the family's expenses and food are still indispensable. If they delay seeking medical treatment and taking medicine, it is impossible.

(2) Those medical practitioners who are at the peak of their careers raise their consultation fees to show their status, thereby limiting access. Therefore, the poor and sick will retreat in the face of such circumstances. Those with sluggish business are almost in a state of hidden poverty. If there are people seeking treatment, they will use quackery methods to defraud, in order to make up for the shortcomings in their business income. Thus, even if the poor and sick can raise money to respond, they can only do it once and not again.

The above two items are indeed the trend of a part of the national medical community, although there are also those who live up to their "benevolent heart and benevolent art," but they are ultimately a minority.

(3) The business of national pharmacies is originally more profitable than other national businesses. Those with large capital and long history are dedicated to serving the upper class, so they do not worry about declining business even if the prices are very high. (However, this is unique to cities and is ultimately a minority.) Most of them use inferior materials, or their facades are not magnificent, and they specialize in serving lower-class customers. Before the war, the price difference between large pharmacies and small pharmacies was more than half. To this day, there may still be this phenomenon in suburban areas. Taking Shanghai as an example, large pharmacies manipulate the industry association, and the marked prices must be uniform, so the poor and sick cannot afford it even more. If you look at the statistics of internal medicine and surgery seeking treatment from various charity groups that provide free diagnosis and medicine today, they can be equal. If only diagnosis is provided without medicine, only external diseases will be treated (because there are usually special medicines for external diseases), and internal medicine will be extremely few, all because the price of medicine is too high. This is not a rumor, but there is an example to cite!

With these three, the poor and sick groan and cry out, no longer like human beings, or they live for many years with illness, and there is no day for the nation's health to improve. The national medicine community also has no comprehensive development into a proper and bright state. But now that we know the cruel cause, is there no way to reverse it? Saying: No, we can treat the abuses! Preliminary discussions are as follows, for the reference of people from all walks of life and the authorities:

It must be known that sick families cannot afford medical treatment, but it is not that there are no doctors; doctors have no one seeking treatment, but it is not that there are no patients. Patients cannot afford medicine, but it is not that there are no pharmacies; pharmacies have sluggish business, but it is not that there are no patients. The key is to propose methods, namely free medical treatment and affordable dispensing of medicine.

Free medical treatment Investigate the number of medical practitioners, and assign them in proportion. For example, if a town has 1,000 households and 5 doctors, each doctor is responsible for treating the patients in 200 households (specify a certain time). If some of them can afford medical treatment on their own, they do not need to be treated at will. Or the doctors in this town can cooperate in one place for free diagnosis. It can also be done. Adapt to the time and place to seek convenience and benefits, and adapt to the situation. The consultation fee for doctors is hoped that the municipal authorities or local gentry will be responsible for it, and strive to adapt to the local living standards, otherwise abuses will definitely not be avoided.

Affordable dispensing of medicine The price of national medicine has recently increased by about 300% compared with the previous month. If we want to seek affordable dispensing of medicine, we do not need to rely on medicine dealers, but we hope that people from all walks of life and those who are enthusiastic about public welfare will establish affordable national medicine shops. The selling price must be more than half lower than ordinary national medicine (real money). Now, the cost of each catty of medicine in pharmacies is 100 yuan, and the selling price of each tael is also close to 100 yuan. Even if the processing, cutting, and other expenses are added, if people are used properly, there is still profit to be made. Since the price of medicine is cheap, there must be many civilians seeking dispensing. From this, we can predict that it will be easy to labor without spending, and the price of medicine can be controlled.

Social Services

### Enthusiastically Respond to Winter Relief

(1) Mr. Lin Ruiting wrote in a letter: "Dear Editor, I previously handled the clearing of the accounts of Tongqing Money Shop, which has been closed after each shareholder paid up according to their shares. Now, Mr. Yu Zhendong, a shareholder, has handed over National Currency 50,000 yuan to Mr. Zhang Rongchu as my remuneration. I am afraid of offending his kindness, so I dare not refuse it firmly. I specially transferred this amount in Mr. Yu's name to assist your newspaper and the five religious groups in jointly organizing winter relief funds, so as to create blessings for Mr. Yu. This amount is entrusted to Mr. Wang Boyuan for transfer. Please collect it."

(2) Mr. Ying Yongyu, in order to support the winter relief in this newspaper, in addition to soliciting 20,000 yuan from Mr. Fang Zijun of Fuzhong Company, and other donations, he and his son, etc., saved money to assist in response, and the enthusiasm is admirable. He wrote in a letter: "I recently heard that your newspaper launched a campaign to provide porridge and clothes. Although I am a salary earner with not much income, I have a compassionate heart. I specially saved the cost of vegetables and meals, etc., and obtained 600 yuan in two days, and raised 2,400 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan, which I will send to your office as winter relief funds, to fulfill the obligation of mutual assistance between human beings. I hope everyone will respond, gather a little to make a lot, and accumulate sand to form a tower, then the effect will be great. I especially hope that the wealthy and large merchants will save on medical expenses when they encounter birthdays, weddings, and festivals, and help the poor, then the merit of benefiting people and helping things will be small."

### Distribution of Food Certificates at Various Porridge Distribution Points

In addition to entrusting various charities to distribute porridge at (1) World Military Porridge Factory, No. 180 Xiamen Road, (2) China Education Righteousness Association, No. 98 Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road, (3) Si Men Guandi Temple, (4) CaJiadu Bailinan Road Liuliu Lane No. 6 since the 10th of this month, we have recently added Pudong Dongchang Road District, Yangshupu Meizhou Roadkou Hudong Commune, and Huai'an Road Wuding Road Chengping Lane No. 25 Mingde Righteousness Association to distribute porridge, biscuits, and sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains, etc. All are handled by the respective places for registration, distribution of food certificates, and queuing for food on a daily basis, and the order is quite good.

### Respond to Good Deeds

(1) Funeral Expenses to Help Good Deeds Mr. Peng Zifeng, with morality and literature, was respected by the world. He was enthusiastic about public welfare and loved to do good throughout his life. Unfortunately, he passed away far away, and the old man passed away, which was a pity for those who heard about it. His son, Mr. Yousheng, collected 120,000 yuan in funeral expenses from relatives and friends and transferred it to charity. In addition to donating 10,000 yuan to this office's medical assistance fund for elementary school teachers, he also donated 100,000 yuan to the Nantong Road China Education Righteousness Association for porridge distribution, and 10,000 yuan to An Yang Nian Fo Tang, adding up to the above number. Mr. Zifeng's legacy is in the hearts of the people, and we are extremely admired.

(2) Pray for Blessings for Parents Mr. and Mrs. Gao Yi wrote in a letter: "Dear Editor, the 15th of the month is my son's first birthday. For the past year, due to the love of my son, I have experienced the kindness of my parents in raising and nurturing me. Therefore, I specially donated National Currency 10,000 yuan to your office's medical assistance fund to pray for blessings for my parents. Although the amount is small, it expresses my heart." Mr. and Mrs. Gao Yi, because of their love for their son and their thoughts of filial piety, are admirable.
