### Editorial: Reading Mr. Tokutomi Sohō's "Idle Talk on the Current Situation"

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō is a veteran in the Allied Japanese press, highly respected for his moral character and literary accomplishments. Recently, he published an article titled "Idle Talk on the Current Situation" in the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, which is of great value. This newspaper has specially translated it and is publishing it in installments (see today's second edition). Mr. Tokutomi's words are candid and straightforward encouragement to the Japanese government and people. We are not flattering Japan, nor are we belittling ourselves. Whether it is in terms of political, economic, and cultural measures, or social phenomena, people's livelihood, and so on, comparing Japan and China, there is no doubt that China lags far behind. However, after reading Mr. Tokutomi's article, we see that he still sharply criticizes Japan's current situation. Looking back at our own situation, our criticisms and the resulting reactions only make us feel more ashamed.

Han Yu said: "The gentlemen of ancient times were strict and comprehensive in their demands on themselves, and lenient and concise in their treatment of others. Strict and comprehensive demands lead to diligence; lenient and concise treatment encourages people to do good." Because "self-discipline" can be "strict and comprehensive," one can be "diligent" in everything concerning oneself. This means "strict self-discipline." Mr. Tokutomi prepared his own country with "strict and comprehensive" demands, hoping to arouse the "diligent" spirit of his people. At the same time, when the government and people heard his advice, they would certainly not find it annoying. Such a candid attitude of "not concealing" and "not embellishing" only makes us feel more ashamed.

We believe that Mr. Tokutomi's words are actually something that we Chinese should accept. Here, we specially quote them as follows:

He said, "People only talk about extraordinary times, extraordinary times, but their behavior remains the same as in peacetime." This is something that each of us should deeply ask ourselves and awaken to. We have repeatedly proposed "practicing wartime living," but everyone turns a blind eye and does not care. How can we compete with the enemy if we are enthusiastic about enjoying peacetime life during wartime? He also said, "But there are people in and out of the government who, not to mention bowing and scraping to bear the work of ten people, can even be found everywhere who bear the work of a hundred people without complaint." What about us? How many people in and out of the government are willing to do the work of ten or a hundred people? Comparing this with their "found everywhere," what can we say?

Secondly, he said, "If a fire breaks out here, the first goal in such a situation is to put out the flames, to prevent the spread of the fire, and to minimize the damage as much as possible. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, the first and greatest task must be to carry water buckets and hand buckets, constantly pouring water nearby to extinguish the fire. At this time, it goes without saying that the whole family should be mobilized, and even the neighbors on the left and right must be fully mobilized, and even people nearby should do so. Today's situation is far more than this, and it is not as trivial as a fire in one family. Rather, it is the autumn of national survival. In such a situation, without waiting for the coercion of others, without waiting for the orders of the government authorities, without waiting for the command of superiors, everyone should spontaneously and desperately strive, which is an unavoidable duty." We have a great feeling about this passage. Since the enemy America launched the so-called Pacific counter-offensive, Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US fleet, has even advocated using the Chinese mainland as a base to counterattack Japan. At the same time, the US fleet is eager to approach the Chinese mainland to realize its plan. On the one hand, Allied Japan, in order to ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War, naturally counterattacks this ambition of the enemy America. Under such circumstances, our Chinese mainland is very likely to become a battlefield. Here, we must work together to defeat our enemies. First, without a doubt, the United States is the common enemy of us East Asians. The US military has gradually expanded its power in the Chongqing area, attempting to occupy the Chinese mainland as a base for attacking Japan. Their purpose is to restore their old forces of aggression in East Asia after defeating Japan. If Japan is defeated, then China will naturally be dominated by its aggressive forces and fall into slavery. If we say that after Japan is defeated, the enemy America will give China freedom, this is a completely deceptive and delusional statement, and only a few people in Chongqing believe it! Second, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been clearly stated in the declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference, which is that East Asians are fighting for survival, freedom, and happiness. The enemy's war aims are entirely to restore aggression and continue to enslave the people of East Asia. From the standpoint of us East Asians, we can clearly distinguish which war aims to abandon and which to follow, without the need for tedious words. Third, since China and Japan abandoned their past grievances and commonly realized the mistakes of brothers quarreling within the walls, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, using facts to resolve the past estrangement between the two countries. After this turning point, in order to ensure the freedom and happiness of all East Asians, we must fight to the death against the common enemy whose purpose is to invade and enslave East Asians, no matter in any corner of East Asia, until they are destroyed.

Under such circumstances, enemy America uses Chongqing to expand its power, verbally advocating that its target is to attack Japan, but in reality, it still aims to enslave East Asia. We should use our reason to judge and clearly recognize that if the Chinese mainland becomes a battlefield, and the local people of China suffer from devastation, it is the enemies, Britain and America. Then we will cooperate with our allies and fight with all our strength to minimize the damage and thoroughly resolve the hidden worries and crises of being enslaved by Britain and America again. Just like the fire that Mr. Tokutomi compared, it is a fire deliberately set by Britain and America to fulfill their ambitions. We will, regardless of men, women, old, or young, carry water buckets and hand buckets, constantly drawing water, and mobilize all our efforts to put out the fire. This is indeed an unavoidable duty.

Original Text of the Special Court's Verdict

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The case of Hu Dachun, former Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and Zheng, former Director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, for crimes such as embezzlement, has been handed over to a special court for trial by order of the National Government, and the trial has now concluded, sentencing them to death. The original text of the special court's verdict is now Qian Hou:

Verdict of the Special Court of the National Government, Special Character No. 1 of the 33rd year. Defendant Hu Dachun, male, 40 years old, native of Tianchang County, Anhui Province. Residing at No. 1 Le Residence, Xishan Chang Lane, Suzhou, former Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province. Zheng, male, 40 years old, native of Wu County, Jiangsu Province. Residing at No. 29, Lane 280, Futong Road, Shanghai, former Director of the Rice Grain Procurement and Sales Office of the Jiangsu-Song-Chang-Jia District of the Ministry of Food.

The judgment of this court on the case of the above defendants for crimes such as embezzlement is as follows:

Main text Hu Dachun jointly speculated and manipulated military supplies and daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, which was sufficient to hinder supply and demand relations, sentenced to death, and deprived of civil rights for life. Zheng jointly and continuously intended to make profits during wartime, speculated and manipulated daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, which was sufficient to hinder supply and demand relations, sentenced to death, and deprived of civil rights for life, one Western-style suit, four ties, and one pair of cotton shoes were confiscated.

Bribes and illicit profits of National Currency 7,419,458.538 yuan were recovered and confiscated from Hu Dachun, and National Currency 5,600,000 yuan was recovered and confiscated from Zheng.

Facts Hu Dachun was the Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he ordered 1,000 shi of brown rice from Shi Kaizeng, a rice merchant in Qingpu County, at 280 yuan per shi, and prepaid a check for 280,000 yuan. When the price of rice gradually reached 900 yuan per shi, Hu Dachun plotted to profit from it and instructed Shi Kaizeng to hand over the rice money instead of delivering the rice. Shi Kaizeng then issued a check for 300,000 yuan and subsequently delivered 130,000 yuan in cash to Hua Chuangqiu, a prostitute in Suzhou, in early October. Hu Dachun then withdrew 10,000 yuan from the cash and bought a Western-style suit and four ties in Shanghai. He bought a pair of cotton shoes in Suzhou. Later, because one of the checks could not be cashed, he only actually obtained a bribe of 430,000 yuan. On March 27th of the same year, Hu Dachun ordered Tang Keming, the magistrate of Songjiang County, to purchase 30,000 shi of rice. The magistrate actually received 32,000 shi. Geng Jiaji informed him to falsely report a smaller amount, so Tang Keming only reported 22,163 shi to the Joint Venture. After Hu Dachun approved it, Geng Jiaji and Tang Keming colluded to sell the remaining 9,836 shi for profit and gave Hu Dachun a bribe of 800,000 yuan. (150,000 yuan, Hu Dachun alone obtained a bribe of 200,000 yuan. (To be continued)

Philippine Compilation of New Budget

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - After the reform of the administrative structure, the Philippine government is actively compiling the budget for the 1944 fiscal year. According to the Philippine Information Bureau, the budget for the current department for that year has been decided to be a total of 58,238,884 pesos, which is a reduction of 8,176,586 pesos compared to the 59,115,470 pesos of departmental expenses decided by the Philippine Congress before the reform of the administrative structure. The reason why such a huge budget can still be reduced despite the establishment of the new Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and other bureaus is the reduction of expenditures centered on personnel expenses by eliminating redundant personnel in various departments or dispersing them to local areas. This result is sufficient to represent the Philippine government's determination to fight.

Guangzhou Border Area Starts Cleaning Up

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) - The troops under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Pacification Director's Office started the cleaning-up work in the areas surrounding Guangzhou on February 20.

### Japanese Army Implements New Operation on the Central Indo-Burmese Border, Launching a General Attack on Don Zaun from Three Sides

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from the Burmese front on the 15th states that the Japanese army's preemptive operation on the central Indo-Burmese border is proceeding extremely smoothly. The elite Japanese troops have formed an encirclement around the British Indian 17th Division entrenched in the area south of Don Zaun. The annihilation of the enemy troops in that area is only a matter of time. This operation is of great significance, with two meanings: Annihilating the British Indian army in Don Zaun and the area south of it is equivalent to cutting off the enemy troops within the Burmese border, thereby ensuring the security of Burma and preventing the enemy from acting from that area. After the Japanese army destroys the enemy troops south of Don Zaun, it will not be threatened from the side when attacking the Bay of Bengal. At the same time, it will make the operation easier to carry out and establish close contact with the actions of the Japanese army in the Kaladan River Valley. Due to the above-mentioned influence, the Japanese army's new operation can echo the offensive against the enemy's rear from the Kaladan side. The British Indian 15th Army Corps in a certain key point in the Bay of Bengal is still continuing to plot a counter-offensive in the Bukitdon area, and its rear will inevitably feel a major threat due to this operation.

Rangoon, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to cut off the retreat route of the main force of the enemy 17th Division near Tiddim, the Japanese army is currently advancing westward through the mountainous area east of Don Zaun, urgently pursuing the fleeing enemy troops. On the 12th, they reached the mountains surrounding Don Zaun, and on the morning of the 13th, they launched a general attack on Don Zaun from the east, southeast, and northeast, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy troops. The Japanese army advancing from the left is currently attacking from the southwest of Don Zaun. It is only a matter of time before Don Zaun falls. The enemy's 17th Division, numbering about 10,000, is now extremely disheveled.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - A message from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front: The Indian National Army, under the strong support of the Japanese army, has begun operations from the Haka area. In order to attack the rear of the 81st Division of the West African Army, they have begun an attack from the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, destroying the enemy in the area and continuing to advance towards the Burmese border.

### Decisive Battle Stage on Burmese Border Gradually Intensifies, Battle Line Stretches Over a Thousand Kilometers

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - A message from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front: The Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border has launched an offensive against the British army operating in the Lingqiu Ridge area. The decisive battle on the Burmese border is gradually entering a stage of intensification on a long battle line stretching approximately 1,000 kilometers from Arakan in the south to Fugong in the north. The enemy's wild cry for a counter-offensive in Burma has now turned into a dream. On the other hand, the enemy's defense in southern India is facing a considerable crisis. In order to reverse the crisis, the enemy army is still sending its elite 7th and 5th Divisions to attack the Mendo and Bukitdon areas, attempting to recapture Jilgye and advance its base for counter-attacking Burma. However, due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the enemy 7th Division has collapsed, and its 5th Division has also been attacked by the Japanese suicide squad and fallen into chaos. Therefore, the enemy's offensive attempt has been destroyed. The West African Army was lured by the Japanese army to the intermediate zone of Kakhert and Apokwa, was severely attacked by the Japanese army, and fell into a state of chaos. It is now trying to escape towards Barretwa, but the Japanese army has occupied the northwest highlands of Kakhert and is gradually compressing its semi-circular encirclement net with another unit of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in the Chin Hills land area has crushed the enemy that began to operate from Don Zaun since the start of the full-scale operation, so the threat from the side has been removed. The Japanese army in the Haka area has reached the upper reaches of the Garas River, and at the same time, it is cooperating with the Indian National Army to continue to advance towards Chittagong. The Indian National Army in the southern Indo-Burmese border has also arrived at the border area with various elite units of the Japanese army. The enemy army is making a desperate resistance against the Japanese army in the Garas area. The enemy 26th Division has been urgently transferred to the Bukitdon area to stop the Japanese army's attack, but its formation has been greatly disrupted by the Japanese suicide squad attack. According to the enemy army's strength in that area, there were 5th, 7th, 81st, and 26th Divisions at the start of the war, all of which were dispatched to the front of Jilgye, but all were ambushed by the Japanese army. Even its reserve forces in the rear are quite weak. Therefore, the enemy army's crisis is very serious. Therefore, the elite of the Indian National Army is now preparing to break through the enemy's weak line, and the Japanese army in the rear is also calmly preparing for the next operation. It is also said that the Chongqing army in the southern area is now building fortifications, preparing defenses, and defending against the Japanese army's attack. However, the Japanese army is elite. From the above information, it can be known that the defense of the Indian border and its domestic political crisis have become increasingly uneasy.

### Javanese Military and Civilians Become One, Cooperatively Promoting Wartime Measures

Jakarta, 15th (Central News Agency) - Two years have passed since the conquest of Java. Thanks to the prevalence of the Japanese military administration and the implementation of various meticulous plans, the important mission of strengthening its military power has been gradually realized. The formation of the Volunteer Labor Corps and the expansion of the Police Defense Corps and the Youth Corps have further strengthened the defense posture of the entire region and ensured security. The militarization of supplies and the strengthening of transportation capacity, with concentrated production as the center, are also moving forward according to the predetermined goals. In particular, since the establishment of the Javanese Public Service Association, a central conference was held in Jakarta in less than a month. The guidelines decided by the conference are as follows: In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, exert all efforts to overcome all difficulties. Maintain the spirit of public service in order to thoroughly implement various military administration measures. Without distinction between regions, wholeheartedly and with one mind and one heart, build a new Java in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In this way, military officials and civilians, as well as Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians, are all united, and the Japanese military administration agencies are internally and externally integrated, promoting wartime measures. It is worth looking forward to in terms of Java's defense and increased production.

### Military Headquarters Meeting in Malaya

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to the current war situation and review important issues under military administration, the Malayan Military Administration Department convened a conference of department heads of the Military Administration Supervisory Department, as well as state governors, police chiefs, and industry chiefs from the 16th to the 18th of this month at a certain location.

### Churchill Reports on the Irish Situation

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Hai News Agency: British Prime Minister Churchill's travel restrictions are the first step in isolating Southern Ireland from Britain and the outside world. The United States has asked Ireland to close the Axis embassies and consulates in Dublin, which he fully supports. The U.S. government is constantly reporting on this issue to the British government. The United States is taking the initiative, but the British government is constantly offering suggestions. The British government has long since taken various measures to reduce the danger caused by the presence of Axis representatives in Ireland. "But now is the time to improve these measures."

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: According to a New York correspondent's commentary from Zurich, the U.S. government is coercing Ireland. U.S. government observers claim that this move by the United States is only part of its actions towards the world. It is acting similarly towards Argentina and Spain. It is expected that in the near future, the United States will take action against other European countries that remain neutral.

### Fierce Fighting in the Bug River Basin; Germans Improve Positions; Garrison Retreats from Kerson

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 14th: Although the Soviet offensive on the central and northern front, stretching 1,200 kilometers from Gomel to Narva Bay, has stalled, fierce fighting continues on the southern front along a 600-kilometer line in front of the Bug River. The Soviets, with superior forces, attacked the main German positions in the area between Pogrebische and Novy Bng, southwest of Krivoy Rog, and the riverbanks between Vinnitsa and Nikolayev. However, the Germans have conducted an organized avoidance operation. German rearguard units, in order to stop the Soviets, have crushed their attempts to break through. After fierce defensive battles, the German forces in that area have improved their positions according to plan. In the northern part of the Bug front, the Soviets are currently attacking the German positions in the Starokonstantinov district, but due to the German reinforcement of defensive positions in the area, the Soviets have suffered heavy losses. German forces have driven Soviet troops out of the streets of Ternopol and are continuing fierce fighting east of the city. The Soviets have been trying to encircle the city since the 11th and are currently sending reinforcements. In the southern part of the Bug River, southeast of Krivoy Rog, the Soviets are attempting to advance towards the Inhul and Inhulec rivers. Elsewhere, the Soviets are intensifying pressure on German forces in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. However, the German forces, in order to improve their positions, have retreated to the city of Nikolayev.

### Soviet Recognition of the Batista Regime; German Official Commentary

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the 14th, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the Soviet government's recognition of the Batista regime. Chairman Stalin, disregarding the United Kingdom and the United States, unilaterally recognized the Batista regime, while the United Kingdom often claims the Mediterranean as the lifeline of the British Empire. This time, due to the Soviet Union's recognition of the Italian puppet regime, the British government seems to be panicking. The Soviet Union also insisted on its own views when recognizing the Turgut regime, causing the United Kingdom and the United States to take the same measures. It is expected that after the Soviet Union recognizes the Italian puppet regime, its voice in southern Italy will be strengthened. King Emmanuel III sold out the Fascist Party in order to maintain his throne and is now attempting to follow Stalin to eke out a living. The Italian people are truly in danger of being communized.

### Naval Battle in the Strait of Dunkirk

### Random Thoughts on the Current Situation

— Tokutomi Sohō

The elder statesman of the Allied Japanese press, Tokutomi Sohō, is a guest of the Japan Mainichi Shimbun, and has repeatedly written articles for the newspaper, which are highly sought after and respected. Our newspaper has repeatedly translated and reprinted them. Recently, Mr. Tokutomi wrote another article, "Random Thoughts on the Current Situation," which is quite valuable.

Germany's Newly Built Sea-Air Amphibious Airship Shows Its Strengths on the Front Lines

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a magazine run by the German Aviation Department, the largest airship in Germany, the BA-222, is equipped with six motors, a two-story hull, 37 meters long, 5.6 meters high, and a wingspan of 46 meters. The rear rudder is very high, and it floats 10 meters above the water. The lower floor can accommodate 100 fully armed soldiers, while the upper floor has a spacious cockpit and pilot's room. The airship is equipped with many steel cannons and machine guns. This sea-air amphibious airship has already shown its strengths on the front lines.

It is unwise to talk about this as an 'emergency situation' anymore. The emergency is already here, right before our eyes. The enemy has already thrown everything they have at trying to break through what could be called Japan's 'Maginot Line' at sea. Really, this is the time to destroy the enemy. Before we act decisively, we don't need to be afraid, we don't need to be surprised, we don't need to panic. We have to rely on our own strength.

That is to say, in words we talk about an emergency, but in action we remain the same as ever, as if it were peacetime. Of course, we're not talking about everyone. For example, the thoroughness of those tightening the reins is one example. There are also more than a few officials, I think, who are no less than the Prime Minister. And it's the same with those out of office. Never mind exerting yourself to take on the work of ten people; there are those who take on the work of a hundred people without any hardship, everywhere you go. But the most regrettable thing is that the attitude of most people in general remains the same. Of course, everywhere you look, you can see a lot of departments being merged, names being changed, agencies being revised and so on, but when you get right down to it, it's nothing but window-dressing, and the content remains the same: a truly superficial phenomenon of 'new bottle, old wine'. Because it's like this, today we're not afraid to repeat ourselves, to speak out bluntly and frankly, that to adapt to our nation's hour of need, of crisis between survival and extinction, we must have our hundred million people be of one mind and one heart, express a great determination for this emergency situation, sacrifice the great price of this emergency situation, and carry out the great labor of this emergency situation. This is something that we are truly compelled to do.

If a fire breaks out here, the first goal is to extinguish the flames, to prevent the fire from spreading, and to minimize the damage as much as possible. Regardless of gender, age, or size, the first and greatest task must be to get buckets, hand-buckets, and constantly pour water nearby to put out the fire. At times like these, it goes without saying that the whole family will mobilize, and even those around us will do the same, and even the neighbors nearby should do this as well. This situation today is more serious than that. It is not an insignificant thing like a fire breaking out at home. It is a question of the life and death of the nation and the people. Under these circumstances, without waiting for others to force us, without waiting for the government's orders, without waiting for the commands of our superiors, everyone should spontaneously, desperately exert themselves. This is an unavoidable duty. But today, however, there are still those who are carefree, unconcerned with the seriousness of the situation, which is truly infuriating and heartbreaking.

Red tape is not unique to Japan's culture; it is a common ailment throughout the world. But this ailment still exists firmly in today's emergency. According to what we've heard, those in charge are themselves troubled by the cumbersome machinery, which is truly a situation of 'self-imposed restrictions'. Therefore, capable officials are always racking their brains, thinking about how they can skillfully jump over these iron barriers, how they can cut through them decisively and pass through smoothly, and how they can skillfully evade them. To put it more bluntly, how can they cleverly avoid the trouble of numerous checkpoints and procedures? This is the first priority at present. If the authorities themselves are fond of red tape, then the trouble for the people is indescribable.

In short, those who recognize this emergency situation are not necessarily all civil servants. There are also such people among the common people. Things like personal gain and happiness, in the face of national crisis, are discarded like worn-out shoes, and they only care about serving the country. Looking at it from the perspective of education, just as the Eighty-Fourth Diet has discussed, textbooks for middle school English and the like still teach the ideas of enemy nations, such as "God, please grant victory to the King of England!" But what is most strange is that these are textbooks that have been approved by the Ministry of Education. If this isn't the same old way, what is? Examples of this kind are too numerous to list. In short, one part of the nation has already awakened to the seriousness of the situation, while other parts remain the same as before. In theory, it is said that we are now a nation of one hundred million people fighting together, but in reality, all those with a sense of justice absolutely cannot say that is how it is.

In short, since the middle of the time of bandit rule, the so-called 'rule of law' has already become the highest principle of the Japanese nation. In order to achieve this goal, it is not people controlling the law, but the law controlling people. Therefore, no matter how perfect the law is, if people's thinking doesn't change, the old ways will never change. Originally, people act according to common sense, and thus common sense bears more responsibility than people themselves. To push everything onto the law, to use the law as a shield and the law as a spear, and for people to only be watchers of the law, watching the law work, then we still cannot speak of things being on the right track. No matter how simple the law is made, if humanity itself isn't simplified, even if there is an earth-shattering revolution, it will be nothing more than a revolution in name only. No matter how cumbersome the laws are, if humanity itself bears the responsibility, if humanity itself is willing to carry out affairs according to common sense, then all the laws will come alive. That is to say, there is law because there are people. It is not that there are people because there is law. We are not saying that now is an emergency situation, and that we should disregard all laws, do as we please, and act recklessly. We are simply saying that we should make active use of the law. However, this active use is done by people. Therefore, if we truly want to recognize the emergency situation, if we do not first establish a new world in the government, in the general population, that is based on talent, common sense, and responsibility, I believe that we will absolutely not be able to save the country from crisis. That is the reason why I am loudly and urgently calling for respect for talent today. (To be continued) (Translated from the February 11th Mainichi Shimbun by Lu)

### Shanghai Rice Control Association is Actively Planning to Appropriately Increase the Allotment of Rice Rations.

The Shanghai Rice Control Association (SRCA), in response to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's request to increase rice rations, hereby transcribes the original text of its reply: "In accordance with your government's official letter No. 14464 from Shanghai, briefly stating that the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has requested an increase in rice rations for households, and requesting our review and reply. We have reviewed this matter and find that our association is comprehensively planning the collection and distribution of rice. In the future, within the possible range, we will strive to appropriately increase rice rations for households. Correspondingly, we are hereby replying, hoping that you will take note of this and inform the relevant parties."

Formulating Measures to Prevent Rice Smuggling

In addition, in order to eliminate smuggling, the SRCA has specially formulated "Measures for Managing the Transportation and Sale of Rice and for Handling Confiscations and Fines": 1. These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 90 and 92 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. 2. The confiscated rice by local enforcement agencies should be quickly handed over to the SRCA at the local purchase price. Items other than rice should be quickly transferred to the Trade Control Association at the current market price. 3. The proceeds from the transfer of confiscated goods and fines will be fully handed over to the provincial government. However, in accordance with Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Transportation and Sales, the bonuses to be awarded to informants will be allocated from these funds. However, the method of allocating bonuses when confiscations and fines are carried out by enforcement agencies other than Chinese ones (consulates, police, Japanese military police) should be determined by the relevant enforcement agency in consultation with the provincial government. 4. When the provincial government obtains confiscated goods or fines, it should promptly report the facts and their handling methods to the National Government and notify the Military Liaison Department, the Trade Control Association, and the SRCA.

### The Enemy's Defeat in Various Battles on the Burmese Front - Remarks from the Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department

Central News Agency: The regular press conference of the Press Department of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai was held yesterday (the 15th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. Lieutenant Sakamoto, Akahoshi, and others from the Press Department of the Army were present. The spokesman of the Press Department gave a very detailed account of the situation on the Burmese battlefield and the enemy's defeat. The details are as follows:

Skillful Operations in Attacking the Enemy

The spokesman first gave a detailed explanation of the enemy's cooperation and the Japanese army's skillful operations on the Burmese battlefield. He said that the enemy's forces in Burma consisted of British Indian troops, British troops, West African troops, American infantry, and troops from Chongqing commanded by Stilwell, scattered in various battlefields in Burma. The details of their battles with the Japanese army and the results of the Japanese army have been reported in detail. The Japanese army has given them a painful blow through skillful operations. Looking at the war situation in Burma today, there are the following meanings: 1. Burma's national defense has gradually been consolidated, and the Burmese people are determined to win. 2. The damage to the enemy is very substantial, especially the British Indian troops, whose losses are particularly severe and cannot be revived. 3. The war situation in Burma has had a great impact on the Indian people. As a result, the Indian people have lost faith in the British, causing a strong anti-British sentiment. Moreover, due to the relationship between the Free Indian National Army and the Japanese army fighting side by side, the impact on the entire India is very large, and the anti-British sentiment of the Indian masses is becoming more and more激昂. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma is in fact completely impossible. At the same time, the support sought by Chongqing has also become difficult. Therefore, the failure of the enemy on the Burmese front has also had a great impact on the psychology of the people in Chongqing and has caused them to doubt the British. In summary, the anti-Axis forces have suffered deep blows in terms of material and spiritual resources. The enemy has boasted of building the Ledo Road as a goal and said that it would be built during the war. However, after this blow, it has all gone up in smoke.

The Construction of the Ledo Road Is Difficult to Achieve

The spokesman then explained the situation of the Ledo Road, saying that Chongqing's supply line initially relied on the Burma Road, which was destroyed by the Japanese army's operations in Burma, making it difficult for Chongqing to use. Therefore, they planned to build the Ledo Road to Chongqing via India. The road connects to Calcutta in India, and from there the railway runs to Ledo, then through Fort Hertz, Hukawng Valley, and Tarong, Mong-Ko, Myitkyina, and then to a section of the Yunnan-Burma Road before reaching Chongqing. As for the construction situation, the section from Ledo to Tarong has been mostly completed, but there are still 260 kilometers from Tarong to the India-Chongqing border that have not yet been completed. The enemy dreamed of completing the construction of the Ledo Road in order to launch a counter-offensive against Japan. However, not only has the road not been completed, but it has also been destroyed by the Japanese army in many places along the way. Therefore, future construction will be fraught with difficulties and will be very difficult to achieve. Therefore, through the Japanese army's surprising victories, it first completely secured the area south of Mong-Ko and launched attacks at any time, so the enemy's wishful thinking will definitely not become a reality. According to recent reports from the Burmese battlefield, the Japanese army, in absolute victory, has put an end to the Arakan. In addition, the Japanese army has thoroughly annihilated the enemy in the Kaladan and Fort Hertz valleys, as well as the Kin-Nga River (i.e. the Chin Hills), a tributary of the Irrawaddy River in central Burma.

The Defeat in Burma Affects Chongqing

The spokesman also criticized the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao for its ridiculous claim on March 9 that the Chongqing Expeditionary Force's two major goals of Bhamo and Myitkyina were to reopen the supply line in Burma. Looking at the recent situation of the enemy, the Japanese army has skillfully used operational strategies to encircle the enemy in the vicinity of Mong-Ko and completely cut off the Ledo Road that the enemy was building. Therefore, analyzing this combat fact and the enemy's propaganda, it is fully proven that the enemy has ended in failure. They have not only failed militarily, but Chongqing has been shaken, and the Burmese war has had a great impact on the economic aspect. Prices in Kunming and Guilin have soared sharply. Therefore, the Japanese army's great victory in Burma is not only of great significance militarily, but also politically, socially, and economically. In addition, the United States is also very regretful about this. The appearance of American infantry on the East Asian mainland battlefield is still for the first time, and they have combat experience in the Southwest Pacific. This time, on the East Asian mainland battlefield, the Japanese army has skillfully defeated them, causing the American army to suffer a setback. Recalling the past, the United States made a major publicity campaign, wanting to turn the Chinese mainland into a base for operations against Japan and prepare to launch an offensive against Japan. The first attempt has ended in failure. Therefore, the plan for its future implementation will be re-prepared, which will be even more difficult.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### Order and Discipline

A free economy collapses and cannot be sustained due to its excessive disorder; a controlled economy seeks to restrict the freedom of the people, so everything must be centrally managed by the state. Therefore, a controlled economy can also be called a managed economy. If control leads to corruption, with no one to oversee it, and control fails to satisfy the people's desires, with no one to address it, then the word "managed" becomes a contradiction. The pathology of a managed economy will then share the same plight as a free economy: a lack of order and discipline.

The lack of order and discipline is the primary flaw of a controlled economy. Because a few individuals abuse their authority for personal gain and engage in corruption, they do not hesitate to plunge the lives of the majority into dire straits. Meanwhile, black markets for rice, black markets for cloth, and even black markets for all daily necessities run rampant and chaotically, seemingly without anyone caring. Based on such a state of indiscipline and disorder, the pursuit of exorbitant profits becomes increasingly rampant, like a raging fire. The trend leads to emulation from above and below, and the nation's discipline and order become even more untenable. Therefore, we constantly advocate for political reform to precede economic reform.

The reason why Japan's controlled economy can function effectively is because it can wield a high degree of political power to decisively implement a policy of "consolidation and integration." At the same time, it enforces the law like a mountain against all economic criminals, showing no leniency whatsoever. Only in this way can it establish order and discipline in its controlled economy.

The words spoken by several attendees at the tea party held by the National Diplomatic Promotion Association to welcome Minister Nakamura the other day were thought-provoking. One person said, "There's no need to talk about the rice black market; the only place to buy cloth is from the police!" Another said, "What rice production increase? Isn't it the private pockets of the Rice Control Association that have increased?" Yet another said, "It's rumored that the Rice Control Association wants to move to the racecourse because its office space is insufficient. Those who hear this are worried, because the more staff the Rice Control Association has, the less rationed rice we will receive!" Therefore, I wrote a section here on "Order and Discipline."

### Rumors Circulating About Treating Meningitis are Pure Nonsense; A Reasonable Approach Should be Taken

Central News Agency report: Since the discovery of meningitis in this city, the relevant authorities and hospitals in this city have been making every effort to prevent and treat it, and have repeatedly announced in newspapers the methods to be adopted, advising citizens. However, in recent days, various simple methods and rumors have been circulating in the city, and ignorant women believe them to be true. Yesterday, a reporter visited a senior official of the police局, who informed him that the police局 has investigated and found that they are purely unfounded rumors. For the sake of public peace, the police局 specifically advises citizens that whether for prevention or treatment of meningitis, they should go to a formal hospital or consult a formal doctor, and should not blindly believe rumors, lest accidents occur.

### Cotton Industry Control Committee to be Divided into Two Departments: Cotton Department and Cotton Products Department

The Cotton Management Office and the Cotton Control Committee under the National Chamber of Commerce are to be merged and renamed the Cotton Industry Control Committee, which will be implemented once approved by the relevant parties. It is understood that the proposed Cotton Industry Control Committee will have two departments under it: one is the Cotton Department, and the other is the Cotton Products Department. The former will serve as a purchasing organization for raw materials for cotton textiles, while the latter will be an organization that purchases yarn and cloth and then implements the rationing of yarn and cloth.

### Transfer of Judicial Personnel Must Not Be Delayed

The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the adjustment of its personnel is originally intended to promote affairs and is of great importance. It specifically orders its subordinate units that all personnel dispatched by the Ministry, whether newly appointed or transferred, should promptly conclude all unfinished matters and proceed to their new posts once ordered, so as to take care of both sides and prevent any delay. If there are requests for adjustment under false pretenses or delays on the pretext of excuses, which are incompatible with the wartime system, it is difficult to tolerate for the sake of the authority and credibility of the law. The officials in charge should also not submit requests for retention on their behalf, resulting in prioritizing private interests over public duties and creating a bad trend.

### Concert for Airplane Donation to be Held on the 19th

The Aircraft Donation Committee, in order to promote the aircraft donation movement, has specially requested the teachers and students of the National Conservatory of Music, the highest music institution in the country, to hold a large-scale concert three times at the Grand Theater. The first concert will be held on the 19th of this month, with an exceptionally brilliant program. In addition to a large mixed choir of one hundred and thirty men and women, there will be solo performances on cello, violin, piano, pipa, etc., solo performances by male and female tenors, and valuable chamber music such as piano trios and quintets. In order to promote noble music, the association has specially reduced the price of ordinary tickets to two types: one hundred yuan and sixty yuan. Tickets are now on sale at the Grand Theater.

### Mediation Resolves Rickshaw Rental Dispute

Recently, due to the soaring prices of applied rickshaw materials, hardware parts, and even the lack of goods on the market, the public rickshaw merchants in this city have had to seek out the black market. As a result, the cost of repairing each vehicle has increased sharply, and the original rental fee is difficult to maintain. Each vehicle must spend more than one thousand yuan per month. Therefore, they requested the Bureau of Social Welfare to adjust the rental fee, while the rickshaw pullers' trade union argued that the lives of the rickshaw pullers were already extremely difficult. Recently, due to the soaring prices of goods, their burden has increased repeatedly, and the soaring military rental fees in the black market are endless. They also submitted a request to the Bureau to crack down on this. After the Bureau sent personnel to investigate, it was found that both parties' claims were true. Considering that the matter concerns the city's public transportation, this dispute should be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore, it convened labor and management parties to implement mediation. After five convocations and exhortations, an agreement was finally reached.

### A Look Inside Shanghai's Financial Situation

— Bitter Mouth

In Shanghai's entire economic market, the abnormal development of the financial sector is the most lively. In the past year or two, newly opened banks have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Looking around Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Ningbo Road, Beijing Road, etc., the newly established banks, one by one, have solemn facades, as if running a bank is the most fashionable business and the only way to make a living. Influenced by the prevailing trend, banks have become the pride of Shanghai's financial sector. If we study it a little, we will know that the reason for their opening banks is nothing more than absorbing deposits and then using other people's deposits to purchase materials, stocks, and real estate in anticipation of rising prices of materials, real estate, and stocks; and to obtain huge profits. This can be said to be the main purpose of the banks that are generally opened, and it is also the psychology of those engaged in the newly opened banking industry. What are the consequences of this improper mentality? We may as well point out further. Is it good? Is it bad? Everyone must have a considerable understanding and lesson.

According to the actual situation of general bank operations, all absorbed deposits are current deposits. Because prices are rising day by day, depositors are worried that their deposit currency is not reliable enough, so they feel that it is safer to deposit materials than to deposit currency, so they withdraw deposits to purchase goods. Because they rush to buy materials, take the limited materials to supply unlimited collections, prices will naturally rise. This is not entirely based on the law of supply and demand, but on the rising of the psychology of group purchase and storage. Since relatives and friends spread the word and imitate each other, is there any reason why the trend of purchasing and storing materials is not strong? Is there any reason why bank deposits are not withdrawn? Is there any reason why prices do not rise without limit? Is there any reason why the money supply in the financial market is not tight? Everyone does not trust currency, so what credibility can currency have? The consequences of today's soaring prices and people's inability to make a living caused by this mentality are not accidental. What do the general self-proclaimed nouveau riche bankers think about this?

Recently, the phenomenon of extremely tight money supply in the Shanghai financial market is also self-inflicted by bankers. Our explanation is: because the banks themselves created an atmosphere of "valuing goods and devaluing currency," depositors withdrew deposits from the bank to purchase and store goods, but the deposits received by the bank, as mentioned above, have already purchased and stored materials, stocks, and real estate; once depositors withdraw, they are unwilling to sell the stored materials for a while, so they have to look around and pay high interest rates to collect funds to meet the needs of depositors; the more funds are collected, the tighter the money supply becomes, which is inevitable. Looking at the inside story from its inside story, most of the newly established banks are shareholders and also important employees; they take investing shares as their entry point, because if they obtain important positions in the bank, individuals can use their position to borrow and mortgage from the bank to achieve their desire to purchase and store materials; once the money supply is tight and the bank has difficulty supporting it, according to the usual practice, loans and mortgages should be recovered, but the person in charge is ostensibly anxious and urges the payment of debts, but the person handling the matter is one of the important employees, who is also the borrower of bank funds: in this situation, it is like the left hand asking the right hand for debt, so how can the recovery of loans be effective? The bank belongs to everyone, and hoarding is for personal gain; who is willing to sacrifice personal interests and think for everyone's sake when they are immersed in personal gain and desire? In fact, I am afraid that no one can sacrifice the small self and seek the legitimate development of the bank! Since the bank is in this situation, what will be the result of its creation? People with discerning eyes should know more than half of it. Then, what is the final trend? It must be that the bank is unable to support it and has to sell the stored materials; at this time, prices will inevitably tend to fall, so the recent stock market slump is also due to this. Since the bank has no choice but to sell materials, and prices tend to fall as a result, it is naturally a benefit to the general public, and a loss to the general purchasers and blind followers. The original instigator is not worthy of pity, but the blind followers are inevitably pitiful. The author is not alarmist, but the heart is so dangerous that it is not safe to remain silent. Those who regard the newly opened bank as a way to get rich, I dare to advise them to turn back as soon as possible, because saving people is saving themselves, otherwise the future is full of endless disasters, and it will never be recovered. Not only will the great Shanghai market be destroyed by this kind of people, but also the future of the entire people's life will be affected. Bank, bank, I don't know how many disasters are caused by taking your name, you should be alert from now on!

Silk Industry Plans Collective Purchase of Spring Cocoons: Silk Reeling and Weaving Factories Ship Goods Smoothly

The spring cocoons of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year are about to enter the market. It is learned from the silk industry that the relevant parties are now preparing to collectively purchase them. The specific plan and other matters have been generally prepared. In addition to mobilizing people in the silk industry in various places, the relevant parties will also provide assistance in the purchase matters. Because in the current period when yarn and cloth cannot be purchased, silk fabrics are the only clothing raw materials for the people. It is also learned from the silk weaving industry that due to the good results of the autumn cocoon purchase last year, all silk reeling factories can ship goods in large quantities, so the silk weaving factories can obtain raw materials continuously, and the shipment is very smooth. The stock of silk and satin in this city is also quite large, and the addition is less than before, so the silk and satin market is now trending downstream.

### Various Hospitals Inject Meningitis Preventive Vaccines

The Shanxi Hospital wrote yesterday saying: "Recently, cases of meningitis have been repeatedly discovered in this city. Treatment is urgently needed, but prevention and eradication are even more urgent. The preventive effect of this disease seedling slurry is also evident. The Taishi area is vast and the population is large. All doctors and hospitals have the obligation to provide free injections to assist the authorities in their shortcomings in order to achieve universality. Our hospital will start injections from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day from today, and no fees will be charged to anyone." (Note: The World Red Swastika Hospital, Youzhu Hospital, Boai Hospital, Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, Shangxian Hospital, Shanghai Health Association, Hongren Hospital, Renai Association, Tongren Hospital, Foguang Hospital, and various district health offices all provide free vaccination. Two vaccinations are effective.)

The Process of Refining Meningitis Treatment Drugs

Use five catties of soap alkali (i.e., green alkali), place it in a ceramic pot (do not use copper or iron utensils), and burn it on charcoal fire for two hours (coal briquette fire and firewood fire are insufficient, and cannot be used). It will turn into a liquid. Do not move it. Burn it for another two hours. It has become a dry substance. Then, add a large fire of charcoal to refine it for about two or three hours until the substance is dry and refined. If the ceramic pot is broken, put it on charcoal fire to refine it. The front and back are about seven or eight hours in total. The soap alkali is dry and crystalline. Remove the ceramic pot and take out the dry substance. The substance has three layers. The upper layer is as crisp as soil, the middle layer is dry and hard with red and black, and the upper and middle layers are not usable. The crystals are in the bottom layer, which is red and about two or three points thick. Use a knife to shovel out the red broken end, grind it in a magnetic bowl (do not use an iron millstone), sift it, wrap it in paper, put it on the ground overnight to remove its fire, and put it in a magnetic bottle for later use. There is about one tael, which can treat forty or fifty people. Each person uses two points, blowing one point into each nostril each time, and it will heal after blowing twice in a row. I previously published the Nie family's effective formula, but the pharmaceutical method was not detailed. I went to Xírì day to find this formula for all walks of life to imitate and save people. The method of use is the same as the Nie family's formula. If you need detailed single-page instructions (with a special formula for black fever attached), please apply to the Sanle Agricultural Products Store on Nanjing Road in this city from the 19th of this month, one sheet per person, without taking a penny. Letters and envelopes will not be answered. Previous inquiries from all walks of life about the manufacturing method will no longer be answered separately.

Red Swastika Hospital Resumes Diagnosis

The Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society is located at No. 1171 Yuyuan Road. It has been operating for many years. This spring, Dr. Ding Shouren was hired as the president to do his best to rectify the interior and expand the equipment. Diagnosis was resumed on March 15, and patients of all levels were admitted from the 20th, and doctors outside the hospital were welcome to refer patients and borrow equipment. In order to benefit the poor and sick, the hospital still provides diagnosis every day and has free hospital beds. Recently, due to the epidemic of meningitis, free preventive injections and vaccinations are being given from now on.

Egg Milk Oatmeal Factory Offers Preferential Treatment to Teachers

Each machine-made egg milk oatmeal produced by the Jiqing factory contains 1% protein, 73% starch, and 16% vitamins. It is resistant to hunger and can be cooked with rice. It is economical and hygienic. In order to give preferential treatment to the education sector, the price is set at 18 yuan per catty delivered. First, accept 1,000 priority customers, limited to school teachers and staff. In addition, the factory's on-site sales of this film do not require delivery power, so it is specially raised to subsidize student loans, sent once every four weeks.

Letter

Your column previously published "A reader's letter stating that the number of receipts for changing vehicle licenses is inconsistent," which contained the phrase "Go to the Transportation Section of each administrative office to handle various procedures for changing licenses." It is found that the transportation section of this department originally handled vehicle license business, but it has been ordered by the municipal government to transfer all of it to the Public Utilities Bureau on February 16. Now this matter of changing licenses is no longer handled by this department. We are deeply afraid that people from all walks of life will misunderstand, so we hereby declare.

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

True people are born lazy to write, and for letters, they only seek not to lack affection and righteousness, and do not like to write too much. Therefore, diaries are not often made. I do not know why, in Showa 13, from January 1st to the end of the year, I continued to write diaries almost every day, and there are still a few remnants left.

This year, he was already twenty years old, and his grade had risen from No. 2 to the highest grade, No. 1. It was an era of high spirits. The diary was just an ordinary common diary at that time for five cents a book, but the articles and handwriting were very clear. There are very few places to delete and add, which may be a habit developed in Etajima. In the military school, the two tasks of writing workbooks and writing suitable end feelings are not allowed to be amended by a single word.

In the page of January 1st, at the beginning of the year, it is written that "must be spiritual, spirited, persevering, and upright."

If the entire diary for the year is introduced, everything about life in the military school can be understood, and it is also a very interesting thing, but due to the length limit, only the main points can be revealed below.

January 6 (Thursday) Sunny

Held a military parade. The morale is high, which is indeed the decoration of the beginning of Showa 13. We must move forward step by step and abide by our duties. With the grateful mood of the day of the imperial visit (Note: When receiving the imperial parade in Kashima). I am very excited about the training of the squadron and the world situation. We must fulfill the great mission of the empire. Please see our young people who bear the brilliant glory of the Japanese Empire. The British and American navies are not worth mentioning. Resolutely build the world's number one navy. No sleeping, from the new year.

January 7 (Friday) Cloudy with occasional snow.

Started rigorous training. Starting with gun and sword techniques, I felt uncomfortable in my body and felt very tired during class time. I fell asleep at the beginning of the year, which is very embarrassing.

We must cheer up, but our strength is still insufficient.

January 13 (Thursday) Clear after snow.

In the morning, I trained in sword techniques. It is also a happy thing to sweat under the snowflakes. We must work harder.

Floating navigation air balloons, measuring high-altitude meteorology, the weather is very cold, and it is really unbearable to stand in the snow on the training ground.

Judo training, full of energy, very happy, no matter what, work hard, and interest will arise. Everything must be like this.

January 20 (Friday) Warm and sunny.

At first, I thought it was still raining, but it was sunny. The martial arts training in the morning was very pleasant. We must be enthusiastic. We still feel that we are not enthusiastic enough during class time. We went to the squadron supervisor's office to print during self-selection. Because we did not do well, we suffered an unexpected failure. We must trust others, but when we are responsible for ourselves, we must check it. Trust is acceptable, but over-trust is not acceptable.

Still napping. Unacceptable. (II)

February 9 (Wednesday) Cloudy and cold

It's really cold weather. Today is my father's birthday. Visited Happoen. There are boundless emotions. Twelve years have passed. My father was only a first-grade elementary school student when he died, and now I am able to be in the world-renowned Naval Military Academy. Whose grace is this? It is the grace of the emperor, the grace of parents, and the grace of teachers. If you want to repay this grace, you must do your best. Please rest assured, I will consciously work hard.

Mother and brother are now living in Taiwan. May you be safe and protect the remains to return to your hometown. (Note: To welcome the heroic spirit of brother Zhenichiro)

February 11 (National Foundation Day) Sunny.

Woke up at half past four. Immediately ascended Mount Kotaka. The east will be white, and we will pay our respects to the imperial city from afar, shouting Long live the imperial country. In the distance of the morning clouds, the future of the empire is vast. If we do not rise up now, who will bear the heavy responsibility of the imperial country in extraordinary times? We vowed to be loyal and descended the peak. (Note: The phrase "If we do not rise up" appears dozens of times in the diary, but this is the first time. It is probably influenced by the lyrics of the school song.)

March 10 (Thursday) Cloudy after rain.

Affected by the completion of the exam, I was not in the mood to study hard. I passed the class time blankly. People are prone to mistakes when they are not nervous. This is often heard. We must strive to be diligent.

There is shooting training. My heart is not calm. The results are not good. We must pay attention when ticking. When we are not calm, ticking will definitely ruin the results. We should be humble and calm.
