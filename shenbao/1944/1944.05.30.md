### Eliminating Profiteering

Since the establishment of the First Police Bureau's Economic Security Division in this city, the business community has shown great concern and high expectations for it, owing to its close relationship with the economic sector itself. In order to facilitate communication between the authorities and the business community, our newspaper invited prominent figures to a symposium to discuss the Economic Security Division. The proceedings have now been compiled and are published on page three of today's newspaper. It is believed that the Economic Security Division authorities and members of the business community will be pleased to read it.

Summarizing various opinions, the key points can be outlined as follows:

The Economic Security Division should clearly publicize all laws and regulations so that the people can understand and abide by them.

For minor violations, the Economic Security Division should contact trade associations to advise and give offenders an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. Serious violations should be referred to the courts.

The powers and duties of the Economic Security Division and other economic agencies should be clearly defined and separated to avoid duplication and confusion for the public.

Raise the salaries of economic police officers to enable them to serve with peace of mind and fulfill their mission of economic security.

Many ad hoc economic laws and regulations have been promulgated during the war, and it is impossible for the average person to fully understand them. While deliberate violations are inexcusable, unintentional violations are somewhat excusable. Therefore, the authorities should pay attention to how to ensure that citizens, especially those in the business community, thoroughly understand the meaning of all economic laws and regulations, and create concise interpretations. How to adjust the past situations where businesses felt troubled by the complexity of regulations and overlapping of agencies is also something the authorities should pay attention to.

However, from the perspective of the economic community itself, there should also be a thorough self-reflection. We believe that a most terrible phenomenon exists in a portion of Shanghai's economic sphere: the rise of profiteering. We have said before that profiteers are as terrible and dishonorable as corrupt officials. Since the rise of profiteering, several abnormal situations have formed in Shanghai society:

First, the mentality of luck, speculation, and risk-taking is commonly nurtured and encouraged.

Second, after the above three mentalities become prevalent, people are no longer willing to do proper business in a law-abiding manner, and they are no longer willing to seek legitimate profits in a peaceful manner, but only want to take shortcuts to seek huge profits.

Third, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority suffer from the hardships of life, forming a stark gap between the rich and the poor. Salaried workers suffer from hunger, while profiteering tycoons enjoy themselves to the fullest, and improper entertainment is particularly prosperous.

To be honest, for the past seven years, only the salaried class has lived a difficult life. The property of some profiteers in the business community is richer than it was seven years ago, their lives are more extravagant than they were seven years ago, and their minds are more corrupt than they were seven years ago. Therefore, social phenomena are more abnormal than they were seven years ago. Therefore, we can assert that rampant corruption promotes political corruption; the rise of profiteering promotes social distortion. And corrupt politics provides an opportunity for the spread of communism; social distortion also provides an opportunity for the spread of communism. In other words, corrupt politics and social distortion are both driving forces behind the spread of communism.

During this time of war, there are two major enemies: one is profiteering, and the other is communism. And profiteering is enough to promote communism. The spread of these two toxins are both major enemies hindering the war effort. Therefore, on the one hand, we must make every effort to eliminate the spread of communism. On the other hand, we must eliminate the rise of profiteering.

We hope that the authorities of the Economic Security Division will grasp this premise, do their best to protect legitimate businesses, and guide Shanghai's economic sphere back on track, and further cooperate with the needs of the war. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will use the most severe and effective means to sanction profiteering! Eliminate profiteering!

### Rights to Build Motor Highways Transferred to Local Governors. Interior Ministry Strengthens Wartime Transportation Affairs

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Interior Ministry, in order to strengthen and expand wartime transportation affairs, previously established an extraordinary land transportation system and decided on a policy for the construction of high-speed motor vehicle-only highways. Subsequently, according to the first plan last year, it completed the highway between Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe (four meters wide and 160 kilometers long). This year, according to the second phase of the plan, it began construction of highways between Nagoya and Tokyo, and between Kobe and Fukuoka. Now, the Interior Ministry has also decided to transfer the highway construction rights to the local governors from June 1st in order to promote the construction of land transportation highways. If the motor vehicle-only highway between Tokyo and Fukuoka is completed, it will be able to advance the transportation mission simultaneously with railway transportation, placing the transportation connections of important cities in Japan under wartime conditions on a solid foundation. Its realization is greatly anticipated.

### Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces War Results of Luoyang Capture. The Japanese Army's Combat Power is Astonishing

Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced the war results of the Luoyang capture on the 27th. The war results have expanded daily since then. As of the 28th, it was determined that the Japanese army's war results included 4,829 corpses abandoned by the Chongqing army, 8,286 prisoners captured, and the capture of 76 artillery pieces (4 field guns, 5 mountain guns, 20 direct-firing guns, 2 5cm howitzers, 6 rapid-firing guns, 55 mortars), 181 heavy machine guns, 6,004 rifles, 201 grenade launchers, 10 automatic rifles, 35 pistols, countless ammunition, and other items such as 31 telephones, 5 wireless radios, 5 switchboards, 1 locomotive, 4 freight cars, and 200 rails. The total number of corpses abandoned by the Chongqing army and prisoners captured was 13,115. It is said that the three divisions of the Chongqing army defending Luoyang numbered 14,000. They have now been annihilated by the Japanese army. This shows the brilliance of the war results obtained by the Japanese army in capturing Luoyang.

Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the reasons why the Chongqing army guarding Luoyang this time was able to resist so stubbornly, it was certainly due to the excellent equipment they possessed, but the main reason was due to the extremely solid fortifications they had. The defense of Luoyang was accomplished by the Chongqing army using all their strength and abilities to complete the most perfect and solid defensive battlefield. One kilometer south of Luoyang city is the Luo River, and to the east there are even more natural barriers to defend. It includes the northern highlands and the western plains. Here, the Chongqing army had completely built permanent fortifications. Shelters, artillery emplacements, machine gun emplacements, communication trenches, tank trenches, and countless large and small fortresses were built everywhere in the city. The tank trenches were 10 meters wide and 5 meters deep, all dug in a cross shape or spider web shape, so that even if one place was breached, other places could still be preserved. The largest tank trenches were 10 meters wide and 20 meters deep, and water was injected into them, extending 50 to 60 kilometers to the north and west. Communication trenches were dug under the tank trenches. There were communication cut-off trenches and fortress air-raid shelters in the city. All residential walls were used to dig loopholes. The air-raid shelters were about 20 meters deep, and continuous combat capability could be maintained in them for up to 10 days. A group of Americans who came here to inspect in February of this year praised it greatly. In addition, Baimapo and other places had countless artillery emplacements and large fortresses that could accommodate hundreds of people. Various military facilities were set up in a corner of the new city in the west, a river defense battlefield in the south, and natural barriers that could be used in the east. Also, the field fortifications were built in a three-dimensional shape near the city walls, so it is no exaggeration to call them strong fortifications that are difficult to attack and impossible to fall. But in the end, they could not stop the Japanese army's advance. As the saying goes, "Whoever controls Ximapo can capture Luoyang." But after the general attack by the Japanese army unit occupying the northern highlands, they finally captured it in one fell swoop. The Japanese army, which broke through such solid fortifications, had an astonishing fighting spirit.

The Cityscape of Luoyang is Refreshed

Luoyang, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the second day (26th) after the fall of Luoyang, the Public Security Maintenance Association was established. The acting chairman was Qin Peiqing. Under Qin's command, the general public engaged in cleaning, organizing, and bridge-building. On the 27th, the Louchi in Beida Street was already open for business. The brave Japanese soldiers, who had long suffered from the war, happily went there. Propaganda teams dispatched into the city distributed food to the citizens with a gentle attitude, so the citizens were all grateful. The 94th Division of the 14th Army of the Chongqing army, which guarded Luoyang, issued six announcements of "Military Law Compliance Regulations" to its troops two or three days before the fall of Luoyang. Among the captured Chongqing army soldiers, some showed a cold smile at this. Luoyang City, which is about to be turned into ruins, has taken a giant step towards building a new China due to the cleaning and reorganization.

The First War Zone is Thoroughly Destroyed

Central News Agency Report - The anti-Japanese organization in the Chongqing First War Zone has been completely destroyed due to the recent Henan campaign. At this time, the movements of Hu Zongnan's troops, known as 400,000 strong, guarding the Yellow River can be noted. To this day, the fact that the Yellow River Defense Army, with Xi'an in Shaanxi as its center, is taking a position of encirclement against Yan'an, which is occupied by the Chinese Communist Party, is a well-known fact. Due to the Japanese army's recent operation in Henan, sweeping through the First War Zone, the Chongqing authorities ordered Hu Zongnan to send six divisions, about 50,000 troops, to assist in the Luoyang area. However, Hu Zongnan's army, which was ordered to provide assistance, and Jiang Dingwen's troops were suddenly defeated by the Japanese army south of Luoyang. However, the main force of the Yellow River Defense Army still looks down on the Chinese Communist Party and seems to be unmoved, and has not taken any defensive measures against the Japanese army. This fact clearly shows the extent of the friction between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party. In the current Chongqing-Communist talks, lifting the Yellow River Defense Army's encirclement of the Communist army must be one of the important demands put forward by the Chinese Communist Party. If this issue cannot be resolved in the end, the Chinese Communist Party will inevitably turn a deaf ear to Chongqing's demands, which is to be expected. However, from Chongqing's standpoint, if the encirclement of the Chinese Communist Party is lifted, it is tantamount to recognizing the free development of the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, Chongqing will use the Communist army as its defensive force to avoid its own losses. Therefore, both Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party will insist on their respective positions on the resolution of this issue until the end.

Chongqing Army Commander Li Jiayu Killed in Action

Kaifeng, 29th (Central News Agency) - The headquarters of the 36th Army Group of the Chongqing army was thoroughly hit on the 21st at Daying due to the fierce attacks of our troops. In that battle, it was reported that the life and death of the army group commander was unknown. Later, it was confirmed that he had been killed in action. The heads of the staff office and adjutant's office were mostly killed or captured, so the headquarters had collapsed. Li Jiayu was from Sichuan Province, born in 1889, and graduated from the Sichuan Military Academy. He served as the commander of the 100th Division and concurrently the commander of the 47th Army. Since last year, he has been working hard to increase his combat power along the Longhai Railway in the Xin'an area.

Beiping, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 21st, Japanese troops attacked more than 1,000 Chongqing troops about four kilometers south of Daying (west of Shanzhou). The Japanese troops stormed into the Chongqing army's position with hand grenades, inflicting heavy damage. In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 150 corpses (including many generals and officers) and 60 prisoners. The Chongqing army had retreated from Xin'an and was originally under the command of Li Jiayu. It has now been determined that it was the 36th Army Group, and the headquarters of the 49th Army was also established. Among the prisoners were Major General Zhou Dingming, chief of the adjutant's office of the army group, and a dozen other officers. Chief Zhou died soon after being captured due to serious injuries, so the Japanese army buried him. The army group commander and chief of staff have already escaped, but there are rumors that three bodies resembling important figures have been found, so it is not known whether they died in battle. Also, according to the prisoners, the commander of the 104th Division has already been killed in action.

### Foreign Minister Chu Arrived in Tokyo Yesterday Morning for Official Business

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Chu Minyi, Foreign Minister of the National Government, arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 29th for official business in Japan. At 6 p.m., he and Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei jointly hosted a banquet for Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, Minister of the Navy Shimada, and other ministers. It was decided that they would jointly host a banquet for Japanese Field Marshal Sugiyama, Field Marshal Nagano, Minister of Education Okabe, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, and others on the afternoon of the 30th.

After the Collapse of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the National Government's Construction Strength Increased

Zhengzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) - From the perspective of the United States and Britain, Chongqing is an advanced base for a counterattack against Japan, so they have great expectations for it. However, since the fall of Luoyang, the First War Zone in Henan has been on the verge of collapse. This Henan campaign not only militarily destroyed the 300,000 troops of the First War Zone, but also secured the connection between North China and Wuhan, and most of the Longhai Railway, giving the Japanese army a firm control over the initiative to attack Chongqing. The Henan Plain is a powerful northwestern base for Chongqing's anti-Japanese economy, but it has now been transformed into a base for the National Government to develop its power. Therefore, this has greatly strengthened the National Government's strength. After this campaign, agricultural products from Henan have been imported into peaceful areas. It is reported that the prices of food in Tianjin, Beiping, and the markets are 20% lower than before the war. The prospects for a fundamental solution to the Yellow River water control plan have emerged. Therefore, this Henan campaign has greatly strengthened the National Government's construction.

### Zhengzhou is Becoming Increasingly Prosperous

Zhengzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Due to the erroneous anti-Japanese theories of the Chongqing government, the farmers of Henan Province were forcibly conscripted and driven to the front lines. Since the end of the Japanese army's operation in Henan, they have been returning one after another. For example, in Zhengzhou, the Public Security Maintenance Association and the Chamber of Commerce were established on the eighth day after the Japanese army entered the city. The police station and district offices have also begun to operate. Of the past 40,000 inhabitants, 20,000 have returned, so the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The unique phenomenon in the area is that Japanese language schools have been established one after another. At the same time, entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters have also begun to operate. Also, the power plant was bombed by Japanese aircraft during the incident, and the power equipment was auctioned off by the Henan Provincial Government last summer, so there is still no street lighting equipment. Recently, the authorities have installed electric lights in several places, and it is planned to install electric lights along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways soon.

### Dr. Sasaki Talks About His Impressions of Lecturing

Dr. Sasaki, a Japanese agriculturalist, was invited to give lectures at the academic lecture series of this newspaper. A reporter from the Dalu Xinbao interviewed the doctor, who said about his impressions: "Although it is called an academic lecture series, the audience is not specialized, so I avoided going into too much depth. What I lectured on mainly focused on the importance of the foundations of Chinese agriculture and the necessity of Sino-Japanese cooperation from an agricultural point of view. The topic in Shanghai was 'Japan, China, and the United States and Britain as Seen from Agriculture.' In Nanjing, I plan to focus on my specialty, animal husbandry, and lecture on 'China's Animal Husbandry and its Resources as Seen from East Asian Animal Husbandry.' I have attended academic conferences held in the United States and Britain, and have also investigated the agriculture of various countries, so I was able to list specific figures to compare and demonstrate the agriculture of various countries. I explained that the commonalities between China and Japan in agriculture are extremely large, so that students can understand. China and Japan are inseparable, and I will emphasize that Japanese agriculture is the best in the world, manufacturing Holstein dairy cows that produce 102 shi of milk per year, and White Leghorn chickens that lay 364 eggs per year. This kind of technology should of course be introduced to China. Importing British and American technology is actually harmful and useless in China. In Nanjing, in addition to lecturing and holding seminars, I also plan to visit various farms and Chinese agriculture in person."

### Indian Soldiers Awaken and Join the National Army

Yangon, 29th (Central News Agency) - The enemy near Kohima is currently increasing the number of British soldiers sent from Dimapur to open the highway from Kohima to Imphal. However, the number of British soldiers mobilized has reached its limit, so the rear service personnel recently are making every effort to use older soldiers. At the same time, the surveillance and supervision of Indian soldiers under command has become stricter, in an attempt to strengthen the will to resist Japan. On the 22nd, the Japanese army launched a bayonet attack on Height 460 west of Kohima. Indian Sikh soldier Kexenki, who escaped from an enemy armored vehicle and surrendered to the Japanese army, recently described the British's brutal behavior towards Indian soldiers as follows: "The British's brutality towards us Indians is no different from drinking our blood and eating our flesh. We now fully understand the British soldiers' deceptive tactics towards us. The voices of joining the National Army are rising daily. Machine guns are set up behind the first-line Indian soldiers no matter when they retreat. British surveillance and supervision of Indian soldiers is even stricter at night. If there is any intention to retreat, they will be shot immediately. Indian soldiers have lost their will to fight due to excessive fear of this kind of behavior. We call the supervisors 'guides to hell', so the number of people joining the National Army is increasing day by day. During our armored vehicle unit's attacks, there must be British soldiers monitoring in the rear, or firing shots in the rear to supervise the battle. From now on, we swear to avenge this hatred, quickly wake up, and join the National Army."

### American Planes Attacked Nanying and Were Defeated

Xinxiang, 29th (Central News Agency) - The American troops stationed in Chongqing stubbornly attacked in order to prevent the rapid advance of the Japanese army. On the 12th, 28 Chongqing planes attacked the Japanese army near Nanying (20 kilometers west of Luoyang). The Japanese army fought back with anti-aircraft fire and repelled them after inflicting heavy damage. An enemy plane (F40 type) was forced to land due to a mechanical failure. An American pilot was captured. According to the captured pilot, "At first, we thought that the Japanese army unit in the area had no anti-aircraft guns and we could bomb safely. But we completely misjudged. I am deeply horrified when I think about the vigorous fighting spirit of the Japanese army. We came to the Chinese mainland with the aim of air-raiding the Japanese mainland. Now that we have come into contact with the Japanese army, we are disappointed."

### After Obtaining Southern Resources, Japan's Petroleum Business Changed

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Before the war, Japan's kerosene situation was almost the same as Germany's. Domestic resources were scarce, and artificial petroleum could not be fully developed. In terms of artificial kerosene, its situation was even worse than Germany's. In the 11th year of Showa (1936), Japan's domestic oil production was about 400,000 tons, which was only 8% of the total demand. The amount imported from other places reached 5 million tons. However, since obtaining southern oil resources, Japan's kerosene business has changed greatly. Before the war, the production volume of kerosene in various southern regions was approximately 5.2 million tons in Sumatra, 1.8 million tons in Borneo, 840,000 tons in Java, 100,000 tons in Ceylon, and 1.1 million tons in Burma. But now the production volume in various places is several times that of before the war. However, under these wartime conditions, it is not enough to be satisfied simply because the southern oil source has been secured. The Japanese government ordered the Imperial Oil Company to carry out development in order to centrally control the domestic and foreign oil extraction businesses. In the field of oil refining, it also established the Kerosene Refining Industry Council the year before last to plan for the centralization of kerosene business operations. Now, compared with the oil business of the anti-Axis side, the Japanese side has the advantage of advancing internal line operations. Although the anti-Axis side has a large volume of oil production, they must go through a long transportation route to transport oil to the necessary battle zones. For example, the distance to transport oil from California to the Solomon Islands in the Western Pacific war zone is more than 6,000 miles. On the other hand, the Japanese side has the advantage of being able to quickly transport kerosene from the oil fields to the battle zones due to the development of the local oil refining business. Although the absolute amount of assets is inferior to the enemy, from another perspective, the Japanese side can fully secure the necessary amount of kerosene and quickly turn it into combat power. In this respect, its advantage is several times that of the enemy.

### The Ministry of Industry's Recent Work Focuses on Increasing Production and Actively Supervising the Implementation of Price Controls

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Bingquan, chief secretary of the Ministry of Industry, met with reporters on the 29th and made the following remarks regarding the general situation of recent work: "The work of the Ministry focuses on increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods. We are still implementing the previously established plan, the important points of which are as follows: Regarding increasing production, (A) Cotton: For increasing cotton production, the Cotton Production Increase Coordination General Association was recently established in Shanghai, and local coordination associations were established in various cotton-growing areas to promote and develop cotton cultivation. The area is approximately 3 million mu, and it is estimated that cotton production this year can reach 2.5 million dan. Also, in order to prevent the mixing of cotton quality, over 1,180 mu of original seeds have been carefully planted. The situation is good, and after the autumn harvest this year, they can be used for promotion next year. (B) Hemp: The propagation of jute and kenaf in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai has been promoted to 20,000 mu. Castor beans: 3,000 mu in the Wuhu area, and 7,000 mu in Taixian. (C) Mulberries: 500,000 excellent spring silkworm egg sheets were imported from Japan and distributed by industry agencies in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other regions. (D) Rice: Last year, the improved rice seeds distributed to various areas were better than the local varieties. The Ministry instructed various regions to guide farmers to exchange local varieties for the improved varieties planted by farmers. (E) Coal Mines: The Ministry encourages people to mine coal. Recent surveys show that Jiangning and Jurong produce more than 150 tons of coal per day, and Guichi, Fanchang, and Chaoxian produce more than 80 tons of coal per day. The number of mine operators applying for resumption of business and reporting the start of work has increased recently. (F) Promotion of agricultural economy: The Ministry signed joint agricultural loan measures with the Bank of Communications to issue funds for increasing production. The following are actively underway: (1) Revising the regulations on rural pawns, (2) Consulting the Ministry of Construction to allocate vehicles for transporting fertilizer, (3) Collecting agricultural statistical data, (4) Contracted cotton production survey. Regarding industrial and commercial surveys and price management, the Ministry, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Industrial and Commercial Survey Committee, is conducting surveys of company operations. As for managing prices, we are still supervising the implementation according to the established policy. Price evaluation committees have been organized in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Huaihai. Regarding personnel, since the Ministry of Food was merged into the Ministry, the administrative affairs of the Ministry have been incorporated into the Ministry. The organizational structure of various departments has been slightly adjusted and expanded, and the number of personnel has also been slightly increased. However, the progress of the cause depends on the concentration of talents, especially in the Ministry. The selection focuses on both learning and experience, and promotions are made at any time. The directors are urged to contribute their personal talents and wisdom to the country."

### Fierce Fighting on the Valmontone Front – Germany Announces Withdrawal from Apulia

Zurich, 29th (Central News Agency) – News received here indicates that on the Italian front, anti-Axis forces, from Cisterna to Valmontone, launched a sudden attack on the Valmontone front, leading the German side to acknowledge the gravity of the situation in that area. The current center of fierce fighting is in the front lines of Valmontone. German forces there have built extremely strong defenses, using Valmontone as a forward base. If the anti-Axis forces break through Valmontone and attack Valmontone, the German forces in that area may be able to encircle the enemy. According to neutral observers, Marshal Kesselring has transferred some troops from other fronts to reinforce the defenses of Valmontone.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, citing an official German war report, stated that yesterday, the German defense in Italy was quite successful.

### Special Edition for Allied Nations' Japanese Navy Memorial Day, No. 10 – The Great Spirit of Japanese Navy Personnel

Whether weapons and warships can exert their power depends entirely on the people handling them. The warships of the Japanese Navy are the most advanced in the world. In terms of hull design, speed, armor, and crew configuration, all countries are left in the dust. Moreover, its weapons, aircraft, and gunpowder have unmatched precision and performance, as demonstrated in the Greater East Asia War. However, if handled by naval personnel like those of the United States, they would ultimately fail to fully exert their power. Here, in terms of personnel, we see the reason why the Japanese Navy is the strongest in the world.

Japanese Navy personnel, during their training, have every Sunday of the week altered. There are no regular holidays, and half-day Saturdays are absolutely out of the question. Every week, their days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday.

Let's take the example of training a young aviation soldier. After joining the unit, for three years, they [unclear]. Even when flying in groups, they know where their aircraft is over the earth. Without this, how could they brave dense clouds to bomb Pearl Harbor and Darwin? Only in the fourth year do they begin to learn aviation technology, in the fifth year, shooting and bombing. In the sixth year, they practice shooting and bombing. In the sixth year, they practice on aircraft carriers. Only in the seventh year can they fly aircraft on their own. Their spirit and their skills are both indispensable to the country's aircraft.

The same goes for torpedoes and cannons. Marshal Dong Zheng once said, "One cannon that hits every time is equivalent to a hundred cannons that fire [unclear] hits." In every naval battle, it has been proven that each cannon operated by a Japanese soldier is equivalent to more than a hundred cannons operated by British and American gunners.

Submarine crew members are mostly non-commissioned officers. Submarines require excellent personnel. Volunteers who join the marine corps first undergo preliminary training in the marine corps for six months, then undergo appropriate inspections, and are separated into gunners, torpedo men, and mechanics. After receiving various specialized educations at gunnery schools, torpedo schools, and engineering schools, they practice on warships and then enter schools to learn advanced technology, constantly being trained. Those who join submarines must also enter submarine school.

Commanders who command these excellent soldiers, such as officers in the combat branch, graduate from the Naval Academy in Etajima. Those in the mechanical branch graduate from the Naval Mechanical School in Maiizuru. Military doctors and pharmacists graduate from the Tokyo Naval Medical School, and officers in the accounting branch graduate from the Tokyo Naval Management School.

Let's look at life at the Etajima Naval Academy. The school accepts students who have completed four years or more of secondary school. Lower-class students absolutely obey upper-class students. Up and down are naturally one, cultivating the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy: "Not relying on the enemy not coming, but relying on our readiness." Whenever an enemy comes, they must be defeated. This confidence is more important than the excellence of weapons and the number of warships.

"Willing to die" is the noble spirit of sacrifice unique to the Japanese. "Not dying before the enemy falls" is an even more proactive and solemn spirit of attack. This spirit of attack is the manifestation of utmost sincerity in serving the country. With this sincerity, they can achieve great results in every naval battle.

### Lessons from the Russo-Japanese War

– Miyake Keiji

While America produced Botzchi Nel, it proved the power of submarines to the world in actual warfare.

Since then, various forms of "submarines" have appeared, including the "Plodtec" created by the German rigid airship inventor Zeppelin-Laem, and the "Holland" created by the Irishman Holland. The former used a thirty-horsepower gasoline engine on the water and in the water, and could travel at eight and a half knots on the water and five and a half knots in the water, and had four wheels that could be retracted into the boat, allowing it to travel on the seabed. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russia purchased this boat and moored it in Vladivostok to snipe at the Japanese fleet.

Japan began to study after purchasing the Holland-type submarine, as mentioned earlier. Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's Sixth Submarine, which was said to be Holland-type, was built together with the Seventh Submarine at the Kawasaki Shipyard in Japan. Its model was the Fifth Submarine, which was ordered from the American Electric Boat Company in November of the 37th year of Meiji (1904). The reason for Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's early death was to experiment with how long this small boat, weighing only 75 tons, could dive. However, the motor was very small and could not dive for long in the water. If a gasoline engine for water use were used in the water, it could dive very far, but there was no way to dispose of the toxic gases generated at this time. In desperation, they came up with the idea of sinking the boat halfway and floating it, and drawing fresh air from the sea through the ventilation tube on the upper deck for the gasoline engine to use. This is the so-called semi-submerged navigation.

The Sixth Submarine sank during this kind of semi-submerged experiment when a wave hit the ventilation tube.

### Progress in Japanese Shipbuilding Technology

What kind of warships did the Japanese Navy build during this period? Although "Tsukuba" and "Ikoma" were the beginning of battlecruisers, after Japan saw Britain build the "Invincible" class of warships, it also went on to design and build more powerful warships.

However, what must be considered here is whether Japan has the ability to build such giant ships. No matter how well-conceived the shipbuilding plan is, if there is no corresponding technology, warships cannot be built. Therefore, when this shipbuilding plan was drafted in the 44th year of Meiji (1911), it was generally considered an unrealistic delusion. As a result, the Diet also raised questions about shipbuilding technology, such as "Can Japan build such giant ships?" At that time, Naval Minister Saito Minoru made the following reply in the Diet.

"Japan has decided that all Japanese warships in the future will be built in Japan by Japanese hands. However, the first ship of this shipbuilding plan, the 'Kongo,' will be built in the United Kingdom as a technical blueprint. In the future, the warships of the Japanese Empire will absolutely not be built in foreign countries."

This reply not only surprised the Japanese, but also astonished Westerners. According to [unclear] Fujido's "Memoirs," the Ministry of the Navy was in an uproar after this reply was made in the Diet.

Although it was said that all Japanese warships in the future would be built in the country, it was already not easy to build warships such as "Kawachi" and "Settsu," and it was even more impossible to predict how huge the warships would have to be built in the future. How could they be built? However, the minister in charge actually announced it clearly in the Diet, wasn't this too rash? However, because one cannot wait passively, there is no hope for technological progress. If one simply imitates other countries or buys from other countries, then the country, like an individual, can never become strong. It is necessary to create something from nothing and to hone oneself diligently. Because Japanese people have an unwavering belief in everything, only the "Kongo" was ordered from the Vickers plant in the United Kingdom, while its sister ships, "Hiei," "Haruna," and "Kirishima," were all built in the country.

Not only when these three ships were completed in Japan, but even when their plans were announced, they surprised naval experts all over the world.

Up to that time, the largest cannon in the world was the thirteen-and-a-half-inch cannon of the British super-D-class battleship, but the Japanese Kongo-class battleship was equipped with eight fourteen-inch cannons. Can such large cannons be fitted on a warship? When Japan ordered the "Kongo" from the United Kingdom, British engineers immediately studied its design. Surprisingly, this design far surpassed all their designs, which they considered the authority in the world of shipbuilding, and approached perfection.

At that time, they were planning to build a larger 28,500-ton battlecruiser than the "Lion," the "Tiger." The displacement of the "Kongo" was 29,330 tons, slightly larger than the "Tiger," but much stronger. Therefore, they stopped the original plan and almost completely rebuilt the design of the "Kongo," but the cannon installed was still eight thirteen-and-a-half-inch cannons.

The Kongo-class battlecruisers were the largest and strongest warships in the world at that time, and their speed reached 27.5 knots, which was in no way inferior compared to the warships of other countries. Apart from the "Kongo," its sister ships were all built in Japanese shipyards.

The "Kongo" was the world's first cruiser to be equipped with fourteen-inch cannons. As for battleships, from the 4th to the 7th year of the Taisho era (1915, 1918), the super-D-class battleships "Fuso," built by Japan, and its sister ships "Yamashiro," "Hyuga," and "Ise," were all giant ships of 30,000 tons, each equipped with ten fourteen-inch cannons, and were the strongest battleships in the world. After they were successively commissioned, they attracted worldwide attention. These battleships and the four Kongo-class battlecruisers constituted the most ideal four-four fleet. The establishment of this fleet made the Japanese Navy the first-class navy among all the naval powers in the world. (End) (Yoshida: Excerpts from a chapter of "Naval History")

### Seventh Session of Scholarship Applications to Begin on June 1st

The seventh session of our newspaper's reader scholarship program has been decided to commence on June 1st. All procedures have been meticulously prepared. The most pressing issue is the small amount of the scholarship fund. What methods can be used to ensure a steady stream of donations, gathering a substantial sum, so that thousands of impoverished and outstanding students can be spared the pain of dropping out of school?

Given the current high prices, it is expected that tuition fees for all schools will inevitably increase in the next session. The amount of the scholarship needs to reach at least five million yuan in order to be勉予 [barely] distributed. However, the existing fund is only two million three hundred thousand yuan, a significant difference from the expected amount. We sincerely hope that enthusiastic individuals will generously donate to ensure the smooth progress of the next scholarship work. We would be very grateful! Regarding the application procedures for impoverished students, preliminary review will be handled by the schools themselves. This is different from previous sessions. We hope that students applying will pay special attention to this. The official letter from our office to the principals of various schools and the application procedures are recorded as follows:

### Economic Sector's Discussion on the Establishment of the Economic Security Office

Since the establishment of the Economic Security Office by the First Police Bureau of this city, the business community has expressed great concern because of its close relationship with the economic sector. This newspaper has invited leaders from the economic sector to hold a discussion, exchange opinions on the expectations of the Economic Security Office, and represent the views of the general economic community. The salient points are specially published as follows:

Mr. Xiang Kangyuan: The establishment of the Economic Security Office is most closely related to the industrial and commercial sectors. I would like to raise a few points of hope: The various laws and regulations, prohibited fines, and inspection procedures, etc., on which the Economic Security Office's administrative facilities are based should be announced as soon as possible so that the people can abide by them. If the people violate laws and regulations, the execution of the prohibited penalties by the Security Office should be subject to a Protection Committee to ensure prudence. At the same time, the penalties should set a maximum limit. If the circumstances of the crime exceed this limit, the case should be transferred to the court for legal trial. When economic police are performing their duties, they must have special identification to avoid the occurrence of fraudulent situations. At the same time, the facilities of economic police must be suitable for the environment of the Shanghai economic sector. The treatment of economic police should be specially improved, so that they can maintain their livelihood and serve with peace of mind.

Mr. Li Quanshi:

The establishment of the Economic Security Office now is for the welfare of the citizens of Shanghai, so the economic police must be particularly capable, and each must be of noble character; otherwise, they will not only be insufficient to stabilize the economy, or even enough to disrupt the merchants and people. Originally, to successfully control the economy, the person executing the control must first be able to control his own desires. If the economic police cannot inspect themselves, then they cannot control others. This is not an overly harsh statement, but rather an overly eager expectation, so I speak sharply.

The mission of the economic police is economic security. The so-called "economic security" is to protect the stability of people's livelihood and the economy. To seek to ensure people's livelihood, the retail prices of all goods must be reduced, but it is also necessary to weigh the importance and execute them separately, such as vegetables, rice, coal, and salt, which are all very closely related to people's livelihood. I hope that the Economic Security Office can pay attention to this and lower their prices, especially the prices of vegetables in the small vegetable markets.

The lessons of the previous 清鄉 [rural cleansing] are well-known facts. I hope that the Economic Security Office can establish its reputation from the beginning and not repeat the mistakes of the past 清鄉 [rural cleansing] work, which often gave people cause for criticism.

It is of course best if one more agency can benefit the people. Otherwise, if it is not run well, it is better not to run it at all. In the future, I hope that the Economic Security Office can be impartial and achieve the goal of seeking welfare for the people by stabilizing prices.

Mr. Sun Ruihuang:

The Economic Security Office is a temporary agency established in the First Police Bureau. First, the outside world should understand its mission, so as to prevent future knowing violations of the law. There is still a lack of clear explanation, so there have been doubts in recent times. The work, investigation of human rights, and illegal practices are all for the , the key seems to lie in major commodities, but how does it work? What is considered illegal? The general public should have a clear understanding. Items such as the name, quality, and quantity of goods should be specified and explained in detail. If there is knowledge of and violation of the law, penalties should be imposed accordingly; if there is penalty without knowledge, it does not seem to be the intention of the authorities. Therefore, if the Economic Security Office can explain the details to the people before implementing its work, it can avoid many injustices and unnecessary disputes. I think this is what the people hope for.

Mr. Lin Kanghou:

The Economic Security Office is an expansion of the special high section's Economic Division. Since its establishment, we have only seen the conversation between Deputy Director Du and Division Chief Gotō, but we hope that Mayor Chen can also express his opinion. There are four agencies in Shanghai managing the economy: the Municipal Government's Economic Bureau, the Materials Investigation Committee, the Economic Division, and the Economic Security Office. My opinion is to ask the authorities to clearly disclose the respective powers and boundaries of these four agencies, so that the public can understand. The Security Office is different from the 清　局 [Bureau for the Purification of Social Customs]. We hope that it will not disturb the people in any way. The search methods in the past 清　 [Purification] areas have already made the people cry out in agony. How can they be used in Shanghai again? Security police should use civilized methods. For any illegal events, it is best to consult with the trade association first and cooperate to remedy the drawbacks. The association, due to its duty, will never intentionally protect wrongdoers.

What we are now asking the authorities for is: Clearly announce the powers and boundaries of the four agencies. The Security Office should be different from the 清鄉 [Rural Cleansing] Bureau. Peaceful measures should be adopted. Only after these two points are achieved can other issues be discussed.

Mr. Cai Shengbai: I agree very much with the opinions of the distinguished speakers I have just heard. I would like to add a few points as follows:

The scope of laws and regulations of the Economic Security Office must be clearly defined. At present, many wartime economic laws and regulations of the national government have been promulgated, but their meaning is profound and cannot be understood by the general public. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will compile detailed interpretations based on the laws and regulations so that the people can follow them and there will be no misinterpretations. This means that the people should be "taught before being punished, and not punished without being taught."

Those who violate laws and regulations should be given appropriate dispositions. If the circumstances of the violation by a store are not serious, the trade association should be notified first to advise them to change their ways and renew themselves. Because the law is nothing more than human sentiment, it is better to save trouble if the offender can correct their mistakes in time. As for whether future offenders will be judged solely by the Economic Security Office, or whether offenders can hire lawyers to defend themselves, it must also be expressly stipulated. It is best that the Economic Security Office be responsible for investigation, and the court be responsible for judgment. Economic investigation work must be simplified. At present, there are many agencies established by the central and local governments, such as the Financial Inspection Office, the Insurance Regulatory Bureau, and the Enterprise Supervision Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Management Committee which are about to be established. There are many institutions, and their powers overlap. The central government is the superior agency, and the Economic Security Office is the subordinate agency. In the investigation work of the Security Office, if the central government has established a special investigation agency, then the Economic Security Office does not need to conduct a second investigation to avoid duplication.

Mr. Chen Riping:

The establishment of the Economic Security Office is of great concern to the business community and the general public. I would like to briefly state my hopes for this matter to the government authorities and all sectors as follows:

Hopes for the government:

(A) Unification and clarification of economic laws and regulations: The current economic laws and regulations are enacted and implemented at any time, and there are many places where they are repeated and divergent, which seem to lack clarity. It is necessary to unify and訂 [revise] them. I hope that the central or local government will訂 [revise] unified economic laws and regulations, and clearly stipulate and explain in detail all matters that should be subject to control so that merchants and people can easily comply with them.

(B) Concentration of administrative agencies' authority: There seem to be too many economic administrative agencies in this city, and it is not easy to concentrate authority. People feel quite disturbed and do not know what to do. I hope that the government will quickly adjust and merge the overlapping economic administrative inspection agencies to concentrate authority and facilitate the implementation of government orders.

(C) Fair penalties: Penalties should be clearly stipulated and trials should be thorough to avoid unjust leniency or punishments. Minor offenses should be subject to administrative sanctions, and serious offenses should be transferred to judicial organs for handling to ensure fairness.

Hopes for the Economic Security Office:

(A) Increase the salaries of economic police and protect their positions: Due to the nature of their duties, the economic police of the Economic Security Office have more contact with the outside world and are more likely to be tempted by illegal individuals. Increasing their salaries must be enough to maintain their livelihood so that they have no internal worries. Their positions must also be protected so that they can serve with peace of mind to enhance administrative efficiency.

(B) Clear rewards and punishments: Increasing the salaries of economic police and protecting their positions are not enough to be considered perfect. It is necessary to determine rewards and punishments based on whether they perform their duties diligently. Those who have made meritorious contributions should be rewarded; those who abuse the law for personal gain should be severely punished according to the law. If rewards and punishments can be clearly defined, it will be enough to encourage their service spirit.

(C) Careful selection of talent: Since the salaries of economic police are excellent, those with good character and academics should be carefully selected to fill the positions, so as to be honest and impartial, act in the public interest, and be able to guide merchants and people to jointly abide by the law.

Hopes for the public:

(A) Citizens should follow the government's wartime economic policy: During this time of war, the government is implementing a wartime controlled economic policy. All sectors of industry and commerce should cooperate in promoting it to prevent the lack of materials and the soaring of prices, which would harm people's livelihood and affect the war. If merchants and people are each self-disciplined, there will be no violation of economic laws and regulations, and they will be spared 처 [treatment].

(B) Relevant groups and media should guide citizens to abide by the law: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, baojia [neighborhood watch] self-defense groups, and various groups related to the welfare of citizens should guide and advise merchants and people from time to time not to hoard, seek illegal profits, or violate economic laws and regulations. This is also the best way to prevent it from happening.

(C) Jointly eliminate illegal activities: It is true that economic police exercise their powers as a countermeasure to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. However, given the density of the population and the vastness of the area in this city, if all parties can jointly cooperate and report at any time, it will be a good way to eliminate illegal activities. Not only can violations of economic laws and regulations be prevented, but also other illegal activities can be reduced.

Mr. Yao Qingsan:

The distinguished speakers have given many excellent opinions, and I would like to add a few more points. I believe that the Economic Security Office is of great importance to the livelihood of all citizens, and its every move should have a legal basis and at the same time be consistent with the facts.

The so-called legal basis means that the Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Important Goods, which were promulgated by the government, should be the general basis for the office to investigate materials in the future, but the articles are too simple. Supplementary detailed rules must be made when implementing them. I hope that the government will clearly stipulate this point so that violators know what articles and clauses they have violated and what they are guilty of.

The so-called consistent with the facts means that it must consider all aspects of the facts. For example, when setting a price limit, it must be suitable for the cost of the goods. If the price limit is not suitable for the cost, then the merchants will definitely feel distressed. Another example is the matter of gold trading. It has never been expressly prohibited by law, but in fact the government also uses gold to buy cotton yarn. Those who buy and sell gold get their gold bars from the sale of cotton yarn. Is it guilty after all, and how can it be innocent? The government should also explain it clearly.

Furthermore, it is necessary to clearly define the scope of powers of the Economic Security Office. I believe that if the central government has directly established a management agency for a certain industry in Shanghai, it should not be subject to the interference of the Economic Security Office. At present, the central government has established a Financial Inspection Office for the banking industry, an Insurance Regulatory Bureau for the insurance industry, and an Enterprise Supervision Bureau for various enterprise companies. There is no need for local governments to do what the central government has already done to avoid duplication of powers.

In short, the work of the Economic Security Office is passive, and it can only punish after the violation of the law. If you want to prevent problems before they occur, you must engage in active work, that is, stabilizing people's livelihood. After people's livelihood is stable, economic crimes can be reduced.

### Giving a Concrete Example: Injustice: The Actions of the Wujiang Office of the Rice Control Association

Wujiang County in Garupan is a rice-producing area, so the brewing industry has always been very developed, second only to Suzhou. Last year, due to restrictions on the use of glutinous rice for brewing, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau issued an order requiring all brewers to apply for permission before they could brew. All merchants complied because it was a matter of grain administration. Later, the Grain Bureau separately determined the amount of brewing, reducing it by about 40% of the brewing volume of the previous year. At that time, the Rice Control Association did not move or issue any regulations. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, when the new wine was about to be released, the Wujiang Office of the Rice Control Association suddenly sent a notice to the Suzhou-Wujiang Brewing Industry Association, stating:

After verifying the brewing volume submitted by the Suzhou-Wujiang Brewing Industry Association, it is found to be in line with the quantity set by the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau. We are now reporting this for your review. It has been found that Wujiang brewers directly purchase glutinous rice without permission and should be treated as privately hoarding rice according to the law. Considering their ignorance, they should complete the procedures for the rice they have purchased for brewing according to the association's allocation methods, that is, the association's purchase price is 820 yuan per dan [unit of dry measure], and the allocation price is 1,800 yuan, a difference of 980 yuan per dan. Please promptly order the merchants to calculate based on the actual brewing volume of 33,996 dan [unit of dry measure] and send the difference to the association as soon as possible. Therefore, after verification, the merchants purchased and transported glutinous rice directly without the approval of the association, destroying the regulations and disregarding public orders, which is very wrong. All differences are hoped to be督飭 [supervise and order] and迅 [promptly]解 [delivered] by the merchants in full, so that it can be reported for closing. Please do not delay, and hope that you will investigate and handle this matter.

The brewing of various merchants has been approved by the Grain Bureau. What is wrong? The Rice Control Association had no plans to purchase glutinous rice in advance, and had no allocation of rice to the brewers afterwards. In fact, they want to seize the so-called difference of 31,326,080 yuan with a piece of paper, gaining without labor. How can there be such a thing in the world? It is heard that the merchants are planning to jointly request the higher authorities to thoroughly investigate. Moreover, Suzhou and Wujiang are in the same association, and the circumstances of buying rice and brewing wine are exactly the same. The Rice Control Association does not mention Suzhou, but only Wujiang, because Suzhou is the provincial capital area, and they dare not act rashly, fearing criticism. Wujiang is a remote rural area. Although the Rice Control Association is not an official yamen [government office], it is more than enough to scare the country folks. At this time, the person in charge of the Rice Control Association, who is entrusted with the important task of national grain administration after Hou Hubu was executed, dares to follow in his footsteps and test the law with his own body. It may be that he wants money and does not want his life, but the country folks have the pain of losing both their lives and their money.

Letter to My Sister (6)

This monument to despair is ten times larger than the Nakamoto Tekshin monument at the Second Middle School. On the back is an inscription in English. Losing half of it makes me feel very uncomfortable.

(The Japanese people of the Meiji era certainly did not sincerely appreciate Perry; there must have been other unspeakable reasons why they had to express their gratitude in this way.)

That's the only explanation.

The panoramic painting the landlady mentioned is outside the circle of the monument. In a simple little shed are displayed childish and clumsy paintings of warships, maps of that time, and photographs of Perry, etc. Perry's face has no hair, he looks very young, and he wears a one-eyed glasses. He always looks like he's winking and grimacing, with wide cheekbones like today's U.S. President Roosevelt.

(Is he trying to poke at the eyes of the Japanese with an American finger!) Thinking of this, I couldn't help but laugh. Then, my husband walked towards the sandy beach. Tired of walking, we sat down on the soft sand.

In the morning sun, the surface of the sea rippled with small waves. In the waves, it seemed like schools of silver fish were jumping, reflecting the sunlight. On the opposite shore, there were many mountains stretching endlessly. (How beautiful the sea is!) I haven't appreciated the sea for a long time. I seemed to have forgotten that I didn't sleep well last night and felt really refreshed.

(A very high mountain presents itself in front. Although not as high as Mount Osumi, its shape is somewhat cylindrical.)

He didn't know the names of Mount Kano or Mount Nokogiri, but he noticed that the continuous mountains in the sea were heading towards the old office. On this sea, there is naturally no elegant charm like Cherry Island, nor is there a fragrant pine forest. It really looks like it has been attacked by ships. The blue expanse of this sea and the surrounding mountains are exactly the same as the Tenpōzan beach where I used to play with others.

(How beautiful the sea is!)

He said this again in his heart. Real people also like the sea. Perhaps Takao likes it even more. However, one has become a marine athlete, while the other has become a despairing painter suffering from the world. The two people who once loved the sea equally are now worlds apart.

(The sea is so beautiful! But I have become someone who cannot love the sea.)

Takao was again attacked by the worries of last night. It was as if a very clear mind was dyed with ink, completely turning black.

(What am I doing coming to the beach? I shouldn't have come. I should go back to the Kurihama Inn and finish writing the unfinished letter from last night! Then, I'll go back to Tokyo in the afternoon!)

He thought of getting up at this point, but suddenly he saw something and couldn't get up.
