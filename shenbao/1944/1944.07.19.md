### The Gains and Losses of the Battle of Saipan

This time, the enemy, the Americans, mobilized eight-tenths of their fleet, mainly a large force composed of more than ten battleships and over twenty aircraft carriers, escorting more than a hundred transport ships. Starting from June 11th, they attacked the Mariana Islands. After more than a month, they finally occupied Saipan Island, which is only 24 kilometers long and less than eight kilometers wide. From this, one can see the incompetence of the enemy American combat power. Moreover, the enemy Americans have been constantly consuming and reinforcing their forces over this month, and the price they paid is not worth the gain.

Judging from the combat operations of the Allied Japan, they have always adopted a strategy of fighting the few against the many, trying to consume the enemy's forces as much as possible. Especially since July 7th, the troops stationed on the island have made a final all-out attack, lasting ten days of arduous combat. The Japanese residents on the island also cooperated with the army to participate in the battle, and all of them died in their posts. From this, one can see the Japanese spirit of preferring to be shattered jade rather than intact tile.

Therefore, the Battle of Saipan, on the surface, seems to be a victory for the enemy Americans and a defeat for Japan. But what is the reality? The incompetence of the enemy American combat power has already been demonstrated in the battle. At the same time, it also demonstrated the Allied Japan's spirit of being shattered jade. If we compare the two sides in battles of equal strength and scale, based on this combat power and fighting spirit, the outcome is already obvious.

Furthermore, we should pay attention to the repercussions caused by the Battle of Saipan from the Japanese perspective.

First, the characteristic of the Japanese nation is that it is outwardly calm but inwardly tenacious, and also first calm and then tenacious. During the calm period, it buries itself in hard work; when it enters the tenacious period, it perseveres tirelessly. In the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, Japan was calmly burying itself in hard work; now that it has reached the decisive battle stage, Japan is tenaciously persevering tirelessly. Especially in this Battle of Saipan, the decisive battle posture in Japan will definitely change rapidly because of it. The Japanese people have now reached a point where everyone is determined to die. The more the enemy pressures in terms of the situation, the more the Japanese national mentality develops in the direction of resisting the enemy. Therefore, the Japanese people throughout the country regard the Battle of Saipan as "Heaven's blessing," which is to accelerate the development of enemy hatred and promote all manpower to the path of wartime production. For example, the enemy Americans have long used all their strength in aircraft production. Men under the age of 65 and women under the age of 50 all work in aircraft factories. Female workers account for 40% of the total. All automobile factories have been converted into aircraft factories, operating in three shifts day and night, and production efficiency has reached its peak. However, female workers in Japan account for only 20% of the total, and factories operate only one shift a day. If they switch to three shifts day and night in the future, production efficiency can be rapidly increased. This is the most important point to promote the development of the Japanese people's enemy-hating mentality.

Second, from the perspective of the overall war situation, Saipan Island is indeed a partial loss, but it does not fundamentally affect the situation, just like a tree whose branches and leaves fall, which is not enough to shake its roots. The partial sacrifice of branches and leaves is a planned strategy. Moreover, the Japanese army and navy are luring the enemy closer to the inner line. At the same time, they are successfully operating on the mainland, and are doing their best to accumulate combat power to await the arrival of a decisive battle opportunity. In particular, the Japanese people unanimously trust the army and navy and fully cooperate, which is the most powerful guarantee for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Third, as for the enemy, the sacrifices in the Battle of Saipan are admitted by the enemy Americans as the greatest blow since the start of the war. Therefore, the enemy American military leaders have been greatly shaken psychologically by this battle, even though they have established a foothold on the island. On the one hand, the enemy American supply line will not only be extended in the future, but must also continue uninterrupted, which is an enormous drain. Secondly, the enemy American government leaders will use this battle as a credit to seize power. Roosevelt will even use it as a propaganda tool to be elected president and dominate the world. The financial groups will also use it to carry out economic aggression against China, India, the Near East and other places, and attempt to monopolize them.

In short, the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive battle stage, and the enemy is fighting desperately, which is to be expected. The gain or loss of one place has no decisive impact on the overall war situation. Therefore, we do not attach much importance to our observation of the gains and losses of Saipan Island. What we should value is that the Allied Japanese military and civilians are even more aroused by the enemy-hating mentality, and are rapidly changing the domestic decisive battle posture, accumulating combat power to await the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. We are also a participating country, and from the standpoint of the entire Greater East Asia War, we must take consistent action with our allies. Therefore, how our government and people will rise up together to adapt to the decisive battle situation is the most important issue at present.

### The Only Way Forward in the Face of an Unprecedentedly Critical Situation - Important Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo recently delivered a speech entitled "Facing an Urgent War Situation," the full text of which is as follows: The Mariana Islands, since June 11th, have been the scene of fierce fighting by the Japanese soldiers, who have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. However, Saipan Island has finally fallen into enemy hands, which is truly regrettable. Under the great task of protecting the divine land, I hereby express my deepest condolences to the loyal and brave soldiers and compatriots who died for their country in the South Seas. Since the issuance of the declaration of war, two and a half years have passed. During this time, our imperial soldiers have launched heroic battles everywhere, and our 100 million compatriots have also been able to overcome all difficulties and advance towards the long journey of completing the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain and the United States, especially the enemy Americans, have also gradually increased their counter-offensive forces, and the enemy has gradually advanced to the Mariana Islands. Today, the Empire is facing an unprecedentedly critical situation. However, today is precisely the best time to defeat the enemy and determine the outcome. At this time, in order to protect our imperial country, there is only one way forward. With no delusions in our minds and no thoughts of life or death, relying on the fresh blood of our many comrades-in-arms and compatriots, we must恪守战训、傾挙全力恪守战训, and strive to quickly destroy the enemy and achieve final victory. Only in this way can we repay the brave soldiers who died for the Greater East Asia War to protect the imperial country. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been clearly stated in the declaration of war. For the Empire, the Greater East Asia War is a war of rise and fall, a war of liberation for Asia. For the enemy, the Greater East Asia War is a war to enslave East Asia and conquer the world. Therefore, it can be said to be a war of self-preservation and self-defense versus a war to achieve wild ambitions, a war of liberation versus a war of aggression. Today, we have reached the decisive battle, and it is also the time for us to join hands with the various ethnic groups of East Asia and the Allied countries in Europe to thoroughly destroy the enemy's reckless counter-offensive. And the real war is just beginning. One hundred million citizens should renew their determination to die, and gather the traditional fighting spirit of three thousand years to achieve active victory, and rely on this to reassure the Emperor and strengthen our fighting spirit.

### The Japanese Garrison on Saipan Island Heroically Sacrificed Themselves Behind Enemy Lines, Displaying the True Essence of Courageous Combat

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th that the Japanese army on Saipan Island launched a final all-out attack on the morning of July 7th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. A part of the Japanese army advanced to the vicinity of Mount Tapochau, fighting bravely and fiercely, causing great losses to the enemy. By the 16th, all members had gloriously died in battle. The commander of the army unit was Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito, and the commander of the naval unit was Rear Admiral Takehisa Uemura. The highest naval commander in that area, Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, also died in battle on the island. The Japanese residents on Saipan Island always cooperated with the military. All those who could fight participated in the battle, and seemed to share the same fate as the Japanese soldiers on the island.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Saipan Island launched a final general attack on the American army on July 7th. At that time, the highest commander of the area issued an order to sacrifice themselves for the country with the spirit of fighting to the death. The main point is that since the enemy American army landed, the bravery of the Japanese troops has truly been fully displayed. The garrison decided to launch a final general attack on the enemy Americans on July 7th. On the morning of that day, all the troops broke through the enemy forces in front of them and advanced towards Garapan Kanoa, determined to crush the enemy American lines. Before the decisive battle, special commando teams were selected separately from each unit. After the 6th, they infiltrated the enemy's positions at any time to destroy the enemy's headquarters, camps, artillery positions, tanks, aircraft, etc., to create chaos.

### Japanese Army and Navy Soldiers Unite and Await the Opportunity - Statement by Director Matsushima

(Central News Agency) After inflicting a severe blow on the landing American forces, the Japanese army defending Saipan Island has gloriously sacrificed itself. This was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 18th. Naval Captain Matsushima, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, made a statement on this matter, the main points of which are as follows: Since June 11th, the Japanese military units on Saipan Island have been fighting a large force of enemy Americans, enduring all kinds of harsh conditions, resisting enemy attacks, and fighting bravely for more than a month. The significant damage they inflicted on the enemy has been repeatedly announced by the enemy side, which is clearly visible. In particular, the Undersecretary of the US Navy, Forrestal, cried out loudly on the 16th about the US military's manpower crisis, which shows the fierceness of the battle. In fact, the Japanese army defending Saipan Island had fully accomplished the strategic objective of destroying and weakening the enemy's forces before gloriously sacrificing themselves. Although the Japanese army lost a famous general like Vice Admiral Nagumo on Saipan Island, the brave and fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison, fighting to the last soldier, was a manifestation of the traditional spirit. This would be difficult to achieve for the British and American armies, which rely solely on material strength. The Japanese army and navy soldiers have strengthened their determination to wait for the opportunity to kill the enemy in order to avenge the comrades who died in battle on Saipan Island.

The loss of Saipan Island has given the enemy a strategic advantage. The enemy may recently use this island as a base to operate in the central Pacific. However, the Japanese had long anticipated this attempt by the enemy and have been closely watching them. Therefore, it can be asserted that it will be difficult for the enemy to easily achieve their goal. On the contrary, the Japanese army can wait for the enemy's forces to approach the mainland and destroy them in one fell swoop. The Japanese can wait at their leisure, choose the most favorable location and timing, and achieve final victory.

The essence of military tactics is like water, which has no constant form and can be stretched and bent freely. In the use of troops, one must not adhere to a single condition. Although the Japanese army has abandoned a small island in the Pacific, the main force is still dispersed throughout the Greater East Asia region, cultivating its combat power to prepare for the final decisive battle. No matter where the enemy appears in the future, the Japanese army will inflict a more severe blow than on Saipan Island.

The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia must not be tempted by the enemy's superficial success. At this final juncture that determines the rise and fall of Greater East Asia, I hope you will quietly await the great potential of the Japanese nation. The liberation of Greater East Asia can only be guaranteed after Japan achieves victory. Whether or not East Asia can escape the colonial status of Britain and the United States depends on the strength of the Japanese army and navy. I hope you will clearly understand this and move forward in cooperation to achieve the common victory of Greater East Asia.

### Eastern Front Battles Approaching East Prussia, Germany Determined to Defend Kaunas with All Its Might

Reuter's dispatch from Seoul, 18th (Central News Agency) The focus of the Eastern Front operations is still in the central region, where Soviet forces seem to have begun crossing the Neman River between Kaunas (also known as Kaunas) and Grodno. According to front-line sources, a part of the 3rd Belorussian Front has reached a point two kilometers from the so-called "Suwalki Triangle" contained within East Prussia. The pressure on Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania, is also increasing moment by moment from the southeast and south. Soviet forces are currently attempting to rapidly expand the bridgehead west of the Neman River, and the threat to Kaunas from that direction cannot be ignored. According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, German forces are using new tank divisions to defend Kaunas with all their might against the above-mentioned Soviet movements. The battle for the defense of East Prussia, centered around Bartoszyce, seems to be approaching its final stage.

The development of the current war situation is extremely rapid, and its handling is extremely urgent.

### Flour and Wheat Control Committee Negotiates Loans with Banks for Wheat Procurement Funds - Seeks 200 Million Yuan Loan from Chinese and Japanese Banks

Following the announcement of this year's unified procurement, allocation, manufacturing, and processing methods for flour and wheat by the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce Control Council, the wheat procurement work needs to be launched swiftly. According to the regulations, designated agents have been selected and regions have been demarcated to separately designate procurement work. Currently, to raise funds for procurement, the committee is negotiating a loan of 200 million yuan with various Chinese and Japanese banks in the city. The Japanese side includes six banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Teikoku Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Taiwan Bank, and Chosen Bank. The Chinese side includes twenty banks such as Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Hsing Yeh Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Real Estate Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Continental Bank, and Chin Cheng Banking Corporation, jointly forming a wheat loan syndicate. The Bank of China will serve as the representative of the syndicate, and the loan will be provided in the form of acceptance bills, which will be discounted by the Central Bank of China. It is understood that the loan has been principally finalized. Regarding the participating banks' loan quotas and interest rates, representatives from the Chinese and Japanese banks, including the Bank of Communications and Yokohama Specie Bank, convened a meeting yesterday (the 18th) afternoon at the Central Bank of China to discuss and finalize the details. It is expected that the agreement will be signed and established soon.

### Minister Matsudaira Discusses Recent Situation in Chongqing - High Prices, Confused Ideologies

Matsudaira, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, made the following remarks when meeting with a group of reporters on the 18th, regarding "the recent situation in Chongqing after Wallace's visit": "It seems that Wallace returned to Washington about ten days ago. However, when he left Chongqing on July 2nd, he believed that although Chongqing's awareness of the war was strong, they were facing various economic difficulties, which inevitably led to military failures.

Heard of Failure."

It is also said that during his stay in Chongqing, he encouraged the Chongqing Communists to compromise or advised them to improve agriculture. However, there has been no new progress since then. Prices in Chongqing are still soaring. On July 5th, Zhang Pingqun stated at a meeting with reporters that general prices were, on average, 438 times higher than before the war. Recent news from the mainland indicates that since the failure of the Hunan campaign, the price of rice has soared to 18,080 yuan per stone. From this, it can be inferred that general prices have actually increased to 800 times, which is twice as high as when Wallace was in Chongqing. Furthermore, the CCP's attitude towards Chongqing is extremely tough, demanding the transformation of the Chongqing regime and allowing representatives from Yan'an to participate. On July 7th, they also issued slogans demanding that Chongqing lift the encirclement of the CCP's army and provide military expenses for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. From this, it can be seen that the CCP's position remains consistent, still demanding concessions from Chongqing.

Talk of Government

Reorganization is Rampant. There are many who covet the position of the President of the Executive Yuan, and there are also rumors of changes in the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. On the one hand, when Chongqing intellectuals meet Wallace, they always mention agriculture, believing that Wallace wants Chongqing to pay attention to agriculture so that Chongqing will permanently become a market for American goods. Furthermore, they strongly express their dissatisfaction with Wallace's interference in Chongqing's internal affairs and diplomacy, disregarding Chongqing's will, and denying its independence and autonomy. In short, Wallace, during his visit to Chongqing, ignored the reality, acted as he pleased, and spoke arbitrarily, stirring up trouble out of thin air and causing ideological confusion. As a result, the issue of government reorganization cannot be ignored. Regarding the relationship between Soong Tzu-wen and Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Mei-ling flew to South America a few days ago. Although she ostensibly claimed it was to recuperate from illness, her true purpose may have been to discuss these issues with the Soong family and their allies."
