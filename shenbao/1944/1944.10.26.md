### The Great Battle in the Philippine Sea Offers a Great Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy. Minister Ren Expresses His Views Yesterday

○Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The good news of the Allied naval victory east of Taiwan and east of Saipan has once again arrived. This battle resulted in the sinking of as many as six of the enemy's newest aircraft carriers, which has greatly inspired the one billion people of Greater East Asia. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Minister of Naval Affairs Ren Yuandao of the National Government to inquire about his views on this great victory. Minister Ren graciously made the following remarks: The enemy American navy, after suffering a major defeat in the waters east of Taiwan, recklessly attempted a landing in the Philippines, which is an extremely foolish move. However, the commander of the enemy American Pacific Fleet is aware of the difficulties of avoiding such an attempt, and President Roosevelt, facing re-election for the fourth time, is seeking to deceive the public and has no choice but to act rashly. From a military perspective, we can observe that the enemy Americans had prepared for a landing in the Philippines when they invaded Taiwan, as they clearly knew that they would inevitably fail in Taiwan and would have to change their strategy after the failure. However, this foolish move is actually beneficial to Japan. We can assert that the more enemy troops that land, the more convenient it will be for Japan, as it provides Japan with a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Now that this opportunity has arrived, Japan must not let it go easily. The two major victories, the previous one east of Taiwan and the current one in the Philippines, sufficiently prove this. Based on the results of these battles, we are even more deeply convinced of the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. Our entire nation should recognize themselves as East Asians of East Asia, quickly abandon past grievances, and participate in this Greater East Asia War. Furthermore, the recent naval warfare situation has changed its past character. Past major battles, such as those in the Yellow Sea, were planar operations, while now they have transformed into three-dimensional operations. If we understand the nature of this naval warfare, we can be certain that the Japanese fleet's deployment at this time is a good opportunity for a final reckoning with the enemy American navy.

### The National General Association of the New People's Society Opens in Peiping Today

○Beiping, 25th (Central News Agency) - The General United Conference of the New People's Society for the 33rd year will open in Peiping on the 26th. Representatives from various provinces and cities have arrived in Peiping in the past few days.

### The Revised List of Major Commodities Was Approved by the Executive Yuan Yesterday

○Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The list of major commodities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry was promulgated and implemented in the 30th year, listing 19 items. In May of this year, due to the merger of the former Ministry of Food into the Ministry of Industry, its seven major commodities were also merged, totaling 26 items before and after. The Ministry of Industry has now merged, organized, and revised these items according to the principles decided by the Local Economic Policy Liaison Conference: those related to military needs, those essential to people's livelihood, and those that need to be controlled due to supply and demand should all be listed as major commodities. In order to make the above principles more concrete, three key points are added as criteria for revision: those subject to implementation control, those subject to restricted actions, and those subject to evaluation implementation. The draft list of revised major commodities has been submitted by Minister Chen to the Executive Yuan and passed at the 282nd meeting, and submitted to the Central Political Committee for record, promulgation and implementation. The revised list increases rice bran and white paper, while tea and glass are not included. Rice was previously referred to as "rice grain," which was originally a major commodity, but it was not included in the ordinary major commodity list because there was a special management department for its implementation control. In May of this year, the Ministry of Food was ordered to be abolished, and the free trade of rice grain was also permitted. For the sake of management, it is specially added to this list. In addition, white paper is of great importance to the cultural industry, and the newspaper industry is distributed by the Propaganda Department to prevent speculative hoarding, so it is specially listed in this table as one of the items. Although tea and glass were previously listed as major commodities, tea has not yet been subject to control, and the raw materials for glass manufacturing have been subject to control as chemical industrial products, so they are not included in this table. The full text of the revised list of items is recorded below: 1. Food (1) Rice: japonica rice, indica rice, glutinous rice, and rice varieties (2) Wheat flour (3) Coarse grains: wheat, barley, naked barley, soybeans, peanuts, sorghum, broad beans, peas, mung beans, corn (4) Livestock: cattle, pigs, etc. (5) Eggs: chicken eggs (6) Sugar: white and brown sugar (7) Edible oil: soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil. 2. Fiber (1) Cotton (2) Cotton yarn (3) Cotton products: cloth and needlework (4) Woolens (5) Wool products (6) Flax (7) Silk (8) Rayon (9) Silk fabrics (10) Raw hemp (11) Hemp products (12) Blended fabrics. 3. Chemical Industrial Products (1) Western medicine (2) Pigments (3) Dyes (4) Alcohol (5) Raw materials and other products. 4. Industrial Oils and Fats 5. Cigarettes 6. Soap 7. Matches 8. Coal (1) Lump coal (2) Coal briquettes (3) Coal dust 9. Cigarettes and the tobacco industry 10. Rubber (including raw materials and products) 11. Metals (including raw materials and products) (1) Iron (2) Copper (3) White iron (4) Non-ferrous metals 12. Electrical Equipment 13. Leather (including raw materials and products) 14. White Paper.

### Tank Battles Unfold in East Prussia

Soviet Forces Continue to Exert Pressure

○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: The battles on the border of East Prussia are almost entirely mechanized. In four to eight hours, no fewer than 323 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. The Soviet forces are sparing no heavy sacrifices in order to extend the war into the interior of Germany. According to recent observations, Soviet losses within Germany are 40% higher. German commanders are now mobilizing fresh troops to prepare a counterattack and drive the enemy out of the country. The war in East Prussia at the end of this month will be fierce. More than 700 Soviet Tanks Destroyed

A German military spokesman said last night that the German forces fighting in East Prussia have won, and a total of more than 700 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: After the initial Soviet invasion of Goldap in East Prussia, their advance has been halted. German forces are attacking the Soviet flank from the south and north, cutting off the Soviet lines of communication. The Soviet forces are being attacked from both sides, and as a result, most of the Soviet forces in the Goldap and Gumbinnen areas have retreated. The Soviet attacks on the rear of Memel from Rauschen and Szillen have been frustrated by German counterattacks. Therefore, the German counter-measures on the East Prussian border are proving effective. German Forces Fight Hard on the Balkan Front

On the Hungarian battlefield, the Soviet attacks on Budapest have slowed slightly, with only a few battalions attacking in the past 24 hours. Fierce fighting continues in the Szolnok area. Soviet forces continue to exert pressure on the Tisza and Danube rivers. German forces are continuing to retreat in Greece.

### Chungking Overcrowded with Refugees

○Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - Since the retreat of the Yu army in South China, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Chungking within four months. According to a Central News Agency survey in Chungking, the population of Chungking has exceeded one million. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: Soviet and Bulgarian forces are attempting to cut off north-south lines of communication in order to encircle German forces. German forces are fighting hard to prevent the enemy from succeeding. Yesterday, German forces defeated attacking Soviet tank forces, inflicting heavy casualties. East of Kraljevo, Soviet forces launched a desperate attack, attempting to encircle German positions at Fojnica. The German defenders have been reinforced.

### Hungarian Soldiers

○Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: Hungarian newspapers have published conscription notices. Officers and warrant officers from the 1896 class and reservists from the 1902 class must immediately join the army. In addition, those who are physically fit but have not served in active military service should also enlist.

### End of Anti-Communist War in Northern Spain

○Delhi, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: General Yagüe told the News that people entered the Spanish province of Navarra in two teams on October 4th. Most of them have been captured, and the rest have been driven back to France.

### Focus of Western Front Warfare Shifts to Central Netherlands; Anglo-Canadian Joint Offensive Frustrated

○Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the end of the fighting in the Aachen area on the Western Front, the focus of the war has shifted to the central Netherlands in the northernmost part. The British Second Army launched an offensive with powerful mechanized units northeast of 's-Hertogenbosch, but German forces are still fiercely resisting. Fierce fighting has also begun in other areas close to the German border. Snow is falling in one or two places in the area, making offensive and defensive battles between the two armies extremely difficult. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: The entrance to the port of Antwerp remains blocked, preventing the enemy from entering, which demonstrates the power of the German artillery at the Scheldt estuary. The enemy has repeatedly failed to capture the Scheldt estuary, so they launched a fierce attack with large forces along the Roosendaal-Breda-Geertruidenberg line, and only made progress on Monday, but failed to break through the German defenses. Since Sunday, the British have also been attacking 's-Hertogenbosch, attempting a large-scale encirclement, threatening the German positions at the mouth of the Scheldt, Meuse, and Rhine rivers. On Monday, the British were still only outside the city of 's-Hertogenbosch. The U.S. First Army on both sides of Geilenkirchen is still attacking fiercely. If a major offensive is launched here, it will be directed not only east, but also north and northeast, to echo the British Second Army's advance from the Nijmegen bridgehead along the east bank of the Meuse towards Geldern and Wesel.

### Anti-Axis Conference to be Convened Early Next Year

○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Athens, saying: "At the Moscow Conference, a plan to divide Greece has certainly been discussed based on the Soviet principle of establishing a Macedonian state within the Balkan Federation. Southern Greece will fall within the British sphere of influence, while northern and eastern Greece will fall within the Soviet sphere." Eden's trip to Athens is to persuade the Greek authorities to accept this agreement. The German Foreign Ministry also knows that Eden will also go to Belgrade to meet with Tito to explain the agreement to be concluded between King Peter of Yugoslavia and Tito. Eden may also visit Rome to resolve the dispute over Sicily. Eden may also visit Ankara to make the Turkish authorities understand the difficulty of the UK preventing the Soviet Union from delaying discussions on the Dardanelles issue. The British Economist magazine recently stated that the Soviet Union will insist on its demand for Iranian oil rights in the Tehran Conference, which is part of Moscow's active Near East policy.

### Provisional Government Formed in Greece

### Recent Situation in Wu County

— Min Xian

Wu County was the capital of the State of Wu in the Spring and Autumn period. During the Qin and Han dynasties, it was called Kuaiji. In the Later Han and Five Dynasties, it was renamed Wu Prefecture. During the Sui Dynasty, it was changed to Suzhou. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, it was called Pingjiang. During the Ming Dynasty, it was Suzhou Prefecture, and the Qing Dynasty followed suit as the capital of Jiangsu Province. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the provincial capital was moved to Nanjing. The three counties of Changzhou, Wu County, and Yuanhe, as well as the two waters of Taihu and Jinghu, were combined and renamed Wu County. Recently, it was renamed the provincial capital again. The Qingyang area south of the city was once a Japanese concession, opened as a commercial port, and returned to our country on March 30, 1943, under the principle of mutual benefit and equality in Greater East Asia. In recent years, due to the increasing prevalence of scattered bandits and vagrants in rural areas, and the mixed presence of local troops, extortion is inevitable. Many people with some reputation and those who make a living from farming and are able to make ends meet have moved to the city, and their numbers are increasing daily. According to the latest population statistics in August, the urban area has 232,292 men and 189,684 women, while the rural area has 333,299 men and 309,135 women. The unorganized rural areas have a total of three districts, with 57,692 men and 44,311 women. The entire county has a total of 623,283 men and 543,130 women, totaling 1,166,413 men and women. The rapid increase in population is evident. Transportation Situation

Suzhou is a major station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway starts in Suzhou, but is temporarily closed. It is replaced by charcoal-powered vehicles traveling between Wujiang, Jiaxing, and Changshu, with several trips per day. Unfortunately, there are too few seats for too many people, and the drivers and employees inevitably engage in sardine-like squeezing to obtain personal gain. Recently, it has been heard that the transportation authorities plan to restore automobiles in the urban area, one line from the railway station via Jinmen to Guanqian, one line from Guanqian to Laotuanmen, and one line from Guanqian to Xumen. The territory has rivers crisscrossing it. Small steamers travel east from Suzhou to Shanghai on one line, northwest along the canal via Wuxi and Changzhou to Zhenjiang on another line, and southwest along the Xujiang River via Xiangshan, across Taihu Lake, to Huzhou on another line. There are also small steamers traveling back and forth across Shengze, Muzhi, Zhouzhuang, and Jiaozhi Chenmu. The wharves for transportation boats are located at the four gates of Yi, Xu, Pan, and Qi, with the Jin and Tuan gates having the most. In order to understand the current state of the waterways and for safety reasons, this reporter took a steamer from Wuxi along the canal to Suzhou, which took six hours. All the villages and towns passed through had stationed military and police forces. Unreasonable exactions by the customs were common, and the tricks were endless due to insufficient salary. Recent improvements seem to be few and far between. General Financial and Commercial Situation

Although the urban area suffered the calamity of "nine out of ten houses empty" during the incident, the buildings were able to stand and survive fortunately, and order was restored quickly. There are currently 30 banks and more than 80 money houses and remittance agencies, which is why commerce is thriving. The bustling and prosperous area is still Guanqian, followed by the inside and outside of Yanmen, and Yuyuxiang and Lindun Road, where shops are lined up, more than in Shanghai. On the second afternoon of my visit to Suzhou, I had coffee with two friends, Mr. Xu. Each of us drank a cup of coffee and two pieces of cake, which cost 1,010 yuan before leaving, which was quite a pity. Other restaurants, such as Weiya and the authentic Shanghai-style Lao Zheng, have distinct Shanghai and Suzhou flavors, just like the everywhere-ness of Lu Gaojian. The people of Wu are as particular about food as those in Guangdong Province. In particular, the upstarts who have hoarded and made fortunes in these times have gathered in the provincial capital. Not only are the seats in the food and beverage industry always full, but also general hotels and inns are making a hundred times more profit. Gambling and prostitution follow, and door gods and door intelligences are extorted and cheated all day long. The money they earn from speculation and luck is exchanged here, and abnormal things are everywhere. If we analyze it, the dark side of society is struggling to survive under high pressure, and there are more than tens of thousands who cannot eat their fill every day. County Administration and Public Security Observations

Because Wu County is the provincial capital, the area is vast, and the population is dense, there was talk of establishing a city before the incident. It is now divided into 15 administrative districts. The 12 districts were cleared and reorganized during the tenure of former Provincial Governor Li. There are another three districts that have not yet been cleared and reorganized: [Fenwu District] Hengjing Town, [Fen Twelve District] Dongting East Mountain, and [Fen Thirteen District] Dongting West Mountain. According to Commander Ren Zuxuan of the Second Division stationed in Suzhou, the people in the uncleared areas of the Taihu Lake basin are fierce, and many people from other places have moved here to reclaim wasteland. If the area has a poor harvest, they will become bandits and harm the nearby residents. This is also true in areas slightly off the urban area, such as the border area north of the railway. This is especially true in the neighboring counties of Yixing and Liyang. In order to understand the true situation of the rural areas, this reporter has visited towns and villages and found that there are not a few people who are selfless and loved by the villagers. However, it is inevitable that there are still those who are influenced by the environment, take advantage of the opportunity to benefit themselves, and become powerful and oppressive to the villagers. There are those who swallow their property. Cunning people form gangs to resist, and the military and civilians build a wide gap, which greatly affects harmony and the public security of the rural areas. County Magistrate Shen Jinghua is committed to the people and often goes to the rural areas to inspect, sparing no effort to revitalize the district administration. Educational Revitalization Dynamics

The person in charge of the county's education bureau has changed several times. Due to the order to revitalize, it has been difficult to take over the private schools and convert them into county-run schools. The current director... was newly appointed by the Ministry of Education. He told reporters about the implementation of education: the new education emphasizes both primary and secondary education, such as the unification of curriculum, teaching time, control of school administration and economics, promotion of labor and production education, and expansion and promotion of national compulsory education to gradually reduce the number of out-of-school children. In order to achieve the above goals, all private schools will be taken over by the county, so that the education administration can be unified. According to the latest statistics in the eighth administrative district [urban area], the number of school-age children has reached more than 52,600, of whom only 29,262 have been enrolled, and about 23,400 are out of school. According to statistics, since the implementation of revitalized education, the number of out-of-school children has decreased by 13,757. According to statistics, there are 190 primary and secondary schools in the county, including 4 provincial boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 1 provincial education college and affiliated normal school, 1 provincial Japanese language specialized school, 2 county boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 9 private boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 1 chief center, 18 central primary schools, 56 complete primary schools, 81 junior primary schools, 14 simplified primary schools, 1 experimental people's education school, 3 ordinary people's education schools, 3 simple people's education schools, 4 farmers' education centers, 1 provincial library, 1 county library, 1 county park, and 1 provincial public sports center. The promotion of education is constantly moving forward, but unfortunately, funding is difficult, which affects the treatment of teaching staff and school facilities. Overview of Various County Farms

Suzhou is located on the shore of Taihu Lake, with a dense network of waterways, so irrigation can be worry-free. The main agricultural products are rice and wheat. In previous years, there was more than enough for self-sufficiency. When the autumn harvest arrives, this reporter visited various counties. The fields are vast, but everywhere the ears of rice are grayish-white, accounting for 30-40% in the most fortunate cases, and 60-70% in almost every case. After inquiring with the farmers, I learned that this is called "white awn." The reason is that there was no winter snow last year, so the insect eggs in the soil were able to survive, gnawing at the center of the rice stalks. The rainfall was not well-distributed, and the white dew and continuous rain caused them to wither and ferment into white awn. The farmers work hard under the scorching sun, but all their efforts are in vain. In the most severely affected areas, the harvest of late rice is less than one dou per mu. Military and civilian food needs, coupled with the payment of grain taxes, have a significant impact. In short, the countryside is complaining, and the urban area is suffering from hunger. The soaring price of grain and the following prices of all goods are not without reason. According to a farmer, even if the rice seeds are sown next year, it will be impossible to make up for the loss. Only by reducing land taxes, exempting miscellaneous taxes, and helping landlords and tenant farmers can we avoid their flight from the land and prevent an irremediable situation. That would be fortunate.

### Traffic Safety Campaign Starts Today

Hoping that Citizens Will Strictly Abide by Traffic Rules

The city's police bureau has found that unfortunate traffic deaths and injuries have been increasing daily. The biggest reason is that citizens have not clearly understood traffic rules. Therefore, the [Safe Traffic Movement Week], sponsored by the administrative office, starts today (the 26th). In addition to ordering each branch bureau to send additional traffic police to guide traffic at key traffic points within their respective districts, self-defense corps members are also assisting in various districts. Newspapers and radio stations are also cooperating in promoting traffic essentials. A large number of slogans have also been posted throughout the city and on various vehicles, and large cloth slogans are hung at key traffic points, attracting attention.

### Warning Slogans

The slogans are simple and cautionary, including [Safety First], [Caution Can Prevent Danger, Carelessness Can Easily Cause Trouble], [Be Sure to Look Left and Right Before Crossing the Road], [Do Not Cross the Road Between Parked Vehicles], [Be Especially Careful When Coming Out From Behind Vehicles], [Do Not Attach Bicycles to Moving Streetcars or Trucks], [Riding Two People on a Bicycle Is Most Likely to Cause Trouble], [Keep Left], [Do Not Ride Abreast], [Impatience and Carelessness Are Life-Threatening], [Caution and Care Are Life-Saving], etc.

### Safety Rules

As for the [Safety First] rules for vehicles: 1. When entering a main road from a side road, be sure to drive slowly and give way to vehicles on the main road, 2. Do not take the wrong route when turning, 3. Be sure to signal when turning right or left, 4. When turning right, be sure to pay attention to whether there are vehicles overtaking you from behind, 5. When passing pedestrians, horses, bicycles, and other vehicles, give them plenty of space, 6. Give way to faster vehicles, 7. Strictly abide by traffic rules, which can save a lot of trouble, 8.

### Actively Seeking to Suppress; Relevant Authorities Promise to Assist

The price of firewood and charcoal fuel in this city has been soaring recently. Although there are many reasons for this, there is illegal extortion, such as the extraction of a handling fee of 630 yuan per ton for firewood and charcoal transported to Shanghai. With 70-80 boats arriving every day, each carrying 50 tons, this amounts to millions of yuan. Furthermore, a group of unscrupulous people, forming gangs, not only extort along the way, but also demand a "leaky sky" fee of several million yuan when they arrive at the dock. Because of this kind of inside story, the cost increases invisibly, so the price of goods has soared, increasing the burden on citizens. Members of the same industry, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, have repeatedly reported to the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association, requesting that measures be taken to crack down on it. After the association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 13th of this month, the focus of discussion was that the fundamental solution must be to designate appropriate docks, concentrate loading and unloading, and handle it in a coordinated manner. At the same time, regulations must be taken to suppress market prices. After discussion, various measures were decided. Association Chairman Ni Boqi went to Director Xu of the Bureau of Economics, Director Yamaguchi of the Economic Security Office, and relevant authorities to discuss and negotiate repeatedly. The authorities are also very concerned about this matter and promised to provide thorough assistance. According to recent reports in the newspapers, the rise in firewood prices has attracted significant attention from society. If appropriate measures can be taken, it will not be difficult for market prices to stabilize. Enemy Planes Attacked Shanghai Suburbs Yesterday

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Shiitake

(8) The Young Arrival - Translated by Hong Yang -

After the memorial service, it was not until after 3 o'clock that the general public was allowed to perform flower offerings. Longfu's younger sister also squeezed into the crowd to go to the altar. Because there were too many people, it was impossible to worship as desired. The two people were jostled in the crowd and naturally walked to the Hibiya intersection.

Longfu remembered that he had not gone to the Navy Department today, so he looked at Xiang and said:

(I must go to the Navy Department for a while, you swear to go back to the apartment!)

(No, I'm going to the train station now...)

The younger sister replied quietly.

(To the train station?)

Yes.

The train is at 8 o'clock...

(What did you say?)

Longfu suspected that he had misheard and stared at his sister's face. Now he realized that his sister had come to Tokyo not to go to the Western Front School or some women's university.

(Paimo... Paimo, did you sincerely come to participate in the military memorial service?)

Longfu realized his sister's true intention and asked back.

(No, I am...)

The younger sister lowered her head slowly in shame, and after a while, she stared at her brother's face again. Her eyes seemed particularly bright.

(I'm here to pick up the remains and the nails. I know that I'm taking the 8:10 train home tonight...)

Longfu was even more surprised by his sister's words.

(Then isn't it you who is protecting and returning home with our mother and brother Siji?)

(That's their business, I'm here to accompany you according to my own wishes...)

The younger sister smiled slightly coldly. Now there was no more shame and sadness. An iron will and determination were expressed between her eyebrows. This expression was always seen in women in Kagoshima when their husbands died. For example, Zhenren's mother would have been like this when her husband died——

Longfu fully realized his sister's heart——the determination that dominated his sister's life. Hot tears burst out, and this was only for Longfu, while the sister was only going to Tokyo Station.

Naturally, Longfu dismissed his original intention of going to work. At the same time, he didn't want to take his sister to visit the bustling and lively Ginza Avenue. He only followed his sister's will and walked towards Tokyo Station.

When they arrived at the station, there were still more than four hours before departure. After filling their empty stomachs, which had been hungry for a day, in the cafeteria, the two ran to the third-class waiting room to wait for the time to come. The reason why the younger sister waited in the third-class waiting room was that she knew that the martyrs' family members took the second-class train.

At 8 o'clock, the people in the waiting room stood up and went to the door.

(The spirit of a martyr has arrived!)

The crowd of people lowered their heads. People in mourning clothes holding white boxes suddenly appeared. Longfu unconsciously dragged his sister's hand and stood up from his seat. But his hand was stopped by the more powerful hand of his sister.

(Brother! Isn't it the same here?)

The younger sister, standing in a corner of the waiting room, faced the backs of countless people. She put her hands together and bowed. - (End of the book) -

### Red Persimmon Peels Disguised as Crab Roe: Do Not Be Greedy When Purchasing Food

Recently, some salted crab vendors have appeared on the market, waiting for two days on the road to specialize in confusing buyers. Yesterday, when I was returning from evening school, I met a crab seller who shouted loudly and was cheaper than others. Those who buy crabs think that the crabs are full of red roe, and the price is not too expensive, so they are greedy for small purchases. I walked home, and the villagers all bought some to eat. When they were dissected, they were already rotten and inedible. The roe was replaced with red persimmon peels, resembling crab roe. Persimmons and crabs have opposite properties, which is very important for hygiene. Not only is it a waste of money, but it also harms the human body. I hope buyers will be careful. (Fudong)

### Gospel of Lung Disease

○ The 4th Lung Disease Clinic: The Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Association and the Chinese Catholic Doctors Association jointly established the 4th Lung Disease Clinic at 197 Yueyang Road (Old Qiqi Road). Since its opening, the clinic has been very busy. The clinic provides free diagnosis and medication at a great cost. The board of directors of the clinic recently decided to raise funds to purchase a new X-ray machine and medical equipment, and to meet the needs of patients, they have hired additional doctors and nurses. Starting today, outpatient services will be added from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., but free patients will still be limited to the morning. ○ Social Association Lung Clinic: Mr. Ding Mocun, Chairman of the Chinese Social Enterprise Association, recognizing that there are many lung disease patients in our country, specially established a lung disease clinic at 700 Nianhao Road, Yuyuan Road, this spring to help poor patients with lung disease. He hired Dr. Weng Zhefu, a lung disease expert, to preside over the clinic. Diagnosis and medication are free of charge. Now that it is autumn, there are many patients and the price of medicine is very high. The clinic continues to provide completely free diagnosis and treatment every day from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and can provide some medication. I am honored to receive 50 free consultation vouchers, which will be distributed to the poor and sick.

### News from the Yixin Charity Association

The Yixin Charity Association in Shunyu Lane, Zhajiang Road, Hongkou, was founded by Director Zhao Zhikang. Mr. Wen Chantin was invited to be the honorary director. It has been established for more than two years since it was registered with the Social Welfare Bureau. It provides free diagnosis and medication, and has an obligation school that enrolls more than 100 elementary school students free of charge each semester. The expenses are borne by the directors. Due to the increasing cost of medicine and other expenses, and the planned winter porridge distribution, funds are needed. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance to benefit the poor.

### Postscript on the Zheng Ma Art Exhibition

### Zheng Shiqiao and Wife's Art Exhibition - Evening Lament

Mr. Zheng Shiqiao, a landscape calligrapher from Wulin, has been working hard on his art for thirty years in addition to his political career. Since the Incident, he has been delayed at sea, and has worked harder on calligraphy, so his art has greatly improved. His landscapes are between the styles of Zhong Kui and Lu Tai. His brushstrokes are bold and majestic, which is very different from those who win with delicate flattery. This time, Mr. Zheng and his wife, Ms. Hong Xuxiu, held an art exhibition in Jing'an Temple, with many excellent works. As a result, those who came to visit and order works were crowded.

Mr. Zheng's recent works, such as (Deep and Beautiful Streams and Mountains), are clear, moist, and tranquil. (Misty Water and Geese), elegant and lofty. (Rain Scattered Smoke), the green is clear and bright. (Autumn Mountain), divine and outstanding. (Roaring Canglong), concise to the extreme, using a small amount to surpass many. (Water Embracing Lonely Village), the ink is sparse, but the artistic conception is distant. (Temple Gate Cool Moon Shines, Yun Yun Night Hoof Monk), skillfully uses dry brush rubbing, showing majesty.

His wife, Ms. Hong Renqiu, is extremely strict in landscape painting, following the methods of Lu Tai, peeking into its secrets. Her brushstrokes are condensed and lack feminine weakness. Her ink landscapes, such as (Where to Rewind the Silk) and (Fangwu Autumn Wind), have clear brushstrokes and clean ink. (Spring Sound Choking Dangerous Stone), Xiu Run has no vulgar reading. (Willow Shaded Fishing) (Creek Bridge Cane) and other screens are all neat and objective. (Planting Bamboo Qianyu), the brushstrokes are round and lively, and the distant mountains are smeared, showing great skill. Their sons, Penglu and Honglu's calligraphy, which were attached to the exhibition, are only nine and ten years old, and they already feel extraordinary. The family is elegant, which is truly enviable!

### Ma Shouhua Art Exhibition

— Contributed

Those who discuss national calligraphy all say that having a scholarly atmosphere without falling into sweetness is the best, but this is only possible for those who are well-educated and of good character. It is said that those with high character also have high calligraphy, and I believe this even more after the Guan Ma exhibition. Mr. Ma, whose style name is Muxuan, lived in the judiciary for decades and never published his paintings, so many people know him as a lawyer, but few know him as an artist. He is known as a virtuous gentleman in the legal world and has a very high character. The paintings are elegant, beautiful, and moist, without any trace of sweetness. Works such as (New Year's Day Spring Picture), (Luxuriant Forest and Tall Bamboo Picture), and imitating various landscape painters such as Fangshan Shuming Xuanzai, and each family's ink bamboo in Huzhou Songxue Ding, all show his skill and depth of attainments, and can be called masterpieces. It is even more commendable that his finger painting is clear, moist, and beautiful.

### Shanghai Nursing Home Welcomes Visitors from All Walks of Life

The Shanghai Nursing Home is located at No. 39, Jichang Street, Nanshi (near the South Railway Station). The buildings are spacious, and there are fields and gardens, flowers and trees, and green moss. Elderly people who live here, although they do not have the joy of serving their parents, can still enjoy themselves.

The rooms in the nursing home are well-arranged, and donations from all walks of life are received. Not even a grain of rice is easily discarded. During this fundraising period, it is open all day to welcome visitors from all walks of life. Anyone who returns from the nursing home will sigh in amazement and marvel at the miracle.
