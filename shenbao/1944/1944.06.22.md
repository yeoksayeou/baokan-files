### Editorial: Organizing a People's Livelihood Investigation Group

When the government decides on its policies, it must take into account the demands of the people. Only then will the implementation of policies be smooth and the people will benefit. A policy based on the demands of the people is benevolent governance. Mencius said, "Practicing benevolent governance gladdens the people as if they were being rescued from hanging upside down." This shows the importance of the relationship between benevolent governance and the people. This is a general principle of administration and needs no further explanation. However, if policy decisions are made by a small number of officials behind closed doors, or based on subjective experience, without aligning with the people's demands, then it becomes a problem.

Admittedly, the so-called "demands of the people" seem to be broad in scope, and it is difficult to have a clear and concrete standard. How can we take them into account? How can we be considered to have taken them into account? It is impossible to determine clearly. However, we believe that taking the people's demands into account means that, before deciding on policies, we should not only rely on the subjective experience of a few people, but also objectively gather public opinion from all sides and investigate the needs and circumstances of the people in the field. Then, we should consider subjective administrative experience. A policy based on such objective investigation and subjective experience is a policy that takes the people's demands into account, and is "benevolent governance."

The easiest way to gather public opinion from all sides is to establish a representative body, because a representative body can convey the people's sentiments and facilitate communication between officials and the people. The easiest way to investigate the needs and circumstances of the people in the field is to select impartial high-ranking officials to go deep into the grassroots. Because impartial high-ranking officials can understand the people's suffering and environment, and understand their concerns and feelings. Therefore, we advocate establishing a representative body to facilitate communication, and at the same time, we advocate selecting impartial high-ranking officials to go deep into the grassroots to investigate the people's concerns, as a basis for deciding on policies.

Before the war, the National Government had supervisory commissioners in addition to the Control Yuan, but their main task was to exercise the power of impeachment, which was only a passive way to report corruption in personnel matters. Currently, the National Government has not even established these supervisory commissioners. At a time when the central political power is striving for reform, and at a time when the people's livelihood is seriously suffering, we believe that it is necessary to investigate the people's livelihood in the field and then decide on a reform plan. Here, we offer our humble opinions as follows:

The central authorities should select impartial high-ranking officials to organize a people's livelihood investigation group to go to various places and deep into the grassroots.

In addition to current officials, the members of the investigation group may invite impartial people from the private sector who are respected by the people to participate.

The investigation group should travel lightly and simply, and maintain a detached position in each place they visit, refusing official entertainment and interacting more with the people. The members should be divided into groups to conduct investigations and record the people's concerns and feelings in detail. If necessary, they should consult with local officials for reference.

The investigation should focus on the people's livelihood, and also cover production, security, education, and Sino-Japanese relations.

The Allied government of Japan has dispatched ministers and cabinet councilors to serve as inspectors to investigate the details of the current food, labor, and radio wave weapons administrations. Based on the inspection results, they have decided to transform the existing temporary measures into fundamental countermeasures, which is worthy of our emulation. Many of the central leaders are Kuomintang comrades from the grassroots and should have more sympathy for the people's suffering. We hope that they will promptly promote this initiative to improve the people's livelihood and reform politics, which will be truly beneficial.

Therefore, the war in Hunan has now entered the second stage. When Xue Yue defended Changsha, he dispatched the best-equipped Fourth Army (Commander Wang Deneng) and four divisions to the defense positions around Changsha, to put up a desperate resistance. However, due to the Japanese army's use of a double encirclement tactic to launch a fierce attack, the Chongqing army completely lost its will to fight. After only two days and nights of resistance, they used their forces to sweep away the defeated Chongqing troops around Changsha, and the sweeping battle is almost complete.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Declaration issued last autumn already stipulated Japan's post-war policies and various issues concerning Greater East Asia and the world.

### U.S. Air Force Base Threatened

A certain Japanese base, 21st (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, the U.S. Air Force bases in Weiyang, Lingling, Baoqing, and Luxiang in Hunan Province were under serious threat. In order to eliminate this threat, the U.S. Air Force is actively dispatching planes, and its activity is unprecedented. In order to cope with this situation, the Japanese air squadrons are currently searching for enemy traces everywhere and intercepting them at any time, inflicting heavy damage on them.

Hunan Front, 21st (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, sent four B25-type aircraft and five P40-type aircraft to attack the Hunan front. When they arrived at Liuyang City, which was guarded by the Chongqing army, they seemed to mistakenly believe that the city had fallen, and suddenly launched a fierce bombing. At that time, the Chongqing army in the city was panic-stricken and thought that Japanese planes were attacking, so they fired fiercely with anti-aircraft guns. As a result, both sides suffered significant damage, and the chaotic situation of the so-called "integrated air and land cooperation" between the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army can be seen here.

### County Administrative Reform Plan; May Be Promulgated and Implemented Soon; Elevating the Status of County Magistrates and Unifying

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen local administration, the central authorities reformed the provincial administrative structure and abolished unnecessary bureaus and departments, so the provincial administration is carried out much more smoothly. The county administrative reform plan has also been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and has been submitted to the Central Political Committee for review. It may be promulgated and implemented soon. It is reported that the five key points of this county administrative reform are: the unification and strengthening of county administration (such as concentrating power in the county magistrate, except for the provincial government or the administrative inspector's office, other agencies cannot issue orders to the county government. Enhancing the county magistrate's command and supervision power over various bureaus and sections, increasing the number of county government field personnel, etc.); elevating the status and treatment of county magistrates and county administrators (such as county magistrates should be senior or delegated, county magistrates should be registered and distributed by the central war examination, and should not be recommended and dispatched at will. Improving the treatment as much as possible, county magistrates should have sufficient special expenses, etc.); the unification and enrichment of county finances (such as making county finances independent, the provincial government should not withdraw suspense funds. County government political expenses should be paid by the provincial treasury, etc.); strengthening the institutions of townships and villages (such as setting up township and village cadres, etc.); unifying the organization of the Baojia system. All aspects have detailed regulations. After the implementation of this plan, the status and authority of the county magistrate can be raised and concentrated, and the administration, finance, and Baojia of each county can be completely unified, and the efficiency of local governance will be as expected. At the same time, if the central administrative structure is strengthened, the connection between the central and local governments will be closer, and the advancement of the entire national politics will be able to be accelerated and achieve greater results.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Houtong News Agency’s chief military correspondent, Sertorius, reports: The operational strategy and actions of the German defense zone along the Normandy coast are aimed at steady anticipation, minimizing the use of our own forces while inflicting maximum damage on the enemy. The American military operations on the Cotentin Peninsula are clearly focused on expanding their corridor, running north and south through the center of the peninsula. Currently, their main force seems to be advancing north towards Bricquebse in order to reach the Valognes area. The intention of the American commander, Bradley, appears to be to first penetrate the Cherbourg defense zone, then proceed with a planned siege. To gain freedom of movement, the American forces must expand their supply lines, but German resistance is extremely strong. In the area north and northeast of Carentan, only localized battles are occurring. The American forces are seemingly probing the German positions at La Saye, Carentan, Vierville, and Floying, as well as Sainte-Mère-Église. To the east, the British Second Army's advance towards Caumont has been pushed back by German counterattacks. On the 19th, the British retreated from Livry.

East of the Orne River, the German forces are pressing the American bridgehead, proceeding according to their predetermined plan. Large forces are concentrating in the rear of the British Second Army, and a large-scale offensive will be launched soon.

The aircraft number is fully coated with ordinary camouflage, the upper part is dark gray, and the bottom is light blue. Control is not by radio, but by an automatic control device installed in front of the launcher.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: At around 8:00 AM on the 20th, American bombers advanced towards the Gulf of Kiel in three waves. The southern wing of the enemy bomber formation was protected by a strong fighter squadron. German fighters intercepted the enemy aircraft over the Baltic Sea coast and engaged the enemy in several air battles over central Germany. The air battles over Rügen Island were particularly fierce. German aircraft dispersed several enemy aircraft formations, damaging and shooting down several four-engine enemy aircraft. Most of these damaged enemy aircraft fled north, and a small number of bombers crashed into the Baltic Sea several miles off the German coast. A large number of American aircraft are feared to have been lost on their return journey or while flying into Swedish territory. Air battles between German and enemy fighters were also very intense over central France. Aircraft from both sides were targeting individual objectives, demonstrating the excellent effectiveness of the German Air Force.

### Soviet Union Asks Egypt to Extradite White Russians

Ankara, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Houtong News Agency, Cairo dispatch: Soviet Ambassador to Egypt Novikov presented a note to the Egyptian government yesterday, requesting the extradition to the Soviet Union of a portion of the White Russians who have resided in Egypt since 1920. These White Russians are not Soviet citizens, but it is expected that the Egyptian government will accept this request. The number of people to be extradited is still unknown.

### Two Kinds of Deviation

When I left Shanghai, I felt that there were two kinds of worrying deviations besides the correct direction. This is caused by a lack of understanding of the significance of the period when the new harvest has not yet come in. Correcting this ignorance is not only my personal hope, but also a common requirement in the interior. So, what are these two kinds of deviations?

First, forgetting the countermeasures for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in. For example, abstract arguments for personnel changes in the Rice Control Association as the top priority, proposals for the Shanghai Rice Grain Public Warehouse Company under the system of government supervision and private management, and arguments for establishing a joint office to promote the purchase of rice from the suburbs, all ignore the urgency of time. If waves of the stormy sea could be overcome just by adjusting the rudder, then it would be enough to change the chairman, secretary-general, or other responsible person of the Rice Control Association every day. However, in this critical period, the refreshing of the organization and the adjustment of the organization should be strictly distinguished. It is definitely not just an adjustment of the organization's circumstances or personnel. The argument for establishing a public warehouse company is also the same. Building a large warehouse capable of holding ten million shi of rice and mobilizing billions of national capital is naturally a good thing. But what is needed during the period when the new harvest has not yet come in is not an empty warehouse and a list of shareholders, but piles of rice sacks. How to buy those rice and how to move it in should be the first thing to consider. If this kind of concrete countermeasure is not given top priority, then even if a large warehouse company is established, it will not start operating. The argument for setting up a joint office for rice countermeasures is also the same. Just setting up a joint office on top of the already huge Rice Control Association and other organizations, and deciding on the personnel below the director, completely forgets the urgency of the situation.

The above proposals were made by various organizations before I left Shanghai, but after traveling to various places and seeing the real situation, I feel strongly that it is not possible to proceed so leisurely.

Another tendency is to focus only on preparing the points of entry around Shanghai, while forgetting to quickly reorganize the purchase system in the interior. The price of rice and the rice problem in Shanghai are sufficient to influence the interior, which is true on the one hand, but on the other hand, the rice problem and the price of rice in the interior are also sufficient to influence Shanghai. The rice problem exists not only in Shanghai, which is surrounded by a 60-kilometer control line, but also deeply exists in the main points, lines, and areas of the entire Central China. In terms of region, the policy should focus on the lines rather than the points, and on the areas rather than the lines. In terms of time, it should not only be a countermeasure for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in, but should also quickly establish the entire policy for this rice year. Forgetting these two points and only emphasizing the temporary nature of the countermeasures for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in is, without saying, a very serious mistake. The real situation of the rice problem in the interior requires Nanjing and Shanghai to clarify their insufficient understanding of the period when the new harvest has not yet come in.

### Reasons for Purchase Difficulties

In Kunshan and Songjiang, I asked the cadres of the Rice Control Association's offices how they would overcome the difficulties in purchasing rice in the future. The answers I received were as follows:

### Kunshan

1. Increase the purchase price. 2. Severely punish smuggling and hoarding. 3. Provide farmers with fertilizer. 4. Extend loans to purchasing merchants. 5. The Rice Control Association should start purchasing work as soon as possible. 6. The Rice Control Association should organize an armed inspection team.

### Songshan

1. Increase the purchase price. 2. Inspect for smuggling and hoarding. 3. Implement barter trade. 4. Supply rice beyond the amount needed for civilian consumption according to the Baojia system. 5. Guarantee local security. 6. Facilitate transportation. 7. Prohibit excessive taxes and levies along the way. These answers are all very principled, formulaic, and only a request for correcting the environment that has already become common knowledge. What I wanted to hear from the Rice Control Association's offices was how the Rice Control Association and its various offices should reflect on their own powerlessness in correcting the environment. This issue was not even raised in the proposals of the joint meeting of various offices held last time, and I cannot help but feel deeply regretful. Everyone knows that before hearing the Rice Control Association's self-reflection, a portion of the outspoken press was severely criticizing the Rice Control Association. That is the argument for making personnel changes the top priority. The general public also has high expectations for the Rice Control Association, so they are disappointed and consider it natural to make personnel changes. But is making personnel changes really the main way to solve the problem? One of my purposes is to examine what the real causes of the difficulties in purchasing rice are in the interior. On this point, I cannot reach a clear conclusion. In Shanghai, no one is conducting a subjective examination of the most likely causes of the difficulties in purchasing rice, but is only listing the various causes in a flat manner and advocating for flat countermeasures. But in the interior, the people engaged in purchasing work and those responsible for guiding purchasing work unanimously say that the biggest reason for the difficulties in purchasing rice since the establishment of the Rice Control Association is the delay in starting purchasing work. In other words, the main reason is not the unsoundness of the personnel or the lack of smooth operation after the establishment of the Rice Control Association, but the delay in deciding on policies and the stagnation in establishing new institutions before the establishment of the Rice Control Association. Therefore, the argument that blames the difficulties in purchasing rice on the Rice Control Association and does not demand reflection on the ideas and methods at the time of the Rice Control Association's birth is a political argument against the Rice Control Association, which is of course severely criticized in the interior.

### Executive Yuan Orders Provincial and County Governments to Facilitate Rice Transport to Shanghai; City Government Designates Four Rice Storage Warehouses

It has been widely rumored recently that wealthy bureaus in various places seem to be restricting the export of rice. The Rice Grain Control Committee quickly reported the situation to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces be instructed to facilitate rice merchants holding the committee's passports so that the Shanghai citizens' food supply could be smoothly managed. The Executive Yuan has now circulated an order to the provincial and county governments to handle this matter, so transportation is becoming more convenient every day. The first batch of rice purchased by rice merchants in Qingpu and other places arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A large number of rice transported by waterway from Wuhu has also arrived. Moreover, citizens are enthusiastically applying for temporary passports for rice shipments of more than five dou and less than ten shi, with thousands of people coming every day. Therefore, the daily arrival volume is strong, and prices are trending downward.

In order to ensure ample rice storage in the city and regulate the food supply for the citizens, the Shanghai Special Municipality issued a public notice yesterday (the 21st), designating the following warehouses as rice storage warehouses for the city, in accordance with Article 5 of the Shanghai Citizen Food Rice Management Temporary Regulations: Zhejiang Industrial Bank Warehouse at 970 North Suzhou Road, Bank of China Warehouse at 1040 North Suzhou Road, China Industrial Bank Warehouse at 1016 North Suzhou Road, and Maotai Warehouse at 369 Fengyang Road. The original text of the public notice is as follows: To inform the public, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Shanghai Citizen Food Rice Management Temporary Regulations, the following warehouses are designated by the government as rice storage warehouses for the city: Zhejiang Industrial Bank Warehouse, 970 North Suzhou Road; Bank of China Warehouse, 1040 North Suzhou Road; China Industrial Bank Warehouse, 1016 North Suzhou Road; Maotai Warehouse, 369 Fengyang Road. In addition to separate orders, this notice is hereby issued for the public to be aware of.

### City Government-Managed Houses Can Be Applied for Return

Owners of houses in the northern part of Shanghai were mostly affected by the war and moved to other places, so all their properties were taken care of by the Allied Navy Rehabilitation Department and the Allied Residents Group, and the rent was collected on their behalf. Now, the Allied authorities have transferred 400 and 414 buildings respectively on June 16 of the 31st year and December 22 of the 32nd year, along with the rent collected over the years, to the city government for management. It is learned that the authorities, in order to sympathize with merchants and civilians, can carry their original property certificates and three copies of photos to register with the Shanghai North Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee at 27 Luofu Road (formerly Fuxing Road) at the end of Wujin Road (formerly Laobazi Road) on the fourth floor (next to the Japanese Residents Group), if the owners return to Shanghai or are in Shanghai. The office will immediately apply for the return on their behalf according to the legal procedures for return.

### Joint Management Office Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Cotton Cloth Rationing Stores

Yesterday, the person in charge of the Joint Management Office of Cloth Store Industry Wholesalers stated that the temporary cotton cloth rationing has already begun. However, since the matter is a new initiative and there are more than a hundred participating stores, it is feared that the procedures for rationing in various stores may not be thorough, or that the variety of patterns may be uneven, making it difficult to take care of everyone's wishes. Not only is it easy to create misunderstandings among the citizens and affect the rationing policy, but it also harms the reputation of the entire industry. Therefore, the committee of the office has decided to secretly dispatch senior staff members to the various participating stores every day to conduct investigations. If any errors are discovered, they will be corrected or warned according to their severity. However, since the office has limited personnel, the investigation may not be thorough. If there are any procedural errors or opportunistic acts by the various participating stores, we hope that the citizens will report them, or report directly to the office to correct them.

### Wharf Service Guidance Office Handles Registration

In order to thoroughly rectify wharf order and improve the safety of travelers and merchants, the Ministry of Social Welfare has promulgated the Management Regulations for Travel Service Agencies and Wharf Service Agencies, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record, and has set up a Travel and Wharf Service Guidance Office in Shanghai, specifically responsible for management and guidance matters. It is learned that in order to implement management and guidance, the office is now preparing the Registration and Licensing Measures for Travel Service Agencies and Wharf Service Agencies, and has begun handling registration procedures in conjunction with the Social Welfare Bureau. The office is now handling the registration of travel agencies, barging agencies, and other similar societies in Shanghai from today onwards in order to promote management work. In the future, anyone operating this type of business in the city must go through registration and licensing procedures, otherwise they will be banned.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Society to Begin Rationing Soon; Actively Procuring Various Supplies

In order to increase police efficiency and improve the treatment of police officers, Deputy Commissioner Su of the Shanghai Special Municipality First Police Bureau suggested organizing a police consumer cooperative society, which was adopted by Commissioner Chen and ordered to organize, and with the support of various sectors and the advance of funds, most of it has been completed. Procurement of materials has also begun. The progress of the affairs has attracted great attention from all sectors of society. When I visited Deputy Commissioner Su to inquire yesterday, he gave a detailed answer, saying: "Since the beginning of the establishment of the society, we have received enthusiastic support from all sectors for fundraising, reaching more than 30 million yuan. The Central Reserve Bank and others have also agreed to provide timely loans, and we are very grateful for the enthusiasm of all sectors. The matter of material procurement has also begun, and most of the main materials have been procured, including more than 4,500 dan of rice, more than 200 dan of salt, more than 4,000 jin of cooking oil, more than 40,000 boxes of matches, more than 1,000 boxes of soap, as well as coal, soy sauce, tea, etc. Among them, except for rice, which is still applying for a permit to transport it back to Shanghai, all other goods have arrived at the society and are being prepared for rationing. The rationing method is based on the number of police officers and their family members, and the price will be much lower than the retail black market price. There are also cotton cloth, wool, shirts, woolen goods, etc., which are being discussed with the relevant authorities. In short, if various goods can be procured smoothly, the lives of police officers can be improved day by day in the future, and the efficiency of police administration will also increase."

### Items Confiscated by Road Police to Be Sold at Public Auction

Items confiscated by the Road Police of the Ministry of Construction have been piled up for a long time, and there is a fear that they will be damaged. The Ministry has previously requested that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit send personnel to jointly sell them at public auction, and the application has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It has also formulated measures for handling confiscated items accumulated by the Road Police in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit, and has sent letters to the chambers of commerce of both Beijing and Shanghai to appoint two or three local impartial merchants to handle the matter together. Except for contraband and drugs, which will be transferred to the Ministry of Interior for handling, other confiscated items with fixed prices will be sold to the control or rationing agencies of the respective items at the price, regardless of the quantity. Those without fixed prices will have a floor price determined by the local chamber of commerce, reviewed jointly by the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Audit, and sold at public auction after being advertised in the newspaper. It is heard that the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce has selected Ding Fangyuan, Xu Wenzhao, and Zhang Dalian to be appointed by the Ministry to assist in handling the matter.

### Reader's Educational Assistance News: New and Returning Students Apply in the Same Way

The educational assistance office is issuing application forms, counting both new and returning students. In addition to the prescribed 5% ratio, schools with a large number of sixth-term assisted students will receive a corresponding increase in forms to ensure that each school has at least enough forms to distribute to returning students (the total number should not exceed 20%). Deserving students should be given the opportunity to apply first. However, returning students whose family circumstances are acceptable, who do not need assistance, or whose academic performance is too poor to be improved should be restricted. Schools should consider these two aspects when distributing applications. Therefore, whether new or returning, students who have been refused an application form by the school should not directly request additional forms from the office.

Illegally Obtained Application Forms Are Useless: According to the office's records, some schools have already received their full allocation of application forms, but the schools insist that they have not. This suggests that someone has obtained them illegally. The office keeps records of all distributed application forms. Any application form that is not obtained through legal channels will not be accepted. Therefore, it is useless to obtain application forms illegally.

We Hope School Authorities Pay Attention: The office staff held a full meeting yesterday to review general issues regarding this term's educational assistance work and passed several resolutions. Two points are mentioned below for the information of school authorities. Please encourage schools to establish more free and half-price scholarships to help poor and outstanding students. Although Shen Bao and Xin Bao have scholarship funds, they are limited and cannot meet the demand, leading to regretful omissions. If schools can establish more free or half-price scholarships, it will be easier to raise funds and achieve broader benefits. We believe that school principals, being enthusiastic about education, will agree with this suggestion. In recent days, students have been coming to the office to complain, saying that principals are forcing impoverished students to pay tuition fees, otherwise they will not be issued, or that they are not acting fairly according to the office's regulations, giving importance to personal connections, resulting in qualified students not being able to obtain application forms. No wonder students are coming to the office to complain. It has been decided that: firstly, we hope that school principals will conduct fair reviews, without favoritism or difficulty. Education is a matter of conscience, different from general commercial situations; secondly, we hope that students will truthfully report any unreasonable or unfair situations that occur. This newspaper will investigate and take appropriate action.

### Notice from the Economic Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality

— Jing Zi No. 16

It has come to our attention that this Bureau previously issued orders to assist the National Commercial Federation in handling the temporary distribution of cotton cloth. All procedures are determined by the Commercial Control Council, and this Bureau only distributes purchase certificates to the citizens of this city. All residents of this city, except for newborns, are able to receive one purchase certificate to buy 1.5 zhang of cotton cloth from designated retailers. However, recently, citizens have reported that the retailers display a limited selection of patterns and insufficient lengths. Furthermore, if one asks to exchange or select, they often make excuses that there is no stock, and even use harsh words. Such a situation is truly abhorrent. In addition to sending a letter to the Commercial Control Council to strictly order all retailers to display samples as publicly as possible and allow people to choose and purchase, and to promptly correct the poor attitude of the clerks, if the people of this city find that the cotton cloth purchased is of insufficient length or damaged, they should report it immediately to this Bureau or the Economic Security Section of the First Police Station or the Second Police Station, or the National Commercial Control Council. Once verified, they will be punished according to law without leniency. This notice is hereby issued.

June 21, 1944, Director Xu Tianshen

### National Discussion: The Plight of Retail Cloth Shops

— Chen Chuben

The term "retail cloth shop" implies that it is the smallest and least capitalized type of cloth business. These shops are typically located in the Nanyang Bridge area and along Connaught Road in western Shanghai. In the past, their business involved collecting leftover and defective cloth from various cloth factories and selling it to customers in rural areas. Their operations were essentially a low-profit venture serving the impoverished. Last year, when the National Government purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth, including remnants, in support of national policy, these shops had to apply to the Commercial Control Council to release all their goods. Since then, they have been passively depleting their resources and are now facing a dead end. Larger cloth businesses with more capital have already switched to other businesses. Retail cloth shops, with their small capital, have no funds to change businesses and can only wait for their demise.

This temporary allocation of cotton cloth is handled by the Cloth Shops Joint Operations Office. The total number of cloth purchase certificates is over 300,000. The quantity of cloth distributed to retailers is not specified. Retail cloth shops, with their small scale, limited capital, and insignificant influence, are nominally listed as retailers, but in reality, they only receive several hundred to over a thousand certificates. The goods allocated to them are based entirely on their retained goods and existing inventory, with no new cloth supplied from outside. The goods stocked by retail cloth shops are originally affordable and durable goods for the common people. In addition, the retained goods are remnants, which are remnants accumulated over the years, with varying lengths and colors that may be out of fashion. Therefore, this allocation is bound to be difficult, causing dissatisfaction and unjustly blaming retail cloth shops. In reality, retail cloth shops have inherent deficiencies and have no goods to exchange, nor do they acquire inferior goods.

The distribution area for this cloth purchase certificate also seems inappropriate. The goods stocked by retail cloth shops are mostly economical and durable types, such as Yuanjiu patterns, Yuanxi cloth, etc., which are very suitable for villagers. It would be most appropriate to allocate them to villagers in Pudong. The issuing authorities, unaware of the situation, distributed them to fashionable women in this city, who found them unsuitable, so the sin of blame is added to the retail cloth shop. Retail cloth shops receive their unjust anger every day. It cannot be blamed on the issuing authorities. The joint operating office did not inform the authorities of the industry's status.

This temporary allocation of cloth purchase certificates is valid for six months. The number of cloth allocated to retail shops is only several hundred to over a thousand certificates. If each certificate is worth 200 yuan, the total value is only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Based on the current price of rice at 10,000 yuan per dan, the minimum monthly expenditure is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the six-month expenditure is 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the day the cotton cloth is sold out is the day the capital is exhausted. At that time, all retail cloth shops will be unemployed, which is probably not a blessing for society. I hope that the wise authorities will pay attention to this.

I am one of the retail cloth shop owners in the cotton cloth business. I am unwilling to sit and wait for death, unwilling to endure the unwarranted anger of the landlord, and even more unwilling to be unjustly blamed by society. I am willing to give up this allocation and transfer the goods to be sold by large department stores. In this way, buyers from all walks of life, from farmers to scholars, will stand on the road and enjoy the distribution of high-quality cotton cloth. Retail cloth shops can also close down early, and the partners can disband and rejoice.

### Fuyou Orphanage Appeals for Assistance: We Can Also Collect on Their Behalf

The Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage is the only institution in Nanshi that provides education and care for orphaned and destitute children. Although it was established only two years ago, it has achieved remarkable results, having taken in hundreds of beggar children and orphans. After education and care, over two hundred people have been introduced to various factories, stores, workshops, and hospitals inside and outside this city to learn skills and work. There are currently more than two hundred children still in the orphanage. However, the orphanage has no fixed funding and relies on donations from the outside world. Recently, funds have been exhausted, and supplies are difficult to obtain. If assistance is not received in a timely manner, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. We dare to appeal on their behalf, hoping that kind-hearted people will generously donate during the orphanage's fundraising period (from May 11th to June 30th, with a goal of one million yuan) so that the orphanage's education and care work will not be interrupted. If you wish to donate, we can also collect and transfer it on their behalf.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Naval Painter (4)

"That's not necessarily the case! It's just that the painting methods cannot be the same. For example, there are also surrealist works that depict warships. Those kinds of warships are commendable, but Mr. Iwata's painting method is a bit different."

Duhara then said something harsh.

"It's okay, please don't hesitate to criticize!"

Ichikawa urged quickly.

"If I may be frank, I think it's closer to an advertising painting than a work of art."

"Haha, that's a bit of an over-the-top criticism! Then wouldn't my paintings also become high-priced advertising paintings?"

Ichikawa readily defended Takao and said with a laugh.

Takao listened patiently to this criticism. There were many things he wanted to say, but he endured it for the time being. After a moment, Takao asked in a trembling voice:

"Sir, the movers from the moving company have been waiting for too long. Can I have them send it back to me?"

"Oh, wait a moment, can't I keep this painting here for a few days?"

Ichikawa seemed to have thought of something and said this.

### (5)

After Takao left Ichikawa's house, he felt uneasy, muddled, and dragging his wooden clogs, he ran all the way to the Ashigaru Station.

"One ticket to Shinbashi!"

He said angrily at the ticket office.

He didn't want to go straight back to the apartment. He ran to Ginza Street, dragged his former Parisian party colleagues, and thought of going to a tavern to drink beer.

(Advertising painting, what exactly is that?)

Sitting in the tram starting forward, he shouted this in his heart.

(Painting an apple is a work of art, painting a warship is an advertising painting? Don't arbitrarily judge people!)

His anger did not dissipate even after he changed trains at Gotanda. (I have liked the navy since I was a child, so I paint warships. I know the shortcomings of my painting, but the warships are very childish and very popular. What exactly is the reason for this?)

Even when he got off at Shinbashi Station, Takao was still angry.

(To hell with it. Let the advertising painting be an advertising painting! Even if apple painters object, I will create an advertising painting with great advertising power. If it has advertising power, then it is good art. That is a good painting. I don't care what anyone says!)

Thus he became the uninhibited Takao. He developed a great aversion to Tsuruhara Keiichi, and even eating him alive would not be enough to vent his hatred.

As he passed Shinbashi, he suddenly saw a sky densely covered with ink clouds. A cold wind blew from the Kyobashi direction, like a gloomy winter scene with the sun setting. However, Ginza Street at 5 p.m. was still very lively.

(Not a single good facial expression.)

Takao, whose anger had not yet subsided, did not have a good impression of the men and women walking on Ginza Street. He felt that all the people dressed in beautiful clothes and strutting around were like Tsuruhara Keiichi.

He shrugged his shoulders and walked forward through the crowd. This image of Takao was like a madman, with disheveled hair and eyes behind his glasses as if carrying blood beads, so the refined passersby on Ginza Street gave way to him.

Before long, he was about to turn towards the Parisian office. In the seams of the crowd on Ginza Street, he saw a man wearing a bronze suit and a gray hat, peeking at him, and suddenly rushed at Takao.

"Damn it, can't you see people?"

"Oh, I'm sorry!"

The man apologized straightforwardly, but when Takao looked at the man's face, his legs went weak and his mouth lost its agility. (104)
