### Commentary: Impressions of the Sixth Consultative Meeting

— Chen Binhe

——The Issue of Establishing Model Districts in the Seven Counties of Shanghai Municipality——

The Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee held its sixth meeting the other day. I participated in it and had the opportunity to hear the discussions and reports from the heads of various municipal departments, as well as the opinions of my colleagues on various aspects of municipal administration. I have benefited greatly. Now, I will express my impressions as follows:

Among the proposals discussed at this meeting, the most important was the suggestion from the Consultative Committee regarding the establishment of model districts in the seven counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. The content of the proposal largely coincided with the suggestions provided in our newspaper's editorial on July 28. However, to further explain, the Ministry of Interior recently designated Nanhui County as an experimental model county, while the Consultative Committee proposed that all seven counties of Shanghai Municipality should become model counties. Because the seven counties are the outer ring of Shanghai, it is actually impossible for only one of them to become a model county. Even if one county became a model county, it would not have the overall effect on the periphery and would not greatly benefit the entire Shanghai municipal administration. Moreover, the current so-called model county is merely the reform of county administration, restoring the county administration to its proper functions, and making it operate normally. It is still far from being a "model".

Our newspaper's editorial stated that the establishment of a model county must involve four points: First, establishing the administrative system of each county district. Second, improving the administrative personnel of each county district. Third, reorganizing the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintaining the public security of each county district. Among these, the selection of county magistrates is the most important. Without outstanding talent to serve as county magistrates, all perfect systems and reorganization proposals will become mere formalities, without any practical effect. Currently, most counties in the occupied areas have special circumstances and harsh environments. To be honest, outstanding talents who take office as county magistrates cannot settle in their positions and must overcome special forces to gain a foothold. Furthermore, a few local scoundrels or those fluent in Japanese, those who are clever or obscured by the Japanese authorities, are extremely pushy and surprising. Once they take office, they act recklessly and without shame. These kinds of people, as Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida analyzed, are the second type of pro-Japanese, who have no concept of nation or people, and are neither for China nor for Japan, but only for their own personal gain. To expect such people to promote county administration and improve the lives of the people is naturally to go in the opposite direction. Therefore, we do not advocate model counties unless we are cautious in selecting county magistrates. The seven counties of Shanghai have a crucial relationship with the entire Shanghai. If we want Shanghai to become a national model area for governance, we must first make the seven counties model districts and start by being cautious in selecting the magistrates of the seven counties. We must absolutely adopt meritocracy, without being constrained or interfered with by any party. Furthermore, we hope that the authorities in various Allied countries will assist in selecting good people to appoint as county magistrates. The mayor immediately accepted this suggestion from the Consultative Committee. We believe it is advisable to implement the plan as soon as possible, organize a committee to discuss the implementation steps and various countermeasures, in order to realize it as soon as possible.

Secondly, Mayor Chen, in his opening remarks at the meeting, fervently expounded on the importance of personnel. The saying "everyone has nothing to do, and nothing gets done" can be said to hit the nail on the head when it comes to the chronic problem of Chinese civil servants. Mayor Chen also pointed out that in general, responsible personnel like to appoint fellow villagers and relatives in their personnel policies. Fellow villagers and relatives are not absolutely unusable, but their talents must be considered. If there is favoritism, thinking that all fellow villagers and relatives are usable, the result will naturally be "everyone has nothing to do, and nothing gets done." He specifically instructed all responsible authorities to pay attention to this. He also indicated that the renewal of the civil service system will begin in Shanghai.

In summary, the issue of personnel has held a dominant position in Chinese political history. Sound personnel leads to prosperous politics, while unsound personnel leads to declining politics. Currently, after the turmoil, local politics is abnormal. Without the most sound personnel to handle administration, there is no basis for discussing innovation and progress.

### Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's Broadcast: Grasp Victory with Total Effort, Establish Human Morality, and Resolutely Defeat the Enemy

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The gist of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast is as follows: The world war situation has now entered an unprecedented great war, and it is also a time when Japan is facing unprecedented difficulties. At this juncture, I am cooperating with Admiral Yonai of the Navy to form a cabinet, and we will sincerely work with the people to overcome national difficulties. I am filled with fear. Shortly after taking office, on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would like to express my thoughts in response to the sacred pronouncements. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been two years and nine months. Due to deep suffering and pressure from internal and external situations, the enemy intends to determine victory or defeat in a short period of time and has invaded the Mariana Islands, with the momentum to break into our homeland in one fell swoop. At the same time, they are also slowly advancing in New Guinea, attempting to sever our homeland's transportation to the South Seas. At this time, our Japanese army has been approaching and fighting bravely, and a hundred million people in the rear are concentrating their total strength to crush the enemy's ambitions. I take this opportunity to pledge my allegiance to the Imperial Edict and to recognize with the people the ultimate goal of this Greater East Asia War, and to strengthen our belief in certain victory. Judging from the current situation, even if the enemy's air force is prevented from invading our homeland, the conclusion is extremely simple. That is, according to the Divine Edicts proclaimed by our ancestors and the instructions in the Great Edicts, we must gather all our strength and eliminate all obstacles to grasp victory. The path to grasping victory, as shown in the Great Edict, is that we, the subjects, absolutely believe in the great achievements of the Emperor, each fulfilling his duties and carrying out his mission. We are confident that with this belief, and with a hundred million hearts united in total strength, the result will be the power to penetrate the universe, supporting the boundless imperial destiny and achieving complete victory, leading the imperial country to stand on eternal bedrock. When military officers and civilians unite to fulfill their respective missions, they will naturally establish the highest morality of mankind, and the power to resolutely defeat the enemy will also arise. At this time when the Greater East Asia War can achieve a sharp victory, I am convinced that this is the essence of the belief in certain victory. I would like to share this with the people. Moreover, the government has implemented all measures to move towards victory, which goes without saying. The recently established Supreme War Guidance Council is also working hard to rapidly enhance military power and stabilize the people's livelihood. To reiterate, the time has come for the imperial army to fight bravely, for a hundred million people in the rear to be fully armed, to concentrate total strength, and to crush the enemy's ambitions. Today is the only major battle to repay the Emperor's kindness, and I am convinced that it is the best opportunity for a hundred million people. If we miss it today, it will not come again.

### The Hunan War Situation Enters a New Stage: Japanese Troops Occupied Hengyang Yesterday, Completing the Deployment to Annihilate the Anti-Axis Forces

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 8th: The Japanese troops that had previously surrounded Hengyang launched a general offensive on the evening of August 4. They annihilated three divisions of the Chongqing army co-defending the city with the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, and completely occupied the city at 8:00 AM on the 8th.

Hunan, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing-U.S. air base in Hengyang has been captured by the Japanese army. The Hunan war situation has therefore entered a decisive phase, and the mainland front has taken on a new shape and entered a new stage. This operation is fundamentally different from the so-called mainland operations of the past. The Japanese army launched an offensive with a major determination. Even if we view the Henan and Hunan operations separately, we can see how grand its scale and plan are. It can be said to be the largest operation in the past seven years. With the strategic strongholds of the Chongqing army, with the east-west defense lines as the outer ring, double encirclement, annihilating the main force of the Chongqing army, and as a result, connecting the Jinghan Railway, the artery of North and Central China, it has become a new front for the offensive against Chongqing. With Hengyang as the apex, and Xinfeng in Jiangxi Province, and Wuzhou and Liuzhou in Guangxi Province as the base, the Chongqing-U.S. air base has also suffered a major threat. At the same time, ensuring the gateway to the Chuan-Xiang Highway, Xiangtan, the gateway to the noble Sichuan, has been opened wide. In both operations, the Japanese army was disciplined and clearly recognized the correct goal of the Greater East Asia War, promoting the friendly relations between China and Japan. The Japanese army is now operating across a broad area of seven hundred kilometers north and south of the Yangtze River. The entire war situation has entered a new stage, completing the deployment to annihilate the anti-Axis forces. The decisive battle between Japan, the United States, and Britain on the mainland front has officially begun.

Japanese Base, 8th (Central News Agency) - The significance of the Japanese army's capture of Hengyang this time does not lie in the acquisition of the city, but in the acquisition of the Chongqing-Hankou air base airfield. This place is an indispensable air force stronghold for the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. After the 14th Air Force Detachment in Chongqing became independent in March of last year, it became the operational base for Chongqing to disturb Central China. The air raids on the Wuhan area, the attacks on ships on the Yangtze River, and the destruction of the Yuehan Railway between Wuchang and Yuezhou were all based in Hengyang. Even more, the enemy attracted the Japanese air power to Hengyang, taking advantage of this gap to carry out bombings of the Japanese homeland. Since the thirty-second year, air battles have been constantly unfolding in various places. The Japanese air force also inflicted heavy blows on the airfields in Guilin, Hengyang, and Lingling. In the past three years, two hundred air battles have occurred over Hengyang. However, the Japanese aircraft have always been dominant. As of today, more than two hundred enemy aircraft have been shot down or destroyed and set on fire in the skies over Hengyang. Now that Hengyang has been captured by the Japanese army, the U.S. Air Force abandoned Hengyang when Changsha fell and withdrew its air force to the Guilin-Lingling area. Therefore, the loss of Hengyang has undoubtedly made the enemy fear the loss of all airfields in the Xiang-Gan area.

Hengyang Japanese Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army entered the streets of Hengyang, the Chongqing army in the city lost its will to fight. By dawn on the 8th, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chongqing army, Fang Xianjue, and his chief of staff, Cai Yuqi, the commander of the 3rd Division, Zhou Qingrou, the commander of the 190th Division, Yang Youlue, the acting commander of the Reserve 10th Division, Li Fuzhong, and the commander of the 54th Division, Rao Shaowei, and other top commanders of the Chongqing army in the city immediately raised the white flag. Li's unit surrendered to the Japanese army.

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 7th that it had acknowledged that Japanese troops had entered the northern part of Hengyang. Japanese reinforcements were continuously arriving from the Xiangtan Mountain area, and under the cover of intense artillery fire, they fiercely attacked the front-line positions inside and outside Hengyang, engaging in bloody battles with the Chongqing defenders in the city. By the morning of the 6th, part of the Japanese army had broken through the northern positions of Hengyang. At the same time, another part of the Japanese army was engaged in a fierce general assault with the Chongqing army positions in the southwestern outskirts of the city around the highlands, unfolding a magnificent battle for control. In addition, in Lianhua, Chaling, Leiyang, Anren, and the southern part of Xiangxiang, fighting is also taking place. Outside the city of Lianjiang in Guangdong and in the southwestern part of the county, fierce fighting is also underway.

Hunan Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in the Leiyang area has been continuing to engage in rescue operations since late July to aid Hengyang. Surrounded by the Japanese army on a regular basis, fierce bayonet battles are still raging. The Chongqing 26th, 99th, and Provisional 3rd Armies, among others, in order to rescue Hengyang, are attacking the Japanese army near Xiaoshui Pu, eight kilometers south of Leiyang. The Japanese army had defeated the Chongqing army's vanguard near Wulipu (two kilometers northwest of Leiyang) on a regular basis and surrounded them from three sides. On the night of the 5th, part of the Japanese army crossed the Ji River, made a surprise attack on the rear of the Chongqing army, cut off their retreat, and launched an attack from all sides. Therefore, the three armies of the Chongqing army are in a critical situation.

### Japanese Troops Enter Hengyang: Military Discipline Is Strict, and a Proclamation Is Issued to Protect Good Residents

Hunan Japanese Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - The motive of the Allied forces in launching the Hunan operation this time is purely based on breaking the common enemy of the Anglo-Americans and their vassal forces, who have been sacrificing China and invading East Asia for a century. Since the launch, in no time, the important military strongholds of the province, Changsha, Yueyang, Xiangtan, Liling, Liuyang, and other places fell one after another. Now Hengyang, located at the intersection of the Yuehan and Xiang-Gui railways, was captured easily on August 8. At this point, the Hunan operation has entered another stage due to the capture of Hengyang. This time, the Allied forces entered Hengyang with strict military discipline, not violating the slightest thing. They did their utmost to protect the good people. Their operation was aimed solely at crushing the vassal forces of the Anglo-Americans who were sacrificing China. The vast majority of the people are powerful partners within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, in addition to sternly warning the soldiers to absolutely prohibit all illegal acts such as harassing the villagers, they also issued a proclamation to the people in the territory, telling them not to be alarmed, to go about their business, and further guaranteeing the lives, property, and all other natural rights of the people. There will be no levy of donations or conscription in the garrison area. They also absolutely respect the customs of the various villages. Therefore, the people were overjoyed when they heard the news and came to submit, looking forward to the beautiful life of peace and prosperity. The original text of the proclamation is recorded below: "Proclamation: The purpose of the Japanese army's entry into this area this time is to break the traditional ambition of the Anglo-Americans to sacrifice China and invade East Asia, to assist China, to establish sovereignty, to achieve freedom, and to promote and realize the friendly relations between China and Japan. Where the righteous army goes, it must conquer, defeat the Anglo-Americans and their vassal forces, implement security and peace for the people, and ensure that the residents live and work in peace and contentment. Do not believe rumors and frighten each other. The following points are made clear so that the great righteousness of our army may be understood: 1. The Japanese army will temporarily garrison the area until security and peace for the people are fully realized. 2. The Japanese army guarantees the lives and all other natural rights of the people in the garrison area. 3. There will be no levy of donations or conscription in the Japanese army's garrison area. All residents in the area who cooperate with our army and provide materials or labor will be paid a sufficient reward. 4. The Japanese army recognizes the simultaneous circulation of the banknotes and central reserve certificates issued in the garrison area. 5. The Japanese army respects the customs of the villages and assists the Chinese in implementing a system of self-government. However, the Japanese army will temporarily implement military administration until security and stability are achieved. This proclamation is hereby made known to all the people in this area, so that they may all understand it and not violate the spirit of the righteous army. Be sure to heed this proclamation."

### Executive Yuan Meeting

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 219th meeting on the 8th to discuss the following matters: 1. The President of the Yuan submitted a case on the draft Law on the Handling of Wartime Housing Rental Disputes submitted by Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare. It was decided to first instruct the Secretariat of the Yuan to convene the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Ministry of Social Welfare to conduct a joint review, sign their opinions, and request a public decision. It was decided to pass it according to the review opinions and submit it to the Central Political Committee. Appointments and Removals: 1.

It was proposed to dismiss him and appoint a Director of the Propaganda Division. The resolution was passed. 4. Mayor Chen of Shanghai Special Municipality submitted a proposal to appoint Feng She as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Goods Rationing Office. The resolution was passed.

### Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Investigates: American Soldiers' Bestial Acts

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - American soldiers used the skulls of Japanese soldiers killed on the Pacific front to make souvenirs and send them back to their home country for amusement. U.S. congressmen even made paper knives from the arm bones of Japanese soldiers and presented them to the President. The shocking nature of these barbaric and bestial acts is almost unbelievable. After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this to the government, it immediately entrusted the Spanish State, which protects interests, to investigate the truth. In addition, an incident of abuse of Japanese expatriates recently occurred in Lake City, USA. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also entrusted Spain to investigate the truth.

### National Government's Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the 30th year [likely referring to the Republic of China calendar], the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has engaged in the Old Hand New National Movement, dedicated to ensuring security, improving people's livelihoods, increasing national strength, and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still clung to their century-old policy of dividing East Asia and intensified their efforts, inciting Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Asian battlefield, sending troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the naval and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning and regard the peaceful development of the areas ruled by the National Government. They allow Chongqing elements to constantly harass us, obstructing the implementation of various policies, and directly use their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing elements, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, are shamefully acting as traitors to East Asia. Britain and the United States, with ulterior motives towards East Asia, have exhausted their efforts to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate aggressive desires, which should be met with common hatred by the East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Manchuria and Japan have always been friendly and share the same spirit when it comes to Asian co-prosperity. In the future, they will further promote proposals to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Many friendly nations have been fighting the forces of Britain and the United States for many years and have won glorious victories. Our country is now joining the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Grand Asianism of the Founding Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of universal faith, peace, and harmony all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and one heart and devote our strength to the end to carry out this great mission of a great era!

January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China.

Chairman: Wang Zhaoming

### Significant Discord to Arise Between Chongqing and the US

An Eight-Day Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Hunan Front: The Chongqing army's loss of Hengyang forces Chongqing to acknowledge entering a "dark age." This Hunan campaign has a significant impact on relations between Chongqing and the US. Moreover, the collapse of the Chongqing army's counteroffensive in the Xiang-Yu area, along with the destruction of the US bases stationed in Chongqing, has completely foiled the US plan to invade Japan from the mainland. With the Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang line threatening Chongqing, US aid to Chongqing will naturally be hampered. Assuming the US continues to aid Chongqing in the future, its purpose will be solely for: (1) preventing Chongqing from leaving the anti-Axis front; (2) using Chongqing as a puppet to maintain its bridgehead for invading East Asia. When US President Wallace arrived in Chongqing, he said, "I have come to Chongqing this time, from the northwest region through the back door, but I solemnly declare that I am actually entering through a new front door." Everyone understands what the heartfelt words express. As the Japanese army's Hunan campaign progresses smoothly, the US specifically dispatched Wallace to Chongqing to adjust US-Chongqing relations. We should observe how things develop from across the river.

Eight-Day Central News Agency dispatch from a forward Japanese base in Hunan, the Hengyang Airfield: The US-Chongqing airfields being captured by the Japanese army has had an enormous impact on the US-Chongqing camp. Major discord will arise between Chongqing and the US as a result. The pathetic and laughable state of the enemy camp when the Hengyang Airfield fell is truly evident. From this, we can also see how huge the impact of this event will be on the US-Chongqing camp in the future.

Fatal Blow from Loss of Resource Areas

Based on combined frontline intelligence and broadcasts from Chongqing and the US, when the Japanese army captured the Hengyang Airfield on the 29th, a Chongqing Associated Press dispatch stated: "With Hengyang, following Luoyang and Changsha, being seized by the Japanese army, the War of Resistance area is divided into two. The loss of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, China's largest resource areas and the base for cultivating the strength of the War of Resistance, is truly a fatal blow." Furthermore, a subsequent US broadcast stated: "The anti-Axis nations have now lost the largest hope of launching air strikes against the Japanese mainland. At the same time, Chongqing has lost even more. In other words, it will become the root and source of the strength of the War of Resistance, more important than the heart of the world." The so-called "heart of the world" refers to the US's intentions toward Chongqing. Chongqing is truly feeling like it has thorns in its back. Chongqing could only respond with the old cliché from the "Military Commission" spokesperson: "The fall of Hengyang will not stop the War of Resistance." However, even as the words were still ringing in the ears, the Hengyang Airfield was lost in less than half a day, providing excellent material for the Japanese to attack Chongqing. The loss of credibility goes without saying. In the past, the US had already stated that the Chongqing army was an "inferior army." Now, it will surely intensify its criticism. It is only natural to imagine them confronting each other. Regarding this issue, both sides have remained silent to avoid blame for the fall of Hengyang. However, once it occurs, we can simply wait and see the ugly drama unfold.

Economic Issues as the Primary Cause of Friction

Secondly, there is the issue of the southwestern blockade, which is an important topic in both Chongqing and the US. Recently, H.H. Kung also met with a group of reporters and admitted that the fall of Hengyang was a "truly significant loss of the most important economic zone for foreign relations." This refers to major materials for US loans and factories in the southwest that rely heavily on US capital. Currently, the greatest support for Chongqing's economic War of Resistance comes from US loans and US factories. In the past, Chongqing had obtained US capital of one hundred million gold dollars by using tung oil as collateral, and also concluded a 99-year mining treaty, establishing a 500 million gold dollar legal tender stabilization fund and other loans. When the treaty was signed in January 1941, the US member of the "Legal Tender Stabilization Committee," O.K. Davis, accompanied Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Chongqing "Trade Commission," to investigate resources in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. From this fact, it can also be seen that the majority of the collateral objects for the loans were located within the area of this Japanese military operation. After the investigation, it was also decided that the Datong-Pingsiang coal mines, which have now been occupied by the Japanese army, the thermal power generation facilities, the mining of important minerals such as tin and antimony, facilities in Huangtian, northwest of Xinhua in Hunan province, Chongqing, and Hengyang, among other places. In Hengyang alone, there were more than twenty factories, including the Ford-funded Sixth Automobile Factory and large and small factories for military and civilian needs. Following the activity of the US Air Force in Chongqing in Hunan, Hengyang had an aircraft factory and an aircraft repair factory, with repair and construction factories in other locations. The southwestern region had become a major US military-industrial zone, and both the resource zone and the factory zone were centered in Hengyang, with railways and waterways connecting east, west, north, and south. The important zones and the related transportation networks are now either in the hands of the Japanese army or blockaded. The embarrassment of the US and Chongqing can be imagined.

US Extends its Grasp, Chongqing Feels Anguish

Regarding this, only a New York dispatch stated: "When the properties in southwestern China encounter changes, we must seek replacements on the mainland." This is a point of deep distress for Chongqing. The so-called replacement clearly refers to Sichuan province and the northwestern inland. The US's grasp will naturally extend even further into the aforementioned two areas in the future. Whether Chongqing will sacrifice everything to satisfy the selfish desires of the US and continue its humiliating War of Resistance under foreign consular power in the US is a matter that deserves attention. Chongqing seems to be suffering from the US relationship resulting from the defeat in the war. Therefore, taking the loss of the Hengyang Airfield as an opportunity, not only will the US-Chongqing military relationship be shaken, but other aspects will also experience a huge upheaval and discord is without a doubt.

### Today is the Eighth Air Defense Day; Air Defense Drills Will Be Held; Attention Must Also Be Paid to Real Alarms

Today (9th) is the Eighth Air Defense Day. In addition to conducting various air defense propaganda activities as usual, the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will also hold various air defense drills to ensure that citizens are proficient in various air defense measures and to enhance their air defense spirit, staying at their posts and being prepared for any eventuality. The training items have already been detailed in yesterday's newspaper, and citizens must strictly follow them. However, regarding the alarm drills, the scheduled times for issuing the alerts are: the first time at 9:30 AM, issuing a warning alarm, transitioning to an air raid alarm at 10:30 AM, and lifting the air raid alarm at 11:30 AM; the second time at 8:30 PM, issuing an air raid alarm, lifting the air raid alarm at 9:30 PM, and completely lifting the warning alarm at 10:30 PM. However, in addition to the above-mentioned scheduled training alarms, if there are any further alarm sounds, it is a real air defense alarm, and citizens should pay special attention to taking various emergency measures at any time to defend against enemy aircraft attacks.

### An Enemy Aircraft Attacked Our City Yesterday Morning; Bombing in the Huangpu River Causes Minor Damage

As the Japanese army's operations in mainland China continue to advance, the US-Chongqing air force is now adopting guerrilla warfare tactics. Yesterday (8th) at 4:55 AM, an enemy aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs indiscriminately over the Huangpu River before fleeing hastily. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced at 6:00 AM that morning: "At 4:55 AM on the 8th, an enemy US B-24 aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs over the Huangpu River, causing minor damage."

The City Issues Two Alarms

The city issued a warning alarm at 11:05 PM on the previous day (7th), which was lifted at 11:35 PM. Then, at 4:55 AM yesterday (8th), an emergency air raid alarm was issued, indicating that an enemy US aircraft was attacking. Because the entire city's lights were extinguished, plunging it into a "black city" state, the enemy US aircraft was unable to find its target and only dropped bombs blindly on the Huangpu River before fleeing suddenly, causing little damage. At 5:45 AM, the air raid alarm was changed to a warning alarm, and at 6:00 AM, the warning alarm was completely lifted, returning the city to normal.

Enemy Aircraft Conducts Psychological Warfare

(Additional report) The enemy aircraft that infiltrated the Shanghai area yesterday morning for a guerrilla air raid had scouted Hangzhou Bay at 11:00 PM on the 7th, then reappeared in the area at 4:00 AM on the 8th. At 4:55 AM, flying at an altitude of about 500 meters, it entered the Pudong area and penetrated into Shanghai, dropping bombs over the Huangpu River before fleeing hastily. The objective of the enemy US air force seemed to be the ships in the Huangpu River, but the bombs landed in the river, causing minimal damage. The US-Chongqing air force has suffered heavy losses due to the brave attacks of the Japanese army. This attack by the enemy forces is nothing more than an attempt to conduct psychological warfare in the Shanghai area. Furthermore, there were shortcomings in the light control aspects during the warning alarm the night before, especially regarding the adjustment of car lights, which needs to be greatly improved. Citizens must pay close attention.

### The Commercial Control Association Holds Its Third Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Today

The new organizational structure of the National Commercial Control Association has been adjusted and is starting new control activities. In addition to submitting separate letters to government authorities and related groups, the association has scheduled the second third joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 3:00 PM this afternoon (9th) at the Cathay Mansions to discuss all the steps for implementing material controls in the future.

### Household Rice Rationing Resumes Tomorrow; Each Person Can Purchase Two Sheng of Rice with a Coupon

Regarding the household rice rationing in the city, which has been suspended for two months, under the active supervision of the Municipal Government's Goods Rationing Office, it has been decided that from the 10th of this month, all districts in the city will universally resume sales. Each person, regardless of age, can purchase two city sheng of rice, calculated at 35 yuan per sheng, for a total of 70 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The office originally planned to unify the periods for household rice rationing. However, due to the large number of remaining coupons from the former Economic Affairs Bureau and the former Food Bureau, which would have to be scrapped, it was decided to continue using the past rice rationing periods to conserve resources. The old first district will still be called the 69th period, and areas outside the old first district will be called the 41st period. The former will receive rice based on the comprehensive rationing certificate. At that time, citizens in that district can check the designated number in the office's announcement and purchase rice with the coupon. Other areas that have not yet implemented the comprehensive rationing certificate will purchase rice with the rice purchase certificate issued by the former Food Bureau.

The city currently has a population of 3.3 million people, and each period requires the allocation of approximately 61,000 bags of rice. The whole month requires approximately 183,000 bags of rice, including specially accumulated rationed rice. The inventory of household rice is extremely abundant, and with the imminent harvesting of new grain, the food prospects for the people can be free from worry. The continued implementation of household rice rationing will still be based on past rice rationing standards, with each person, regardless of age, receiving six sheng of rice per month in three installments. Ration coupons will be distributed by the Baojia office. After receiving the coupons, residents can purchase rice from the public sales offices. Currently, the office has six public sales offices responsible for selling specially rationed rice to residents and others.

Rice Prices Drop; Shanghai Citizens' Household Rice Rationing: Through the efforts of both the Japanese military and political sides, a large amount of rice has been transported from Hunan, a newly operational area, to meet the needs of the people of Shanghai. The authorities have decided to resume rationing from the 10th of this month. Rice prices in Shanghai are declining daily, falling to 8,000 yuan on the 8th.

### Approved List of Aid Recipients to Be Announced Tomorrow

The examination papers for the seventh session of the newspaper's reader's scholarship application have now been graded separately. All those with better results and scores that meet the standards are admitted, accounting for about half of the total number of more than 7,000 people. All 10 million yuan of scholarships will be issued to admitted students, with an average of 3,000 yuan per person. Among the more than 3,000 people who were not selected, there are many who are excellent in their studies, talented, physically fit, and morally upright, and should be selected to enable them to continue their studies for further development. Unfortunately, due to the limited scholarship funds, we are unable to help! We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate as much as they can. An additional 30,000 yuan will help 10 more people to study, and an additional 300,000 yuan will help 100 more people to study. In other words, more donations will help more people, and the more donated, the more beneficiaries there will be. The colleagues of this newspaper will do their best to help needy students to the greatest extent possible; we especially hope that the readers of this newspaper will also fulfill their greatest aspirations; we sincerely pray! As for the list of students approved for scholarships, a total of more than 2,700 people from elementary school to junior high school will be published in this newspaper tomorrow (10th).

We will settle accounts on a daily basis and submit the funds successively, which is more convenient. The total revenue of the entire business today is 100,000 yuan, and 5%, or 5,000 yuan, should be extracted, sending 2,500 yuan to your newspaper and Xinwen Daily, respectively. Please accept."

### Municipal Consultative Council Holds Sixth Committee Meeting; Two Proposals Approved

The Municipal Consultative Council held its sixth plenary committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th of this month in the Municipal Government meeting room on Jiangxi Road. Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, and the heads of various bureaus and departments, as well as committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Riping, Pei Yunqing, Jin Xiongbai, Li Quanshi, Wu Yunsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Guo Shun, Shen Siliang, Yao Qingsan, Chen Binhe, etc. attended.

Mayor's Speech

The meeting began with a speech by Mayor Chen, who briefly stated that the municipal administration was unified on August 1st, and he had published an article on all the circumstances. In terms of the newly divided district boundaries, it can be said that they are the most suitable for the current situation and the future of the municipal administration in the ideal state, and it is expected that there will be no further changes in the future. He felt that personnel issues were particularly important, and he hoped that all parties would break with old habits, eliminate prejudices, work together harmoniously, and cooperate. All regulations on staff service are being revised. As for the selection of staff, he had always respected the freedom of each unit to select them, and he hoped that each unit would strive to review, consult widely, and focus entirely on talent, and he also hoped that the Consultative Council would provide guidance at any time.

Two Proposals

The Consultative Council then discussed two proposals: (1) A proposal to establish the seven counties under the jurisdiction of the city as model districts. (2) A proposal to incorporate the significance of receiving the concessions and abolishing unequal treaties on August 1st into textbooks, which were unanimously passed. Subsequently, the Deputy Director of the Police Bureau reported on the suburban police facilities plan, and Director Feng of the Goods Rationing Office reported on the preparations for this rice rationing, both in great detail. Regarding household rice, it was decided that from August, two sheng would be rationed per person each period, which would not be lacking or delayed. However, the first phase of August would have to start on the 10th due to procedural reasons. As for rice registration, it is hoped that citizens will report truthfully and not purchase extra, so it is hoped that they will not conceal anything. This matter concerns the livelihood of the people, and statistics will have to be verified on the ground in the future.

Financial Issues

Finally, Chen Binhe raised five questions regarding financial aspects, all of which were answered one by one by Director of the Finance Bureau. The main points were that after the unification of municipal administration, in addition to the unified regulations on house tax rates, other regulations were being gradually adjusted, and the principle of unified revenue and expenditure was also being implemented. The city government's revenue and expenditure were still balanced this year. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Director Liang first delivered a speech, briefly outlining the significance of organizing the Baojia Propaganda Committee, and strongly urged news colleagues in the city to enthusiastically participate in the Baojia propaganda work. Director Gu then gave a speech, stating that although the Baojia Department had been established for many years, the general public still did not fully understand the Baojia work. Therefore, he hoped that the Propaganda Committee would be established as soon as possible, and hoped that colleagues participating in the work would cooperate to enable the public to generally understand the meaning of Baojia, etc. After the speech, the representatives immediately nominated Chen Binhe, Xu Liqu, Lu Feng, Lu Guangjie, Zhu Yongkang, Hinohara Kiyomaro, Zheng Hongyan, Chen Zhengzhang, Ma Zongyao, Chu Baowei, Ren Yunpeng, and Pan Bide as committee members, and elected Chen Binhe as chairman.

### Finance and Industry Ministries Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Stock Exchange Books

During the period of skyrocketing Chinese stock prices, the Chinese Stock Exchange's announcement on the 31st of last month to suspend trading for one day to handle deliveries attracted attention from the outside world. Li Shangming, a member of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervision Committee, felt that the exchange's sudden suspension of trading for one day during the period of rising prices gave speculators an opportunity to make up for their short positions, and the measures were improper. He sent a telegram to the ministers of the Finance and Industry Ministries and the chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Chen, for instructions. It is now known that after approving the telegram, the Finance and Industry Ministries separately ordered Mai Jingming, Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and Li Zheng, Commissioner of the Finance Ministry's Shanghai Office, to work with Zhang Guru, Director of the Inspection Team of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, to go to the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange on Jiujiang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (8th) to inspect the exchange's business accounts to see if there was any collusion to speculate in short positions. It is reported that the chairman of the exchange, Zhang Weiru, and the managing director, Shen Changgeng, personally met with them yesterday and presented the trading books for the past month for inspection. This inspection of the accounts was very serious and meticulous and will take one or two days to complete.
