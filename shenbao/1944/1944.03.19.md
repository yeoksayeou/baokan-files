### The Core of the Commodity Price Problem

— Yoshida Toyosuke

To think the commodity price problem arises because prices are high is a nonsensical view. Those who hold this view do so based on the proportion between the amount of goods and currency to observe the commodity price problem, and arrive at a guess. However, this is the most foolish opinion in the world. For example, a one-carat diamond may be worth 100,000 or 200,000 yuan, but this can never become a commodity price problem. The Soviet Union imposes extremely heavy taxes on luxury goods, so the prices of luxury goods are far higher than in other countries. Currently, some black market items in Japan are even more expensive than in Shanghai. However, neither Japan nor the Soviet Union has ever experienced a commodity price problem like Shanghai's. In short, the commodity price problem does not arise because prices are high, but because there is a social system where people have to buy high-priced goods. Although black market prices in Japan are not necessarily cheap, because truly essential daily necessities can be obtained through extremely inexpensive rations, the people will not be affected in their survival, even if they completely ignore the high-priced black market. Stepping back, even if there are items that must be bought, the extent to which the Japanese people rely on the black market is not as severe as in Shanghai. Therefore, no matter how high black market prices are in Japan, the lives of most people are not problematic. If Shanghai increased the ration of household rice and allowed people to barely maintain their lives with it, then even if black market rice rose from 4,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry volume), it would no longer be a commodity price problem. If the coal briquette ration was sufficient for a family to cook and prepare dishes, then even if one coal briquette cost 100 yuan, it would not become a serious problem. Pursuing materials outside of essential daily necessities on the black market is the private affair of the wealthy and is of no concern to the general public.

The reason why Shanghai is experiencing a commodity price problem is that the amount of essential daily necessities rationed to the people is too low, and the people have to seek most of their essential daily necessities on the black market. Additionally, the flat-price markets have fallen into an abnormal state of existence in name only due to "control," so black market prices have become astronomical figures. This is like a hunter wanting to capture beasts in the desert and eliminating all water sources except for one. Even if the beasts are very clear that approaching the water source is extremely dangerous, they cannot but approach this water source for survival. Since the market for essential daily necessities is controlled, and life cannot be sustained by the regulated rations, the citizens of Shanghai, in this dilemma, must seek essential daily necessities from the only remaining water source, the "black market"—regardless of how high the price—like beasts in the desert, or they will simply sit and wait for death. Therefore, the citizens have no choice but to let the "black market" manipulators, who hoard and speculate, arbitrarily control them and sacrifice them. From this perspective, although "control" and the "black market" are opposing in a subjective sense, they are mutually dependent in an objective sense. The most concrete and obvious manifestation of this point is rice. If Shanghai did not have black market rice and relied solely on the current household rice to maintain life, I am afraid that the majority of Shanghai's population would have already become starving corpses in ditches. In this respect, the "black market" helps "control." Conversely, if rice in Shanghai were not "controlled," then there would be no "black market" for rice. In this respect, "control" helps the "black market." Those who knowingly exploit this relationship are Hou Dachun and his cronies. This event is just like a hunter using only one water source to capture beasts, employing the endless mysteries between "control" and the "black market" to plunge the people into misery.

The Hou Dachun incident alone, in that the parties involved knowingly violated the law, clearly shows the subtle relationship between "control" and the "black market." In contrast, for those who hold esteemed figures like Mr. Yuan Gengdeng as the host of "control," no matter how beneficial the current situation is to "black market" manipulators, the mutually dependent relationship between the two is quite difficult to grasp. However, under these conditions, simply saying that "control" helps the "black market," objectively, is not much different from the Hou Dachun incident. Regarding the relationship between "control" and the "black market," the Shen Bao commentary on March 16 stated: "The first defect of controlled economy is the lack of order and discipline, because a small number of people use their power to seek personal gain and engage in corruption, not hesitating to plunge the livelihood of the majority into a desperate situation; at the same time, the black market for rice, the black market for cloth, and even the black market for all daily necessities, are rampant and chaotic beyond control." The actual situation is indeed like this, but simply saying this is not enough, and there is a high possibility of confusing the fundamental relationship between the two. According to the current rations, even if the controlled economy has order and discipline, even if a small number of people do not use their power, the citizens of Shanghai cannot but buy essential daily necessities in the black market. The core of Shanghai's commodity price problem should lie in this point.

I have discussed more than once that the solutions to the commodity price problem are to crack down on speculation, rectify official discipline, and have clean government, etc. Naturally, these points are, to some extent, measures to prevent commodity prices from rising, but I have never considered them to be the fundamental solution to the commodity price problem. Because even if commodity prices are extremely cheap, if the people's purchasing power is lower than the commodity prices, then the commodity price problem still exists. Of course, the flat-price policy is very important, but it is only a temporary and expedient palliative measure before adopting a fundamental solution, only a camphor injection before performing surgery. Today, China's economy is no longer in a period where it can be perfunctorily dealt with using camphor injections and antipyretics. If we want to fundamentally solve China's commodity price problem, we must dissect the relationship between the "black market" and "control." If the government consistently wants to solve the commodity price problem through "control," then it must thoroughly implement control, that is, it must guarantee the minimum living standards of the people. Only after the minimum living standards of the people are guaranteed can the commodity price problem be fundamentally solved.

If the commodity price problem that Chiang Kai-shek is troubled by today can be successfully resolved within the Peaceful Zone, this will be the political victory of the Peaceful Zone. If the Peaceful Zone cannot achieve political victory, then it is not qualified to talk about "victory first" in the Greater East Asia War. Thus, it can be known that the core of the commodity price problem is also the core of the political problem. (Translated by Lu)

### Japanese Troops Continue to Advance in the Tiddim Valley Area, Occupying the Forward Position of Kangrat Peak

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the front lines of the Japanese army in Burma, the British Indian 17th Division, after being surrounded by the Japanese army, was subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army, and finally collapsed on the 7th. The commanders of the 63rd and 68th Brigades, the main force near Tiddim, and division commander Lacey, along with their subordinates, attempted to escape the Japanese encirclement and flee into Indian territory, seeking their retreat downstream of Manipur, northwest of Tiddim. However, the Japanese forces arrived quickly, and near the junction of Tonzang area in western Tiddim, the Japanese troops, with the cooperation of the air force, are currently fiercely attacking the Indian National Army. The annihilation battle of the British Indian 17th Division has reached its climax.

Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The forward position of Kangrat Peak, the stronghold of the enemy's 17th Division in Tiddim, has finally fallen. The enemy troops in that area, after being surrounded by the Japanese army from the east, south, and north, and subjected to fierce attacks, lost their will to fight. However, due to the severe supervision from the rear, they were forced to continue fighting until 4:00 a.m. on the 17th, when the Japanese army launched a fierce frontal attack, resulting in a complete collapse and a scramble to flee. At the same time, in pursuit of the defeated enemy, the Japanese army began to attack Tiddim. Therefore, the only key technique in the Chin Hills area, which has prevented the Japanese army from advancing since the Japanese army occupied Fort White in November last year, has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. As a result, the enemy's base camp, Tiddim, is on the verge of falling.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Southeast Asia Allied Headquarters issued a communiqué on the 17th stating that Japanese troops are currently continuing to advance north of Tiddim and in the Kabaw Valley area.

### Japanese Aircraft Heavily Bomb Two Airfields in Indian Territory

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army in Burma states that the Japanese army air squadrons in Burma heavily bombed the enemy's Sirkya and East Indian Ayingmi airfields. This severely damaged their only forward base for attacking Burma. The runways and important facilities were set on fire by the bombing. After completing their mission, all Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defenses. On the same day, another squadron of Japanese fighter planes departed from a certain base. On the way, they shot down two enemy fighter-bombers over the Arakan Mountains. They then continued to advance, flew over Sirkya, and engaged in a fierce aerial battle with about 30 enemy fighter planes, shooting down 19 of them (five of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese side suffered no damage except for one plane that self-destructed.

### Japan Actively Strengthens Women's Mobilization System, Information Bureau Releases Policy Outline

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government believes that women are important contributors to increasing military production. In order to establish a system for the general mobilization of women's labor, the Cabinet decided on a plan to promote general mobilization in September of last year at a meeting of vice ministers. Since then, preparations have been made to organize women's labor volunteer corps. Subsequently, on January 18 of this year, the Cabinet approved the outline of emergency national labor mobilization policies. In order to improve the women's volunteer corps system, measures will be taken to address the organization, management, and regulations and treatment of corps members. The outline of emergency measures for the decisive battle, which was passed by the Cabinet previously, also includes provisions for compulsory female participation in the volunteer corps. The central government is actively strengthening the women's mobilization system. The outline of policies for strengthening the volunteer corps system, which was passed on the 18th of this month, was released by the Japanese Information Bureau on the afternoon of this day. The main content is recorded as follows: The women's volunteer corps should respond to the urgent demands of the country and engage in increased production with a spirit of selflessness and dedication to public service. Therefore, in principle, their status is fundamentally different from that of general laborers. However, when working, they should engage in operations with the same labor spirit as other laborers. Unmarried women aged 12 and above are to be members of the corps, with the exception of female agricultural members during wartime. Local officials or the head of the National Labor Mobilization Office will take the lead in having school principals, heads of women's youth groups, heads of women's associations, and heads of group associations organize volunteer corps to prepare for production. Each women's volunteer corps will be led by a leader who can replace the corps member's fathers, brothers, mothers, sisters, or other close relatives. Under them, there will be a captain, in order to ensure that there are no regrets in operations. The corps members will be assigned to factories with excellent labor management and will work in the form of shifts as much as possible. When this is not possible, they will work together in well-equipped dormitories or in schools and homes that have been converted into factories. The term of service for women's volunteer corps members is one year. Preparatory training will be given as much as possible before starting work. In principle, the mobilization of women's volunteer corps will be carried out by local officials. A portion of the work will be managed separately by the head of the National Labor Mobilization Office, with the assistance of municipal, ward, town, and village chiefs. After guidance and persuasion, women's volunteer corps will be formed and deployed. This time, in terms of basic matters such as organization, participation, and treatment, the cooperation order in Article 5 of the National General Mobilization Law will be announced and enforced, and forceful legal measures will be implemented. For those who do not comply with the cooperation order, if necessary, the employment order will be issued in accordance with Article 6 of the law to enforce deployment.

### Burmese Villagers Capture American Airmen Alive, Japanese Army Awards Certificates

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army in Burma states that the Burmese people's cooperation with the Japanese army is increasing daily. Recently, a certain village discovered that American Air Force pilots had parachuted to escape. Through the concerted cooperation of the village chief and villagers, they were captured alive. In order to express gratitude and encouragement, the commander of a certain unit of the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma awarded certificates to these meritorious villagers on the 15th. When four P38 aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft during an attack by American aircraft, the American pilots attempted to parachute down and escape. The village chief of a certain village in Southern Yi Prefecture discovered this and immediately gathered the villagers to bravely arrest an American officer who was lurking in the forest and hand him over to the Japanese army.

### Wartime Production Situation in Chongqing: Two Completely Opposing Opinions

Central News Agency Report: Regarding the wartime industrial production situation in Chongqing, based on recently obtained information, there are two completely opposing views, and the two sides are fiercely attacking each other. One side claims that the industrial production capacity under Chongqing's rule has greatly developed compared to before the incident, and continues to list huge figures, expressing extreme optimism. The other side claims that the industrial sector is currently encountering extremely major events, so the government should promptly implement strong industrial countermeasures. According to a recent report in Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor in the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, recently stated at a reception for foreign reporters that the rear area industry in Chongqing has made leaps and bounds compared to before the incident. At the same time, the Chongqing Central Daily News also commented on this matter on March 6, stating that the development of Chongqing's industry is still far away. The arguments of both sides are completely contradictory. The main points are as follows: Since the War of Resistance, the steel and machinery industries in Chongqing have indeed made progress in technology, and their business was very prosperous before 1941. However, thereafter, due to increased labor costs and rising raw material prices, the turnover of industrial funds became increasingly difficult. At the same time, due to the stagnation of new projects and other reasons, sales channels have become greatly narrowed. As a result, most factories have been forced to shut down or reduce production. According to the authorities of the Resources Committee, there are nine steel factories under the Resources Committee, the largest of which is the steel factory jointly run by the committee and the Ordnance Department. The most modern equipment and technology are in the electric smelting factory. Under its jurisdiction are also electrical, thunderbolt, pure iron, electric steel, and hand steel factories, etc. Currently, preparations are being actively made and work will be heard soon. In the future, it is planned to use high-frequency electric furnaces to manufacture various alloy mines, or use low-temperature sintering methods to cast pure iron. Although this is Chongqing's first excellent undertaking, the production volume of each factory does not exceed 30 tons per day. Moreover, due to the lack of state-owned funds and inefficient turnover, the sales channels of the products are quite poor. Therefore, the Zihe Steel Factory of the committee has been shut down for half a year. Ten of the eighteen factories in Sichuan Province have been shut down. Government industrial loans are a drop in the bucket and have absolutely no benefit to reality. Father Yu, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, and economic commentator Qian Jiaju, also hold roughly the same views as the above editorial. Qian Jiaju, in his final conclusion, argued that the industrial construction department is currently facing very difficult situations due to insufficient production funds and raw materials, as well as various obstacles such as rising prices. Therefore, strong policies should be adopted to adapt to this situation.

### Gold and US Dollars Soar, Commodity Prices in Chongqing Skyrocket

Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - Recently, Chongqing imported a large amount of gold worth 200 million US dollars from the United States, intending to use it as a countermeasure against currency inflation. Also, because US dollars were issued to American personnel stationed in Chongqing, causing the US dollar to flood the market, commodity prices in Chongqing became even more soaring. Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao recently published an article titled "Gold, US Dollars, and Commodity Prices," frankly pointing out the causal relationship between gold, US dollars, and commodity prices. The gist of it is recorded as follows: In recent months, the prices of gold and US dollars have skyrocketed, and commodity prices have risen by 30% to 50% compared to the past. Commodity prices, gold, and US dollars stimulate each other. Regarding the US dollar, the official exchange rate between the current legal currency and the US dollar is only six times that of before the war, while the highest black market price in Kunming has reached fifty to sixty times that of before the war. The domestic purchasing power of Chongqing's legal currency has fallen to a ratio of 250 to 1. In the past, the US dollar could not skyrocket because there were fewer US dollars in the interior, and exchange was blocked by government agencies and special figures. Therefore, there was no connection between the exchange value of the legal currency and its domestic value. However, in recent years, due to the frequent coming and going of the US military, and since January of this year, the salaries of US diplomats and others have been paid entirely in US dollars, a large number of US dollars have flowed in. Also, air transport between Chongqing and India is extremely frequent, and merchants are buying and exchanging. The official exchange rate and black market transactions have reached more than ten times. As the US dollar becomes more expensive, the black market for US dollars becomes more rampant. The skyrocketing of gold and US dollars stimulates commodity prices, and commodity prices affect gold and US dollars. Commodity prices continue to soar under the influence of this vicious cycle of the three. If we continue to ignore this, I don't know what the situation will become. We sincerely hope that the government authorities, rather than adopting stopgap measures, should seek fundamental countermeasures.

### Japanese Naval Air Squadron Bombs Torokina

When he met with leaders on the 16th, he warned the American people not to be too optimistic about the war against Japan. He emphasized the importance of submarine warfare as follows: The combat power and morale of the Japanese fleet are still strong. Japan has a strong air force in other places, preparing for battle. Submarines will still occupy an important position in the elements of combat in the near future.

### Tokyo Utilizes Vacant Land to Increase Agricultural Production

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Based on the outline of emergency measures for the decisive battle, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government previously established a general headquarters for the utilization of vacant land. The headquarters observed that there are many vacant lands in schools, temples, and other places in the metropolis. If each family without farmland plants one vegetable, the annual increase in vegetables and miscellaneous grains can be 25 million koku (approximately 6.4 pounds per koku). Therefore, it is actively promoting this, and the results obtained so far are quite good. Currently, vacant lands in national schools and town council neighborhood groups have begun to be cultivated to increase production. The headquarters has decided to establish "vacant land utilization and production offices" in Hinoya, Shiba Hazawa, Ueno, Otsuka, Koen, Inokashira, and Azusa Mountain and other parks from the 20th of this month to guide this effort. The work of utilizing vacant land to increase production will temporarily utilize 202 large and small parks, converting both grasslands and plazas into agricultural gardens. In areas with poor soil quality, vegetables such as squash will be cultivated, which will yield approximately 70,000 hectares of arable land.

### Government Determined to Severely Punish Corrupt Officials, Authorities Specifically Publish Opinions on Purifying Officialdom

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the occurrence of the Hou Hu military grain procurement corruption case, the government has severely punished the perpetrators, imposing the death penalty. The people across the country have deeply admired and unanimously supported the government's severe measures. In light of this, the reporter made a special visit to the government authorities to inquire about future opinions on punishing corruption and purifying officialdom. The response was as follows: "The government's promotion of clean governance and elimination of corruption has always been a guiding principle. Our esteemed leader has repeatedly given instructions on purifying officialdom in his speeches. In his talk at the beginning of this year, he specifically pointed out that eliminating corruption is the greatest policy direction of this year. In May and October of last year, the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Important Commodities and the Regulations for Punishing Crimes by Public Officials showed the authorities' determination. The thorough investigation and strict handling of this corruption case are the implementation of the leader's will and the execution of laws. In the future, the elimination of corruption will definitely be based on a consistent policy and strictly enforced. In the spirit of 'Better to cry in one family than to cry on the road,' any corrupt officials will be severely dealt with. We must achieve a situation of complete elimination of abuses in a short period of time. It is hoped that all levels of society will be self-disciplined and self-loving, cooperate in promoting this, and jointly build a model of clean governance."

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 18th - This time, the government authorities, in order to purify officialdom, eliminate corruption, and further seek to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power, decisively sentenced the main culprits in the military grain procurement corruption case, Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng, to death. As a result, the news spread, shocking both the government and the public. In particular, the general public was moved to the point of thoroughness and further strengthened their belief in the government's thoroughness and further enhanced their belief in the government. The Central News Agency reporter, for this reason, made a special visit yesterday to the highest administrative responsibility of the capital, the academy, and Li, the police commander and police chief, to inquire about their opinions on the government's measures. They respectively issued key talks: Mayor (Remarks) This time, the group government is making decisive disposal for clarifying the governance of officials and punishing corruption. If there are local officials who use their powers and engage in private fraud, or if there are illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate, disrupt the economy, and harm people's livelihood, they must be severely punished by law. Be prepared to make the local administration in the capital clean, people's livelihood stable, (Director Li's remarks) Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, various major materials have been subject to reasonable control. However, the control system is a new initiative, and the government has planned it carefully. However, some unscrupulous merchants, who knew the benefits, used various methods to undermine it, and even more unscrupulous officials, who took advantage of it, have not been able to do their best for a while, which is extremely hateful. This time, the Hou Hu corruption case, the government authorities' constitution and punishment, was originally intended to strengthen the country and cultivate the lives of the people.

### Chongqing Severely Protests American Military's Excessive Extravagance

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The arrogance and indulgence of the lives of American overseas troops have reached the extreme.

### Rambling Talk on the Current Situation by Tokutomi Sohō

Respectfulness is a virtue of the Japanese people, and enthusiasm is an inherent quality of the Japanese character. Even a glance at the Noh play "Hachi no Ki" reveals the passion and fiery spirit that resides within the Japanese heart. However, this kind of enthusiasm has gradually been lost in modern times, especially today in wartime.

Government authorities are desperately shouting for the importance of wartime enthusiasm and promoting its recovery, but the effects of the response are weak. Occasionally, cases of enthusiasm are discovered in society, and newspapers immediately publish them prominently. Based on this point alone, we can see that Japan is very lacking in enthusiasm. At this critical juncture, our 100 million Japanese compatriots should ask themselves, what will happen if we continue like this?

Heroic sacrifice is of utmost importance to complete the aims of the Greater East Asia War, but it is also essential to cultivate this enthusiasm. This enthusiasm can also be used to complete the war. The effects of the war can also be grasped, cultivated, and expanded with this enthusiasm. The ancients said that the benevolent are invincible, which proves the important position that enthusiasm occupies in human affairs, large and small, and we must understand this point.

Regarding the reasons for the lack of enthusiasm, the dominance of so-called individualism is the greatest. No matter how much it harms others, as long as it benefits oneself, when this kind of thinking dominates humanity, enthusiasm will unknowingly disappear from the world. Although Britain and the United States are unable to fully control individualism, they still have the support of Christianity. Japan has no restraint and only practices individualism, so its drawbacks far exceed those of Britain and the United States by ____ times. Perhaps some people think that this is a thing of the past, and that the situation has already changed drastically, but in fact this kind of thinking is ____ ten thousand miles away from reality. Furthermore, it is even easier to fish in troubled waters during wartime. The lack of enthusiasm has become commonplace, and enthusiasm has become a rare exception. The shortage of labor due to the war is a natural thing. However, instead of thinking of ways to remedy this shortage, some people take advantage of the labor shortage to engage in all sorts of unenthusiastic actions and remain indifferent, not caring at all. This cannot be said to be anything other than taking advantage of the war to commit evil deeds.

If there were enthusiasm between people, seven or eight out of ten frictions and conflicts would disappear. Someone once told me:

"I went to a certain government office for something. A young official was sitting on a swivel chair, his feet propped up on the desk with his shoes on, and he treated the visitors with absolutely no respect. He not only didn't treat them as equals, but he almost didn't even treat them as human beings. It was truly infuriating and outrageous." Perhaps this is an exception. Such an official will definitely not get things done. However, we must not forget that such situations exist in society. We are not saying that only government offices today can be called unenthusiastic organizations. The phenomenon of unenthusiasm has already spread to every corner, no matter how remote or ____. If we do not thoroughly cleanse this atmosphere, Japan will never become a great power in the world, and the Japanese people will never be able to shoulder the task of leading Greater East Asia.

Enthusiasm is not only for people, but also for things. There is a big difference between doing things with enthusiasm and without enthusiasm, whether it is hammering a nail, sealing an envelope, or cutting a piece of paper. Today, almost no package arrives with its outer wrapping intact. Is this the fault of the sender, or is it the fault of the administrator? In any case, this is the result of someone, somewhere, lacking enthusiasm. What's worse, there are not a few cases of people taking advantage of the damaged packages to steal the contents. Perhaps one cannot generalize and say that all damage is done to steal the contents, but I don't believe that such things never happen. Since newspapers have recently been publishing articles about such repeat offenders being prosecuted, this proves that there are already many such negative phenomena in Japan.

Some people in society think that this is a small matter or that it is better to remain silent. Or some people are afraid of trouble and have the idea of "sweeping the snow from one's own doorstep," so everyone is indifferent to this unenthusiastic attitude. As a result, negative phenomena are becoming increasingly widespread. I think that there must be a lot of waste in every kitchen, not to mention large-scale military supply companies and similar organizations, due to a lack of so-called enthusiasm. According to newspaper reports, even in the single item of electricity, tens of thousands of watts can be saved. The president of a prominent newspaper in Tokyo personally supervised the work of the printing department and was said to have saved 10,000 yen in scrap paper as a result. There are such examples everywhere. If all 100 million people cultivate a kind of enthusiasm, whether it is for things, for people, for themselves, or for others, the benefits will be immeasurable.

Previously, some people in society often criticized those who did not give up their seats on trains or streetcars to children and the sick. Tracing back to the source, this is ultimately learned from their adults or elders. It is truly putting the cart before the horse to be unenthusiastic oneself but to demand enthusiasm from other adolescents or young people. If you want to demand enthusiasm from others, you must set an example yourself. This is the proper way.

The concept of responsibility is often mentioned in society, but the concept of responsibility does not fall from the sky. The concept of responsibility is causally related to enthusiasm. If enthusiasm surpasses the concept of responsibility, then even matters that are not within one's own responsibility will be taken on with a sense of responsibility. As a result, human affairs become more harmonious, and things in society become universally beneficial. When one is merely constrained by a sense of responsibility and lacks enthusiasm, it is like trying to operate a machine without lubricating oil, and it cannot run smoothly. Enthusiasm is the lubricating oil that makes all relationships flexible. Originally, we Japanese had a lot of this lubricating oil. It is truly a great pity that we have now lost it. We must quickly recover it, develop it, and bring it to full glory.

Today, many people's hearts are cold, and consequently their voices are also cold. When you look at their faces, they seem to be ready to quarrel. The excuse they give is that their minds are tense due to the war and they cannot change it. This kind of expression is most harmful in wartime, so it must be changed at all costs. To deal with a war of such great scale as the one we are conducting today with such a mournful ____, will only ruin things. As the ancients said, to laugh and joke in the face of life and death is the right way. To share an orange with each other, to share half a glass of wine, to exchange what we have and make up for what we lack, this is what reveals the true flavor of humanity. Today, because of the war, people wear a ____ face like a god of death from morning till night, and they will not be able to do things carefully. If we think that for the sake of our ancestors of 3,000 years, for the sake of our descendants of thousands of years, for the sake of this sacred war that is hard to come by in a thousand years, we, though ____ and insignificant, are one of 100 million compatriots, but we must all do our duty, so we should endure ____ poverty and suffering, and gladly be willing to brave fire and water. The so-called regarding death as returning home is this principle. Taking this opportunity, I want to say something frankly: there is an enthusiasm among the soldiers on the front lines and their relatives that far surpasses even the Noh play "Hachi no Ki." Recently, someone who inspected the fiercely fought battlefields of Rabaul and other areas said that there is no need to say that the army and navy are completely united as one, but even every single soldier forgets that death is imminent, and they raise high the banner of cooperation and happily share suffering. When I heard about this situation of unity and harmony between superiors and subordinates, I could not help but burst into tears of excitement. Only then are they qualified to be called Japanese. I hope that our compatriots in the home front will also follow the example of the soldiers on the front lines and restore the innocent, pure, and enthusiastic Japanese character.

### First Talking Meeting of the First Bureau Consumer Cooperative Yesterday

### Reflections on a Visit to Japan by Educational Figures in This City: The Spirit of Wartime Structure

(Central News Agency) A delegation of educators from this city recently visited Japan and witnessed firsthand the diligent service and spirited enthusiasm of the Japanese people under the wartime structure. Deeply impressed by the elevation of Japanese culture and seeking lasting peace between China and Japan, as well as the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, upon their return, they shared their observations in a symposium with Chinese and Japanese educators in this city. They reported in detail on the work of the Japanese home front under the wartime structure. Details are as follows:

Common Knowledge

(A) The Current State of the Japanese Government's Cultivation of Common Knowledge Among the People (as presented by Shen Yiren, Principal of Zhongxin No. 1 Elementary School): Libraries are established not only in national schools but also in middle schools and universities. Numerous well-equipped libraries are also established in various cities and towns, and many people use them for reading. In science museums, the rapid progress of modern science in Japan is immediately apparent. The precision of various models and experiments is particularly astonishing. History museums feature prominent descriptions of various pictorial models and artifacts, which are clearly understandable to the general public. Aviation corps and aviation parks offer rigorous training of mental strength and strict discipline. The aviation parks are richly equipped, instilling aviation knowledge in the general public with a dual emphasis on practical application and theory. Botanical and zoological gardens are well-equipped, regularly open to the public, and not profit-oriented. Large-scale radio stations are established throughout the country, broadcasting public knowledge daily. Shrines and temples are established throughout the country, and people regularly visit them to worship the true gods, demonstrating the great unifying power of the Japanese people.

Social Facilities

(B) Overview of Japanese Social Facilities (as presented by Sun Cang, Principal of Zhongzheng No. 2 Elementary School): Regarding the overview of the Japanese newspaper industry, the scale of Japanese newspaper operations is grand, with rapid and comprehensive facilities for reporting, publishing, and other aspects. All newspaper employees are advancing with the goal of serving the country through newspapers. Additionally, newspapers are also published for domestic merchants. Therefore, the state of Japanese culture can be understood like the palm of one's hand. Factories and society: The development of the Japanese chemical industry is no less than that of Europe and America. Regarding the equipment of various factories, there are welfare facilities, such as schools, hospitals, sports facilities, and cooperative stores, all for the purpose of ensuring the livelihood of factory workers. This differs from the exploitative and selfish goals of Europeans and Americans. In Japanese factories, all production is dedicated to the state, and factory workers strive to produce for the country.

Transportation and Education

(C) Overview of Transportation (as presented by Sun Renlin, Principal of Zhongxin No. 3 Elementary School): Japan has a well-developed domestic transportation system, which is convenient for the people. Subways, underwater tunnels, steam trains, elevated railways, mountain railways, cable cars, suburban trains, etc., are all quite developed, not only fast and accurate but also safe and convenient. At the same time, the people adhere to traffic order and never crowd or rush. (D) Reflections on Japanese Education (as presented by Zhang Zhongyi, Principal of Zhongxin No. 5 Elementary School): There are numerous national schools in Japan, all under a compulsory system, fully equipped with spacious playgrounds and auditoriums. In middle schools, boys and girls are not segregated. Girls' middle schools especially emphasize home economics, instilling all common knowledge about home life, teaching cooking, laundry, sewing, flower arranging, tea ceremony, and other skills. The facilities of universities and vocational schools can be described as unparalleled in society. Students studying there are exceptionally frugal. Furthermore, there are schools established to train various disabled and incomplete people. In short, the educational policy of all schools in Japan focuses primarily on spiritual education and vocational education.

National Spirit

(E) The Spirit of the Japanese People (as presented by Cai Fucheng, Principal of Zhongxin Middle School): Firstly, regarding Japanese families, in every Japanese household, regardless of gender or age, the head of the family is the center, and everyone does their best. For example, a housewife fully manages the household, and in her spare time, she studies etiquette, tea preparation, flower arranging, and other skills as essential cultivation. She also emphasizes family education and guides her children. Furthermore, she is particularly cautious when her children receive secondary education. Each household has a shrine where they worship daily, encouraging their children to carry forward the spirit of their ancestors. Every Japanese person completely dedicates their body to the state, which fully demonstrates the people's patriotic enthusiasm. Moreover, the stability of life in Japan, the perfect distribution of materials, and the people's spirit of cherishing and carefully using resources are among the best in the world. This deeply impresses one with the enormous political power of Japan, the unwavering faith of the people in the government, and the united efforts of all, working towards the successful completion of the East Asia War.

### The City Propaganda Department Held Its Tenth Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Municipal Issues

(Central News Agency) The City Propaganda Department held its tenth regular press conference at the City Hall yesterday. The questions raised by reporters from various newspapers and the answers from various agencies are recorded below:

Inferior Quality of Coal Briquettes Distributed

The Zhonghua Daily asked: The coal briquettes distributed in the third phase contain too much soil and cannot be burned. The composition of the coal briquettes distributed to users has been clearly stipulated, but the products from the coal factories are so poor. Does the authorities have appropriate measures to improve the situation? The Economic Department of the First District Office answered: The composition of the coal briquettes has been clearly stipulated by our department. However, some manufacturers may engage in illegal behavior. We are currently sending people out to investigate and supervise the production. We sincerely hope that citizens will report to our department at any time so that we can handle the matter according to the law.

Gambling Houses Will Not Be Postponed

The Xinzhongguo Daily asked: There are rumors that the ban on gambling houses in this city, which is scheduled for the end of March, will be postponed. Is this news reliable? What measures will the authorities take, or have they already made a decision? The Secretariat answered: All the rumors circulating outside are inaccurate. The government has already ordered all gambling houses to close on March 29 and will not postpone the date.

Security for Light Control

The Zhonghua Daily asked: With the implementation of permanent light control in this city, criminals will inevitably take the opportunity to act in the dark of moonless nights. What are the secret preventive measures taken by the police and Baojia authorities? The Security Section Chief of the First Police Bureau answered: 1. Since the implementation of light control on March 3, instructions have been issued to the heads of all branch bureaus to closely monitor the activities of undesirable elements. 2. Strengthen night patrols and increase the number of inspectors and field supervisors. 3. Enhance the close liaison between Baojia self-defense corps and the police. 4. Conduct regular checks of citizen certificates. 5. Maintain close liaison with relevant military and constitutional institutions. 6. The police authorities will do their best to maintain law and order, and we hope for the cooperation of the citizens. Furthermore, the Air Defense Section Chief of the First Police Bureau answered: The Electric Certificate Company is actively improving the modification of outdoor lights and will soon be able to make the light brighter than before, so the security situation will also improve at the same time.

Extortion by Police in Western Shanghai

The Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency asked: Traffic police near the Zhaofeng Garden in Western Shanghai often leave their posts without permission and extort money from passing travelers under the pretext of inquiries. Even when illegal activities are discovered, they accept bribes and let them go. The police authorities should be aware of this situation. What measures will be taken to crack down on this? The Security Section of the First Police Bureau answered: We are currently conducting a thorough investigation. If it is true, we will severely punish them. We hope that citizens will report the facts at any time.

### A Cultural Film Conference Is Scheduled to Host Students

The Zhonghua Daily and the China Film Joint Company, in order to introduce Greater East Asian culture and instill scientific knowledge, are jointly sponsoring a cultural film reception, which is co-sponsored by the Shanghai Educational Association and the Education Bureau. Preparations have been completed, and it is scheduled to be held on the 21st and 22nd of this month at the Cultural Cinema (the former Guanglu Grand Theater) on Bowuyuan Road to host students from the entire city. There will be three screenings each day. The Education Bureau will notify the schools in advance to allocate students, who will then take turns attending free of charge. It is reported that the films to be screened will focus on science and sports, and Greater East Asian newsreels and meaningful cartoon films will also be shown.

### The New Citizens' Movement Youth League Held a Symposium Yesterday to Report on Past Work and Future Plans

(Central News Agency) The Shanghai branch and the Youth City Department of the New Citizens' Movement have been established for one year. They have spared no effort in promoting the New Citizens' Movement and organizing youth inside and outside schools. Now that the New Citizens' Movement has moved from publicity to the practical phase, and youth organizations will also be extended to the general public, in order to thoroughly clarify the responsibilities borne by the citizens and complete the task, a symposium was held yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Bupu Hotel to entertain the press in this city. More than 50 people attended, including Director of the Propaganda Department and reporters from the newspaper. Mr. Ke Jinpeiwen, Chief Secretary of the Association and Executive Deputy Director of the City League, hosted the event. Mr. Xi gave a detailed report on the past work and recent plans of the association. Finally, the reporters raised the following questions: Clean Government Movement, Reporting Corruption and Hoarding, Economizing Consumption and Increasing Production, and Future New Citizens' Movement Work and Youth Organization Training. Director Xi made a speech.

### Sugar of the Eleventh Phase Must Be Delivered by a Deadline

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has completed the allocation of sugar for the eleventh phase of household distribution. Purchase certificates will be issued on March 20th and 21st. Retailers who sell distributed sugar must affix their store seal and the seal of the responsible person to the back of the above-mentioned red sales certificate. They must bring their sugar ticket fee and deposit receipt to the office to exchange for a purchase and sales certificate. They must also adjust the deposit according to the amount of sugar tickets, paying any shortfall or receiving a refund. They must pay the purchase price to the designated distribution sugar store before the 23rd and immediately deliver the goods without delay. As for the date for users in Special Group One (i.e., the former Retailers of Class B) to exchange for purchase certificates, they will be notified separately after the distribution is completed.

Short Commentary

### After Long-Term Air Defense

It has been half a month since this city implemented long-term light control. We made some suggestions at the beginning of the implementation, but abuses have been heard from time to time during the past half month, especially the intolerable actions of lawless elements taking advantage of the situation. In response to this, the real-world problems of air defense and the security authorities should pay close attention to this and quickly find ways to prevent and eliminate them.

First, criminals take advantage of the darkness to feel their way around, especially on remote roads. We have previously advocated that lights may not be used during periods of bright moonlight. However, ordinary lights should be widely used, such as setting Nanjing Road's lighting as the standard, so that other roads should uniformly apply this standard, so as to reduce the chance of criminals using the darkness.

Second, be straightforward and stipulate that pedestrians are not allowed to pass after 11 p.m. If someone must pass through, they must obtain a pass. However, the procedures for issuing passes to citizens who need to pass through temporarily due to emergencies should be simplified. The operating hours of entertainment venues should be ended earlier, such as the Golden Grand Theater changing to end at 8:30 p.m. In fact, this measure is necessary and should have been implemented earlier from the perspectives of saving electricity and adapting to wartime life.

Finally, we hope that the general public will go out less at night when there is nothing to do, to avoid many troubles. At the same time, special attention should be paid to light leakage. It is better to train one's own habits than to obey the authorities' air defense orders.

Sports

### International Cup Football Kicks Off: Northern Europe Defeats Russia; Portugal vs. Germany Today

The International Cup football match kicked off at the Jiangwan Stadium at 4 p.m. yesterday. There were also more than a thousand spectators. Because Russia faced Northern Europe, the strength of both sides was evenly matched, forming a stalemate. In the first half, Russia missed a penalty kick opportunity, which was a pity. In the second half, both sides attacked and defended, but neither side scored. As time expired, the score was 0-0. In extra time, Northern Europe's right winger, Krimi, dribbled straight into the Russian goal and finally won 1-0. In the quarter-finals, Northern Europe will meet Italy. In the two Group C matches yesterday, Zhonghua drew 1-1 with Qiaoxiao, and Sansheng defeated Hequn 3-1.

The second act of the International Cup will be held today at 4:30 p.m. at the Jiangwan Park, with Portugal facing Germany. The Portuguese team has a complete lineup today.

### The Authorities Are Actively Planning to Strengthen Guild Organizations and Authorize Them to Supervise the Buying and Selling of the Same Industry

It has been learned that the economic and food authorities are actively planning to thoroughly suppress prices and strictly crack down on profiteering. They plan to strengthen the organizational structure of guilds in various industries. For industries that are found to be lacking or have not been established, they will be ordered to establish them immediately so that they can formally exercise their powers. They will also be authorized to supervise the buying and selling of the same industry. If any failure to fulfill responsibilities or acts of harboring or other improper behaviors are discovered, they will be punished according to law.

The following individuals are not allowed to be representatives of the same industry in the guild: Individuals outside the industry. Those who have been deprived of their civil rights. Those who have committed acts that violate national law or have been sentenced for criminal offenses by a court. Those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored. Those without capacity. The following individuals shall be ordered to resign: Those who neglect their duties or shirk their responsibilities. Those who violate laws and regulations in their duties, engage in embezzlement, or engage in other serious improper behaviors, as ordered to resign by the standing committee.

In addition to planning to strengthen the organizational structure of guilds in various industries, the authorities will continue to appoint preparatory members for guilds in various industries that have not been reorganized, and set a deadline for their formal establishment. The names of the four guilds recently approved by the City Economic Bureau are as follows: Import and Export Trade Guild, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road; Timber Guild, 3rd Floor, 14 Bowuyuan Road; Local Candle Guild, 3 Sanyili, Ninghe Road, Nanshi, opening meeting today; and Handmade Cotton Tape Guild.

### The Central Bank Implements Inspection of Loans

In order to assist the government in cracking down on hoarding and suppressing prices, the Central Reserve Bank has implemented a tightening of interbank lending and has the Financial Affairs Inspection Office restrict the lending business of financial institutions, rejecting all mortgage loans for major commodities. As a result, general hoarders who use borrowed funds have become panicked and have sold their hoarded goods, causing prices to fall. It is reported that the Central Bank's tightening of interbank lending this time is a long-term measure and will not be relaxed halfway. However, interbank lending for legitimate purposes will continue to be handled in order to maintain legitimate interbank business and assist the development of industry and commerce. It is heard that the Central Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has already implemented an inspection of lending business for financial institutions that use funds to hoard goods in order to thoroughly investigate and crack down on them.

### Registration of Cotton Merchants in Various Places Will End at the End of This Month

The Cotton Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Association previously handled the registration of cotton merchants in accordance with the provisions of the Outline for the Implementation of Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton. Now that the registration has been in progress for a long time, except for the special circumstances in the two regions of Dongtai and Hede, which should be handled separately, the registration of cotton merchants in other regions will be limited to the end of this month to end the work and prevent abuses.

### The Egg Industry Guild Handles Unified Purchase and Distribution

The Shanghai District Egg Industry Guild and the Japanese Egg Industry Association are responsible for handling the unified purchase and distribution of eggs. The preparations have been completed and will be implemented starting today. The guild and the association have specially formulated measures for the unified purchase and distribution of eggs, which have been approved by the Commercial Control Association and will be implemented starting today. It is expected that the distribution of eggs in this city will gradually become smoother in the future.

### Eliminate the Three Evils

Dust · Odor · Germs

Duck down pillows and quilts, light, soft and comfortable, have long been popular at home and abroad. Many similar products on the market are beautiful in appearance but dirty in substance. When buying, please hold them to a bright place and tap them lightly, and you will see dust flying and a foul smell touching your nose. A large number of bacteria must exist. If these products are shipped overseas, they will be banned by the local government and suffer losses. Only the Guohua duck down pillows and quilts produced by our factory are guaranteed to be clean. They are extremely suitable for both domestic sales and foreign transportation.

### Diary of a True Man (2)

March 13th (Sunday) Dark.

The Sundays after the exams have ended are truly leisurely.

During self-study, Major spoke about the aviation war, especially the attacking spirit of the naval air force. Even after the bullets and fuel were exhausted, they still attacked the enemy, which was ten times larger. It is truly a model for soldiers.

Secondly, a commander must make his subordinates sincerely submit and stand on the front lines to command everything. This is the tradition of the Navy, but when it is not possible, one must also possess the personality to make subordinates willingly die for him.

April 4th (Monday) Rain then clear.

The rain that started when the supervisor checked on time seemed to be deliberately ruining the blooming cherry blossoms. In the afternoon, it cleared up suddenly, and there was scheduled education. I felt something in my heart. My step forward is also the step forward of the Imperial Navy. The path is not far, and now we must do our best.

April 15th, 6th Boat Anniversary, Clear.

Short boat race training. If there is a slight disturbance, there is no way to deal with it, and one must admit that research is insufficient and there is a lack of agility at sea. …

On the anniversary of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's disaster, we held a visit to the reference hall and sang military songs. One must know that Lieutenant Commander Sakuma was also the essence of the best from the graduates of Etajima.

April 17th (Sunday) Cloudy then rain.

Although it was Sunday morning at 0900 (Note: 9 is 9 o'clock, the navy uses a 24-hour system), we ate cakes sent by the officer candidate's dormitory at Yanghao Hall. After that, we organized our clothes and self-studied machinery. Although we study various subjects on Sunday mornings, we can go out at will in the afternoon.

(3)

April 20th (Wednesday) Cloudy.

Regular wake-up. Organize the fishing gear. 0900 Student team supervisor's instructions. Graduated from China School. Take the "Ioi" warship from Koyou (Note: Name of the pier). (Note: Started shipboard training from today) 1300 Departed. Headed all the way to Osaka.

It is very beneficial for us who have no confidence in night navigation. 0800-1000 on duty. I deeply feel that naval officers must have good eyes.

April 21st (Thursday) Clear.

On duty from 0400. The fog was heavy, and the Akashi Strait was all in the fog at Goyo. At this time, the officer on duty must have calm and thorough hands. Although there are sailors available when entering the port, the work of mooring is also quite difficult.

Docked in Osaka. In the afternoon, visited the weather museum and took a free walk.

When the pier gathered, one person was late, which is a great pity. What are the officer students thinking?

April 22nd (Destiny Day) Clear.

Docked in Osaka.

0430 Wake up and go to visit the historical sites of Kusunoki Masashige. Take the Nankai Railway car to visit the ruins of Chihaya Castle and Chihaya Shrine.

After viewing the historical sites of Kusunoki Masashige and his son, who were loyal and died for their country, their loyalty, courage, and wisdom are truly worthy of our example. I was deeply moved to find the birthplace of Kusunoki Masashige, whom I had admired for a long time. (Note: This internship lasted eight days before returning to school)

May 2nd (Monday) Rain.

The first day that No. 1 ship was not available for fleet training (Note: No. 2 and others are in charge of guidance). It is mainly necessary to have enthusiasm and spirit. However, instructions (Note: This means that senior students reprimand junior students) must have firm beliefs in their hearts. It is not possible to simply intimidate; one must first lead by example.

May 25th (Wednesday) Clear.

The naval mine textbook was lost. I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. My heart was restless, and I couldn't accomplish anything. Today I learned that it was picked up by Instructor O. I went to the instructor's office to get the textbook during self-study. I was relieved. Because of my carelessness, I troubled all my classmates, which is a great pity. What price should I pay for this crime?

May 27th Navy Day.

Training started with the departure of the general ship's boats. 0630 Returned to school. 0915, Review and instructions. After the end, the memorial ceremony. Visit the memorial tablet in the reference hall.

1100, Outing inspection.

May 30th (Monday, Sun) Rain.

Although there was a planned small arms shooting competition, we waited for the sunny weather, but it never stopped. There were only two classes in the afternoon.

Today is the birthday of Marshal Togo. When visiting the reference hall and looking up to the great predecessors of the saint generals, I deeply felt the great responsibility of the navy in this extraordinary time.

June 3rd (Friday) Clear.

Practical navigation on the "Nara". Weather measurement, pressure has already occurred. In nighttime weather measurements, because the horizon is about to disappear, it must be done quickly. On a busy ship, it is especially necessary to concentrate.

### After the Latter Regulations

— Xue Tian

Recently, I read in the newspaper that Hou Dachun, the former director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and Hu Zheng, the director of the Aquatic Products Administration of the Food Department and the director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, were found to have committed serious corruption during the purchase of military food during the war. After being explicitly dismissed from their positions by the National Government and handed over to a special court for trial, the trial has ended. Both criminals have confessed their guilt and have been sentenced to death. It is said that this case was reported by the Suzhou Allied Military Police, and thus brought to justice. The general public was greatly pleased to read this news. Is this what is meant by "the people of the country all say they should be killed"?

Hou and Hu, relying on the power of the government, engaged in such self-serving and corrupt activities, creating the current era of soaring prices and difficult food supply for the people. Although Hou and Hu have been brought to justice, there are probably many other corrupt officials like Hou and Hu. How can we ensure that they are all like the Suzhou Allied Military Police, who can report them without regard to personal feelings and bring them all to justice?

Furthermore, after the incident occurred, the so-called "profiteers of national crisis" made tens of thousands or even tens of millions of dollars, and such cases are common. These "nouveau riche" all used illegal means to obtain wealth. In principle, they should also be reported and punished as they deserve. I deeply hope that the National Government will take the punishment of corrupt officials as the starting point for creating a clean government and implement wartime price countermeasures. On the one hand, it should encourage reporting or denunciation, and if there is solid evidence, it must punish severely according to the law without regard to personal feelings. Then the people will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!
