### The War Situation Enters a Critical Stage: Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Resolve to Strive for Victory with an Active and Decisive Spirit

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) After the cabinet reshuffle, the first regular cabinet meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Prime Minister Tojo, Finance Minister Ishiwata, Agriculture Minister Uchida, Transportation Minister Goto, and all other cabinet members attended. Prime Minister Tojo reported on the recent replacement of the three key ministers and the close coordination measures taken between national affairs and supreme command. He then expressed the government's significant determination to address the current tense war situation. The cabinet members exchanged opinions until the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) Following the cabinet reshuffle on the 19th, Japan implemented measures on the 21st to strengthen the coordination between the supreme command and the government, aiming to achieve complete unity in political and military affairs and establish a decisive battle posture. During the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, Prime Minister Tojo expressed his determination to actively implement policies and achieve political and military objectives. The gist of his statement is as follows: Today's war situation is extremely critical. The enemy has already attacked the Marshall Islands and subsequently air-raided Truk. We anticipated the enemy's counter-offensive. The current war situation is indeed profound and difficult to be optimistic about. We must overcome this stage to pave the way for certain victory. Therefore, today marks a critical moment for the empire's survival. At this juncture, we must further strengthen the coordination between supreme command and national affairs. In operations, we must resolutely implement strategic and tactical measures. In national affairs, we must concentrate all the nation's material and human resources to defeat Britain and the United States, ensuring that there are no worries in the rear during operations. This is the key to securing the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. The supreme command has grasped the current war opportunities and is striving for sound planning and courageous fighting to achieve certain victory. The government is also taking today as a turning point and is determined to overcome all difficulties to meet the demands of the war. Today marks a defining moment in completing the Greater East Asia War. We can only realize this resolution today. Any past shortcomings should be rectified to strive for victory. We should start anew, regardless of any praise or criticism, and exert all our strength to achieve success. I hope that all of you, in implementing your respective administrative duties, will not be swayed by past inertia and regulations, and will adopt decisive measures. Because in the current stage of the war, if national strength does not directly contribute to the completion of the war, it will leave regrets for millennia. We will have no way to answer to the Emperor, let alone face our ancestors or descendants. I have carefully considered the policy for dealing with this significant situation and am rapidly studying its specific methods. I hope that you will thoroughly cooperate in this regard. Indeed, at this moment, our active and decisive spirit is the key to public service. To cope with the ever-changing war situation and achieve our intended goals, the responsibility of our commanders at all levels can be summarized in the four characters 'active and decisive.' This is by no means an overstatement. At this time of crisis, subordinates are paying close attention to the attitude of their commanders. The commander's strong determination and ability to make timely decisions are more crucial than ever. In short, Japan is now facing a critical war situation that will determine its rise or fall, and we are taking today's measures as a turning point. We have made a great and courageous resolution, and there must be a way to overcome the difficulties. I now share with you my determination to achieve certain victory and pledge to repay the country with my life. By ensuring the mutual consistency of political and military strategies and thoroughly implementing active and decisive policies, we can achieve the Emperor's great undertaking and ensure the stability of the nation.

### Resentment of British Troops by Chongqing Troops in India Increases

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Chongqing troops stationed in India are increasingly resentful of the tyranny of the British and American troops. Recently, Chongqing seems to be quite concerned about this. It is reported that Chongqing recently dispatched Xiong Shihui, Zhang Zhizhong, and Xu Yongchang to the border region of India and Burma to investigate the actual situation of the problem and seek a solution. Xiong Shihui and the other two have recently returned to Chongqing and reported the results of their investigation. It is said that: 1. There is a complete lack of communication between the middle-level officers of the British and Chongqing troops, and there is a lack of mutual understanding. 2. Due to the lack of aircraft, the cooperation between the army and the air force cannot be promoted, and the British and American air forces have not provided assistance to the Chongqing troops. 3. The relationship between the Chongqing troops and the residents is bad, and the relationship with the Indian army is also not harmonious. Therefore, both the Indian and Chongqing troops are considering leaving India.

### Editorial: Review of the Burma-India Operations

The long-dormant Burma-India border has, under the brave and resolute actions of the Japanese army, routed the British-Indian forces that were eyeing the border, and is now making steady progress. At this time of tension in the Southwest Pacific war situation, why did the Japanese army again point its sword at Burma-India? The reasons are no more than the following:

Britain and the United States have abandoned their advocacy of "Europe First" as the center of the war and have entered the "central breakthrough" decisive battle stage in the Pacific. The Chongqing British forces want to take advantage of the troubled times in the Southwest Pacific to counterattack Burma and restore the main blood transfusion route, so the Japanese army has risen up to strike first to制敌.

Burma is the outpost of Shonan Island (Singapore), and Shonan Island is the gateway to the South Seas Islands, so ensuring Burma is to consolidate the South Seas Islands.

The Indian National Army led by Mr. Bose can take this opportunity to take further action to promote the All-India national movement, so that the Indian people can rise up to drive out the British ruling forces, get rid of the shackles of British colonial policy for a hundred years, and seek independence and autonomy to restore East Asia's East Asia.

Now let's further study the above three points. First, the recent change in the British and American war strategy, taking a political offensive in Europe and a "central breakthrough" offensive in the Pacific, is very obvious. In the European continent, Britain and the United States are trying their best to win over neutral countries. The purpose is not only to make Germany fall into isolation militarily, but also because they do not want the Soviet Union to become too powerful, so they advocate a temporary second front, which is long overdue. In East Asia, given the rapid progress in Japan's military industry production, if they continue to miss the opportunity, they will be unable to recover. Therefore, they do not hesitate to take a desperate gamble and launch a risky counterattack in the Southwest Pacific and the Burma-India border, hoping to achieve the effect of a "central breakthrough" with indirect attacks.

Second, the South Seas Islands are a treasure trove of military resources, and Shonan Island is the throat of the South Seas Islands. Burma-India is the shield of Shonan Island. If the merchant army wants to regain the South Seas Islands, the military resource treasure house, then Burma is a must-争之地. Today, the Japanese army does not wait for the actions of the British-Indian forces and strikes first to defeat the enemy, giving the enemy who covets public reason a great blow.

Third, since India was ruled by Britain in 1857, its national pioneers have been constantly resisting and struggling. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Indian patriots have risen up to fight for the freedom of their motherland, forming the Indian National Army, with Delhi as the ultimate goal of attack. The call for national independence and autonomy can respond to the whole city, developing into a national salvation movement like a raging fire, shocking the British ruling forces, and is the greatest effect of the Burma-India operations.

### Fierce Battle at Nettuno: Thousands of Cannons Firing Simultaneously

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: The battle for the Nettuno bridgehead resumed on Sunday with intense fighting. Before the British forces launched an infantry attack on the German lines, thousands of cannons fired simultaneously, sounding like thunder, for several hours. The enemy's main objective was to seize the area south of Aprilia occupied by German grenadiers. The enemy broke into the German defense system in one place, but the German forces immediately launched a counterattack under the cover of tanks and, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, drove them out. Due to the strong British and American forces, the German losses were also very heavy. British and American air forces were most active in the south of Aprilia in the morning, while German air forces constantly attacked the unloading areas along the coast and the artillery positions of the British and American forces, causing many fires.

### Street Fighting in Krivoy Rog: German Retreat

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) The German News Agency quoted the official German war report as stating that advanced units engaged in fierce street fighting in Krivoy Rog. Soviet offensives east of Svenigorodka, south of Heshkov, and northeast of Rochev were repulsed. Soviet offensives north of Velikiye Luki were also ineffective. After destroying all military-specific equipment, German forces withdrew from Kholm, which had become a wasteland, in order to carry out a planned withdrawal movement.

He also absolutely did not guarantee that the European war would end this year. It is said that he did not even mention such hope on this point.

### Major Air Raid on London: Incendiary Bombs Rained Down

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) The German Air Force again carried out a major bombing of London on the night of the 20th. According to reports from Berlin, German aircraft teams invaded London airspace from the east and southeast in two waves, carrying out a concentrated bombing, dropping thousands of bombs and hundreds of thousands of incendiary bombs on important targets in the city. London sources also admitted that many factory facilities were destroyed and suffered heavy damage. The German aircraft seemed to have adopted new tactics in this air raid, and the British anti-aircraft guns were almost ineffective.

### Mussolini's Visit: His Spirit Remains the Same as Before

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency reports: A reporter from "People's Observer" who visited Mussolini in northern Italy stated that Mussolini spoke in a very low voice, almost a whisper, only when talking about the problem of Italian reconstruction, did he raise his voice, assisted by gestures and a rising and falling tone. His eyes were bright and his spirit was radiant. His demeanor as an orator reappeared before his eyes, and his appearance was also upright and lively. The office in Mussolini's headquarters is not as large as the hall of the Venice Palace and is very small. He greets guests graciously.

### Japanese Army in Burma Strikes First

The war situation in the South Pacific, such as the battles of Rabaul and the Marshall Islands, is becoming increasingly fierce. While concentrating the attention of the people of the country, the Japanese army in Burma launched a bold and unannounced attack on the British-Indian forces moving in the area of Arakan, and the Indian National Army assisted the Japanese army, and the military advance was like a hot knife through butter.

In response to the counterattack in the South Pacific, the British-Indian forces under Mountbatten must quickly take action in the Indian Ocean and Burma in order to disperse the Japanese forces and achieve the effect of a pincer attack. This is what the Allied countries have been vehemently demanding, with even public criticism of Mountbatten's timidity. Under these circumstances, 500,000 British-Indian troops are stationed in India, and the Chongqing army is continuously reinforcing them. The first-line air force, British and American combined, reaches more than a thousand aircraft, plus the main force of the British Mediterranean Fleet, centered on Ceylon, is gathered at sea, watching with tigerish eyes, and the war opportunity is about to break out. Judging from the recent actions of the British-Indian forces in the area of Buthidaung and Arakan, the war opportunity is imminent. How can the Japanese army sit idly by and watch this significant opportunity? Therefore, they struck with the speed of lightning, catching the enemy unprepared and inflicting a painful blow. Considering that since the Nu River operation last autumn, the Japanese army has always been swift in the several battles in Burma, seizing the initiative to制敌. Now that the enemy is calling for a pincer attack in both the Pacific and Burma, they are taking the initiative to制敌. This operation is significant for the increasingly fierce Pacific war and the overall situation, which does not need to be reiterated. We are deeply pleased with the good news released by the Supreme Headquarters, and at the same time, we pray incessantly for the enthusiastic and vigorous fighting of the Indian National Army that participated in this cooperative operation. (Wei An: From the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun editorial, February 9th)

### General Attack by Anglo-Indian Troops Against Burma from Germany

To strike first is the key to all wars. The Japanese Burma Expeditionary Force recently launched a preemptive general offensive, coordinating air and ground forces, against the elite Anglo-Indian forces in Akyab, southern Burma, who were launching counter-offensives. They have achieved successive victories, including the encirclement of enemy units and the cutting off of their rear supply lines. The General Headquarters has also announced that the campaign is proceeding smoothly. This is as swift as the preemptive operations in the Nu River basin last winter and the tragedy in the Arakan Mountains, which raises high expectations among the people.

According to our triumphant reports, the campaign is being assisted by the Indian National Army led by Bose, which is advancing towards the Indian border. Bose has stated that the Indian National Army has begun operations according to plan, with the determination to "fulfill the solemn oath to liberate the motherland." Although the future of this campaign is undoubtedly difficult, in the struggle for the Burmese-Indian border, the Japanese army can be said to have gained the advantage of timing, terrain, and popular support. Behind the Japanese army, a high tide of national liberation is rising. Burma has now broken free from the shackles of British power, and the entire nation is devoted to the great task of nation-building. Therefore, the Indian National Army, the armed fighters for Indian national liberation, are standing up for the Burmese people who are embarking on the great cause of independent nation-building, and the Japanese army, which is raising the banner of Greater East Asia liberation. In this endeavor, it can be said that they have launched a united front of East Asian peoples.

On the enemy side, the British, American, and Chongqing armies have different operational goals and are acting independently, pursuing their own selfish interests. Recently, the American forces in India have been planning to mobilize the British and Chongqing armies to respond to the Pacific front and serve as the front line against Japan. However, the British army, the main force on the Indian border, only pays lip service to an offensive against Japan, while focusing on strengthening the defense of India and regaining Burma. As for the Chongqing army, it only seeks to reopen the Burma Road and promote British and American aid, and has no other demands. It is only natural that the British, American, and Chongqing armies, who are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, are eager to compete for command and even engage in mutual attacks, which is truly chilling. Furthermore, what is the current situation in India? Under the guise of wartime, Britain is extracting as much as possible. Rampant inflation, famine, and epidemics are causing millions of Indians to lose their lives. Since the beginning of the war, Britain's repressive policies, such as the imprisonment of national movement leaders and the violent suppression of popular movements, have temporarily prevented the rise of the Indian people. However, by basing its war efforts on the extreme exploitation of Indian land, population, and resources, the end of its rule over India is probably not far off.

The state of conflicting interests among the enemy forces is not unique to the Burmese-Indian front. We should frankly admit that although the enemy forces have conflicting interests, they are united in their opposition to Japan. Moreover, the battle on the Burmese-Indian border is not only a battle for the defense of Burma, but also part of the overall counter-offensive against Japan. Concurrent with the European war, the desire of Britain and the United States to hold a decisive battle in Cambodia this year can be seen in their strategies towards the Soviet Union and Chongqing, short-term military theories, and the desperate situation of domestic and foreign politics. The Anglo-Indian forces, which have been maneuvering for a long time since last autumn, will undoubtedly launch a full-scale counter-offensive in conjunction with the American and Chongqing armies. The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War is imminent. To strike first is not only the iron rule of the battlefield, but also of the rear. All of our people must realize that today is a crucial turning point in the decisive battle and work together. (Translated by An'an from the editorial of the Asahi Shimbun on February 10.)

### The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Convenes a Price Liaison Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday and Decides on Several Major Cases to Curb Prices

A Central News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, recognizing that the recent surge in prices has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, urgently needs to invite economic administrative authorities from the central and local governments, as well as commercial organizations, to conduct detailed research and decide on countermeasures. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, it convened a price liaison meeting at the Duchen Hotel on Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, bringing together the directors of economic bureaus from various regions, the presidents of chambers of commerce, and the chairmen of the commercial control commissions, rice control commissions, cotton control commissions, and various industry associations. The meeting was chaired by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who delivered an opening speech, clarifying the significance and purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, the directors of economic bureaus from various regions reported on the economic and price situations in their respective areas. The attendees discussed and studied major cases to curb prices until about 6:00 p.m., when the meeting adjourned. During the meeting, Minister Chen expressed his deep encouragement to the directors, chairmen, and representatives of other units, and declared his determination to handle the situation. The details are recorded as follows:

Attendees

In addition to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the heads of the ministry's agencies stationed in Shanghai, the attendees included Lin Dazhong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Nanjing Special Municipality; Chen Shushou, Director of the Economic Bureau of Jiangsu Province; Yu Yu, Director of the Economic Bureau of Zhejiang Province; Cai Wenshi, Director of the Economic Bureau of Hubei Province; Guan Chengbin, Director of the Economic Bureau of Qinghai Province; Wang Hanzhang, Director of the Economic Bureau of Anhui Province; Xu Tianshen, Director of the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Xing Jianquan, President of the Xuzhou Chamber of Commerce; Pan Ziqi, President of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce; Wang Wuquan, President of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce; Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, representing the city government; Su Chengde, Director of the First District Police Bureau (represented by Yao Shuyi); Zhang Yuzhai, representing the Second Police Bureau; Feng You of the Economic Department of the First District Office; Ji Hua, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau; Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce; Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Commission (represented by Luo Nazhai); Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee (represented by Shan Zhe); Chen Ziyi of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee; Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Cotton Control Commission; and over 50 chairmen of various industry associations.

Discussion Results

It was generally agreed that the current soaring prices are not due to actual supply and demand or the inevitable trend of rising costs, but rather to artificial causes such as manipulation. In order to suppress prices, in addition to addressing the root causes, such as increasing production and unblocking sources, which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is striving to do, as a temporary measure, the "Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management" promulgated by the National Government and its implementation measures should be strictly enforced and implemented immediately by the economic administrative bureaus of various regions.

Price Control Measures

The prices of daily necessities should be quickly assessed in accordance with the regulations, and the prices limited to those before January of this year should be strictly enforced as the highest standard. To ensure the effective enforcement of price limits and the crackdown on the black market, the police, commercial organizations, and the public should be mobilized simultaneously to work together. The price management agencies should be strengthened and unified as soon as possible. Those who privately raise prices should be severely punished, and those who hoard, speculate, and manipulate profits should be punished in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Hoarding" and the "Special Criminal Law in Wartime." Industry associations should strengthen supervision of members who privately raise prices, and economic administrative agencies should punish those who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. Efforts should be made to unblock sources and increase the distribution of supplies in various regions.

After the Oil and Grain Professional Committee reported on the recent purchasing situation, it was resolved that the Rice Control Commission's proposal for allocating glutinous rice to tea snacks, pastries, and rice merchants would be referred to the Rice Control Commission and the Rice Adjustment Committee for research. In the future, the emphasis of allocation will be on the glutinous rice for 粢饭 (ci fan, a popular breakfast food) industry because it is a staple for a portion of the population.

Master Ku Qi Purchases Extensively for Scholarships

Starting on the 15th of this month, Tianshangtang held an exhibition of paintings and antiques at the Chinese Painting Academy, and designated valuable items to donate a percentage of the sales price to scholarships. The results have been excellent since the opening. The exhibition closed on the previous day (21st). Mr. Jin Kequan, the owner of the gallery, wrote in a letter: "This time, we entrusted the Chinese Painting Academy to host the calligraphy and painting exhibition, and designated items to donate a percentage of the sales price to scholarships. With the dedicated efforts of our friend Mr. Chen Zhiwei, we invited Master Ku Qi to the event, who purchased paintings worth 89,000 yuan for student loans, and another 12 ordinary items worth 78,800 yuan. According to the original agreement, one-quarter of the designated scholarship amount, totaling 22,200 yuan, will be contributed. However, according to Master Ku Qi's wishes, 60,000 yuan will be contributed from the sale of scholarship items and 20,000 yuan from the ordinary items, totaling 80,000 yuan. Considering that this is for the cultivation of national talent, I readily agreed. It is estimated that 40,000 yuan each will be distributed to Shen Bao and Xin Bao for scholarships and student loans. With the support of the Chinese Painting Academy, all commission fees for the 80,000 yuan in scholarships and student loans are waived. We will send another letter to inform you once the fees have been collected. I am writing to you in advance."

Short Commentary

### Implement Thoroughly

The Price Liaison Meeting convened in Shanghai by the authorities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce concluded that "the current soaring prices are not due to supply and demand or the inevitable trend of rising costs, but rather to artificial causes such as manipulation. In addition to addressing the root causes, such as increasing production and unblocking sources, which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is striving to do, as a temporary measure, the Wartime Price Management Regulations and its implementation methods should be strictly enforced by the economic administrative bureaus of various regions immediately." Yesterday, we suggested "overall planning of both root and branch." We pointed out that the institutions and methods for managing prices in the past were not incomplete or inadequate, but the failure to achieve results was due to "ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation." Now the meeting has concluded that the Ministry will "strive to carry out" the root-cause solutions of increasing production and unblocking sources, and the economic and administrative authorities of various regions will "strictly enforce" the Wartime Price Management Regulations and implementation methods. We earnestly hope that authorities at all levels will thoroughly achieve "striving to carry out" and "strictly enforce," so that the mistakes of the past, which led to the chaotic situation of soaring prices due to "ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation," will not be repeated in the future. The price control measures stipulated in this meeting must be "thoroughly implemented," especially those who privately raise prices and hoard goods for speculation must be severely punished in accordance with the special provisions for wartime punishment. Prices are a matter of vital concern to the people, so everyone must pay close attention to the revival of hoarding and speculation, report and curb it as soon as possible to prevent it from spreading.

### Regarding the Resignation of Director Nie of the Cotton Management Office, the Commercial Control Commission Responds with a Letter Expressing Its Views

Nie Lusheng, Director of the Cotton Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission, submitted his resignation to the commission. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Commercial Control Commission to inquire about the truth. According to the person in charge of the commission, after receiving Director Nie's resignation letter, Chairman Tang immediately sent Zhang Enhong, Director of the Finance Department, to visit Mr. Nie as a representative to inquire about the true meaning of the resignation. He was unable to meet him, so he inquired about everything in detail in writing. Because it was an internal matter, there was no need to make it public. Since it has been disclosed in the newspaper yesterday, we can only provide you with the Commercial Control Commission's response to Director Nie for your review. The full text of the letter is as follows: In response, I received your letter yesterday and learned of your decision to withdraw. I was very surprised after reading it. Although we have only recently met, the government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cloth this time and entrusted our commission to handle it on its behalf. At the beginning of the establishment, it was stipulated that it should be managed by the industry. Because you are the chairman of the Cotton Products Association, you were invited to take charge of the purchase work, and you resolutely came forward to accept it, for which I am very grateful. For the past half year, all administrative affairs have been managed by you. Although letters of inquiry and criticism from outside have arrived one after another, because they were not signed, they were all burned. I have repeatedly informed you, and you have repeatedly stated that you would never shirk your responsibility until the purchase work was completely completed. Therefore, in addition to admiration, I have tried every means to designate important members of our commission to assist in the sorting out of the past chaos. I am also grateful for your repeated expressions of gratitude for this sincere maintenance. I privately believed that cooperation would lead to a satisfactory conclusion. Now, you have suddenly sent a letter proposing your resignation without any prior discussion. What is the meaning of this? It is difficult to understand. I entrusted Director Zhang Zanong of the Finance Department to visit you as a representative, but you refused to meet him, leaving me confused. Now, I will answer the points you raised in your letter separately: The establishment of the committee is entirely to deal with the chaos in the purchase work. More than 3,000 letters have come from outside operators, and some of them cannot be resolved. Therefore, I discussed it with you and invited important personnel from our commission to participate in the assistance. Each person has their own task in their official capacity. Who would want to add more work? However, because they were designated and because of my friendship with you, and also because the commission and the office were difficult to manage, they worked day and night, and did not hesitate to work hard. You should feel grateful for this and should not misunderstand. I have also explained it to you in detail many times. As for the inspection work you mentioned in your letter, it is being handled in an orderly manner. This is indeed a misunderstanding. Inspection should be carried out in a proper order and with priority. We have clearly notified you that the cloths to be inspected are those that can be prepared for this temporary allocation, and the Cloth Industry Association has already submitted a request for this. Our commission has already forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for approval. Before the approval is received, the inspection should be temporarily delayed, and there is no other intention. The number of cloths that should be inspected still accounts for more than half of the total. How can you say that there is no inspection work? This is very clear. As for the more than 100 deposit slips that you mentioned have been processed, but the merchants have not come to collect them, merchants are eager to receive the deposit slips in order to turnover funds. If they have been processed, they should be promptly notified to collect them. This is a responsibility that our commission should bear, and it is definitely not enough to say that it is completed with only a little more than 100 copies. This is also a very obvious fact. As for the allocation affairs you mentioned that have been assigned to Deputy Directors Sun and Honda, I have discussed this matter with you in advance and stated that they are still responsible for the allocation under the supervision of the director, with the sole intention of relieving you of your burden and enabling you to handle the purchase conclusion work. Because the conclusion work has begun, it is stipulated that all external documents must be finally reviewed by you, and I will make the final judgment. The division of powers and responsibilities is clear, and all the regulations are in place. There is no falsehood. How can you say that the deputy directors are handling the allocation, and the conclusion is being handled by the committee, so you have nothing to do? This is a misunderstanding on your part. Now the purchase conclusion work is about to begin, and the allocation problem is also very complex. I am deeply relying on you. You have decades of experience as an operator and have a certain status in society. I rely on you to assist me. Unexpectedly, you suddenly disregarded everything, turned away, and left all the unfinished responsibilities and unhanded them over to me alone. It is difficult to understand both publicly and privately. Is it possible that I have offended you in some way, or that I have behaved improperly and you are ashamed to associate with me? We have been together for several months, and our friendship is not superficial. I cannot help but venture to express my words, hoping you can explain the matter to me. This is addressed to Director Nie of the Cotton Management Office, Chairman of the Board, and I implore you to enlighten me. Sincerely, The Cotton Industry Management Commission. 19th of February, 33rd year of the Republic of China.
