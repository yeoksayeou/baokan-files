### Wartime Official Discipline and Certain Reward and Punishment

Japan decided in February to strengthen its national posture to meet the urgent needs of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. One of the most important practical steps is "Administrative Operation Decisive Battle." In order to further rectify official discipline, it took necessary measures. Therefore, the cabinet formally decided on four imperial ordinances in a meeting on December 21 last year and announced them on January 4 this year. It stipulated that they would be implemented immediately to strengthen the system of certain reward and punishment, strengthen the domestic decisive battle base, and complete the Greater East Asia War. These four imperial ordinances include: Wartime Civil Service Order, Special Wartime Exceptions for Civil Service Disciplinary Actions, Special Exceptions for Appointment of Various Officials in Times of Danger or Retirement, and Special Wartime Exceptions for Disciplinary Actions for Police and Rescue Team Members. (See page 2 of today's Japan newspaper) To sum up, the main purpose of these four imperial ordinances is to reiterate the spirit of certain reward and punishment for wartime officials. Therefore, the core can be said to be the Wartime Civil Service Order. These imperial ordinances clearly indicate the specific matters that wartime officials should diligently practice, and clearly stipulate the practical methods of punishing crimes and rewarding merits. Although they are all determined based on the current internal and external situation of the allied country Japan, they are not without reference and application significance for the government's public officials today.

Since the National Government returned to its capital, what the government has sought is nothing more than the restoration and security of public order in the peace zone, especially the political track. Since the war, our country's responsibility for completing the Greater East Asia War has become more arduous. Just as we have always tirelessly advocated, whether it is to demand the practical fulfillment of the obligation to participate in the war, or to demand the realization of a new unified situation, the only prerequisite is to demand that politics be on the right track, to demand that politics have a solution, which is to improve political efficiency. Because only when these requirements are realized politically, can we ensure public order and cooperate with the United States and Britain in the war, and economically increase production to ensure the livelihood of the people and assist the allied countries. However, the realization of these political requirements, or the complete establishment of the wartime political system and the thorough implementation of all wartime policy programs, in our China, "we are not worried about the lack of governance methods, but worried about the lack of governance personnel," so we should pay special attention to carefully selecting the virtuous and capable, rectifying official discipline, and strengthening the system of certain reward and punishment. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the content of the Japanese government's imperial ordinance on rectifying official discipline.

In the four Japanese imperial ordinances on rectifying official discipline this time, the seven admonitions for wartime officials that must be practiced wholeheartedly are clearly stipulated. What is particularly worthy of attention by government leaders and general public officials is the third item: In wartime, officials should especially show their subordinates the direction they should take and lead by example. The fifth item: In wartime, officials should observe public sentiment with special care and strive to be sincere, affectionate, and responsible. And the sixth item: In wartime, officials should pay special attention to integrity, cultivate themselves and manage their families, take the lead in setting an example, and strive to be a model for society. This fully demonstrates that wartime officials must especially understand the people's hardships, respect public opinion, and be especially honest; they must lead by example in everything, which are the prerequisites for the political improvement of the National Government that we have repeatedly suggested. In addition, how should particularly severe punishments be given to those who violate wartime official discipline, and how should special preferential rewards be given to those who faithfully abide by official discipline and thus suffer illness, ruin their families, or even sacrifice their lives? These are all urgent matters that need to be clearly stipulated in our country.

"If the name is not correct, then the words will not be smooth; if the words are not smooth, then things will not be done." We admire the new imperial ordinance of the Japanese government to strengthen the system of certain reward and punishment, and we sincerely expect the government authorities to further consider the actual situation in our country today, clearly stipulate the service rules for wartime officials and resolutely implement the system of certain reward and punishment, clarify right and wrong, respect public opinion, recruit true talents, and improve politics, and then be able to fulfill the mission of participating in the war and building the country.

### Full Text of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo delivered a policy speech at the reopening of the 84th session of the Parliament on the 21st. The original text is recorded as follows. At the opening ceremony of the previous parliament, I was honored to receive a special edict from His Majesty the Emperor, which I am deeply grateful and afraid of. I sincerely wish to serve with you under the holy decree, and to complete the heavy responsibilities under the decisive battle with all our strength, and to quickly achieve the purpose of the war, so as to reassure the Emperor. Looking back on the two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army, under the majesty of the Emperor, have fought bravely and continuously. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers fighting on the front line, express my condolences to the fallen warriors, express my sincere sympathy to their bereaved families, and wish the wounded soldiers and soldiers a speedy recovery. Finally, I would like to express my deep respect to the people who continue to work hard in the rear to win the victory. Looking at the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy's counterattack has recently become more intense. Although they have been repeatedly hit hard, they rely on their abundant resources and gradually advance their bases, and attack our maritime transportation lines, trying to affect our maritime transportation. Our front-line officers and soldiers are making use of the strategic advantages gained in previous battles to continue to fight and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Especially the great and glorious results recently obtained in the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and various aspects of China are rare in the history of war. This is not known to the British and American people, who are blinded by their leaders. It is worth noting that the enemy's heavy losses in manpower.

Japan is Vigorously Increasing Aircraft Production

Our Imperial Army officers and soldiers can kill ten enemies with one, so the challenge of the British and American armies is no different from moths flying into the fire. Their future will inevitably be full of darkness, and their future will only be the final failure. Now our 100 million people have responded to the struggle of the front-line officers and soldiers and have risen up together. Our students have gone to war, and the conscription age has been lowered. This has been implemented in various warring countries for a long time, but it is only being implemented in the Empire at present. All of this proves that the Empire is superior to Britain and the United States in mobilization, and shows the Empire's determination to defeat Britain and the United States. In terms of combat power, just to enhance air combat power, we have overcome various internal difficulties and implemented vigorous production increase. The numbers show a leaping increase. The current production status has increased more than twice compared to last year. On November 1 last year, the Ministry of Munitions was established, and on January 15 of this year, the army and navy authorities took over all matters related to aircraft production. At this point, the Ministry of Munitions will officially and fully exert its functions, and the aircraft production mechanism will tend to be strengthened. Therefore, it is expected that aircraft production can be increased several times in the future, and its future is especially promising. The government, in view of the requirements of the war, deeply feels the need to further improve the aviation industry. Our iron and steel industry has broken through the world standard in a very short period of time, showing its world's highest technology and efficiency. Therefore, today, if we fully apply our outstanding qualities to the aircraft industry, there is greater hope for a leaping increase in aircraft production. The government has decided to enhance aircraft combat power based on this conviction, referring to the results of administrative inspections, and constantly studying with the people to meet the needs of the front line.

Britain and the United States are Trying to Settle the Situation Quickly

Recently, the enemy has adopted a war strategy in the South Pacific that disregards major sacrifices and insists on challenging. From this strategic point of view, we know that Britain and the United States, especially the United States, although loudly proclaiming a long-term war, are eager to end the war as soon as possible. This is due to their unfavorable war and the excessive length of the supply line, which makes their situation difficult. The reason is that the military production that the United States relies on has reached its peak, and the problems of materials and labor have made their anxiety increasingly deep. Britain, on the other hand, has been exhausted due to the depletion of its combat power. On the other hand, the Empire has sufficient time, so the strategic strongholds are more solid. The resources in the south are also rapidly becoming combat power, and the unity of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia is becoming stronger. The superior position of the Empire is difficult for them to shake in any way, which is what they fear most. The leaders of Britain and the United States have started an unjust war, forcing the people into the abyss of war suffering. Now, they are forced to cover up the truth and maintain face in the face of the increasing suffering and dissatisfaction of the people, so they have to resort to inhumane atrocities. The interests of their allied countries are not consistent, and there are many contradictions. Therefore, they want to settle the situation as soon as possible before they fall into an irredeemable situation, which is a natural thing.

The Domestic System is Becoming Decisive Battle

Today, the enemy is anxious, which is a rare opportunity for us to thoroughly defeat the enemy. The Empire has always calmly dealt with the war situation and used this opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. For example, in the six naval battles off the coast of Bougainville Island and the four naval battles off the coast of Kiska Island, the enemy suffered heavy losses. This is a fatal blow to the United States, which is rich in resources. It is unimaginable. Moreover, tens of thousands of enemy troops were buried in the belly of fish in a very short period of time. It is self-evident how deeply this affected the American people. The enemy's leaders were forced to cover up this fact. In the meantime, the Imperial Army intercepted the enemy and showed its great power, and did not miss the opportunity to prepare for future offensives. The rear area enhanced combat power, especially aircraft combat power. At the same time, we should prepare to implement a long-term war in both material and psychological aspects. The so-called long-term war should be equipped with a strong and durable system internally, and externally equipped with a powerful offensive that can strike the enemy anytime and anywhere. In short, the key to future operations is to use the opportunity of the enemy's general counterattack to destroy the enemy's combat power, while strengthening our combat power (especially aircraft combat power), consolidating the momentum of the long-term war in both material and psychological aspects, and further turning defense into offense to make the enemy surrender. In order to promote domestic decisive battle measures, the government has taken various measures since last autumn based on the above-mentioned operational essentials to make the domestic system become decisive battle.

### The Japanese Government's Key Policy Focus in the Future is to Devote All Efforts to Win the Victory

Now I will report on the key policy focus that the government will focus on in the future. Today, whether we can quickly supply the front line with excellent aircraft is the key to determining the current war situation and the victory or defeat of this war. Therefore, rapidly producing a large number of aircraft is an absolute requirement to enhance combat power. This is not easy, but we must complete it to win. As mentioned earlier, the government will work with the people to complete this task with firm conviction. To enhance combat power, especially to enhance air combat power, in addition to increasing iron, light metals, coal, and other important resources, strengthening the National Labor Movement and ensuring sea and land transportation capacity are also fundamental requirements. Regarding the increased production of essential materials, the government has devoted all its efforts to achieve it under the increasing production plan in order to meet the requirements of the war, so as to avoid any regrets. Regarding the strengthening of the National Labor Movement, the government is taking all measures in terms of increasing the quantity (that is, increasing the number of people) and improving the quality (that is, improving production efficiency). Regarding increasing the quantity, the National Mobilization System has been strengthened, and the burden on the people has been increased. This has also had a significant impact on the people's lives, but the government has taken this measure to meet the harsh war situation in the future. I am sure that the people will be happy to accept the country's urgent demands. Regarding improving the quality, I believe that there is still room for improvement and improvement in all aspects. The government is determined to guide it, and I hope that the responsible persons in all aspects will redouble their efforts to study so as to avoid any regrets. As for ensuring and improving sea and land transportation capacity, the losses suffered by sea transportation today are difficult to ignore. Therefore, we should strengthen the protection of the sea and air and strive to reduce the loss of ships. The government will take urgent measures to solve the problems of the efficiency of transport ship crews loading and unloading materials, overcome all difficulties, promote the construction of ships, and strengthen land transportation in order to comprehensively ensure and improve transportation capacity.

Strive to Increase Food Production

Parallel to the above-mentioned measures is to ensure food supply. The government has always strived to increase food production under careful planning. Thanks to the efforts of the people, Japan's food, such as rice and wheat, has been produced in large quantities, and it has also received food assistance from Manchuria. Therefore, no matter how long the war lasts in the future, it will not cause any anxiety. Under the traditional pure customs and beautiful customs of Japanese rural areas, regardless of old or young, men or women, they support each other, overcome many difficulties, and diligently devote themselves to increasing food production. The efforts of rural people are truly commendable. It is clear from the history of the war that ensuring food supply is a very important issue, especially in the event of a prolonged war. In order to increase food production and smooth distribution, the government will further strengthen food self-sufficiency. In this regard, I hope that the people will provide stronger cooperation. It goes without saying that we will increase taxes and strengthen national savings in view of the progress of the war. The government hopes to achieve perfect results with the cooperation of the people. Parallel to the above measures, the decisive battle of civil service is the fundamental premise of all measures. In view of the importance of the war situation, how our officials perform their duties can reflect the morale of the people and affect the activities of the people, which has a great impact on the war. At this time, the Wartime Civil Service Order was specially promulgated, which clearly stated the way officials should be during the war. At this time, our officials must deeply reflect on themselves, sincerely obey, and hope that the service under the war will not have the slightest slack. The above are the essentials of promoting the war and the main points of the government's internal policies. (The following turns to page 2)

### Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Continued from the first page

Japanese Troops Display Patriotic Spirit

What I wish to particularly draw attention to is that our one hundred million people must have a consistent belief in certain victory, that is, to be convinced that the Greater East Asia War can achieve final victory. Needless to say, war is a battle of wills, and those great powers of the world who have devoted their national strength to fighting for years, and who have consistently believed in final victory and continued to struggle, will be able to achieve final victory. The decision of final victory or defeat is extremely subtle, and we must realize that there are still many difficulties ahead. At the same time, under the fierce attacks of the Imperial Army, the enemy's suffering will become more and more serious. In this way, we can imagine the process that must be experienced in the future, that is, the enemy and ourselves will become increasingly tired, and the belief in final victory will gradually waver. Whoever loses the will to fight will be defeated. Regarding this war, the Empire has a national polity that surpasses the world and can never be defeated, while the countries that are hostile to the Empire are truly pitiable. For three thousand years, our Imperial Family has become increasingly prosperous, and the spirit of the Yamato people to be loyal to the country is beyond the reach of other countries. Today, for self-preservation and self-defense, we have no choice but to rise up. The Empire is now completing the Greater East Asia War with a spirit of great courage. The closer the danger, the more the difficulties, the more vigorous the spirit of our one hundred million people will be. The brave soldiers of the Imperial Army fought against a multitude of enemies on Attu Island and Tarawa and Makin Islands, annihilating ten times the number of enemy troops before sacrificing themselves. These brave soldiers represent the power of the Yamato nation to our one hundred million people. We must not forget this. On other battle lines, there are countless loyal and brave soldiers who have also made achievements no less than those of these brave soldiers. This great spirit is the underlying strength of our one hundred million people. Because we have this unique spiritual power in the world, we will be able to achieve the final victory in the righteous war. What the enemy fears in their hearts is this spiritual power. With this great spirit, and by implementing the aforementioned strategies, we have only final victory ahead of us.

East Asian Solidarity Becomes More Solid

Looking back at the situation in Greater East Asia, the Greater East Asia Conference was held last November. The convening of this conference was an unprecedented event. The leaders of the East Asian countries gathered together to review the future of East Asia and to make a joint decision, that is, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, resolving to complete the Greater East Asia War under the five principles of co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, developing the economy, and contributing to the progress of the world, and to build a new order in Greater East Asia, so as to establish world peace. This Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the fact that the great ideals of our China and the ideals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have become unified, and through this, it clarifies to the whole world the common beliefs of all East Asians. Today, the ten million people of Greater East Asia are working more closely together, making their greatest efforts to destroy the aggressors of East Asia and contribute to world peace. The Empire is deeply grateful for the heartfelt cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. Now, the bond between Japan and Manchuria is becoming stronger and stronger. Last year, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Japan-Thailand Treaty were concluded, and Burma and the Philippines became independent one after another. The participation in politics of the original inhabitants of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes is also being realized step by step. Recently, the cooperation of the original inhabitants with the Empire has become more active. Although the enemy is using all means to arbitrarily intimidate or carry out evil schemes, the leaders of Greater East Asia still dare to confront them.

The U.S.'s Indiscriminate Bombing Will Be Avenged

Recently, the United States has indiscriminately bombed non-military facilities in cities throughout Greater East Asia, massacring innocent civilians. Countless people in Greater East Asia have lost their lives and been displaced as a result of such inhumane acts. I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to these East Asians and my respect to the people of Greater East Asia for overcoming these difficulties. Such atrocities by the enemy are not allowed by humans or gods, and the Empire will soon retaliate against them. I hope that the British and American public will remember the Empire's resolute determination. Today, the unity of the one billion people of Greater East Asia is increasing day by day, and the great cause of liberating Greater East Asia and building Greater East Asia is also being actively carried out. However, the United Kingdom and the United States are still luring Chongqing to discuss their final path in Cairo, which has exposed the flaws in the spiritual connection between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing. China and Japan have restored their autonomous and independent, permanently friendly and normal relations, and Chongqing has therefore lost the significance of resisting Japan. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States cannot but pay attention to the new trends of the people under the rule of Chongqing, and there is no better policy than to appease the leaders of Chongqing. After the Cairo talks, the people of Chongqing only received empty words and unsubstantial assistance, and as a result, the only thing that affected them was the extension and increase of the suffering of the war. The United Kingdom and the United States once called for a counter-offensive against Burma, and now they are predicting direct assistance to Chongqing. The rainy season has passed and most of the dry season has passed, but they have not taken any action. Soon the new rainy season will arrive, and their attempt will eventually become a bubble.

The Air of Independence Pervades All of India

Furthermore, how empty are the ideals and humanity held by the United Kingdom and the United States can be clearly seen by examining the policies implemented by the United Kingdom and the United States towards the various ethnic groups and black people under their control. To eliminate racial discrimination and share the glory of universal prosperity is the long-cherished hope and distant ideal of our Asian people for many years. However, the United Kingdom and the United States often attempt to enslave other ethnic groups and seek their own prosperity. What they are attempting in East Asia is to transform the new Greater East Asia that is now being built into a world for them to exploit again. This is the difference between our ideals and those of the British and Americans, and it is also something that our one billion people of Greater East Asia will absolutely not tolerate. In particular, the masses of India are still groaning under the violence of the British and Americans, which is what I sympathize with the most. Mr. Chandra Bose, leading many Indian patriots, has risen up for the independence of India. The Empire specially invited Mr. Jiang to attend the Greater East Asia Conference, and has clarified that it will reserve the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Free India in the near future, so as to take this as the first step towards the independence of India. Recently, the great historical cause of striving for the freedom and independence of India is being promoted under the guidance of the Jiang people. Today, the four hundred million people of India have spiritually rebelled against the British and Americans, and are now seeking an opportunity to respond to this great movement of justice. With the progress of this movement, the Indian people will break away from the British and Americans and the air of rising up for independence will pervade all of India. In this way, the day when India raises the flag of the Provisional Government of Free India will soon come. The Empire reiterates to the world that in order to liberate India, it will definitely provide concrete assistance to the Indian independence movement together with the countries of Greater East Asia.

Close Cooperation with European Allies

Looking again at the situation in Europe, our ally Germany has completed a solid defense line amidst many hardships, and is now advancing on the path of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. We can imagine the suffering that Germany has suffered, but Germany is still united as a country, overcoming these difficulties, raising its fighting spirit, and consistently believing in final victory. Today, the German army has been tested and is now preparing to launch a major decisive battle, and will take the opportunity to use its unique land forces to inflict a painful blow on the British and American enemy forces, preventing them from rising again. Therefore, the future activity of the German army is worthy of expectation. Japan and Germany, based on the lofty concept of building a new world order, have always trusted each other, and have formed an indivisible relationship in the battle to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the cooperation between Japan and Germany, especially the spiritual cooperation, is becoming more tense as the war situation intensifies. In addition, Italy, under the strong leadership of Mussolini, is also committed to strengthening the Axis powers. Here, I would like to express my full respect to the struggle of the various European allied countries, and at the same time, I hope that we will cooperate more closely with each other, respond to East Asia, destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, so as to achieve our common mission. The above is a summary of the government's beliefs on this major situation. I hope that you will fully understand the government's resolute determination and cooperate sincerely with each other. At the same time, I also hope that after deliberation, you will approve the budget bill and the bills submitted by the government this time.

The Ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States are Obvious

At the same time, the American people do not understand why the United States is fighting in the remote area of East Asia, which has nothing to do with the security of the United States. The "New Deal" of the President of the United States is difficult to promote in the country, so he incites war in order to seek further development, so that the people's concern turns to foreign countries, and vigorously publicizes that the American continent will be invaded by foreign enemies. If there were no such provocations, this war would not have occurred. In fact, there is no one in the world who threatens the security of the American continent, and the American people are content to enjoy peace, but he still forces the United States to take risks, willing to make unnecessary and high-priced sacrifices, and he also acts as the administrator of the world and the ruler of East Asia, arbitrarily interfering in East Asia after provoking the war, imposing economic pressure on the Empire, and even resorting to the means of "economic warfare." Therefore, the Pacific War was actually launched by the United States before the Pearl Harbor incident, as can be seen from the documents published by the United States. The United States is fighting to seize colonies. In short, the war of the United States is also a war of political strategy. One can see that the United States wants to consolidate the foundation for Britain's dominance of the world throughout the world. The United Kingdom and the United States not only want to drive the countries participating in the war, but also play various strategies and threats to involve neutral countries in the war, regardless of the expansion of the war, and arbitrarily use it to seek their own interests. For example, the pressure and persecution of countries such as Turkey has been a manifestation of trampling on international morality, so it has aroused the anger of people all over the world, but Turkey has not changed its attitude, and Argentina, which is similarly threatened, has also taken a firm attitude, shattering their scheme. Although the counter-offensive of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia has already begun, victory cannot be obtained by propaganda and deception alone, and the firm array of the East-West Axis has not moved slightly.

Japan and Germany Maintain Close Ties

In addition, regarding the European fortresses, the German army has managed the battle line and is preparing to repel the enemy forces with a solid array and complete preparations. The German people, who have experienced pain, are uniting under the leadership of Führer Hitler, and are marching on the road to recovering the war and striving for final victory. Now, the German army will turn from defense to offense, and the German people, under the air raids, continue to fight with an indomitable spirit, which even the enemy has to admit. The Imperial Government maintains close ties with the German government at all times, and provides comprehensive assistance in military and other matters. In addition, the new Italy, under the leadership of Mussolini, has been revived and has become a part of the Axis powers, opening up a bright future for Italy on the common front of the Empire and Germany, which is quite worthy of expectation. In short, all the Axis countries in Europe are making efforts to complete this firm and immovable common war, and their determination to strive for victory has not been shaken in the slightest by the enemy's propaganda. In addition, although the enemy's counter-offensive in the Pacific is fierce, our firm array to protect East Asia has not been shaken in the slightest, which is due to the brave struggle of the Japanese army under the command of His Majesty the Emperor, and is especially what our people are grateful for.

The Way to Victory Lies in Harmony

What the United Kingdom and the United States hold is material things. In modern warfare, the importance of material things cannot be denied, but victory or defeat cannot be determined by material things alone. Moreover, the enemy also has many weaknesses in material things. The enemy not only lacks manpower, but also the geographical advantage is occupied by us. Furthermore, in terms of the national will to fight, they are not our opponents, because our belief in certain victory does not lie in number, nor in quantity, nor in geographical advantage, but in harmony. At present, what our people are facing is the question of life and death. Looking back at the great achievements of our ancestors who overcame many difficulties in the past, we know that the spirit of struggle will definitely guarantee the great future of our country. The future of our country will be full of unlimited light because of the struggle of our one hundred million people. We rely on the authority of His Majesty the Emperor and the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front line, and the total mobilization of the people in the rear, so there is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us. This war is a war of survival for Japan, and a war of rise and fall for East Asia. Germany is expanding its great power in Europe, and Japan has its great power in East Asia, which are both what the United Kingdom and the United States are trying to prevent. The United Kingdom and the United States actually embrace the "balance of power policy" in Europe, and adopt the "open door and equal opportunity doctrine" in China. The reason for using their colonial policy also lies in this. Their fundamental policy is to make several forces conflict and contain each other, so that they can take the opportunity to establish their own control over the world. This is the so-called "British peace policy" in the past and the "American peace policy" that is now being attempted. (To be continued)

### Measures to Restrict Capital Increase of Companies Implemented Flexibly by the Ministry of Industry Have Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Industry, in order to protect the foundation of companies and stabilize the social economy, had previously drafted interim measures to restrict the registration of capital increase of companies, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. They were promulgated and implemented on December 16 of last year. The industrial circles in Shanghai and economists all believe that these measures are appropriate. However, the Ministry is now said to have received reports from merchants and people in various places that before the implementation of these measures, companies that had already convened shareholder meetings in accordance with the law to resolve to increase capital, or had already begun collecting funds, or even had almost collected all the funds and were preparing to apply, were quite numerous. The methods of increasing capital were difficult to fully comply with the restrictions of the aforementioned interim measures. If they were all restricted in accordance with the law, the capital increase procedures previously handled would be invalid, and the funds already collected would have to be returned, which would not only cause losses, but also involve officials and police. They have asked to consider the difficulties of merchants and allow for flexible handling. The Ministry has reviewed the matter in detail, believing that what the merchants have stated is true. It has been decided that companies that had already handled capital increase before the implementation of the aforementioned interim measures may be handled flexibly by the Ministry at its discretion. However, when submitting the application for approval, they should submit sufficient documentary evidence, such as the minutes of the shareholders' meeting, announcements, etc., to show credibility. These measures have been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan, which has instructed approval, and has consulted the provincial and municipal governments and its affiliated organizations to inform them.

Japanese Planes Attack the India-Chongqing Air Transport Route

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) On the 18th, a Japanese army fighter squadron in Burma attacked the India-Chongqing air transport route, shooting down five enemy large transport planes and two dive bombers.

### Main Points of Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Diplomatic Speech: Determined to Realize the Revival of East Asia

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu delivered a diplomatic speech in the Diet today, the main points of which are as follows: The current war situation is becoming more and more profound, which is already well known. Since last year, the United Kingdom and the United States have been able to contact the outer edges of the East-West Axis battle line due to continuous counter-offensives. Now they feel that it is difficult to continue the offensive by their own strength alone, so they continue to fight with the strength of other countries, regardless of any sacrifices. Before and after the Greater East Asia Conference, they held talks in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. They seem to have decided to launch a general counter-offensive rapidly in the west against the European fortresses and in the east against the Empire. This is also their plan for this year. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States invited Chongqing to hold a meeting in Cairo in late November last year, and as a result, they decided to thoroughly attack the Empire, forcing the Empire to surrender unconditionally, and agreed to seize the territories outside the Empire's mainland, either as their own territory or to divide it with Chongqing, in order to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis camp. Although they have suddenly made it clear that they will implement a general counter-offensive against Japan with all their strength, what they have gained so far is only a few islands scattered in our forward positions, and the price they have paid is that a large number of ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been buried at the bottom of the sea.

### Strengthening the System of Clear Rewards and Punishments: Japan Formulates Four Orders to Rectify Official Discipline

The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of revitalizing official discipline, formally decided on the following four orders at a Cabinet meeting on December 31 of last year: Ordinance on Wartime Management and Service, Special Exceptions to the Civil Service Code in Wartime, Special Exceptions to the Appointment of Employees of Various Ministries in Times of Danger or Resignation, Special Exceptions to the Discipline of Police and Firefighters in Wartime. On January 4, they were promulgated in the official gazette as an extra edition and implemented on the same day. On the same day, Prime Minister Tojo, in addition to the above, specially convened a meeting of officials in Tokyo at 10:30 a.m. at the Prime Minister's official residence and delivered an address instructing them on the attitude that officials should have in wartime. One of the key goals of the domestic situation strengthening measures decided by the government in September of last year is to make administrative operations decisive, with the aim of "seeking further rectification of official discipline and implementing necessary measures." Based on this goal, the above four orders were formulated and submitted to the Privy Council for review. At the Privy Council's plenary meeting on December 29 of last year, they were approved according to the government's original plan.

The Core is the Ordinance on Wartime Management and Service

The main aim of the new imperial ordinance is to reiterate the spirit of clear rewards and punishments for officials in wartime. Therefore, the core of the new imperial ordinance is the "Ordinance on Wartime Official Service," which can be called the "combat instruction" for officials. The ordinance clearly indicates the concrete matters that officials should practice, perform their responsibilities, work selflessly, personally command, obey orders, be sincere and loving, maintain morality, and be careful in words and deeds.

Seven obligations have been stipulated, and special exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime are indispensable measures for strictly enforcing these seven obligations. However, it can be said that a new detention punishment has been added to the methods of discipline. On the other hand, the reward measures have been expanded to make the provisions for punishment stricter. The Special Exceptions to the Appointment of Employees of Various Ministries in Times of Danger or Resignation open a path to promotion for officials who have worked hard and achieved great merit, as well as those who are seriously ill due to official duties, or who are retiring or resigning. In addition, the Special Exceptions to the Discipline of Police and Firefighters in Wartime make the special exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime applicable to police and firefighters in various ministries who are treated as commissioned officers during the Greater East Asia War. The full text of the four orders is as follows:

Ordinance on Wartime Official Service

All officials must carry out the essence of the national polity, be of one heart and one mind, be selfless and loyal, devote themselves to their duties, and fulfill their responsibilities. At present, the war situation is becoming more and more intense, and the responsibilities of officials are also becoming heavier. In addition to strictly observing the official service discipline, they must make special efforts to practice the following items in order to ensure the completion of the war.

1. Officials must pay special attention to the magnitude of their responsibilities during wartime and exert tireless effort and spirit to fulfill their responsibilities.

2. Officials must make decisions with special sincerity during wartime, always putting the overall situation first, working together harmoniously, and dedicating themselves fully to the great cause of completing the war.

3. Officials must especially clearly indicate to their subordinates the direction they should take during wartime and take the lead in leading and guiding them.

4. Officials must especially obey the orders of their superiors during wartime and actively implement policies without losing the opportunity.

5. Officials must be especially sensitive to public opinion during wartime and serve with sincerity and love.

6. Officials must especially value integrity during wartime, cultivate themselves and manage their families, take the lead in setting an example, and strive to be a model for society.

7. Officials must be especially careful in their words and deeds during wartime and pay close attention to maintaining confidentiality. (Supplementary Provisions) This ordinance shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

Special Exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime

Article 1 This ordinance shall apply to those who have been subjected to the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance during the Greater East Asia War or who have used Imperial Ordinance No. 177 of the 40th year of Meiji (1907).

Article 2 Direct superiors must pay special attention to revitalizing discipline, supervise all matters diligently, and act prudently. If there is any violation of the service discipline or violation of the Wartime Official Service Ordinance, they shall take strict disciplinary measures according to the severity of the situation.

Article 3 For those who violate the Wartime Official Service Ordinance and other service disciplines and are subject to Article 2 of the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance, in addition to the punishment under Article 3, they may be punished with imprisonment. They may also be punished with both imprisonment and salary reduction.

Article 4 Imprisonment shall be limited to 60 days, during which work shall be suspended and confinement shall be carried out in the home.

The direct superior shall, according to the circumstances, cancel the confinement at home and change it to reflection and self-cultivation, ordering them to engage in appropriate work.

In cases of absolute necessity, the direct superior may order the person subjected to imprisonment to perform their duties.

Article 5 The regulations on salary reduction in the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance shall apply mutatis mutandis to the procedures for imprisonment.

(Supplementary Provisions) This ordinance shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (To be continued) (Translated by Liu Lu from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)

### Second Phase of Coal Briquettes for Household Registration to Go on Sale at the End of the Month Allotment Amount Increased Compared to the First Phase

According to sources close to the coal industry yesterday, the second phase of coal briquettes for household registration in Districts 1 and 8 is expected to start selling around the 28th of this month. At that time, the allotment amount for each coal briquette purchase certificate will be increased compared to the first phase. However, the exact sales date and allotment amount may be officially announced by the authorities in the near future. As for the first phase of sales, it is scheduled to end in the middle of the day on the 24th of this month. Those who have not yet purchased coal briquettes for this phase should try to purchase them within these three days. According to another source, the authorities plan to postpone the allocation of lump coal needed by various industries and factories to the beginning of next month, because various procedures have not been fully completed. It is said that in the future, the allocation of lump coal will be limited to legitimate users, and those that are not necessary will be suspended.

### News from the Matsushima Fleet: Naval Press Officer Discusses Recent Battles, Japan's Booming Productivity

Central News Agency Report: Naval Press Officer Matsushima, a colonel in the Japanese fleet stationed in China, met with reporters from various city newspapers at the naval attaché’s office yesterday afternoon (the 21st). He made the following remarks regarding recent battles:

The recent Pacific battle situation has eased, and the situation around Rabaul and Bougainville has also stagnated. However, air battles are still intense. The enemy attacks with groups of hundreds or even several hundred aircraft, but each time they are repelled by our air force and intense artillery fire. The losses suffered by the enemy can be imagined. The superiority of Japanese naval air defense weapons and the completeness of our equipment mean that the British and Americans are making no progress in the current battle. Enemy propaganda claiming that Japanese air defense equipment is inferior has already been refuted.

Furthermore, according to frontline intelligence, enemy air forces retreat to Australia after three sorties. They are active during their first sortie, but after two or more consecutive sorties, they completely lose their will. Enemy authorities often separate soldiers who have fought for the first time from those who have fought for the third time. At the same time, soldiers returning to Australia are not allowed to communicate with their relatives and friends back home.

Next, regarding Japan's production situation, the enemy Americans often falsely claim that Japan's productivity is weak and exaggerate their own production capacity. On January 19th, the head of the U.S. War Production Board, Charles Wilson, announced that 100,000 aircraft would need to be produced in 1944. However, the actual number of aircraft produced in various parts of the United States was 125,000. This shows that the U.S. government does not have an accurate estimate of its own production capacity. At the same time, it can also be seen that the labor force (productivity) used by the United States has now reached its maximum limit. As for Japan's productivity, it is now booming, and harnessing the power of domestic youth has only been a matter of recent months. For example, last November, when enemy air forces attacked Kaohsiung, thanks to the active and courageous counterattack by our air force, the enemy planes could only wander in the suburbs of Kaohsiung, injuring only three civilians. Therefore, in the future, Japan will simply laugh off the false propaganda of the British and Americans before the war. We only need to look at the situation after the air raid on Kaohsiung to understand everything clearly.

I have also read the remarks made by Mr. Chen, the president of Shen Bao, yesterday. What I find most ridiculous is that Chongqing willingly endures the pressure of the British and Americans, using Northwest resources to supply them, and using Chinese territory as a base for British and American aggression. This is no different from issuing a blank check, which is just empty happiness. Based on this, we can determine what Chongqing's fate will be. Oriental peoples place great importance on integrity, and we are concerned about Chongqing's behavior.

Yesterday's News Broadcast Time: 7:30 PM Reiterate Wartime Savings

Economic Commentary

### Reiterate Wartime Savings

Yesterday's commentary on wartime savings, titled "National Savings Movement," argued that those leading the national savings movement must painstakingly and diligently study various novel and organized countermeasures, and must place emphasis on absorbing funds from the source of the national economy. Only in this way can the people "economize as much as possible, practice thrift, accumulate little by little, to enrich construction funds and expand the scope of production," as stated by Minister of Finance Zhou the day before yesterday.

Promoting savings is by no means just launching a few propaganda weeks and superficially depositing funds into the Central Reserve Bank. It involves various organized and practically beneficial savings countermeasures, such as the progress of wartime national savings in the allied nation of Japan, and the improvement and expansion of its savings institutions. Japan is very diligent in promoting its national savings incentive movement. Its various savings plans and organizations that we can learn from include: the national savings association system, including the organization of regional associations in cities, towns, and villages; the implementation of incentive savings methods, such as various savings institutions receiving tax benefits; the creation of savings bonds, allowing those who are unable to purchase government bonds to cooperate in saving, so the government itself issues bonds to encourage long-term savings deposits; abandoning the principles previously not operated by various financial institutions, and mobilizing ordinary banks nationwide to operate savings and trust businesses; the implementation of a savings tax payment system, closely linking tax payment and savings. Under such diligent promotion and adjustment, Japan's wartime national savings often show a leap in growth, thus greatly assisting its huge war expenses and production expansion funds. These are all things that our country, both government and people, should strive to imitate in order to make the savings movement fully effective.

### Agreement Reached on New Year's Eve Settlement, All Industries Pass New Year Safely, Discount Interest Allowed Until Tomorrow

The day after tomorrow (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve. Various silver and money industries have already begun to handle the final settlement. The market discount interest rate is allowed to open until tomorrow (the 23rd). Various firms will settle interest with customers until the day before yesterday. During the final account period, no interest is calculated on deposits, but interest is still calculated on debts. Both are calculated according to a deposit interest rate of 6 yuan and a debt interest rate of 33 yuan. Regarding the time for receiving and returning checks on New Year's Eve, the Silver Union Association and the Money Bank have reached an agreement that the check exchange time will be extended that day. The principle is to return all checks on the same day. It is also heard that the banking industry will be closed for three days from the 25th and will reopen on the 28th. The money industry will be closed for four days from the 25th and will reopen on the 29th. All industries in the market are scheduled to open red market trading on January 29th. Regarding the business of various industries in the 32nd year, due to the soaring prices, many have made huge profits. In addition, the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Association's Money Bank have tried their best to regulate, so various banks and firms are able to cope with ease, and all industries are passing the New Year safely.

All Sectors Respond Enthusiastically to Scholarships

Yesterday, a letter was received from Sun Xianhui and Guang Sheng, which stated: "The cost of living is high, school tuition fees are increasing, and many young people will be dropping out of school in society. I have long sympathized with the scholarship initiative organized by your newspaper. However, my strength is weak, and this wish has not been fulfilled. Now, I am persuading friends and relatives who are able to contribute to donate a total of 20,000 yuan to fulfill my responsibility. I hope you will accept it." We deeply admire his concern for young people. We are also grateful for the donations of 10,000 yuan each from Juxing Cotton Cloth Company and Ms. Sun Liu Wanru, and 5,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Yuanmao.

According to Mr. Yuan, a Xi Fan Scholarship Fund Management Committee has also been established in his hometown of Zhenjiang to support local students who have dropped out of school.

### Crackdown on Long-Term Promissory Notes Will Be Handled According to the Original Law, Reports of Accommodation and Changes Are Not Accurate

The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank previously issued measures to crack down on the abuse of long-term promissory notes by various banks and firms, ordering them to comply. The report yesterday that the Silver and Money Industries Associations had proposed four measures for the Financial Affairs Inspection Department to adopt, and that the department had agreed to accommodate them, is now denied by the Financial Affairs Inspection Department. It stated that the department's crackdown on the issuance of long-term promissory notes by banks and firms will still be handled according to the original measures, and there is no so-called accommodation or change.

### Overdrafts on Current Accounts Must Be Cleared Annually, Financial Affairs Inspection Department Orders Banks to Comply

The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank has noted that various financial institutions are supposed to clear all overdrafts for current and current accounts annually at the end of the Lunar New Year. However, it has recently been found that some accounts have not yet been cleared at the end of the year, which is improper. Therefore, they should be strictly urged to clear all overdrafts to maintain the established practice and uphold credit. Yesterday, separate letters were sent to various banks, money shops, and trust companies to comply. If there are any that cannot be cleared, please list the names of the accounts in detail (stating the account name, real name, accurate address, and amount of the overdraft) and report them to the Financial Affairs Inspection Department for verification.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: The market closed on Thursday and will reopen on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year.

Chinese Stocks: Due to the Spring Festival market closure, over-the-counter transactions were limited. Tight credit conditions led to some selling, but buyers were hesitant to make purchases, so the market was stable with a slight hint of volatility.

Discount Interest: Due to the final settlement, various industries must balance their positions, so credit conditions were tight and the discount interest rate remained at two cents.

Rice and Grain: Recently, due to the increase in household rice, the appetite of merchants in this street has been sluggish, and prices have continued to decline. Bo Dao rice was trading at two levels three and four, while glutinous rice was more popular, trading at two levels five and six.

Woolens: Due to various environmental factors, the market remained popular, and new high prices were frequently seen. However, trading was limited due to the final settlement. Retail sales were scarce, and merchants with limited inventory mostly hoarded goods. Except for a few who slightly lowered prices to balance their positions, most were reluctant to sell. The lack of woolens, cotton, silk, and cotton yarn, as well as raw cotton, made the market particularly popular.

### Labor Education for Students at Normal University

Discussions on labor education have always been theoretical, and the so-called labor in schools has been nothing more than child's play. True labor education must involve genuine labor.

Since the beginning of winter this year, coal prices have soared. Currently, 1,000 catties of hard coal cost as much as 90 yuan. The price increase is partly due to a shortage of workers and the rising cost of workers' rations. Fortunately, there has recently been a rationing system where residents can purchase coal at suburban coal yards with their household registration certificates, at a price of just over 40 yuan per 1,000 catties. However, the number of coal yards is limited, and the number of purchasers is extremely high, so some people are still unable to buy coal.

Regarding the issue of coal rationing, there is also an interesting measure related to labor education.

The military-managed Mentougou Coal Mining Company recently agreed with Normal University to imitate the wartime labor education system of temples in Japan and Germany, whereby students from Normal University would handle coal rationing and transportation during their spare time to ease the fuel supply, and to demonstrate a spirit of labor. This has been underway since New Year's Day this year. It is said that Normal University students are currently working diligently, and the coal rationing department has already prepared some of the necessary coal transport carts, with plans to have some of the coal transported by Normal University students starting from the 10th of this month. Furthermore, a commencement ceremony for the Normal University students' diligent service will be held at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month at the department's coal storage yard outside Heping Gate. All staff of the department, as well as the president and secretary-general of Normal University, the manager of Mentougou Coal Mining Company, Mr. Shirashima, and other related parties will attend. This is truly an interesting organization, and one that is worth noting. This kind of measure can be considered genuine labor education. (Posted by Luo Ming on January 15th)

### Excessively Collected Land Tax - Please Investigate Thoroughly, Municipal Authorities

The Municipal Finance Bureau of this city began collecting the land tax for the 32nd year on September 1st of last year, and if not paid by the end of October, a late payment penalty of 10% would be charged. In Yangjing District, Pudong, my hometown, the grain tax notification slips were not issued to the grain households by the baozheng (local head) until early November, after the payment deadline. Without the notification slips, payment was not allowed. Currently, the baozheng are collecting 50 yuan per mu from the farmers, resulting in the amount actually collected being more than three times the tax amount that should be collected, causing widespread suspicion. Therefore, disputes are often heard during payment. Furthermore, 1.5 sheng of military rice is collected per mu. Those with rice pay in rice, and those without rice pay in cash at the government-fixed price. Since the government's fixed price for each shi of rice is 820 yuan, 1.5 sheng translates to only 12.2 yuan in reserve certificates per mu. However, the baozheng are pricing it at 40 yuan, using the black market rate of over 2,660 yuan, resulting in an overcollection of more than three times (the municipal government buys white rice from farmers at a fixed price of 820 yuan per shi, while farmers have to pay for military rice based on the black market rate, which is unacceptable). It is certain that unscrupulous baozheng are overcollecting and engaging in fraud. I respectfully request that the municipal authorities investigate thoroughly and strictly deal with this. It would be best to publish in the newspaper the amount collected for both land tax and military rice so that payers can follow it appropriately, avoid being deceived by unscrupulous baozheng, and eliminate corruption and clarify governance. The farmers would be fortunate. (Tang Jingeng, a farmer from Yangjing District, Pudong)

### Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Entrusts this Office to Distribute Steamed Buns, Two per Person Until Supplies Last

Yesterday, the Noodle Food Industry Association, led by Chairman Wang Bing, once again dispatched Yao Jinbiao and Dai Ziquan as representatives to the Penglai Road Social Welfare Bureau Relief Institute, the Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Association's Relief Centers, and other locations to distribute noodle-based flatbreads and steamed bun food products to benefit the poor. Today, they will set out again to donate to various relief organizations to benefit the impoverished. Furthermore, Mr. Wei Guishan, an advisor to the association, sent 500 catties of flatbreads and steamed buns, instructing that they be distributed at the entrance to impoverished students. Impoverished scholars from all walks of life are welcome to bring their citizen certificates to the Social Service Department of the "Jin Bao" newspaper to claim them, two per person until supplies last, and to create good fortune for colleagues in the cake-making industry.

### Eye Welfare

The Shanghai Eye Relief Association provides monthly assistance to over one hundred impoverished blind individuals. As the Lunar New Year approaches, to show extra consideration, they are issuing double the usual amount to add a little something. According to reports, former directors Xu Heyong, Ji Longtu, and others, due to their advanced age and inability to manage affairs concurrently, publicly recommended Mr. Li Shuming to take over as director. Directors Huang Jiping, Ke Wennong, Chen Changping, Zhou Yixing, Wang Zhiyuan, Chuan Huai琛, Zhao Hongru, Zhang Zaichun, and others serve as executive directors and directors. Monthly donations are determined by the board of directors and are not solicited from outside, it is said.

### The Elderly Home is About to Run Out of Food

The Shanghai Nanshi Elderly Home was founded by Catholic nuns and has a history of 39 years. Any poor and helpless elderly person, aged 60 or older, regardless of gender or religion, can be admitted. However, due to limited resources, it only accepts 250 people. The elderly home is currently in its most critical period, facing the food problem for four hundred lonely elderly people. Since the home has no endowment fund and lacks production, it relies solely on donations for its livelihood. Each month, it needs at least 55 bags of rice, about 10 tons of coal, 90 catties of oil, 250 catties of salt, 300 catties of beans, 650 catties of salted fish, 1,500 catties of vegetables, 2 boxes of soap, and at least 20 bolts of cloth. Other expenses, such as electricity, water, medicine, etc., require at least tens of thousands of yuan per month. These daily expenses are all raised by the nuns through daily solicitations. Please, benevolent individuals from all walks of life, generously donate. This office can collect donations on behalf of the home. (Xu Zongze)

Mingxin School Scholarship: The Mingxin Accounting School at No. 18, Lane 531, Henan Road, has established 60 scholarships for this term, 20 free spots, and 100 reduced-fee spots. Impoverished individuals are welcome to apply to the school.

### Soldier Class (2)

During that year's summer vacation, Kikuchi, assigned to the officer corps, organized a military observation tour, personally leading over sixty aspirants to travel through Kyushu and China. As Makoto had already made up his mind, he also participated. Tatsuo and Komori were, of course, present.

Their group began their tour with the Kumamoto Garrison Division, the hometown of Major Kikuchi. The training of the troops under the blazing sun was indeed extremely intense. The backs of their uniforms were soaked as if with a wet towel.

They went to the army hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers of the Manchurian Incident and to console the bereaved families of the war dead. Their activities were indeed very busy, and there was also instruction from Major's car. He provided guidance on the preliminary knowledge of the places being visited at any time, and the relevant spiritual concepts. Because the cars were traveling at high speed, some people began to doze off. That cannot be entirely attributed to their lack of concentration, because this tour group had almost never stayed in a hotel, but rather spent the nights in the cars. Therefore, the students appeared very tired. Major's goal was to make them persevere.

"Strengthen yourselves, strengthen yourselves." Although he did not say it aloud, it could be seen in his eyes.

The final destination of the tour was the Etajima Naval Academy. At 6:00 AM, they arrived in Ujina City and boarded a transport ship from Kawaharash. Large and small warships, illuminated by the morning glow, were neatly moored. Tatsuo, roused from his dream, walked to the railing, while Makoto, peeking through the gaps between his friends, stared wide-eyed.

After arriving at Ujina, they walked for about thirty minutes to the gate of the Naval Academy. Major Kikuchi went to the gatekeeper and spoke a few words, and the gatekeeper notified his superior by telephone.

After a while, the major returned to the students: "Gentlemen, it is very unfortunate that this school began its summer vacation yesterday. But the duty officer will lead us on a tour. Everyone, please be orderly."

The students were all dejected. But they were also shocked to hear that the school's summer vacation was only ten days long!

An officer in a white naval lieutenant uniform appeared at the gate to lead them. Although it was during the holiday, the clean school, with its pine, cedar, and cherry trees, and the backdrop of the azure sea, did not feel like a school, but rather was filled with a clean atmosphere.

After about two hours, they had walked all over the place. Such a vast campus and school buildings. In addition, there were new school buildings under construction. Finally, before opening their lunch boxes for a meal at the Yōkōkan student hotel, the officer gave a lecture, the topic of which was "Regarding the Imperial Naval Academy."

"Great! The Navy - I didn't know there would be such new school buildings when I entered the school." Tatsuo whispered in Makoto's ear. Makoto just smiled and said nothing.
