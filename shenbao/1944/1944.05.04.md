### Increasing the Salaries of Primary and Secondary School Teachers

Our newspaper's editorial on April 28th raised the issue of "Attention to the Teacher Strike Trend" because the lives of teachers are unstable due to exploitation by some profit-seeking school owners, which leads to negligence of duty and even teacher strikes. This is the most serious crisis in Shanghai's education problem. We advocate that all private schools must disclose their financial income and expenditure. The money collected from students should be used for teachers' salaries and school equipment, and should not be pocketed privately. At the same time, the education authorities should supervise and audit the financial income and expenditure of private schools in a fair manner, and urge them to publish it publicly. If there are unreasonable facts, they should be strictly investigated and punished. We also hope that people from all walks of life will report and sanction them.

Shanghai was originally the cultural center of the country, with the largest number of schools in the country. Since 1937, many primary and secondary schools in the counties near Shanghai have moved to Shanghai, and the number has increased even more. In terms of quantity, the number of schools in Shanghai has actually increased. Due to the rising prices and difficult living conditions in recent years, the impact on education is that experienced and knowledgeable educators abandon their original educational work and engage in other industries; at the same time, there are many people who were not originally educators, or even if they are educators but have no desire to serve, use education as a tool for profit, and create or take over schools at all levels in various names. Their purpose is only to make profit, and they do not care about the mission of education at all. The most obvious manifestation is to increase tuition fees as much as possible and to suppress teachers' salaries as much as possible. With such abnormal development, the more schools there are, the lower and more chaotic the quality of education will be.

To put it bluntly, whether the teachers' salaries are appropriate is directly proportional to the quality of education. If the teachers' salaries are appropriate and their lives are stable, they will naturally be able to work diligently and tirelessly, and the quality of education will naturally be excellent. Originally, teachers have received considerable education, fully understand the meaning of serving education, have the desire to serve education, and know how to endure the hardship of serving education. Therefore, they do not pursue excessive enjoyment in terms of living treatment, and are satisfied if they can obtain the minimum stability. If even the minimum stability of life cannot be obtained, and they are expected to eat grass and squeeze out milk, it will naturally be difficult. What is the minimum standard of living for teachers? At least it must maintain the standard of "eating enough and dressing warmly."

Secondly, China has always respected teachers since ancient times. Today, as role models for others, their lives are unsustainable, and most of them are "pale and empty-bellied." In terms of respecting teachers, it is also unreasonable.

Education is a fundamental plan for nurturing talents for a hundred years, and teachers are the driving force for promoting education. Therefore, the lives of teachers today must be thoroughly improved to ensure that they obtain the minimum stability, especially the number of primary and secondary school teachers is more common. For private primary and secondary schools, we have previously advocated financial transparency, and the money collected from students should be used for teachers. As for municipal schools, tuition fees are lower and income is worse, relying solely on government funding, which is not enough to cover expenses. On the one hand, the government should be asked to increase funding appropriately, and on the other hand, it is hoped that parents of students with strong financial resources will voluntarily provide assistance to help improve the lives of teachers, which is to respect teachers. I believe that parents will be happy to do so for the sake of their children's educational achievements. Recently, I heard that the municipal government and social welfare authorities have paid attention to this and led the launch to improve the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers. The happiness of teachers' lives is the happiness of the future of education.

### New Offensive Launched on the Pinghan Railway Line: Japanese Army Occupies Zhengzhou and Xuchang, Breaking Through the First Line of Defense of the Chongqing Army

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:20 pm on the 3rd: Japanese troops in North China crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River on April 18th and launched an offensive against Tang Enbo's army, a direct descendant of Chongqing. They successively occupied Zhengzhou and Xuchang on April 20th and May 1st and are continuing their attack.

A certain base on the Henan Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At dawn on the 28th of last month, the Japanese army crossed the river near Zhongping on the other side of the New Yellow River and attacked the left wing of the Chongqing army. A separate Japanese army unit coordinated with it and gathered at Fuzhuang on the northeast bank of the New Yellow River on the morning of the 8th. Under the cover of artillery units, they divided into boats and launched an attack, crossing the rapid river about 500 meters wide and rushing to the school. When they arrived on the other side, they chased and defeated the Chongqing army and approached Xinzheng, an important point on the Pinghan Road. At midnight on the 20th, a certain unit of the Japanese army built a position at a certain place two kilometers south of Xinzheng. At dawn on the 21st, the vanguard unit of the first array of the New Army attacked the 28th Army of the Chongqing Army, the newly编第15军, one regiment of the newly編第29师 (师畏吕公良), about 1,000 soldiers, one regiment of the independent 14th Brigade, and about 5,000 other Chongqing troops with fierce artillery fire. At 4:00 pm, they broke into the city and completely occupied Xinzheng at 6:00 pm.

Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing side recently mistakenly believed that Japan had withdrawn troops from China to the southern front and strongly advocated launching a general counter-offensive against the Japanese army. They also actively engaged in the replenishment and preparation of combat power in order to recapture North China. However, after the Japanese North China Expeditionary Force launched a fierce attack on April 18th with excellent mobility and superb tactics against the 40-odd divisions of the Jiang Dingwen-commanded 1st War Zone, the Chongqing army was greatly embarrassed. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army has broken through the first line of defense of the Chongqing army in less than ten days. The Henan operation this time is rare since the Central Plains Battle. When this operation was launched, the National Government army also cooperated with it and launched a large annihilation battle in the Henan plain and mountainous area.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On April 18th, the Japanese army in North China launched an offensive against Tang Enbo's army, deputy commander of the 1st War Zone of Yuwan, in the plains of Henan and Anhui provinces, and quickly occupied Zhengzhou and Xuchang, important points of Pingying. When the Japanese army was besieging the British army at the Imphal fortress and severely damaged it, the Japanese army once again preemptively launched two major offensives in the north and south at the same time, which proved the strength of the Japanese army's combat power and would greatly surprise the Chongqing side and the anti-Axis army. Tang Enzuo is the first deputy commander of the Chongqing army in Henan Province. He is also the commander of the 19th Army of the Chongqing Army deployed in the middle area of the Pinghan Road New Yellow River. Recently, he also served as the commander of the Yu Lu Border Region. His army is an iron army. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack from near Zhong on the night of April 17th and at dawn on the 18th, and from the northern area of Zhengzhou, crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River and began the attack. Immediately, they broke through the Chongqing army's resistance and quickly advanced into the desert area of the Yellow River. On the 20th, they occupied Zhengzhou, and on May 1st, they occupied Xuchang, 70 kilometers south of Zhengzhou, and are continuing to advance. At the same time, the Japanese air force closely cooperated with the ground operations and bombed the Chongqing air force bases in Hanzhong Shilu, Luxi, Xi'an, and Xing'an for days, achieving great results. The Chongqing army suffered great losses in manpower and material resources due to the repeated offensives launched by the Japanese army in the past year (according to the number of battles with the Chongqing army in the past year, about 22,000 times, an average of about 1,000 times a month, and an average of about 70 times a day). Therefore, since the second half of last year, they have adopted the so-called principle of preserving military strength and are even more afraid that the Japanese army will collapse their remaining military strength and retreat to the rear of the first line in order to preserve their combat power as much as possible. However, since the beginning of this year, the Chongqing army has become active due to the instigation of the United States. Recently, it has used American weapons transported by the Chongqing-India air transport route to reorganize its troops and attempted to launch an offensive against Japan by taking advantage of the power of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. However, in order to suppress its attempted rebellion in advance, the Japanese army launched a leading offensive and had already dealt a great blow to the Chongqing army. The Chongqing military authorities also believe that the Japanese army's offensive target is to attack Chongqing and are extremely frightened.

### Minister Matsushima Delivers a Speech in Hangzhou: Implementing Increased Production of Aircraft

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Major Matsushima, Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, attended the Naval Lecture on Funding for Military Aircraft at the China Grand Theater here on the 3rd and delivered a speech on the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, the main points of which are as follows: It is difficult to make a correct judgment on the Greater East Asia War, which is incomparably grand, if only observed locally. At present, our army is preventing the enemy's fierce counter-offensive in the South Pacific and is taking a defensive position. On the contrary, on the India-Burma border, we are exerting a strong offensive force and crushing the Central American forces in India. In China, we are also gradually breaking the enemy's conspiracy. From the above, it can be said that the current stage of the Greater East Asia War is to adopt a defensive posture in the east and an offensive posture in the west. However, the fate of the Greater East Asia War is actually still tied to the Pacific. If we can win in the Pacific, the Greater East Asia War will be completed. However, why is our army currently taking a defensive position in this area? This point has been mentioned several times, and it is actually affected by the insufficient air force, especially the number of aircraft is less than the enemy's. We have already paid attention to this and have now established a plan to greatly increase the production of aircraft. The whole country is united and working hard to promote it. In a few months, our air force will at least be able to compete with the enemy's forces in the Pacific and exert a sophisticated force to suddenly take an offensive posture. The enemy, the United States, has realized that we are so enriching our combat power and is trying to fight in this plan. Therefore, we have repeatedly failed in the Pacific and have not been able to approach our mainland even one step. From this, we can see that the current period is extremely important to complete the Greater East Asia War. If we take a wrong step, we can make the overall war situation collapse. On the contrary, if we can break through this barrier, victory will belong to us. Therefore, the increase in aircraft production is more important than anything else.

### Japanese and Indian Armies Await Opportunity to Attack: Decisive Battle at Dimapur, Enemy Counterattack North of Kohima Repelled

Indian-Burmese Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On the Imphal front, the attacks of the Japanese and Indian armies against the British and Indian armies on the Dimapur Road are becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is continuing to transfer powerful mechanized units from the Dimapur area to the surrounding area of Prema for reinforcement, and is repeatedly bombing the Japanese and Indian armies by air. At the same time, elite troops are being used to reinforce a certain area and the north of Peikai Kuraima in order to prevent the advance of the Japanese and Indian armies. Therefore, fierce battles are currently taking place in all areas. Among them, the battle around the 461 Heights is the fiercest. On the 28th, the enemy launched a swift attack on the rear of the Japanese and Indian army positions under the cover of tanks and mortars, but failed. Several hundred enemy troops advancing from Zibuchai towards the north of Kohima were also repelled by the Japanese and Indian armies at dusk on the 28th. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been completely shattered. At the same time, the Japanese and Indian armies, which are firmly holding on to various strategic points, are now awaiting the opportunity to attack Dimapur, and it is expected that the decisive battle in that area will also begin soon.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain place on the Indian front, on the evening of the 25th of last month, about 400 enemy troops secretly attempted to move near Melei Mai, 5 kilometers north of Kohima, intending to spy on the north of Kohima. The Japanese army immediately launched a surprise attack late that night and repelled the enemy troops. In addition, the remnants of the enemy around the 461 Heights, with the support of artillery units, are still holding on to their positions and attacking with Paibaos, but the Japanese army is not discouraged and is repelling the counterattacking enemy troops separately. In addition, the enemy has recently gathered more than 30 tanks of various types near Kilhmai (20 kilometers northwest of Kohima), intending to move south. The Japanese army has secured the strategy and has repelled the enemy troops each time.

Yangon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On the 25th of last month, the ground troops shot down 14 enemy aircraft in one go during the air battle over the Manipur Valley under the cover of bomber squadrons. Among them were six DC3 aircraft. The battle achieved great results, and the Japanese warriors were all delighted. On the same day, the Japanese fighter squadron flying over the Arakan Mountains discovered four enemy DC3 aircraft attacking southwest from the Imphal area and immediately attacked the enemy aircraft. Initially, one enemy aircraft was shot down, and soon another aircraft crashed to the ground. Afterwards, the Japanese bomber squadron attacked the enemy fighter group, and the remaining two enemy aircraft took the opportunity to flee in embarrassment. The Japanese aircraft flew to the Lalabasa station as planned, accurately dropped bombs, and hit the central building of the military station. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to their defense area. On the way back, they encountered an enemy DC3 aircraft that had been shot down before and immediately hit its vitals with one shot, causing it to fall to the ground. At this time, the enemy's main aircraft squadron flew in from the southwest. The Japanese aircraft also shot at it. Just as they were thinking of returning to their original defense area, an aircraft suddenly flew in from the Imphal area. According to its flight posture, it seemed to be a connecting aircraft at the intersection of the enemy's air transport route. The Japanese aircraft immediately attacked from the side and fired several shots in a row. The enemy aircraft was hit and fell into the valley. In this battle, a total of 14 enemy aircraft were shot down, and all the Japanese aircraft returned safely to their defense area.

### Spain Concludes Agreement with Britain and the United States; Neutrality Unaffected; Spanish Sovereignty Remains Complete and Undiminished

Madrid, 3rd (Central News Agency) Havas reports that the Spanish Foreign Ministry issued a communique yesterday stating that an agreement has been reached between Spain and Britain and the United States regarding the prohibition of oil shipments. The full text of the communique reads, "All outstanding issues regarding economic relations between Spain and Britain and the United States have been resolved through negotiations and an agreement has been signed. Due to the complexity of the issues, the negotiations have taken a long time. The agreement is based on an understanding of Spain's neutral status and the current reality. Relations between Spain and Britain and the United States have been tense in recent weeks, but now both sides have resumed normal relations. The elimination of the crisis does not harm the interests or prestige of the countries concerned."

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) Britain and the United States had pressured Spain with the cessation of oil and other means, but Franco and Foreign Minister Jordana consistently negotiated with a firm attitude. Although crises were encountered repeatedly, the raw materials required by Spain, such as pyrite ore and iron, had to rely on Spanish imports. As a result, due to concessions from the United States and Britain, the negotiations gradually approached conclusion. A correspondent of the German News Agency stationed in Madrid reported that the Spanish government had always handled this negotiation carefully due to the various interests involved. As a result, Spain still insists on neutrality, and its sovereignty in trade and politics has not been impaired. The fact that the British and American governments stopped negotiating the import of oil is a diplomatic success. Although the British and American governments raised unreasonable demands regarding foreigners residing in Spanish territory, the Spanish government has always adhered to neutrality and treated representatives of the belligerent countries equally. The declaration in this communique of respecting neutrality and the interests of the countries concerned demonstrates the consistency of the above claims.

### British Prime Minister Predicts the Imminent Arrival of a Great War

Geneva, 3rd (Central News Agency) German News Agency dispatch from London: British Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech at the Dominion Conference on Monday that the Great War is about to reach "the most dangerous peak." At a time when the war is entering its most intense stage, he did not expect the conference to completely solve all the problems of the British Empire, but holding a roundtable meeting to exchange opinions is the right thing to do.

### Anti-Axis Powers Actively Sabotage Water and Land Transport Lines; Prelude to Landing Operations

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) The northwest coast of France, the Rhine River, the Danube River, and other transport routes are all strategically important lifelines. Therefore, British planes often bomb them with a large number of mines. This offensive echoes the destruction of transport lines behind the strongholds of Western Europe, indicating that an offensive operation is about to begin. Military experts are also very concerned about future developments. Since the beginning of March, the number of enemy mines cleared by the German patrol and minesweeping units in the English Channel to the Bay of Biscay has been three times that of the past. This fact proves that before the start of the war, the enemy had begun to hinder the movement of maritime transport convoys and seek to seize the initiative of the operational focus. The German minesweeping units safely detonated all these mines, and German breakthrough ships, exploration boats, destroyers, and others have foiled the enemy's attempt.

### Mine Design is Becoming Increasingly Sophisticated

Since the outbreak of the war, British and German mine experts have been busy researching and manufacturing mines and their defensive weapons. Most of the mines currently used by Britain and the United States are magnetic mines, which are highly sensitive and different from the previous contact mines. Even if an iron wire passes through, its magnetic surface can explode immediately. At the beginning of the war, these magnetic mines were mostly fixed and placed on the seabed. Now they have been improved to be lightweight, that is, using the buoyancy of the mine, it can be tethered in the water. The sensitivity of magnetic mines is only about forty or so. After the appearance of this type of lightweight mine, the area for laying mines has been greatly expanded. The design of the mines is becoming more and more sophisticated, and the defensive weapons and removal methods are also changing with each passing day. During the preparation period for the invasion of Europe, the contact mines cleared by the German minesweeping units accounted for only 2% of the total number, and the rest were extremely dangerous magnetic lightweight mines. The method of laying these mines is entirely carried out by large aircraft at night. According to reports, the carrying capacity of enemy mine-laying aircraft is four to six mines, each weighing 600 to 1,000 kilograms.

### Residents Evacuated from the Belgian Coast

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) The German authorities have made full preparations to deal with the anti-Axis powers' launch of an invasion of Europe. According to the Belgian News Agency on the 2nd, the German occupation authorities have issued evacuation orders in general cities and towns in the coastal area of Belgium. Therefore, the residents of the two cities of Knokke and Kampenhout are moving to Flanders in the east.

### Mississippi River Floods; Disaster Area Covers 1.5 Million Acres

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to Havas, St. Louis: The Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Illinois River and the Missouri River, have flooded, and the American Red Cross estimates that no less than 1.5 million acres of land have been flooded. U.S. Army engineers said last night that a 30-mile-long section of levee 95 miles south of St. Louis is in danger of being breached. The flooded area is a vast expanse of muddy water, with only the roofs of houses visible.

### The U.S.-British Oil Scramble

"America's oil will be exhausted in about twelve years." This is what U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Wartime Fuel Administrator Ickes said last year. At that time, there was much debate among experts about the correctness of this statement. Currently, the proportion of oil production in the United States accounts for a relatively high percentage of the world's total production. Compared with the surge in total production during the previous war, its rate of increase is very slow. Assuming that the current world's total production is 300 million tons per year, the United States produces about 60%. The United States, citing the sluggishness of oil production, believes that it is natural to lay claim to all oil-producing countries, and the most attention is paid to Britain. When Ickes issued the above warning, he said, "We should make extensive use of other countries' oil, and we must strive to conserve America's own oil." It can be seen what he meant. Moreover, this war is an excellent opportunity to drive Britain out of the important stage of oil production. Especially in West Asia, the two have been fighting secretly for a long time, and the result is gradually becoming unfavorable to Britain. In the Bahrain Islands (in the Persian Gulf), the United States has already obtained oil drilling rights for 29 companies, and in Arabia and Kuwait, 39 companies have obtained the same rights.

Britain's Oil Depot - Bahrain

Bahrain's oil production was 4,000 tons in 1935, and it surged to 1 million tons in 1940. Originally, Bahrain was particularly valued by the British Navy because of its oil and its strategic position. Oil is transported through submarine pipelines to Mena al-Ahmadi, an important base of the British Navy. Bahrain not only supplies oil to the British Navy in Aden, Bombay, and Ceylon, but also as far as Darwin and Sydney in Australia. Before the outbreak of the war, Britain ordered the American-owned Texaco to participate in Bahrain's oil, trying to deal with the situation temporarily, and was able to prevent American forces from entering that area. However, after Texaco's rights were bought by other large American companies, the United States sent troops to Bahrain, and Britain's loss of Bahrain was inevitable.

In 1933, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company obtained the rights to an oil field area of 400,000 square kilometers from King Ibn Saud in Saudi Arabia. Three years later, it began to extract large quantities of oil. Its production volume was only 2,000 tons in 1936, but it reached 800,000 tons in 1941. As a result, the oil reserves in the area have reached 40 million tons. Moreover, new oil fields are being discovered one after another, so Saudi Arabia will be the only oil-producing country in the world in the future.

Britain is Driven Out of Iran by the United States

The U.S. government recently established an oil storage company with Ickes as president. This move is of course an attempt to seize overseas oil resources, and the U.S. Navy is also strongly supporting this policy. Ickes said:

"The United States' participation in the development of overseas oil resources is to ensure the absolute requirements of the oil necessary for the United States and its allies in the future."

The main target of this demand is of course Britain. The former Thurman Committee of the Senate said that the United States demanded to develop the Iranian oil fields that had already produced 10 million tons of oil in 1934, and to participate in the development of the same American raw material resources, as the price for the materials supplied by the Lend-Lease Act.

In 1941, Britain sent a strong force to Iran, but soon the Soviet Union also entered the country. It is said that there was some understanding regarding each other's spheres of influence, and now the United States has been added. The American financial advisor to the Iranian government, Sheridan, can in fact control the government. This proves that Britain has lost the important position it has maintained in the country for thirty years.

Britain has always obtained four-fifths of Iran's oil, which accounts for 27% of Britain's annual consumption of 30 million tons. From this, it can be seen how important Iran is to Britain. It is said that the United States has a budget of 150 million yuan to lay an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia to the coast, and King Ibn Saud will have no way to deal with this American demand. Regarding the development of Turkey's oil resources, the United States recently asked Turkey to share the production volume equally, with the condition of laying a wheel pipeline from the oil field area to Melon, South Anatolia, but this was rejected by Turkey.

Africa is also Coveted

Africa currently cannot produce enough oil for its own needs. Egypt produced 631,000 tons in 1939 and now exceeds 1 million tons, making it the most important oil-producing country in that area. Britain's position in the country was once said to be stable, but American businessmen had already started and achieved considerable success. Moreover, the United States is not only coveting West Asia's oil, but the Canadian oil industry is also gradually investing in the two countries of the United States and Canada. Negotiations on the development of the oil fields between Fort Norman have been concluded. Trial drilling results show 137 tons per day. This oil will be supplied to the U.S. military stationed in Alaska through two oil pipelines in the future.

The United States also wants to control the oil in South America. The United States only has 2.5 million tons left, so it will naturally not let go of South America, which has an export capacity of 25 million tons. After occupying Trinidad in 1940, the United States established its foothold at the expense of Britain, and its position has been strengthened day by day since then. In this way, the United States is approaching Britain step by step and achieving the goal of grasping the world's oil production, which is now a very obvious fact.

### China's Politics and Economy are Becoming Increasingly Clear and Progressive; Ambassador Tani Expresses his Impressions to Reporters Yesterday

Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Ambassador Tani received Chinese and Japanese reporters separately at the Broadway Mansion on the afternoon of yesterday (3rd) at 5:30 pm. He spoke on the recent relations between China and Japan and Japan's cooperation with China, and answered in detail the questions raised by the Chinese reporters. The details are recorded as follows:

Ambassador Tani at the reception (second person from the left)

Ambassador's Speech Ambassador Tani began by saying that he has been in office for more than a year since he took office in May of last year. During this period, he has strived to implement Japan's new policy towards China and to cooperate in strengthening the National Government. Until recently, he has felt even more pleased with this task. Since President Wang Jingwei's health was compromised, he went to Japan for treatment, and he is recovering well. The heads of the National Government are working harder, such as the acting president and the heads of various ministries, who have been working harder in politics and fulfilling their greatest responsibilities since the president left Nanjing, which is deeply admirable. I would like to briefly express my personal views on the National Government. First, from a political point of view, the National Government itself has recently shown a spirit of vigor. For example, personnel and systems have adopted a wartime system, and administration is also striving for simplicity and strengthening, which is being promoted step by step. Many of these have already been implemented, and I believe that everyone knows this well. Especially Shanghai, as the center of politics and economy for various countries, even with the recent changes in Shanghai, such as the changes in personnel in the municipal government, the adoption of a talent system, and the organization of public opinion organizations, at a time when the economic situation is difficult and the social situation is complex, the establishment of public opinion organizations can integrate the emotions and thoughts of officials and the people. Therefore, this move is quite important. In the future, the upper-level situation can be conveyed to the lower levels, and the lower-level situation can be relied upon to reach the upper levels. The establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee a few days ago, with 25 members, all of whom are recruited from the city's prestigious and important leaders from all walks of life, representing all the citizens, can also be said to represent all the Chinese people. It will not only provide advice on municipal administration but also make suggestions for the citizens. In the future, as the work of the committee gradually progresses, various problems can be solved concretely, and good results will definitely be achieved. I feel that Shanghai has recently shown a more clear phenomenon, and I am deeply pleased with this reform. Second, from an economic point of view, President Wang Jingwei of the National Government announced three major policies this year, the most important of which is to increase production. Currently, the National Government is very concerned about the policy of increasing production, such as concrete plans to increase the production of cotton and rice, and is determined to implement them. Furthermore, many factories in the Central China area, such as Shanghai, have been shut down and need to be utilized for manufacturing and production. Recently, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and various parties concerned have considered this plan and have concrete methods that will be implemented. Therefore, there will definitely be good results in increasing production in the future. Now that China and Japan are working side by side to complete the Greater East Asia War, they should always cooperate with each other. Japan will make its best efforts to cooperate with China in increasing production, developing factories, manufacturing industrial products, and so on. Therefore, the revival of Shanghai's industry is currently being enthusiastically researched. For example, the recent appointment of Ogura, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, who has many years of experience in the Japanese business community, came to Shanghai from Nanjing this time to exchange views with leaders from all walks of life in the city, which will be the beginning of cooperation in Shanghai's industry. The cooperation between China and Japan to seek the development of Shanghai's economy will gradually show signs, and I deeply believe that the Chinese people will also be very pleased with this.

Answering Questions Ambassador Tani then answered questions raised by the Chinese reporters: When will the abolition of extraterritoriality in China by the Allied nations be fully implemented? (Ambassador's answer) The abolition of extraterritoriality has been decided in principle, and Japan is researching it at all times, and has already begun the concrete abolition. For example, taxation rights are also one of the extraterritorial rights. However, regarding the complete abolition of extraterritoriality and when it can be completed, Japan and the National Government are currently cooperating and researching each other, preparing to implement it. When a complete solution can be announced, it is not yet the time to announce it. In short, Japan's cooperation with China will never cease. When will the factories managed by the Allied forces in China be fully returned to China for operation to increase production? (Answer) Currently, China and Japan are jointly fighting for the liberation of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the factories managed by the military will be determined based on future circumstances in terms of military relations. In recent years, the problems of commodity prices and people's livelihood in China have become increasingly serious. The control and rationing system itself has not been as sound as ideal. May I ask the ambassador, from the standpoint of the Allied nations, how will China be assisted in stabilizing people's livelihood in order to increase China's participation in the war? (Answer) I have explained this in detail in my thoughts. Japan is determined to cooperate with China with all its might, to seek to increase China's production, to suppress commodity prices, and to improve the economy. Then China's people's livelihood will be stable and the economy can be developed. Regarding the taxation issue of Japanese residents in China, what stage has it reached? (Answer) Regarding the taxation issue, Japanese residents pay taxes according to the tax items notified by the Chinese authorities to Japan. So far, the first notification has been completely completed, and the second notification has also been paid. We have not yet received the third notification from the National Government.

### Today is President Wang's Birthday; Flags are Hung Throughout the City to Pay Respects; The Municipal Government Holds a Celebration Ceremony

In addition to sending telegrams to pay respects, the municipal government has scheduled a celebration ceremony in the auditorium at 10:00 am today.

### Epidemic Prevention Injections Launched in All Districts of the City

The Health Bureau is carrying out the work of epidemic prevention injections in all districts of the city this year with great intensity. In addition to mobilizing the original municipal clinics to handle the issuance of injection certificates, it is also requisitioning epidemic prevention and health personnel who have been specially hired and trained to form five epidemic prevention squadrons, changing the original West Shanghai Squadron to the Takabashi Squadron, which will begin work today.

Certificate Style Upon completion of the injection, the injection personnel will issue a type of cholera prevention injection certificate from the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee. In addition to printing the date, age, gender, name, and other items on the certificate, the seal of the injecting doctor and the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee will also be affixed, and it will be stated that various items are strictly prohibited: The certificate must not be lent to others, and it must not be forged or privately accepted.

### Advisor Ogura Returned to Nanjing Yesterday Morning

The newly appointed Chief Economic Advisor to the National Government, Ogura Masatsune, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 25th of last month.

In order to meet the needs of the fact, it plans to continue to hold the 13th Boiler Stoker Training Class. It is hoped that various factories will send stokers and factory managers to receive training, so that they can understand the structural principles of boilers, as well as methods for saving fuel and maintaining safety during use. The two boiler engineers, Hu Yunsheng and Jin Zhixuan, who have been certified by the District Office, will give lectures and project charts using slides. The managers and stokers who participate in the training must first submit a letter from the factory to the Industrial Survey Office, Industrial Technology Training Night School, Room 335, 3rd Floor, 113 Hankou Road to register, and pay a lecture fee of 20 yuan. Other tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived. Those who have been trained and have obtained a certificate do not need to register. The class is scheduled to start at 6:00 pm on May 8th.

### First Bureau Administrative Office Strictly Investigates Illegal Weighing Instruments

The Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of the city, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from using illegal weights and measures, deducting quantities, and exploiting the public, has ordered the administrative sections of various sub-bureaus to send personnel to shops and firms in their respective jurisdictions at any time to inspect weights and measures. If there is a suspicion of a shortage of quantity, after verification that it does not meet the quantity, the shop owner will be handed over to the judicial authorities to be detained and sent to the court for legal action. It is also hoped that the public will cooperate and report unscrupulous merchants to the administrative sections of the various sub-bureaus for investigation.

### Dancing Girls and Singing Girls Must Register and Obtain Licenses

The Vulgar Customs Division of the First Police Bureau's Administrative Office in this city notes that there are a large number of dancing girls, female receptionists, and singing girls in this city. However, there are currently no regulations for issuing licenses and identification cards. Allowing them to operate freely makes management difficult. In order to thoroughly manage and facilitate crackdowns, they have submitted a request to the authorities and the Finance Office of the First District Public Office to implement registration and issue licenses, so that they can comply with the rules and become more perfect. The application procedures for licenses have already begun, and the division is responsible for handling them. The license fees and management rules will be officially announced by the authorities.

Brief Commentary

### Expectations of Ambassador Tani

Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, made a statement yesterday when he met with a group of reporters in Shanghai. He specifically expressed his expectations for the innovation of Shanghai, saying that the revival of Shanghai's industry is being studied. The other day, Mayor Chen said in his speech at the Municipal Advisory Council: "With economy, there is Shanghai; without economy, there is no Shanghai. If the economic problem cannot be solved, then the general problems of Shanghai cannot be solved."

We strongly agree with Mayor Chen's argument. At present, among Shanghai's economic problems, the shrinkage of industrial production and the operating rate of various factories are less than one-tenth of the normal level. In the midst of increasing production, which is the national policy, this is indeed a difficult problem to understand. If it is said that there is difficulty with power, then entertainment venues can still be brilliantly illuminated with electricity, while hospitals and factories face the same restrictions on electricity use. The distribution is extremely unreasonable. Secondly, passive restrictions are not the most appropriate method. It is necessary to actively transport fuel.

Some people advocate developing coal mines in Central China, which is certainly a fundamental solution, but it will not solve the immediate problem. The coal problem is not only related to industrial power but also to people's livelihood, which is equally important. We advocate hiring a large number of sailing ships to transport coal from Qingdao, Haizhou, and other places to Shanghai. We hope that the relevant authorities and entrepreneurs will work together to make this happen. Passenger trains can be reduced or suspended for a few days at a time, and trucks can be used exclusively to transport coal. Because most of the current passengers are not traveling for a specific purpose but are "running singles," which is not the normal clientele of the train.

Ambassador Tani has high expectations for Shanghai's innovation. However, it is currently only the beginning of innovation, and comprehensive results require more effort.

### Shura (3)

— by Iwata, translated by Hong Yang

That young man was Mutaguchi Takao. It was Takao who suddenly disappeared from Tozama Onsen.

On the road where he could only see the Milky Way in the darkness, he walked forward alone with his head down.

(It's painful to return to the apartment...)

In the three tatami-sized room, what awaited him were not just half-finished canvases and boards. Nor were they just dirty shirts and socks. The stench of turpentine, etc. As soon as he stepped into the doorway, countless poisonous snake-like anxieties and sorrows were waiting for him.

It was one kilometer from the station to the apartment. He deliberately chose a quiet road, taking several turns to make the distance as long as possible, and walked slowly.

(Ah! What am I going to do?)

This sentence had been on his lips for more than half a year. Whether it was day or night, there were many things in his mind that needed to be resolved. The fact that his face looked particularly old for his age was partly due to the hardships of life in Tokyo, but the influence of boredom and misery was a greater reason.

(I came to Tokyo with ambitions, but as a result, I have no way out).

Yes. When he was packing his bags for the journey to the capital at Kirishima Sulfur Valley Onsen, his whole heart and every cell in his body were burning with intense hope. He flew to Tokyo like a ball of fire in the sky.

That was the fire of Shura. It was the wild fire that burned in his heart due to the resentment of failing the physical examination at the old Naval Accounting School. It was the fierce fire of anger, resentment, and rebellion.

This ambitious young man from Satsuma's curse against the invisible fate was pitiful. He was angry and resentful towards the "Navy." The "Navy," which had completely overturned his deep desire to become a commander, accounting officer, and ship crew member, held an absolute resentment and anger.

(Okay, you hate me like this...)

He believed that the "Navy" hated him. He believed that he had severed ties with the "Navy," which he admired most in his life, forever. Therefore, to the same extent that he admired the "Navy," a fierce fire of anger broke out. He himself worked hard to take the path of hating the "Navy."

(I have already become the person most unconnected to the "Navy").

He made up his mind before going to Kirishima Onsen. At that time, he did not think of going to Tokyo, but of returning to his hometown.

(I don't want to see the faces of my military classmates. I don't want to see the faces of naval students of the detective type?)

### Huafeng Bank's Opening Ceremony Gifts Moved to Help Charity, Collected by this Newspaper on Their Behalf

Huafeng Bank in this port is co-founded by well-known figures in the financial community and is scheduled to open on May 6. It is reported that the bank received a letter from the Thrift Association stating that the congratulatory gifts received at the opening ceremony are mostly flower baskets and scrolls, which are wasteful. It would be better to give cash and use it for the Shen and Xin newspapers' scholarship funds and other charitable causes, which is in line with the purpose of thrift and also beneficial to practical matters. The method is very good, and the bank expressed its deep sympathy and decided to comply. Those who wish to send opening ceremony gifts to the bank are requested to send them directly to the collection office of this newspaper for safekeeping in order to simplify the process. As the congratulatory gifts will be used to help charity, regardless of the amount or distance, the fee is fixed at ten yuan per rickshaw and will not be sent separately.

### Lost and Found

Found Keys: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, someone found keys on Jiangxi Road. The owner can describe the situation and claim them at this office.

Lost and Found Fountain Pen: I picked up a fountain pen on the tram from the Bund to Shanzhong Road on May 1 at around 5:00 PM and handed it over to ticket seller number 656 at number 127 (Ferguson Road). The owner can claim it from the tram company. Xianrong respectfully announces.

Seeking a Cure for "Heartache": My mother used to suffer from heartache, which would come and go. Recently, due to old age and weakness, it occurs several times a day. When it occurs, her heart feels like it is being cut with a knife, and she also vomits. Various treatments have been ineffective. I think there are many experts in the country, so I dare to ask for a good prescription. This disease is quite common in the countryside. If a good prescription can be obtained, it can also be widely distributed, which would be a great merit. Reader Lu Wenzhong respectfully submits.

Small Yarn Factory Service Society: The Small Yarn Factory Service Society is responsible for design for the development of small yarn factories. They can also introduce technical personnel and purchase machinery. Those interested can contact them at No. 141, Lane 1143, Dongyouheng Road.
