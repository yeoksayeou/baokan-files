### The Spirit of Mutual Assistance

The newspaper business is our profession, but recently, we have initiated, participated in, and assisted in many social causes that are not related to the newspaper business. Perhaps some people think that we like to meddle or be nosy. In fact, we least want to meddle, and we certainly don't like being nosy. Our enthusiasm for social causes stems from our fundamental desire to do our utmost to promote the spirit of mutual assistance among the people, in order to create a social atmosphere of mutual help.

The late Mr. Huang Guangzi often talked about the spirit of mutual assistance among the Japanese people during his lifetime. In a speech to the New China Construction Association on April 18, 1934, he said: "In Japan, I saw that whenever a coolie was pushing a cart uphill, anyone would help him. Only our people do not have this spirit of mutual assistance, but instead stand by and watch, taking it as a joke. Our country has always only known 'each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on another's roof.' Now, we even ignore the frost on others' roofs, and don't even sweep the snow from our own doorsteps." He believed that this was a bad habit of the Chinese people. How can a nation that cannot help each other cooperate? How can a nation that cannot cooperate build a country?

Helping a coolie push a cart uphill is meddling, is being nosy, but it is a true expression of the spirit of mutual assistance of the Japanese people. Looking back at our country, taking Shanghai as an example, watching the excitement on the streets is a common mentality of most people. Whenever there is a quarrel, they rush to watch, fearing they will miss out. Japanese people help coolies push carts, Chinese people watch quarrels. Which is right and which is wrong in the expression of the national character of the two countries is worthy of our deep reflection.

Building a modern country is as arduous and difficult as pushing a cart uphill. The cart is heavy and large, and the hill is high and far. The carter's responsibility is truly a "heavy burden and a long road." China's current situation is like the cart reaching the middle of the slope. If it cannot go up, it will only fall down the slope. At this time, it is necessary to gather the strength of many people, work together, and push and pull in unison to reach the top of the mountain. Otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. As the ancients said, "A heavy burden and a long road; benevolence is one's own responsibility," and "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." The main idea is to explain this principle. Now is not a normal time. "Standing idly by" was already unacceptable in normal times, and it is even more unacceptable here and now. The inaction of the majority can lead China to self-destruction, while the united mutual assistance of the majority can promote China's early revival. Which to abandon and which to follow is worthy of our deep reflection.

We advocate mutual assistance with the sole hope that everyone, in addition to working hard in their own careers, will do their utmost to help all beneficial work in society. Regardless of the size of the matter, as long as it benefits the country and the nation, we should all cooperate to help and promote its success. Social undertakings can never be successful by the efforts of one person alone. The great cause of building the country requires the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. Society, the country, and the people themselves are all interconnected. The effect of a small matter can affect the entire country and society, and the benefits of this matter are not limited to a few people, but to the entire nation. Therefore, it is important for the entire nation to have a spirit of mutual assistance and create an atmosphere of mutual help. This is how the entire nation creates benefits for itself. The benefits created based on the spirit of mutual assistance are the most real and lasting.

### Great Achievements of the Japanese Academic Community: Introduction to Recipients of the Order of Culture

On April 29th, Tencho-setsu (the Emperor's Birthday), Japan held a ceremony for awarding the Order of Culture. At 10:00 a.m. that morning, the President of the Decoration Bureau, Mr. Seko, presented the decorations and certificates to the following six individuals (Mr. Kano and Mr. Takakusu were absent due to illness) in the President's office.

This is the fourth time the Order of Culture has been awarded since it was established on February 11, 1937. However, this is the first time that all recipients have been selected from the academic community. This shows the diligent research achievements of the Japanese academic community during this time of decisive battle. The six recipients of the Order have been working hard in their respective fields of expertise for many years, have written achievements, and have made outstanding contributions to the creation and development of Japanese culture.

The six recipients of the Order are: Mr. Tanakadate Aikitsu, an elder in the field of physics and a pioneer in the field of aviation; Dr. Okabe, a researcher of ultra-short waves; Dr. Shiga, the discoverer of the dysentery bacillus; Dr. Inada, an authority on internal medicine; Dr. Kano, a scholar of Chinese studies; and Dr. Takakusu, who published the Taisho Revised Tripitaka and established immortal achievements in promoting and popularizing Buddhist culture. Here is an introduction to their brief histories:

Dr. Takakusu Junjiro

Dr. Takakusu is world-renowned as a scholar of Indian philosophy and Sanskrit. He is 79 years old this year and was born in Chiba Prefecture. He was a student who received three yen a month. He and the late Dr. Hanaoka Takuzo were colleagues as elementary school teachers. The two were dismissed because they liked to talk about politics. Dr. Takakusu went to Kyoto and became a "clapper" at the Nishi Honganji Temple. He worked hard and diligently. His efforts were recognized by the Takakusu family, who adopted him and sent him to study at Oxford University in England and in Germany and France. While studying at Oxford, he translated the Chinese "Sutra of Immeasurable Life" and "A Record of the Buddhist Religion As Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago" into English, and clearly identified the most difficult place names in the book. This was the first time he left an immortal name in the world of Indian philosophy.

Dr. Takakusu's lifelong great work, from 1922, took ten years to publish the Taisho Revised Tripitaka, 12,000 volumes. This is an ancient scripture written by the Imperial Court of Shosoin, from the ancient manuscripts discovered in Central Asia, to the great collection of secret documents from various countries in the world, and with rigorous textual research, compared with the previously published Chinese translation of the Tripitaka, it shows unprecedented research results, and can be called an unprecedented event in Buddhist studies.

Dr. Kano Naoki

Kano is one of the world's leading scholars of Chinese studies. His Chinese literary talent is admired even by Chinese people. He is 77 years old this year. When he studied in China in his early years, he encountered the Boxer Rebellion and personally took up a gun to fight. This is a well-known story. Dr. Kano studied Chinese literature, philosophy, and history of philosophy at Kyoto University for more than 20 years. His knowledge is broad, and his insights are not limited to common customs. He surpassed the Qing Dynasty textual scholars in the precision of his scholarship. He is proficient in scriptures, poetry, calligraphy, and is skilled in both Chinese and English. Dr. Kano's attitude towards the study of Chinese studies is based on modern scientific research methods. As a Japanese, he can completely digest it, not adhering to one family's words, eliminating imitation, not tasting dregs, not losing the Japanese position, and surpassing the Chinese in academic vocabulary.

Dr. Tanakadate Aikitsu

Dr. Tanakadate Aikitsu was born in 1856 and is over 90 years old this year, but he is full of energy and no less than in his prime. He can be seen at various public and private gatherings. Dr. Tanakadate has four major achievements: the construction of Japanese physics, the unification of the metric system, the development of the Japanese aviation community, and the popularization of the Japanese language using Roman letters. What Dr. Tanakadate focused on was always ahead of others and not noticed by others.

Japanese physics education at the university level began in 1879 with the late Mr. Yamakawa Kenjiro, who was the first Japanese to teach it. After graduating from university, Dr. Tanakadate became an assistant teacher, and in 1883, he became an assistant professor. In 1891, he returned from studying abroad and was appointed as a professor. At this point, Japanese physics education was completely independent of foreigners. Until he resigned in 1917, he laid the foundation for Japanese physics in these 27 years, and his contribution to the prosperity of science today cannot be ignored.

Japan joined the Metric Convention in 1885. Dr. Tanakadate was a standing member of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and repeatedly attended international conferences. He also made great efforts regarding optical and electromagnetic units. Dr. Tanakadate recognized the importance of aircraft from a national defense perspective 40 years ago. In repeated questions in the House of Peers, in lectures, at the research facilities of Tokyo Imperial University, and in all aviation organizations and aviation-related matters, he exhausted himself in enlightening the people. His direct and indirect contributions to the Japanese aviation community cannot be counted.

Dr. Okabe Kinjiro

Dr. Okabe Kinjiro, known in the world of electrical engineering for his invention of the split anode and the "Osaka Tube," is 51 years old this year. Among Dr. Okabe's research, his work on magnetrons is particularly prominent. Japan's research on ultra-short waves has thus embarked on a practical track. Initially, Dr. Okabe succeeded in generating weak ultra-short waves from a magnetron. He continued to research and improve, and finally used a split-anode magnetron to generate a fairly strong extremely high-frequency wave. After it was announced at the Imperial Academy in 1927, it gave a great stimulus to the world's academic community, and made the production of magnetrons in various countries leap forward. Continuing to implement it, it eliminated the difficulties in wireless receiving and reporting, and in 1936, he invented a new type of oscillation tube, the "Osaka Tube," which made it possible to generate and modulate ideal, strong, extremely high-frequency waves.

He also invented the "electron-emitting magnetron," which increased the efficiency of the oscillator and amazed the academic community. In 1941, the Imperial Academy awarded Dr. Okabe an Imperial Prize for his discovery of the generation of extremely high-frequency waves by magnetrons and the invention of the Osaka Tube and the luminescent magnetron.

Dr. Inada Ryukichi

Dr. Inada's name is known for his research on beriberi and leptospirosis. To date, at the age of 71, he has published hundreds of papers. In 1915, in cooperation with Dr. Ido Yasu, he discovered the causative agent of Weil's disease, and also corrected the error of inflammatory yellow severe jaundice. In 1916, the Imperial Academy awarded him an Imperial Prize. In 1918, he transferred to Tokyo University as a professor, and in 1934, he retired due to old age. He is an authority on internal medicine. His main research publications include jaundice, research on beriberi, research on Japanese epidemic meningitis, and surveys and research on dysentery carriers. He is currently a member of the Academic Research Council, President of the Japan Medical Team, and President of the Japan Medical Association.

Dr. Shiga Kiyoshi

Graduated from the Imperial University Medical College in 1896. After graduating, he joined the Institute of Infectious Diseases as an assistant to Dr. Kitazato. In 1897, he examined the feces of many dysentery patients, and in the bacterial colonies that grew after their cultivation, he tested their agglutination reaction to the patients' serum. He discovered special strategies that concentrated various bacterial concentration reactions. He further studied this bacteria and finally confirmed that it was the causative agent of dysentery. In 1898, he reported his results at the academic conference, which is the so-called Shiga dysentery bacillus. He then manufactured dysentery treatment serum and carried out preventive vaccinations. He is 75 years old this year. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 30)

### Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Integrated War Results of the Army and Navy: 716 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in April

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th: The integrated war results of the Japanese Army and Navy units in attacking and intercepting enemy air forces in April are as follows: Enemy losses: In the South Pacific, 232 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 12 unconfirmed), and 101 were destroyed. In the Central Pacific, 147 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 6 unconfirmed), and 54 were destroyed. In Burma, 74 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 25 unconfirmed), and 66 were destroyed and burned. In China, 20 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 20 were destroyed and burned. In the North Pacific, 1 enemy aircraft was shot down and 1 was destroyed. The above totals 716 aircraft (including 43 unconfirmed). Japanese losses: 90 aircraft failed to return after bombing. 85 aircraft were damaged, totaling 175 aircraft.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The decisive air battle in the East Asian War is becoming more intense day by day. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the various Japanese front lines in April totaled 24,097, setting a record since the beginning of the war. The Japanese Army and Navy air force teams, in close cooperation, from the North Kuriles in the north to New Guinea in the south, and from the Marshall Islands in the east to India in the west, cooperated with ground troops in this vast area, escorting convoys, attacking enemy bases, and intercepting incoming enemy aircraft. With a small number of troops, they continued to fight bravely day and night. In April, they shot down 470 enemy aircraft and destroyed 242 enemy aircraft, totaling 716 enemy aircraft annihilated. The results of the battle were remarkable. 90 Japanese aircraft failed to return after bombing, and 85 were damaged on the ground, totaling 175 aircraft lost. A summary of the battles on each front line is as follows:

South Pacific

The air battle on the New Guinea front was the most intense. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked in March was 3,725, and in April it increased sharply to 5,302. In order to respond to the new landing operations in Hollandia and Aitape on April 22, the enemy, with the army, navy, and air force integrated, attempted to break through the Japanese strategic money in that area. The fight on that front will then tend to worsen. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked Bandara in March was 165, and in April it increased sharply to 970, indicating the enemy's intentions in that area. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked Bougainville Island in March was 6,050, and in April it decreased to 3,254. The enemy, in view of the Japanese army's major offensive near Torokina in March, concentrated the main force of the South Pacific air force on that front, and then entered a state of war. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Bismarck Archipelago remained frequent. The Japanese army greeted the incoming enemy aircraft day and night. The battle results on the Rabaul front were 232 enemy aircraft shot down and 101 enemy aircraft destroyed.

Central Pacific

The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the Japanese-held islands in the Central Pacific in April reached 3,062, which is sufficient to prove the enemy's strong war intention. The battle results in that area were 147 enemy aircraft shot down and 14 enemy aircraft destroyed.

Burma Front

As the Japanese army advanced into India, the enemy mobilized its existing air force and attacked repeatedly. The number of aircraft that attacked in April reached 7,364, double that of March. The Japanese army air force shot down and destroyed 140 of them (25 of which were unconfirmed), mostly large transport aircraft, Dc3, totaling 34. When the enemy was actively supplying the enemy troops encircled in Imphal and the airborne troops landing in northern Burma, the Japanese air force shot down so many transport aircraft, which was a major blow to the enemy.

China Front

The number of enemy aircraft that came in April was 296, which was less than the number of aircraft that came in March. The number of aircraft that came in March was 383. The reason for this was that the Japanese army launched an offensive operation against India, and part of it had to be transferred to the Indian front. However, due to this Henan operation, the enemy's activities may become active again. The Japanese air force's battle in that area resulted in the destruction of 20 aircraft.

North Pacific

Due to the completion of the enemy base in the Aleutians and the improvement of the weather, the number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April doubled compared to March, reflecting the gradually tightening situation in that area.

Thai-Vietnamese Front

The enemy's air raids on that area are still limited to guerrilla warfare. The number of aircraft that came was not much different from the previous month. Looking at the enemy's air raid situation as a whole, the number of enemy aircraft that came in March was 18,329. In April, it was 24,097, an increase of 5,768 compared to March. The above-mentioned air battles have now become the center of the war situation, and the enemy's air raids on the South Pacific and Burma will become more intense.

### Japanese Troops Continue to Advance on the Western Section of the Longhai Railway; Chongqing Acknowledges the Seriousness of the War Situation

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's sweeping offensive on the western section of the Longhai Railway has given Chongqing a major impact. A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing reported: "The fate of Luoyang is decided. The war has now advanced to 15 kilometers south of Luoyang City, and its fall is only a matter of time." A United Press staffer, based on frontline news, reported: "The Japanese army south of Luoyang City has advanced another 5 kilometers and is now only 9 kilometers from Luoyang." According to another Reuters telegram, the Chongqing government issued a war report on the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the 8th, saying: "The Japanese army moving south from the Beijing-Hankou Railway has occupied Xiping and is now advancing towards Suiping, 45 kilometers south of Yancheng."

Suizhou, 9th (Central News Agency) - A spokesman for the Chongqing Military Commission met with a group of foreign journalists and released the following information on the war situation in Henan: The Japanese army is attacking from the north and south in Henan. The distance between the two armies has progressed from 200 kilometers to about 100 kilometers. The northern army has now reached Yancheng, and the southern army has reached Queshan. If they continue to attack, their goal will not be difficult to achieve. It is expected that a major battle will take place in the western Henan plain. If the Chongqing army is defeated at that time, the important towns in western Henan, such as Luoyang, will also be lost. The threat to Chongqing is unimaginable.

### Central Authorities Hold a Ceremony to Join the War

A certain Japanese army base in Central China, 9th (Central News Agency) - A large formation of 40 aircraft of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Hankou at 14:20 on the 6th. The Japanese army combat troops intercepted them in the airspace over Xindi, east of Yuezhou, and immediately shot down eight of them and destroyed two of them. The other enemy aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on the banks of the Yangtze River and then fled.

### Germany Uses New Sharp Weapons; The War Situation on the Eastern Front Stabilizes; Soviet Tank Corps Suffers Heavy Losses

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reported: Since the 8th, two facts in this week's war situation are most worthy of our attention. First, after the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive between the Prut River and Moldavia and downstream of the Dniester River, it encountered failure and has not been seen in any movement. Second, the anti-axis air force's air raids on Europe have had to use dense clouds for cover this week. The German military authorities also said that the reason why the Eastern Front has been able to maintain a calm state is due to the excessive losses of the Soviet army. This is certainly due to the cooperation of the Romanian army, but at the same time, the German army's new attack tactics have also made a great contribution. The German army's specially made dive bombers equipped with anti-tank guns have an amazing effect on attacking tank formations. This tactic has been adopted by the German army since this spring. In future large-scale operations, it is expected to achieve great results.

### Japanese Marshal Koga's Naval Funeral Ceremony Scheduled for the 12th

### Japan's Shipbuilding Industry Achieves Rapid Progress; 10,000-Ton Ships Can Be Completed in a Few Dozen Days

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japan's shipbuilding plan for the 18th year has been completed, and the results have been more than double those of the 17th year. The planned production for the 19th year is expected to increase to two and a half times that of the 18th year, provided that labor and materials proceed smoothly. Under the guidance of the Naval Affairs Department and the management of the Shipbuilding Control Association, laborers have united and are making continuous progress. The shipbuilding industry in the 18th year has shown rapid progress. It started in response to the massive shipbuilding increase plan decided by the extraordinary session of the Diet in May of the 17th year. However, at that time, many non-standard ships were still under construction in various shipyards, so the results in that year were not very satisfactory, and shipbuilding capacity was not fully utilized. By the 18th year, most of the old ships of various companies had been completed, and all new plans had been established, and rapid progress has been made. The main contents are as follows: To thoroughly increase shipbuilding production and save materials, the basic wartime ship type regulations have been changed since the 18th year. The results have exceeded expectations. For example, it used to take about ten months to manufacture a 10,000-ton ship, but after the change, it can be completed in an average of a few dozen days in the shortest time. Since last year, the shipbuilding industry has been listed as one of the five major essential industries, and materials and labor have been given priority allocation. At the same time, the labor system has been changed to a day and night shift system, so its effectiveness has been greatly increased. Recently, in view of the increasing severity of the war, the morale of the laborers is also becoming stronger. For example, workers have recently been spending the night in the factories, embodying the true spirit of sleepless and tireless work by so-called day and night supervision.
