### Total War and Public Opinion Organs

Modern warfare is total war. The meaning of total war is twofold: First, in the process of total war, no matter where you are—east, west, south, or north—and no matter your age or gender, everyone will be affected by the war. Second, to strive for ultimate victory, in the process of total war, all the people must voluntarily participate in the war effort, contributing their manpower and material resources, and consolidating the nation's strength into a solid whole, only then can we defeat the enemy.

Total war requires a wise leader and a strong government. The responsibility of the leader and the government is not to passively prevent the people from opposing, but to actively seek the support of the people in order to obtain the cooperation of the entire population. How can this be achieved? The only way is to establish public opinion organs to serve as a communication channel between the government and the people.

The government authorities need not worry about the people's opposition. A wise government can turn opposing citizens into sincere supporters. How to do it? Through explanation, explaining everything item by item, so that the people understand thoroughly and have no room for opposition, and the people will naturally support thoroughly. The government cannot explain to every individual, so the public opinion organs organized by the people's representatives are naturally the most convenient target. The government must let all the people know that this war is not fought for a certain party, faction, or individual, but for the present and future interests of the entire nation. The government's actions must be for the benefit of the whole people, solve the difficulties of the whole people. These cannot be empty words but must be put into practice in everything. If the government does not do this, then the government cannot prevent the opposition of the people. If the government is truly working hard for the welfare of the whole people, then the government can use the public opinion organs to explain. Except for military secrets, any event, whether political, economic, or cultural, that is truly for the people can naturally be frankly told to the people. Difficulties in implementation and obstacles encountered can be used as an opportunity to ask for the cooperation of the people to facilitate the implementation. If the government can achieve "nothing cannot be told to the people," the people will naturally "support everything."

When the whole nation is at war, it is inevitable that the government's demands are pressing, the people's burdens are increased, and the people's lives are difficult. The people can tell these situations to the wise government and ask the government to improve. Who to tell? Naturally, the most convenient is the public opinion organs. Some burdens cannot be reduced, some difficulties cannot be avoided, and the government can rely on the public opinion organs to explain to the people on behalf of the government. Some burdens can be reduced, some difficulties can be avoided, then the public opinion organs are the eyes and ears of the government, and the government should try to reduce and avoid them according to public opinion. The government's good intentions and good policies often cause the opposite results because of the people involved in the implementation and the methods of implementation. The government's sight and hearing cannot reach these errors in personnel and methods, but they harm the people a lot and can affect the people's psychology. If the people have the opportunity to appeal to the public opinion organs, and the people's feelings are conveyed, the government can immediately rectify and improve. Such a government, anyone is willing to obey, anyone is willing to support. Such people naturally are willing to automatically contribute any force.

With unity from top to bottom, and consistency inside and out, then can will be concentrated, ability be concentrated, then can defeat the enemy and achieve results, and achieve final victory. Public opinion organs are the medium to promote this, so we repeatedly bring it up, hoping to draw everyone's attention.

### Japanese and Indian Forces Advance Like a Bamboo Splitter Towards Imphal; British Forces Retreat Along the Imphal Road

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – On the Indian front, the Japanese and Indian forces have broken into Indian territory from three sides, crushing the resistance of the British and Indian 14th Army, and are advancing rapidly into India. According to a report by the Associated Press, the Japanese and Indian forces have reached a place 20 miles from Imphal and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the British and Indian forces. According to an Associated Press reporter on the 24th, the Japanese and Indian forces have cut off the road between Imphal and Tiddim since launching an offensive in the dense forest area of the Kabaw Valley and the Chin Hills. The British and Indian 14th Army is now resisting stubbornly in isolation. Japanese troops are currently advancing along the road west and south of the Loktak Lake wetlands, approaching a point 20 miles from Imphal. At the same time, a second route of Japanese troops has reached Imphal Street from Tamu, 40 miles southeast of Imphal, and is advancing northwest along Imphal Street, eliminating British resistance along the way, and has advanced to a point six miles from Imphal. At the same time, the third route of Japanese troops, gathered at Bishenpur, is putting heavy pressure on Imphal. In the future, the British and Indian forces must defend the Imphal Plain to deal with the above major situation, and must ensure the two roads from Tiddim to Manipur and from Tamu to the hilly area.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base in India, 26th: The war in the Burma-India area has spread to the Imphal Plain, and the base of the enemy's Fourth Army is in a state of extreme chaos. Its 20th Division was ambushed by the Japanese and Indian armies from the north and south, and retreated in a panic, fleeing overnight with the 23rd Division along the two roads leading to Imphal. The Japanese and Indian armies attacking from the Tonzang area continue to advance north along the Imphal Road. The Japanese and Indian forces advancing from Tamu are using armored units to quickly pursue the defeated enemy. The great annihilation battle on that side is gradually entering the decisive stage.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Burma Front, 26th: The British 17th Division near Tonzang and Tiddim is on the verge of collapse. The British 20th Division in the Kabaw area was also completely surrounded by the Japanese and Indian forces near Moirang on the 19th, and is about to collapse. The Japanese and Indian forces, possessing artillery, broke through the Weitkyu Fortress, a key point in the Tamu forward position, and advanced towards the enemy at Bandhuk, ten kilometers south of Tamu, and launched a continuous general offensive against the enemy forces that were stubbornly resisting in their positions. Fierce battles will be fought in this area. Also, the Indian National Army and a certain unit of the Japanese army, which broke through the border west of Tansen, have penetrated deep into India and are advancing north. From the 17th to the 19th, near Keppen, about 20 kilometers from Moreh, they blocked the enemy's retreat route from Moirang to Palel. The Japanese and Indian forces, who crossed the Manipur River, broke through the dense forest and advanced southwest on the 15th. On the 19th, they cut off the enemy's northern trunk line at Mintha, 20 kilometers north of Moirang, and Tanan to its north, completing the encirclement of the enemy's 20th Division entrenched in Moirang. They are now making every effort to compress the encirclement. The fate of the enemy's 20th Division will be the same as that of its 17th Division, and its complete annihilation is only a matter of time.

### Commanders of the Eastern and Western Armies of Japan Replaced; Defense of the Japanese Mainland Strengthened

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 25th: General Senjuro Fujiie was appointed commander of the Eastern Army, Lieutenant General Sadamu Shimomura was appointed commander of the Western Army, Lieutenant General Yasuhiko Asaka will concurrently serve as president of the Army War College, and Ichiro Shichida was appointed president of the Army Science School. After this change, General Toihara, commander of the Eastern Army, and President Iimura of the Army War College, were transferred to important positions. The Japanese Army authorities, in view of the importance of the current Greater East Asia War situation, further charged the commanders of the eastern and western armies, who shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the Japanese mainland, and their strong lineup is extremely noteworthy.

### Brief Biographies of the Two Commanders

General Fujiie graduated from the Army War College in 1914 and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, assistant military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in France, and staff member of the peace treaty and the Geneva Disarmament Conference. He is known as a "European expert" in the army. Before the outbreak of the China Incident, he participated in the Xuzhou Campaign and the Wuhan Campaign as the commander of a front-line army corps. In 1935, he was appointed president of the Army War College, and in 1937, he was appointed commander of the Fourth Army. In February 1939, he was promoted to general.

Lieutenant General Shimomura graduated from the Army War College in 1916 and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters and a member of the Japanese Peace Treaty Implementation Committee in France. He was a plenipotentiary member of the Geneva General Disarmament Conference, and like General Fujiie, he was well-versed in European affairs within the Army Ministry. He was promoted to lieutenant general while serving as the commander of the Tokyo Bay Fortress, and later served as the president of the Army Artillery and Engineering School and the Army War College. In November 1942, he was appointed commander of the army corps in China. During the Chekiang-Kiangsi Campaign, he was known for his "two-sided encirclement tactics," which were highly successful and caused the Chungking camp to tremble at the name of Shimomura's offensive. During his tenure, he made great contributions to the maintenance of public order in the lower Yangtze River area and to military affairs such as liaison with the National Government in Shanghai.

### Japanese Forces Bombard Augusta Bay; Patrol Battles on Bougainville Continue

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – A spokesman for the U.S. South Pacific Fleet Commander announced on the 24th that Japanese forces had bombarded the U.S. beachhead in Empress Augusta Bay on Bougainville Island for at least two days, and that patrol battles on the island were still ongoing.

Lieutenant General Shichida has served in the Education Supervision Department and as the head of the infantry school and officer candidate school for many years, engaging in military education work. Therefore, his appointment as the president of the Science School is considered the most suitable.

### Intensification of Anglo-American Conflict

— Lu Wen

On the two major war fronts, the Allied powers of Britain and America are attempting an all-out military counteroffensive, while also extending their malicious political tactics in various directions, either to induce small Axis countries to withdraw from the war or to win over neutral countries to join their camp, and plotting to seize military bases and military resources. All this shows that they cannot confidently complete the military counteroffensive. But "those who are too clever are often foiled by their own schemes," and Britain and America are no exception, stumbling in their own plots. Various conflicts of interest have arisen between the two countries, leading to a state of contention. The pressure from the Soviet Union on the two countries is increasing, making them more anxious and deepening the rift in their alliance. The recent Anglo-American disputes are too numerous to mention, so I will try to list the main ones as follows:

1.  The oil issue in West Asia is a cunning tactic employed by the United States, which is becoming increasingly desperate as its domestic oil resources are gradually depleted. It originated in the plan to lay oil pipelines linking Soviet territory, the Persian Gulf in Arabia, and the Mediterranean Sea. This matter has also caused significant problems within the United States. As far as Britain is concerned, the United States' attempt to build a bridgehead for encroachment on the West Asian oil resources, which have long been virtually monopolized, is a source of extreme anger, and has become a major issue of contention between the two countries.

2.  Taking advantage of the new government in Argentina, the United States adopted a policy of coercion towards Argentina; the transfer of the Bartolomeo fleet to the Soviet Union; the United States' efforts to secure a Soviet-Finnish peace, etc.; many of the recent diplomatic strategies adopted by the United States have been based on the United States' own self-interest, acting unilaterally without consulting Britain, which has close interests at stake. Therefore, Britain has expressed extreme dissatisfaction.

3.  Regarding the opening of a second front in Europe, Britain and the United States are also fiercely competing over the proportion of troops to be contributed.

4.  Regarding various post-war issues such as currency, trade, resources, shipping, and aviation, Britain and America often assert their own interests and constantly argue. Post-war countermeasures can be said to be entirely their wishful thinking. The war aims of the two countries are nothing more than the goal of dominating the world. The disagreement on this matter indicates a split in war aims, which is the biggest obstacle to the Anglo-American alliance. On this issue, an unstable atmosphere has already been created between the two countries.

5.  In the East Asian theatre, the United States' attempts to appease India and Australia have become a source of displeasure for Britain. Especially in the war, the failure of the British Indian Army's counteroffensive in Burma has aroused the dissatisfaction of the United States, and a fierce competition of intrigue is currently unfolding.

### Strong Anti-British Sentiment in the United States

In addition, such as the recent questions in the British Parliament about the Atlantic Charter, and the theory of excluding foreign capital from the colonies, etc., reflect the current state of unclear relationships between the two countries. Anti-British sentiment in the United States is gradually becoming more intense. Recent American arguments are that Britain is responsible for this war, and that the United States has been dragged into the war twice by Britain, once in World War I and once in this war. Although the United States has served as the arsenal of the Allies, aiding Britain and other countries under the Lend-Lease Act, when asking for compensation, Britain has expressed disagreement, so they are denounced as ungrateful. In the past, the United States' aid of weapons to the Allies was never motivated by pure intentions, and it always asked for compensation, and it had insatiable desires even for countries that were its comrades. Does the Chungking regime understand this? If it does not realize this now, it may have regrets for centuries to come!

In short, Britain is gradually entering an old and decaying state, and its fate depends on its last struggle in this war. The United States is not a well-intentioned comrade, and it harbors the ambition to overthrow Britain's dominance of the world at the first opportunity. From the beginning, these two countries had no relationship that could be united and advance together. The contradictions and conflicts between the two are becoming increasingly apparent with the progress of the war.

### High Morale of the Indian National Army

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base on the Burma front: Subhas Chandra Bose, Chief of Staff of the Free Indian National Army, has been commanding the National Army on the Burma-India front for three months. He recently arrived here and said: The Indian National Army has broken into India under the great cooperation of Japan and Burma, and its morale is extremely high. The current war situation is more serious, so we must share a part of the Japanese army's strength. We are fighting for independence and will surely win a great victory, but it will take some time to occupy Delhi. Our army will never retreat, and will defend the land once occupied to the death.

### Japan Fully Supports Indian Independence; Chairman Bose Expresses Gratitude

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – When the Indian National Army invaded Indian territory, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo immediately reiterated to the world the Japanese government's determination to support Indian independence. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, issued a statement of gratitude on the 24th: After the Indian National Army invaded Indian territory, our war of independence has entered a difficult stage, but we are confident that heaven will protect us and will surely reward the trust of India, East Asia, and all of humanity in us. From now on, in addition to fighting, we will also implement new political policies on the liberated Indian land. We are convinced that this new political policy is telling the 380 million Indians the difference between self-government and being dominated by foreign countries. I anticipate that the enemy will carry out counter-propaganda out of panic and ambition. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo personally wrote to me and solemnly issued a statement to the world, and the Provisional Government of India, the National Army, and all the people of India express their gratitude for this. After the Provisional Government of India issued a statement on March 21 that the Indian National Army had invaded Indian territory, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement to the world clarifying the strong trust and sincere cooperation between Indians living in East Asia and Japan. We Indians are also fully aware, like Prime Minister Tojo, of fighting for Indian independence and for the righteousness of East Asia and the world.

### Statement by Japanese Prime Minister After the Closing of Parliament

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement on the 25th after the closing of the 84th session of Parliament, strongly stating that he was determined to do everything possible to increase war power, ensure the people's livelihood, and advance towards the final victory. He also earnestly hoped that all one hundred million people would rise up, work hard, and endure hardship to meet the requirements of the war effort. He requested Mr. Jiang to evaluate and finalize the selection. The original plan was to select three articles for each question, but the Central News Agency specially selected eight articles for each question. In addition to the top three, a total of ten good articles were obtained for the remaining two questions. These will be published in a small booklet by the Central News Agency. All manuscripts on the basic problems of the increased production movement will be referred to Guan Zhucun, editor-in-chief of the Central News Agency, in Shanghai. The Shanghai Selection Committee will meet at 5:00 p.m. on the 27th to evaluate and select the two questions and theses. After the selection, they will be published in newspapers across the country, starting from the anniversary of the return of the capital.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Jian'ou

Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) – Japanese army air units, on the morning of the 24th at 11:00 a.m., again used three large formations of bombers to bomb the Jian'ou airfield in the rain. The bombs they dropped hit the runways. Although the Chinese army fiercely attacked with intense anti-aircraft fire, all the Japanese planes returned safely to their base. At 4:30 p.m. that afternoon, they again attacked the Yushan airfield in Jiangxi Province, destroying all the taxiways. All Japanese aircraft returned. According to reports, the Chinese side had recently stepped up the construction of the Jian'ou airfield, extending the guide roads on all four sides, and was building hangars for parking large aircraft.

### Indian Residents in Hankou Hold a Celebration

Hankou, 25th (Central News Agency) – As the Japanese-Indian allied forces fought side by side on the Burma-India border and news of victories was frequently reported, the Indian Residents' Autonomous Association here held a grand celebration meeting at the Xingya Hall in the city at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th to celebrate the National Army's advance into the country.

### American Dollars Flood Chungking; Prices Continue to Soar

Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) – Recently, because of the flooding of American dollars in Chungking, prices have continued to soar. It is said that anti-American sentiment has been brewing among officials and civilians in Chungking. Recently, an article was published in the Chungking Central Daily News, titled "American Dollars Are Like a Flood," which is sufficient to reflect the above atmosphere. The gist of it is as follows: In the past six months, in front of foreign institutions in Chongqing, such as embassies, military delegations, or branch offices of various news agencies, speculators have often appeared in groups of three or five. Whenever they encounter foreigners, they always ask if they have American dollars. They can handle cash of 100 or 200 yuan. In short, if they have American dollars, they can make a profit. After the customs gold notes appeared on the market last April, they were equivalent to American dollars, with an exchange rate of 1 to 20 against legal tender. Foreign exchange is also based on this exchange rate. Gold has no fixed price, so the black market is rampant. Therefore, even the private funds brought by American soldiers and diplomats have become the object of speculation. In recent months, the black market has become more rampant. American gold bonds have jumped from more than 60 yuan to more than 140 yuan, American dollars have jumped from 80 yuan to 180 yuan, and gold has jumped to 27,000 yuan per tael.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Investigator Koichi Hori Passes Away

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Koichi Hori, a researcher at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, passed away on the 4th due to a double ulcerative colitis. Hori graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1920 and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as consul in Los Angeles and Tianjin, consul-general in Nanjing, head of the First Division of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and director of the Japanese Information Department in Shanghai. In 1941, he was appointed director of the Third Department of the Information Bureau. During the Greater East Asia War, he devoted himself to foreign propaganda work. In 1943, he was transferred to a researcher at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Political Situation in Hungary Tends Towards Stability

### German Forces at Cassino Use Sprayers

Zurich, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Lausanne Daily News reports from Berlin: Colonel Liedel described the battle for Cassino on the 25th: The German forces used smoke emitters to attack enemy tanks to confuse them in various battles at Cassino. These devices could fire ten shots. The American forces used phosphorus bombs and hand grenades, which were extremely difficult to treat if wounded. The American tactics were to concentrate a large number of troops in one place, using numerical superiority to defeat the few, often sending out forces eight times larger than the German forces. The anti-Axis forces have exhausted three divisions of troops in the Cassino area, so the battle of Cassino has reached its climax.

### Hull Plans to Establish International Organization; Britain and the United States Hold Preliminary Negotiations

Washington, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Havas News Agency: Senator Connally, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Secretary of State Hull intends to ask Congress to support drafting a plan to establish an international peace organization.

There is also fighting in the Balti area in northern Bessarabia. After German and allied forces repelled the Soviet advance, the Germans launched a counter-offensive southeast from Chernovtsy. The Soviet forces in the Tiraspol and Dubăsari areas are launching flanking attacks from the south, attempting to encircle the German positions at Dubăsari. However, they are facing strong German resistance, and the outcome of this battle remains unclear. A German communiqué claims that a counter-offensive in the Brody sector inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Northwest of Kovel, Soviet tanks were forced to retreat again. Several attempts were made to launch an offensive southeast of Brest-Litovsk, attempting to break through the German lines, but without success.

### First Police Precinct Baojia Office: Hosting Guests from All Sectors Today; Closely Connecting to Promote Baojia Administration

The Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct has been working tirelessly for several months since its establishment to reorganize the Baojia system within its jurisdiction. Recently, the office reviewed its past Baojia work and found it to be imperfect. Now that municipal administration in the city is unified and the evil forces of the concessions have been completely eradicated, the organizational structures of the Baojia self-defense groups should also be unified. Previously, the existence of the concessions hindered unification in the Baojia system. Furthermore, the citizen certificates issued made it difficult for citizens to travel throughout the country due to cumbersome procedures. To facilitate citizen travel, the office has decided, based on regulations issued by the Ministry of the Interior and in coordination with Allied authorities, to legally issue residence permits. This measure will not only benefit citizens but also greatly assist in maintaining public order, thus establishing a solid foundation for security. To facilitate citizens in obtaining permits, the office has established application guidelines. If the application procedures are not properly handled, citizens will face inconvenience and hardship. Although such incidents have not been reported in the past, they cannot be ruled out. To encourage close attention from all sectors, loyal cooperation from the Baojia, and effective collaboration with the sub-bureaus, the Baojia system within the precinct will be further improved. This measure, which supports the promotion of Baojia administration, is a new initiative since the recovery of the concessions. Now that municipal administration in the city is unified, it is gradually moving towards integration, so the Baojia organization and inspection methods will adopt past strengths and implement regulations promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, regulations have been established for exemptions from service in the self-defense groups, with government concern and close cooperation with the public. Since the organization of the Baojia in this city, it has achieved considerable success in combating crime. In the past, the organization lacked regulations and was not unified. The organization in the western district and the old eight districts differed greatly from the previous system under the old Shanghai Municipal Council. An institution called the Baojia Committee was established under the name of the Municipal Council. To foster closer ties with the public, this type of organization will also be established in the future, but it will differ in nature from the past. In the western district, part of the Baojia Committee established in accordance with the guidelines has recently been reorganized as a lower-level foundation after the office was established. Other aspects require the establishment of a self-defense group headquarters. Therefore, citizens are urged to cooperate. Director Chen has scheduled a tea reception at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant at 3 PM today to host officials from relevant authorities and prominent figures from all sectors in the city, as well as Baojia committee members of all levels above the Lianbao chief. It is expected that many notable figures will gather, and the event will be lively.

### Overview of the German-Soviet Spring Front

Continued from yesterday's first page on the Southern Front.

### Southern Front

The southern front, centered on Ukraine, borders old Poland to the west and the Balkans to the southwest. Needless to say, it is the main battleground for both the German and Soviet armies strategically, politically, and economically. Starting at the end of last year, the Red Army's 1st Ukrainian Front army west of Kiev continued to launch a large-scale southern offensive, with part of it penetrating old Polish territory. At the same time, the main force headed south towards Bessarabia, attempting to cut off the retreat of the German army within the great bend of the Dnieper River. However, it was thwarted by a German counteroffensive led by Manstein upstream of the Bug River. As a result, the Red Army's 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Front armies changed their strategy and instead focused on individually encircling the frontline bases of the German army within the Inhulets River bend, launching offensives in areas west of Nikopol, Kryvyi Rih, and Cherkasy. After several weeks of fierce fighting, the German army abandoned the battles of Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih on February 8th and 21st, respectively. However, in the Korsun area west of Cherkasy, they successfully broke through the Red Army's encirclement and moved westward.

In short, a semi-circular front line has formed from upstream of the Bug River to the mouth of the Dnieper River, and fierce offensives and defenses are currently underway. The Red Army's objective appears to be to make a deep breakthrough into southwestern Ukraine in two segments. The Red Army's 4th Ukrainian Front army, which is concentrated in the Kherson area at the mouth of the Don River, has not yet moved. The area west of there controls important seaports such as Nikolaev and Odessa, which will become new battlefields in the future. According to neutral sources, German and Romanian troops have completed their assembly near Nikolaev in the lower reaches of the Bug River and are preparing to meet the enemy.

On the other hand, the Red Army, which invaded the joint zone of Rovno, Lutsk and Ternopil in southeastern old Poland in early February, suffered major setbacks after the German army launched a strengthened counteroffensive. It is unlikely to launch any more offensives in the future and will probably strengthen its extended supply lines. The Red Army, which is only 140 kilometers away from the important hub of Lviv, is eyeing the city. It is expected that fierce fighting will break out in that area after spring. At the same time, 100,000 German and Romanian troops remain alive and well on the Crimean Peninsula, facing off against the Red Army under General Petrov in the Kerch region, and local battles are still ongoing.

The complexity of the southern front has been described above. The positions of the two armies are significantly close to each other in most areas, and the fighting has naturally turned into local offensive and defensive battles. The German army is reorganizing its formations. There has been little activity in the north-central front recently. It is unknown whether the Red Army's north-central offensive will turn into a feint to assist the southern front. The Soviet side attempted to inflict a fatal blow on the German army on the southern front in order to recapture strategic locations, but failed. Therefore, they are supplementing the strength and weaponry of the four Ukrainian Front armies commanded by Generals Malinovsky, Konev, Tolbukhin and Yeremenko, and there is no doubt that they will launch an offensive toward the aforementioned targets.

In short, the German army is well aware of the Red Army's intentions and is concentrating its forces on key points and implementing flexible counteroffensives. Because the Soviet continent is vast, it is impossible to achieve seamless defense. There are inevitably areas that are not adequately covered and that cannot be defended. Therefore, the German army's counteroffensive is a form of defense, not adhering to one particular place or area, but focusing on breaking up the Red Army's combat power. Therefore, fierce offensives and defenses will be launched at important locations along railways and highways in the future, and the German army's mobile warfare will also be greatly expanded.

### Rice Control Association Handles Regionally: Purchasing Rice, Discounting Cash, Limited to Acceptance Bills of Purchasing Merchants

Since the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the purchasing rice and grain loan syndicate formed with Chinese and other banks adopted the acceptance bill system, establishing a total discount amount of 700 million yuan, it has now allocated 450 million yuan out of the total discount amount of 700 million yuan to six locations, including Wuhu, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Nanjing, Taizhou, and Yangzhou, based on local needs to facilitate the allocation of funds. Purchasing merchants in these locations can apply for discounts on acceptance bills from the branches of the Bank of China (the syndicate's representative) in these locations. The allocated amounts are: Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Suzhou: 100 million yuan each. Nanjing: 60 million yuan. Taizhou: 50 million yuan. Yangzhou: 40 million yuan. When the syndicate's representative bank accepts a purchasing merchant's discount request, it will sign a discount contract, send it to the Rice Control Committee for certification, deduct the discount interest, and pay the cash. The use of the low-interest loan is limited to the purchase of rice and grain and must not be diverted for other purposes. Those who do not comply with the terms of the loan agreement or intend to take advantage of loopholes will be deemed to have violated the purpose of the Rice Control Committee's loan and will be punished accordingly.

### Investigation of Hoarding Continues

Market conditions in various industries remained relatively calm last week with no major changes. However, the authorities' investigation of hoarding continues to advance, and hoarders are facing serious threats. To prevent the relocation of hoarded goods for concealment, all goods transported in transit, whether they are controlled goods or not, must be inspected by checkpoint police. If a transfer permit cannot be produced, the goods will be considered illegally smuggled and the people and goods will be detained and investigated according to law. At the same time, citizens who are aware of such situations are urged to report them to the nearest police station or relevant authorities so that personnel can be dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation. If the report is found to be true, all such goods will be confiscated and forfeited to the public, and a fine will be imposed to serve as a warning and stabilize the market conditions for industry and commerce.

### Trade Associations Must Join the Chamber of Commerce

More than 300 trade associations in this city have been formally approved for establishment, but only about 200 have joined the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members according to the law. The relevant authorities in this city believe that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the largest group organization for merchants. After a trade association convenes an establishment meeting, it should immediately join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as a member and should not deliberately delay. It should also prepare a list of members.
