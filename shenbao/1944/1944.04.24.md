### Advancement for Civil Servants

We have previously suggested that the appointment of civil servants should be based on an examination system, that their livelihoods must be secured by all means, and that their performance of duties must be honest and diligent. Furthermore, we hope that civil servants will constantly learn and improve themselves.

"He who excels in learning can become an official, and he who excels as an official should learn," is an old saying, but Chinese people often only do the first half and forget the second. Generally, once someone "enters officialdom," even if they originally had some knowledge, it would likely become rusty over time, let alone improve. It seems that after becoming an official, one becomes disconnected from learning, and the lack of a desire for knowledge among civil servants has become a widespread phenomenon. It should be understood that the world today is a rapidly changing and advancing society. A modern person who cannot keep up with the times will immediately fall behind. Civil servants are crucial to the politics of a country, more so than the average person. How can outdated civil servants accomplish progressive tasks? Therefore, the lack of a spirit of continuous learning among civil servants can hinder the progress of both the individual and the nation.

This trend has been established for a long time. The reasons for this trend are no more than two: one is the lack of urgency in the work within their duties, and the other is the impropriety of entertainment outside of their duties. In the past, people idled in government offices and indulged in extravagance outside of them. Newcomers naturally imitate this, and the minority naturally follow the majority. Everyone unconsciously catches this habit, and the patients themselves, accustomed to it, do not even realize it is a disease. In such an environment, how can one talk about learning, how can one talk about advancement? This phenomenon is not only seen in government agencies but also increasingly found in other private enterprises in recent years.

To transform this undesirable trend, an extremely reformative determination is needed. To instill a spirit of progress in people, there needs to be considerable encouragement. "Disliking labor and liking leisure" is human nature, and habit is indeed a fact. Since self-motivation is impossible, the only solution is compulsion. Those in charge should lead by example and make the work more urgent. They can assign current problems to their subordinates for research, requiring grounded and practical research, not mere bureaucratic formalities. From this, those in charge can obtain many people's opinions and gather ideas for mutual benefit. Those doing the work can truly learn something, be forced to strive for advancement, read diligently, and conduct thorough investigations. As a result, they can recognize the need for knowledge and skills and eagerly replenish them to cope with the demands. The lazy will become diligent, the superficial will become practical, and the undisciplined will become serious, only then can a new atmosphere be created.

Supplementary education for civil servants after work should be widely promoted and seriously implemented, with rewards and punishments to encourage those who pursue further learning. Study programs should be established, and regular examinations should be conducted as criteria for promotion and demotion. In this way, at least the amount of improper entertainment outside of duties can be reduced, and people will engage in continuing education. At least, those who usually live in a drunken stupor will have to work hard to increase their knowledge for the sake of their future. At least, the academic atmosphere throughout the entire organization can gradually become more intense, with more opportunities for mutual learning and observation.

Civil servants are the drivers of a nation's politics. The more their knowledge and skills improve, the greater the power of political advancement. We hope that the knowledge of civil servants can always improve with the progress of the times, so that the politics of the nation can always progress with the times. Therefore, advancement for civil servants is the most urgent matter for both the nation and themselves.

### The India-Burma War and the Crisis of the Ledo Road

The Japanese army is advancing with unstoppable momentum. The British Indian Army, which boasted that Imphal was the main base for defending India, is about to be taken. The Indian National Army, in cooperation with the Japanese army, is marching triumphantly into their homeland. This blitzkrieg operation by the Japan-India Allied Forces is clearly a major blow to the anti-Axis front. With the inevitable fall of Imphal, the Chongqing government will suffer immeasurable pain.

Great Value of the Road

The fall of Imphal, which is only a matter of time, is a direct and decisive blow to the Ledo Road, on which Chongqing relies for its lifeline. The value of the Ledo Road is compounded by the existence of the Assam-Bengal Railway. Once the road between Imphal and Kohima is cut off by the Japanese army, the Assam-Bengal Railway, which connects to the Imphal Road, will be greatly threatened. This fact means that the crisis of the Ledo Road, which is intrinsically linked to the railway, is becoming more pressing every day. For the past six months, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, due to the inadequacy of the British Indian Army, has been secretly equipping itself in the Fort Hertz area of northern Burma. The previous airborne assault operation commanded by Major General Wingate was also aimed at securing the Ledo Road for the counteroffensive.

The Ledo Road originally started from Ledo, the terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway, passed through Ledo, entered Tengchong in Yunnan Province via Myitkyina, and connected to the old Burma Road through Baoshan, forming the Second Burma Road. It was the only supply route for the Chongqing army stationed in India and the US Army units. After the First World War, the British planned a railway line between Ledo and Mogok, and the road was built along that line. The completion of this road was intended to open a path for aiding Chiang Kai-shek and replenishing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and to actively invade Japan from mainland China. Under the guidance of Al. H. Smith, the builder of the Alaska Highway, the construction mobilized the Chongqing army stationed in India and many laborers transported from Chongqing by air, working day and night. The enemy propaganda called the road "the road to Tokyo," showing the extreme expectation of the enemy for the road.

Air Transport Ineffective

Currently, transportation to Chongqing and the US Air Force stationed there is via the so-called "air supply route to Chongqing" from Dinjan over the Himalayas and through northern Burma to Kunming. However, because it is air transport, its capacity is extremely small. Moreover, due to interception by the Japanese Air Force, it can only replenish the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city at most, and it is of little help in enhancing the fighting power of the Chongqing army. Therefore, securing the Ledo Road is currently the only way to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis front and to realize the ambition of the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city to bomb Japan. Therefore, the crisis of the Ledo Road will inevitably have a significant impact on Chongqing in both material and spiritual terms.

On March 27, a Japanese fighter-bomber squadron bombed the Digboi refinery (Ledo oilfield) between Ledo and Dinjan. This oilfield is the only place in India that produces high-combustion-value oil and is used to replenish the US Air Force stationed in the besieged city and meet Chongqing's needs. Recently, there have been plans to lay an oil pipeline from Digboi. The destruction of the refinery has had a profound impact on Chongqing, further intensifying its anxiety and depression.

What is the Attitude Toward India?

What is more noteworthy is why the Chongqing army stationed in India is fighting the Indian National Army, which is advocating the liberation of its homeland? What attitude will they adopt toward India's independence in the future? The internal chaos in Chongqing is becoming increasingly severe with the progress of the Indian independence movement. Bose's second statement on the construction of a free India, issued on the 4th of this month, has further intensified the internal turmoil in Chongqing. In this way, the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces' attack on India is having a decisive impact on the anti-Axis front, especially the Chongqing government. India and Chongqing are now exhibiting two states, one bright and one dark, of construction and collapse. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 9th)

### Advancing North along the Kaladan River: Japanese Army Occupies Paletwa; Battle for Imphal Plain Unfolds

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) — A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Kaladan front on the 23rd states: After the Japan-India Allied Forces decisively defeated the enemy and advanced on the line north of the Kaladan, they moved north from the river basin, broke through Misaung and Pipiwa on the night of the 17th, and advanced on Paletwa (Paletwa), the most important strategic point in the area, with unstoppable momentum. On the evening of the 20th, they finally broke through and occupied Paletwa. The Japan-India Allied Forces, advancing north on the right bank of the Kaladan River, divided into two columns and continued to advance. On the 15th, they captured Hill 524, nine kilometers north of the Kaladan, and on the 16th, they captured Nakakneil, advancing to Paletwa. The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces, responding to each other across the river, have thrown the enemy forces into chaos.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) — A dispatch from a base on the India-Burma front on the 22nd states: After elite Japanese troops penetrated a corner of the Imphal Plain, the enemy's resistance became fierce. Currently, the Japanese army is engaged in a magnificent and fierce battle to crush Imphal's circular fortress defense line, employing extremely subtle infantry tactics, and drawing worldwide attention. What exactly is this circular defense line, approximately 30 kilometers north-south and 10 kilometers east-west, which defends Imphal, and what is the large field position defended by the enemy's combined infantry and artillery? Since the Fourth British Indian Army dreamed of retaking Burma, it built a fortress on the India-Burma border mountains after the rainy season last year. Furthermore, it constructed an arc-shaped defense line on the hills surrounding Imphal, creating a radial-type position centered on tanks and artillery, which served as a counteroffensive base against Japanese infantry attacks from a strategic perspective.

### Enemy's Radial-Type Position Cannot Withstand a Single Blow from the Japanese Army

The hills around Imphal are continuous but only a few hundred meters high, and there are many dense forests. Therefore, the operational posture viewed from outside Imphal is constructed as a land-based radial-type position to block the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, which is actually based on the unique terrain of the Imphal Plain and the India-Burma border. The so-called radial-type position concentrates all firearms, such as field guns, mountain guns, rapid-firing guns, machine guns, and heavy machine guns, in the center of the position. Tanks form the outer ring, and troops are deployed in several radial formations on the outermost side, forming a circular-like position. That is, the radial-type position is composed of artillery groups and infantry groups. This radial-type position is linked to other circular-type positions, forming a large radial-type complex, making the Imphal Plain a large circular fortress. The radial-type positions are specially constructed in a chain-like manner at key points such as roads and intersections, so that even if the Japanese army cuts off the individual radial-type positions, they can be supported by air supply for a considerable period. The radial-type position is not a so-called permanent fortress. It is now being gradually captured by the power of Japanese artillery fire and ingenious tactics. In particular, because there are differences between the British and Indian soldiers defending the radial-type position, the military strength is uneven, which has caused the enemy army deep distress. Recently, the radial-type positions are only defended by Indian soldiers, making them even more vulnerable.

### Imminent War in Europe; Germany Has Confidence in Victory; Western European Defense Forces Stand Ready

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — As the atmosphere for an Allied landing in Europe intensifies, the German "Völkischer Beobachter" commented on the connection between the Second Front and the Eastern Front on the 22nd and revealed its belief in victory as follows: The calm state on the Eastern Front will not continue forever. War will break out again soon. The repeated setbacks in March and April against the Soviet army, although undoubtedly a blow to the Soviet army, have actually benefited the German army, as the front line is considered stable. The German High Command is currently making all-out preparations for all eventualities, and the morale of the German army on the Eastern Front is extremely high. Regarding the Second Front, if the Allied forces launch a landing operation this spring or summer, and the Soviet army also begins its attack, it will inevitably be an unprecedented encounter between the forces of both sides, resulting in a horrific and fierce battle. At that time, the world war will reach its peak and can determine the fate of the European people. The German people are awaiting the arrival of that period with confidence.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: German generals down to the soldiers in the occupied territories know that difficulties lie ahead and are prepared to overcome them. The Western European army is deployed throughout the provinces and concentrated in coastal areas. Gun emplacements and machine-gun nests are ready. Military alerts have also been practiced many times. Every gunner is familiar with how to respond to the enemy. Training has never ceased. In the long period of waiting, many soldiers have not only become skilled in special weapons but also trained in various combat methods. The experience of various battlefields, especially the experience of the Italian front, has been adopted to enhance defense capabilities. We are well prepared for all difficulties. Sentries at various coastal points are constantly monitoring ship movements and reporting them immediately. We know the situation ahead. The enemy will exert its power and resources to the utmost to determine the outcome here, but we are fully prepared.

### Italy May Launch a Diversionary Offensive

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) — According to the Scandinavian News Agency: As the Allied landing operation in Western Europe becomes extremely imminent, the German High Command has predicted that the Allies will also launch a new offensive in Italy at the same time as the Allied landing operation in Western Europe. The US forces at the Anzio bridgehead on the Italian front are continuously increasing new elite troops, which may be a symbol of preparing to land in northern Italy.

### US Forces in England Practice Landing Operations

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: The US forces stationed in England who will attack Europe held exercises at the beginning of the week, such as landing operations and evacuating the wounded. Senior British and American generals and Lieutenant General Lee, Deputy Commander of the US Forces in England, were present to observe.

### British and American Planes Attack Germany; Over a Hundred Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Military sources report: Last night, British and American bomber squadrons in several batches bombed the occupied areas of Western Europe and western and central Germany. A total of 122 aircraft were shot down, including 100 four-engine planes.

### Rumor that Soviet Troops Will Open an Italian Front

Milan, 23rd (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reports that some newspapers in southern Italy mentioned yesterday a radio message near Bari, strongly asserting that the previously rumored dispatch of Soviet troops to the southern Italian front would be realized in the near future. The dispatch of Soviet troops to Italy is based on the suggestion made by Navy Minister Teckelton and Air Force Minister Saidali. One point that is quite noteworthy in this matter is that Moscow requires that these troops be commanded by an independent Soviet commander and not be under British leadership.

### Temporary Calm on the Eastern Front Before the Storm; Frequent Troop Movements on Both Sides

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reports: The Soviet offensive has now stalled. On the other hand, the German offensive is also of a limited nature, its purpose being only to improve positions. This is the most peaceful period on the Eastern Front in months. German reconnaissance teams are busy exploring where and with what strength the Soviet High Command will deploy its divisions in the future offensive, and a fairly complete picture has now been obtained. In addition to concentrating its forces in the north and central sectors of the southern route, the Soviet army is also assembling fresh troops in the lower reaches of the Dniester. There are also frequent troop movements in the Soviet rear, but these movements are hampered by bad weather. This is the reason for the current calm on the Eastern Front. Behind the calm, preparations are underway for a large-scale war in the future. As for the German army, there are constant troop movements in the parallel zones in front of the front line, but their objectives are still unknown. However, from the number of their divisions, it can be seen that these units do not belong to the Western European, Northern European, or Southern European fronts. These powerful and well-equipped units appear to belong to the Eastern Front's reserve force. Military figures in Berlin are unwilling to disclose any information about the tasks assigned to these troops but expect that the German army is taking all possible preparatory measures. It seems that the Soviet High Command is preparing to launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front at the same time as the British and American armies invade Europe. German military figures believe that the current situation on the Eastern Front is "the calm before the storm."

### German Breakthrough Battle in the Ternopil Area

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) — Huitong News Agency reports: German troops in Tarnopol fought bitterly with the enemy during the day and carried out evasive actions at night, with almost no sleep, to break through the enemy's encirclement. The Soviet army in that area numbered about eleven divisions, with strong tank forces to assist, aiming to reduce the German garrison in the city, but nine of the divisions that have fought so far have suffered heavy losses and have now been transferred to the rear for reorganization. The Soviet army is constantly attacking German positions in Tarnopol and tightening the encirclement. Since the German army must deal with them, it can only move its positions backward at night, averaging 12 kilometers per night, or one kilometer per hour, so there is no time for sleep. The soldiers fought extremely bravely.

### Finland Rejects Armistice Conditions

Moscow, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd: The Soviet government issued a TASS statement on the morning of the 23rd stating: Peace negotiations between the Finnish and Soviet governments have broken down. Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd, Huitong News Agency reports: Moscow news, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky announced yesterday that Finland had rejected the Soviet armistice conditions. Vyshinsky reported the detailed process of the negotiations on the Moscow radio station, stating that Finland and the Soviet Union had conducted negotiations in the past few weeks to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire, and that Finland had sent a delegation to Moscow to listen to the true intent of the Soviet demands. According to his report, the Soviet Union insisted on the following points: The German troops stationed in Finland should be confined, or expelled before the end of April; the Petsamo area and its port should be ceded to the Soviet Union; the mining area should be ceded to Finland; reparations of 600 million US dollars should be paid, but the Soviet Union is willing to give up the demand for the cession of the Hango area. The Finnish government replied that Finland could not accept this request for technical reasons, otherwise Finland would lose its independence, and the burden on the Finnish people would far exceed their ability. The Finnish government is willing to maintain good relations with its eastern neighbor, but the Soviet proposals make it impossible to realize this wish. The Soviet government believes that the Finnish government has rejected its armistice conditions.

### Explosion at Norwegian Seaport

Oslo, Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd: German News Agency reports: According to news from here, a violent explosion occurred in the port of Bergen on Thursday, killing many people and causing considerable damage. The explosion occurred in a parked barge, and the entire city's houses were shaken. The port area suffered heavy damage. The exact number of deaths is not yet known, and the authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion.

### Several Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Central Pacific

### Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association Established Yesterday - Constitution and Committee Member List Approved

In order to promote the emergency increase in cotton production in Central China, the Ministry of Industry ordered relevant cotton organizations in Shanghai to form a Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association, and appointed Wen Guanting, chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, as the preparatory committee chairman to convene representatives from various organizations and institutions such as the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, the Central China Cotton Improvement Association, and the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute to prepare for the meeting. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (23rd) at 2:30 pm in the Xingya Building on the Bund in Shanghai. Attendees included Mr. Jun Hui, Director of the East Department of the Ministry of Industry and President of the Association, Vice President Wen Lanting, and all members. Officials from Chinese and Japanese institutions included Chen Yanyi from the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry, Liu Weijun, Director of the Insurance Appraisal Bureau, Huang Zhao from the Vocational Promotion Committee, Huang Bingxiang from the Trademark Bureau, Li Cheng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhang Feng from the Central Reserve Bank. From the Allied side were Minister Usami, Tatsichiro Funatsu of the Cotton Improvement Association, and over one hundred leaders from the Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn industries. After the ceremony, preparatory committee chairman Wen Lanting was elected as the temporary chairman of the meeting. After the opening speech and the report on the preparatory process by committee member and Secretary-General Li Zuchu, the constitution was approved and the list of committee members was selected, and the president and vice president took office. Then, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry gave a speech, Minister Usami gave a speech, and guest Tatsichiro Funatsu gave a congratulatory speech. Finally, the vice president gave a thank-you speech, and the ceremony concluded with refreshments.

Chairman Wen's Opening Speech

In his opening speech, Chairman Wen Lanting said: "The emergency increase in cotton production in Central China is one of the most important administrative policies this year. Our National Government believes that this urgent task must bring together responsible persons from relevant cotton organizations to jointly discuss and decide on economically appropriate strategies and promote their implementation in order to achieve results. Therefore, Lanting and others were elected to prepare for the organization of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association. According to the constitution, the Minister of Industry is elected as the president, and the vice president and committee members have also been pre-selected at the preparatory meeting and should be approved by the general assembly. Lanting is the oldest member of the preparatory committee, so he has been elected as the temporary chairman of the general assembly. I would like to say a few words here. I believe that the decline in cotton production in various parts of China in recent years is due to various man-made reasons such as the excessively low price of cotton. This year, the government has decided to protect cotton farmers, and it is believed that the price of cotton this autumn will not be lower than the price of other crops. After the establishment of this association, we should request various effective strategies and promote their implementation in order to comfort cotton farmers and achieve the goal of emergency production increase. We are very pleased that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, Minister Usami of the Allied Powers, and all Chinese and Japanese guests have taken the time to attend. We sincerely request detailed guidance so that we may follow it, and we are extremely grateful."

Report on Preparatory Process

Committee member Li Zuchu reported on the preparatory process of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association: "In the latter part of March of this year, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to announce a supplementary plan for the emergency increase in cotton production for this year, which was approved by the agricultural industry advancement conference. The relevant cotton organizations in Shanghai were ordered to quickly prepare for the organization of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association and the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area and other regional agreement associations in accordance with the provisions of the plan in order to coordinate appropriate strategies for the emergency increase in cotton production and promote their implementation. Representatives from various organizations and institutions such as the Cotton Control Committee, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China, the Central China Cotton Improvement Association, and the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute were elected to form a preparatory committee and hold preparatory meetings. Mr. Chen Yanshan, Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry, Mr. Kurokawayama, advisor to the National Economic Council, and Mr. Morihide Izukai, investigator at the Shanghai Embassy of the Allied Powers, provided guidance on the spot. The drafters elected by the preparatory meeting drafted the constitution of the general association, the rules of procedure for the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area Cotton Opening Conference Agreement Association, and the general rules for the regional cotton production increase agreement association, which were separately discussed and approved by the preparatory meeting. The general association committee members were pre-selected according to the general association regulations. Mr. Wen Lanting was elected as the vice president and Mr. To Qingdi and Mr. Takashi were elected as executive committee members by the general association committee members. Later, at the preparatory meeting, someone proposed that the Cotton Industry Association and the Japanese Cotton Traders Association should be added to the constituent members, which was approved by resolution, and Cao Qiming, Feng, Maeda Yasuo, and Kamimatsu were pre-selected as members of the general association committee. However, according to the provisions of Article 4 of the general association regulations, the accession of the two groups shall be recognized only after the establishment of this association. Therefore, it was decided to ask for retroactive recognition when the general association constitution is passed at the inaugural meeting. The preparatory meeting has been held a total of eight times, and three regulations have been passed, which should be submitted to the general assembly for deliberation and approval together with the pre-selected list of vice presidents and committee members of the general association."

Minister Chen's Keynote Address

Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry said in his keynote address: "In recent years, the National Government has attached great importance to and actively promoted agricultural production planning. In addition to food, the increase in cotton production is even more important for industrial development. If research on cotton production achieves good results, the adjustment of cotton prices and technical improvements must focus on all aspects of the cotton industry, and joint efforts must be made to research and promote them. Therefore, the significance of the establishment of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association lies in this. Since the Great East Asia War, the wartime economic policy of the National Government has been aimed at stabilizing people's livelihoods and ensuring military needs. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to urgently increase production. Therefore, the mission of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association is very important. I hope that all committee members in the association will work together under the leadership of Vice President Wen to study and promote cotton production increase work and achieve this goal."

Minister Usami's Speech

The establishment of the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Association today is a matter of great celebration for the future construction of a new China. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, cotton in Central China and cotton in North China have become cotton resources in the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their status is extremely important. In the past, cotton in Central China was increased by the Central China Cotton Improvement Association through the improvement of varieties and cultivation methods. Under the current situation, it is still difficult to meet the demand, and there is an urgent need to seek an increase in quantity. Therefore, this association is jointly organized by the Cotton Control Committee and other cotton industry groups in Central China to seek the active improvement and increase of cotton production in terms of both quality and quantity. From the perspective of the current pressing East Asian situation, it is indeed a timely measure. In the future, the most important issue for cotton production increase work is the issue of cotton purchase prices.

### Economic Bureau Orders District Offices to Collect Cloth Purchase Certificates for Distribution to Citizens in Each District

For the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has recently ordered each district office to quickly send personnel to the Fourth Section of the bureau to collect cloth purchase certificates. The order states: "Regarding the case of the city implementing the allocation of household cotton cloth, this bureau has obtained cloth purchase certificates from the Commercial Control Association according to the population within the blockade line of each district. It is hereby ordered that the district offices comply and quickly send personnel to the bureau to collect and distribute them to citizens in each district for purchase. This matter concerns population-based allocation and should not be falsified in any way. The handling situation should be reported for record-keeping." It is expected that the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in this city can be transferred to citizens by the district offices within days, who can then go to designated retailers to purchase it. According to reporters, the total population reported by each district office to the Economic Bureau is 3,452,227, including 2,372,500 in the first district, 71,750 in the second district, 147,000 in the third district, 55,987 in Xuhui Town in the fourth district, 21,906 in the fifth district, 173,552 in the sixth district, and 400,9532 in the seventh district. Compared with the 3,090,000 cloth purchase certificates issued by the Commercial Control Association, there is still a shortage of 362,227 certificates. It is currently reported that the authorities are rushing to make up the difference.

### Authorities Pay Attention to the Quality of Coal Briquettes

In order to strengthen the allocation mechanism of designated retailers in each district, the Municipal Economic Bureau recently issued an investigation form for designated retailers. The bureau has collected more than 120 copies of the investigation form for designated retailers of matches, soap, and coal briquettes in Nanshi and Zhabei. It is learned that the bureau is cooperating with relevant authorities to pay attention to whether the goods distributed by each retailer are adulterated or replaced, and whether the weight is reduced. Once the facts are verified, they will be severely punished according to law, and citizens are also encouraged to report any violations. As for the recent discovery by citizens that the household coal briquettes purchased are adulterated, or mostly broken, and difficult to burn, when asking the coal briquette retailers, they said that they were directly sent from the factory and there was no adulteration. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Economic Bureau about this, who said that the authorities are currently sending personnel to pay attention to the quality of the goods distributed by each retailer at any time, and ordered each coal retailer to pay attention to the quality of the coal briquettes delivered by each manufacturer. If the weight is insufficient or the quality does not meet the standards set by the authorities, they can refuse to accept them, and order each manufacturer to submit the sample of the coal briquettes to the authorities for review at any time. Therefore, the quality of household coal briquette allocation will be improved in the future.

The supervision includes the improvement of factory equipment and technology, the control of raw materials and electricity, and the adjustment of production prices.

### Sales Products Must Not Stop Wholesale

The Western industry has a great relationship with the health of the citizens. Recently, it has been heard that various medicine merchants have requested the authorities to adjust the price of certain medicines for various reasons such as cost relations. During this period, the pharmaceutical factory stopped the wholesale of the marked medicines, and the pharmacies actually had the situation of hiding goods and refusing to sell them. According to this situation, it not only violates the original intention of the authorities to suppress and stabilize prices, but also indirectly endangers the health of the people, and should be stopped as soon as possible. It is now learned that the authorities concerned will conduct strict investigations if the above situation is discovered again in the future. At the same time, a small number of pharmacies have not strictly abided by the authorities' regulations that various medicines must have clear markings. The authorities will also take appropriate measures against these pharmacies.
