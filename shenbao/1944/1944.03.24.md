### A Word to the Wealthy in Society

Yesterday's discussion on "Supporting the Police Consumer Cooperative" listed the weighty responsibilities borne by the police. However, the current treatment they receive is undeniably meager, making the comparison between the two extremely disproportionate and unreasonable. Therefore, while demanding that the police fulfill their duties, we must also consider adjusting their treatment and improving their living conditions. Only when their lives are secured to a minimum extent can we impose upon them the heavy responsibilities they should bear. This is a matter that should be considered in both theory and practice. Frankly speaking, if we only talk about responsibilities without considering actual living conditions, the police may not be able to fulfill their duties, and they may not be able to do anything about their own lives. Under such circumstances, the police will inevitably prioritize solving their own living problems as the first and foremost task, and regard fulfilling their responsibilities as secondary. If we calmly observe the current situation, it is very likely to evolve to this point. This is something that all citizens, especially leaders from all sectors of society, should jointly recognize.

During this decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, this city occupies an important base at the rear, and contributing all its strength to the war effort is an irrefutable responsibility. However, exerting all our strength is not a simple matter. It requires planning, organization, steps, unity from top to bottom, mutual cooperation, and gradual progress. And the most important prerequisite is that all internal efforts must be supported by external safeguards. Only then will such efforts not be in vain and will achieve the desired results. The so-called "external safeguards" are to ensure and maintain public order. Therefore, maintaining public order is a prerequisite for ensuring all forces participating in the war. This is a point that should be recognized by all.

Moreover, the closer the front lines are to the crucial decisive phase, the more deliberate sabotage by the enemy will be discovered in the rear. Therefore, maintaining public order, defending the territory, policing against traitors, and ensuring combat power are even more important. Whose responsibility is this after all? Of course, the local police bear the most arduous responsibility. We can say that maintaining public order is the responsibility of the local police, while improving the lives of the police so that they can serve with peace of mind is the joint responsibility of the government authorities and all the people of the city.

Now, Chen, the concurrent director of the First Police Bureau, and Deputy Directors Du and Su have initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative to gradually improve the lives of the police. The cooperative is actively preparing and is first requesting a loan of 40 million yuan from influential figures from all walks of life. The details have been published in yesterday's newspapers. We would like to sincerely appeal to leaders in the city's industrial and commercial sectors and those with wealth to pay attention to the importance of police responsibilities and improving living conditions, as well as the relationship between maintaining public order and Shanghai's security. Please assist the police consumer cooperative and generously lend funds so that it can be established as soon as possible. Moreover, although the cooperative is not a commercial profit-making entity, it often has inventory, which serves as collateral for the loan. Interest is also stipulated and repaid in installments, which is definitely not comparable to donations. The cooperative has set a deadline for raising the full amount of funds by the end of this month. We hope that...

Finally, it is worth mentioning that Mr. Ye Fuxiao and Mr. Lin Kanghou from the city's banking industry association, Mr. Yuan Ludeng from the city's chamber of commerce, and Mr. Wen Lanting and Mr. Zhao Jinxiang from the Citizens' Welfare Association have enthusiastically supported the organization of the cooperative. Particularly admirable is the fact that the Central Reserve Bank authorities have lent 2 million yuan and Mr. Sheng Youhui, chairman of the Central Asia Bank, has lent 1 million yuan, taking the lead in advocating. Other trade associations such as those in tobacco leaves, new medicines, matches, and chemical industrial raw materials have also lent huge sums. Xinwen Bao and this newspaper have also each lent 100,000 yuan to show their support. It is expected that leaders from all sectors of society, who have always been enthusiastic about public welfare and spare no effort, will surely follow suit, unite their efforts, and promote its success. This will not only be a blessing for the lives of the police but also for the future of Shanghai's public order.

### German Troops Enter Hungary; Stojay Forms a Cabinet; Assists Germany in the War Based on Mutual Understanding

Budapest, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a government bulletin released by the Hungarian News Agency yesterday afternoon: Based on mutual understanding between Germany and Hungary, German troops have already entered Hungarian territory. This measure is based on the joint operations of the Tripartite Pact countries to assist the country in resisting the common enemy, and especially to mobilize all forces to strengthen self-defense and counter Bolshevism. The governments of the two allied countries have decided to continue the spirit of friendship and joint operations between the two countries and strive for the final victory for the German and Hungarian people. As for the resignation of the Hungarian cabinet, Regent Horthy Admiral has ordered former ambassador to Germany, Stojay (Doeme Szeojay), to form a new cabinet, the list of which is as follows:

Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Stojay
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio: Layci
Minister of the Interior: Yolosh
Minister of Finance: Snayoy
Minister of Industry: Yaos
Minister of Commerce and Transportation: Cond
Minister of Agriculture and Supply: Jujeck
Minister of Justice: Temporarily taking charge of Church Affairs and Education: Chatay
Minister of Defense: Satui

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojay was born in Budapest on January 5, 1880. During the First World War, he served in the General Staff. In 1932, he was appointed military attache in Berlin, and in December 1935, he was appointed Hungarian ambassador to Germany, dedicated to the friendship between Germany and Hungary. Marshal Stojay is a representative of the Hungarian military, proving to be a continuation of the joint operations with the German army on the battlefield of the World War.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday's announcement stated that the German leader, upon the recommendation of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, appointed Dr. Fossenmanb as the German ambassador and plenipotentiary to Hungary. The former ambassador to France, Yago, has been recalled to the Foreign Ministry.

### Hungary Orders Dissolution of Social Democratic Party

Budapest, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After German troops, according to the agreement between Germany and Hungary, entered Hungarian territory from the west and south at dawn on the 19th, they were smoothly deployed along the railway lines and base areas near Hungary's capital, cooperating with the Hungarian police in security. The Hungarian government has ordered the dissolution of the Social Democratic Party, and the left-wing Napsava newspaper has also been ordered to cease publication. The domestic order is quite orderly, and the public is very calm. The number of German troops entering Hungary's capital is quite small, and the situation in the city has hardly changed. However, gatherings are prohibited. The wartime system in Hungary has always been slightly less tense than in Poland and Romania. However, from the day the German troops entered, the radio station stopped broadcasting, showing a renewed spirit. The new Hungarian cabinet will strive to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers and improve the wartime system. As far as the German army is concerned, although the Lviv-Odessa railway has been cut off, it is necessary to use the Budapest (Hungary)-Bucharest (Romania) railway trunk line to prevent the Soviet army from advancing. Politically strengthening Hungary's domestic defense, consolidating the rear defense of Hungary and Romania, and further strengthening the war of all allied countries, Germany, after consultation with the Hungarian government, adopted this security guarantee policy.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: Political circles here have expressed their enthusiastic welcome to the establishment of the new Hungarian government and the German-Hungarian joint defense agreement. Political observers commented on the official bulletin of Budapest last night, stating that Hungary now understands its obligations and responsibilities to Europe. Measures will be taken to resist communism, and steps will be implemented to eliminate defeatist elements in the country. Because the strength of the Hungarian army is insufficient to defend the border alone, German troops arrived in Hungary to assist the Hungarian army.

### Intensification of the European Air War Before the Opening of the Second Front

Before the unfolding of the Second Front, England, America, and Germany indeed initiated a preliminary battle, bombing each other. The war forces on both sides are now concentrated on bombing each other's cities. In the current war situation, the significance of bombing cities carries extremely important characteristics. Based on the materials that Lisbon was able to obtain, I will report on the situation of the Anglo-American bombing war against Germany and its differences:

England

There have long been criticisms of England's indiscriminate bombing of German cities. Mr. Biff opposed it in the Upper House, calling it blind bombing, but the government answered indifferently that this was a planned action. England calls the essence of this urban bombing strategic bombing, while other bombing is called regional bombing, destroying and burning the entire city.

In 1941, Germany's bombing of London and other places did not use its fighters elsewhere, but only damaged Britain's military and production facilities. The US bombing was also designed for the purpose of military bombing, but Britain manufactured bombers for the purpose of urban bombing, and urban bombing became the main purpose of bombing. This is a fact seen since last year. Before this, 70% of the British bomber fleet were twin-engine medium-sized bombers with limited range and bomb load. Now, most of them are large four-engine aircraft, such as Lancaster, Halifax, and Shillings. Therefore, the bombing method is also different from Germany and the United States and has its own characteristics.

The design of British large bombers can sacrifice armor and combat power to carry as many bombs and incendiary bombs as possible, with the principle of mixed throwing of bombs and incendiary bombs. The bombs are large, averaging 3.5 tons loaded by American aircraft. Therefore, when a thousand aircraft bomb, it reaches 3,500 tons. Urban bombing aims to destroy the entire city, and its focus is on incendiary bombs. Bombs are used to destroy transportation, waterways, and other fire-fighting equipment, anti-aircraft guns, and other ground air defense equipment, causing artificial winds to expand the fire. Therefore, incendiary bombs are specially dropped in places that cause fires. The result is not expressed in destroying specific targets, but only in dropping a certain number of tons of bombs and incendiary bombs in a certain area within a certain time.

During the bombing of Brunswick on January 14, 90 tons of bombs were dropped in one minute. Incendiary bombs. The highest record is 150,000 tons in one minute. Whether it is a school or a hospital, everything within a certain area is completely destroyed. This method is also called carpet bombing. Therefore, a large number of bombers have to be used. Its preparation also requires a long time and a large amount of materials. The technology of urban bombing is progressing fastest in England.

First, let's talk about the selection of the destination, which is carefully decided by the Intelligence Bureau and other agencies, and "the US also participates in opinions." The political and military production centers are the primary targets. Regarding the latter, the most attention was paid to the location of submarine manufacturing factories, and now it is aircraft factories. The attack method is to use heavy bombers to form a large team, and recently it has been attached with long-range bombers. The time is in the evening. Previously, it was only limited to moonlit nights that could identify targets, but recently, special thick dark nights are chosen to avoid sacrifices. This is possible due to the technological advancement of aviation law. First, meteorology must be advanced. Bombing is carried out by masking the shock layer, and the time to return to the base can be determined so that it will not be hindered by sudden and deteriorating weather. A surprise attack from England to Berlin and other places requires a considerable amount of whiteness, so it is very necessary to predict the weather.

Secondly, the use of radio wave detectors to detect the direction is also quite developed, and night flight is not considered a hardship. The third is the progress of the guide plane. This is a Mosquito, Lancaster, and Halifax with special equipment, and specially trained personnel sit in it and depart in front of the team. They use special sighting devices to find the target and plan when to bomb where, dropping various colors of flares. The main team sees these flares and can concentrate bombing in a certain time and place, even in the dark. The bombing of Hamburg and Berlin used this method.

This attack method has also changed Germany's defense methods. Using anti-aircraft guns and searchlights to defend from the ground is completely useless in this concentrated bombing, so it has become a method of using large and powerful night fighters to shoot down bombers. Therefore, the losses of the British heavy bombing teams with weak combat power have increased. The enemy chooses cloudy dark nights in order to hinder the activities of night fighters.

### Actively Strengthen Combat Power, Implement Victory: Summary of Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo spoke at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd, and the main points are as follows:

I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the government's determination to deal with the current major war situation. In order to adapt to the development of the war situation, the government decided on the outline of the current national administration at the end of September last year, and immediately took emergency measures. Recently, officials and civilians have worked together and made extraordinary efforts. In terms of combat power, especially the air force's combat power has been increasing day by day. This matter does not need to be repeated. The war situation is now increasingly tense, and the situation does not allow for a moment's hesitation. Therefore, new measures have been taken to closely integrate the command and state affairs. At the same time, the government, with emergency and extraordinary measures, decided on the "Outline of Extraordinary Measures for a Decisive Battle", and adopted a clearer policy for domestic administration. This extraordinary measure has completely gathered all the strength of the people to strengthen combat power, so as to complete the system of certain victory. In order to achieve a complete victory, the government will continue to study the best policies and adopt all necessary means. It has also launched a strong national general mobilization movement to boost combat power, increase production, ensure food supply, and defend the territory. At present, the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia have unanimously and closely cooperated to overcome various difficulties, and aim to destroy the Central Powers. The United States is again determined to construct a new order in Greater East Asia, and is working hand in hand to move forward. The spirit of struggle and the sincerity of cooperation with Japan of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia are truly admirable. At this time, the Indian National Army led by Jiang Tela Bous has closely cooperated with the Japanese army and is advancing towards India. What Japan expects from India is to return India to the Indians. Therefore, the land of the motherland India obtained by the National Army will all enter the administration of the Provisional Government of Free India. It is indeed a necessary reason. Today, it is fortunate to see India achieve independence and take a big step forward. It can be imagined. Looking at the European allies again, Germany has overcome various difficulties and has now restored its strong resilience. Its morale is even more boosted, and it is taking an offensive against England and the United States, which is extremely exciting for us for a long time, and we wish it more courageous fighting and strive to accomplish its great cause in the future. The war situation is now extremely serious, and the enemy is increasingly eager to force us, which is giving us the opportunity to annihilate the enemy and obtain an excellent opportunity to open up a path to certain victory. I firmly believe that the 100 million people will do their best to eliminate any suffering they encounter, actively and enthusiastically strengthen their combat power, so as to achieve the final victory.

### Making the Recovery of Liberated Areas Favorable for the Expansion of Operations: Bose Clarifies Two Major Obligations for the Future

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in Burma on the 23rd, Commander Subhas Chandra Bose issued a statement on the 21st in the afternoon regarding the Indian National Army's breakthrough of the border. He met with a group of Japanese and Burmese reporters and answered their questions. The Q&A is recorded as follows:

Question: What are your thoughts after the National Army broke through the border?

Answer: We are very satisfied that our National Army has stepped onto the soil of our motherland. At the same time, we feel even more keenly the great responsibility of defeating the British and Americans. Although the territory regained this time is small, it is still a pioneering achievement to be able to expel enemy troops with our own national army since 1857, which is truly deeply moving.

Question: What is the significance of the National Army's breakthrough of the border?

Answer: Britain has suffered successive defeats on various battlefronts around the world, and still naively believes it is absolutely undefeated in India. Now, it has been defeated by us. This is enough to show that Britain is gradually losing its power to defend India.

Question: What impact will this breakthrough of the border by the National Army have on the Indian soldiers in the British-Indian army and the Indian masses?

Answer: The impact of this breakthrough will become clear in a few days. In the past, the Indian people failed to understand our actions. This breakthrough of the border by the National Army will surely prompt them to awaken. Indian soldiers will also come to join our ranks as time goes on, and it will further make the Indian people confident that they can defeat Britain with their own strength and confirm that Britain is bound to be defeated. I will never engage in exaggerated propaganda, but only hope to crush Britain's attempts with the facts that will gradually be realized in the future.

Question: After the National Army's breakthrough of the border, how will the independence movement be advanced?

Answer: We now have two major obligations: one is to make the expansion of operations favorable, and the other is to restore the liberated Indian territories. The provisional government will promote ideal administration, which will have a great impact on other territories that have not yet been liberated.

Question: What will Britain's attitude towards India be in the future?

Answer: Britain will definitely increase its military strength to attempt to retake the territories that we have recovered, intensify its negative propaganda against Japan, and further suppress the Indian people.

Question: What impact will this have on the Chongqing regime?

Answer: When I attended the Greater East Asia Conference and broadcast to Chongqing from China, I appealed to the Chongqing side, hoping that they would recognize reality and cooperate with Japan, and not engage in wars between people of the same race again. At that time, it coincided with the Chongqing side's participation in the Cairo Conference, and Britain and the United States tried their best to flatter the Chongqing side, so the Chongqing side turned a deaf ear to my loyal advice. However, not only are Britain and the United States unable to help Chongqing, but they are already in a difficult situation where they must abandon their ambition to counterattack Burma. Therefore, the Chongqing side has been greatly affected. If this operation continues to progress further, the anti-Axis leaders within the Chongqing camp will also gradually reflect.

### Air Defense Headquarters Decides to Improve Air Defense Streetlights: Streetlights Throughout the City Will Be Restored with Reduced Light

Since the permanent blackout went into effect in this city on the 3rd of this month, the results have been good. However, some criminals have taken the opportunity to become active, and robbery cases have occurred repeatedly, which has greatly affected public order. Therefore, the police authorities are implementing special security measures. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city, regarding the issue of improving streetlights, also convened a meeting of standing directors to discuss the matter, and a decision has been made to improve them. Streetlights throughout the city will be restored, but the light will be reduced. Except for the 60-candlepower lights at major traffic intersections, all other ordinary streetlights will be reduced to 15-candlepower, and black cloth will be added to the sides to make the light shine downwards. At the same time, red and green traffic lights will also be opened as usual to maintain traffic safety. This improvement plan has been agreed upon by the headquarters and various lighting companies, and the replacement is underway, which is expected to be completed and lit up within a few days.

### Authorities Determined to Severely Punish Opportunistic Crimes

The First Police Bureau of this city, in order to prevent criminals from committing crimes under the blackout, issued a statement the day before yesterday, saying: "Recently, public order in Shanghai has deteriorated, which is regrettable. The authorities deeply feel that the responsibility is heavy, and in the future, they will cooperate with the military authorities and devote all their efforts to maintaining public order in the city. For unscrupulous elements who take advantage of the blackout to commit crimes, we are determined to punish them severely. We hope that the general public, on the one hand, will pay attention to locking their doors, and on the other hand, will go out as little as possible at night, especially women. We hope that they will actively cooperate with the bureau in this measure."

### Press Association Fetes President Miyazaki: Grand Gathering Held Yesterday at the International Hotel

Mr. Mitsuo Miyazaki, president of the Allied Japan Yomiuri Shimbun and president of the Burma Shimbun, departed from Japan to take up his new post in Burma. He passed through this city en route. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by plane the day before yesterday, but the flight was delayed and changed to yesterday. The Shanghai Press Association had already prepared to welcome him the day before yesterday, but also changed the reception to noon yesterday and hosted a banquet at the International Hotel. President Miyazaki also hosted a return banquet for the press of this city. Due to time constraints, it was held immediately during the seating, and everyone shared the meal.

### Attendees

Mr. Miyazaki, accompanied by Mr. Yoshikazu Koyama, Shanghai branch manager of Yomiuri Shimbun, Mr. Shotaro Miyake, deputy manager, and Mr. Yoshikatsu Nakagawa, Hankou branch manager of the same company, arrived on time. Also present were Major Izubuchi, head of the Army Press Department, Colonel Matsushima, head of the Fleet Press Department, Mr. Matsudaira, head of the Information Department of the Embassy Office, Mr. Murakami of Mainichi Shimbun, Mr. Nomura, director of Asahi Shimbun, Mr. Kawasaki of Domei News Agency, Mr. Bisaka and Mr. Akamatsu of Tairiku Shimpo, Mr. To Kabo of Chunghua News, Mr. Chen Bin Su of Shen Bao, Mr. Jin Xiong Bai and Mr. Lu Guangjie of Ping Bao, Mr. Jiang Xiaoguang and Mr. Zong Jingze of Kokumin Shimbun, Mr. Lu Feng and Mr. Wang Ping of Shin Chuka Shimpo, Mr. Hidaka of Shin Shen Bao, and Mr. Cheng Zhongquan and Mr. Zheng Hongyan of Sin Wan Pao, totaling more than fifty people.

### Remarks During the Meal

Mr. Lu Feng, chairman of the board of directors of the Press Association for the month and representing Shin Chuka Shimpo, delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "Burma is on the front line of the Greater East Asia War. The Indian National Army is assisting in the war and has charged into the country. Its position is extremely important. Now that Mr. Miyazaki is going to that place to engage in news reporting, we are greatly impressed. He will surely be able to exert the power of his position and be beneficial to winning the Greater East Asia War." Then, Mr. Koyama, Shanghai branch manager of Yomiuri Shimbun, delivered a speech, stating: "Yomiuri Shimbun has its current status and success due to Mr. Miyazaki's greatest efforts. Mr. Miyazaki is over fifty years old, but he does not complain about hardship and serves in Burma on the front lines. He truly has the spirit of youth and is worthy of emulation." Subsequently, Mr. Miyazaki delivered a reply speech, stating: "The Greater East Asia War has now reached the decisive stage. The Indian National Army has penetrated into its motherland, which is a bright guarantee for the future of the Greater East Asia War. Wherever our Japanese Imperial Army defeats the enemy, our press workers should also arrive at the same time. This is the mission of wartime journalists. I am going to Burma this time and plan to stay for a year and a half to engage in work. I hope to receive your guidance in the future." During the meal, Mr. Matsushima, director of the Fleet Press Department, delivered a speech, explaining the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the Burma-India area, that is, the victory of the war has been determined since the National Army entered its motherland. He also expressed his respect for Mr. Miyazaki's past contributions and recent efforts to the press. At the end of the banquet, Mr. Chen of this newspaper delivered a speech, stating: "Today's banquet, without distinction between guests and hosts, is like a family gathering, which can symbolize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and there is no distinction between guests and hosts. Especially China and Japan are brotherly countries, with the same script and culture, and the relationship is even closer. I just heard Mr. Koyama say that Mr. Miyazaki is over fifty years old and does not complain about hardship to work on the front lines, which is certainly commendable. However, recently, Mr. Tokutomi, a veteran of the Japanese press, published an essay entitled 'Idle Talk on the Current Situation,' proposing 'Serving the Country with Age,' encouraging the people to shorten their age by ten years and serve the country, that is, a sixty-year-old person does the work of a fifty-year-old, and an eighty-year-old does the work of a seventy-year-old. Then Mr. Miyazaki is just a strong man in his fifties, who is at the normal age to work for the country. Mr. Miyazaki said that he plans to go to Burma for a year and a half. We would very much like to hold a grand welcome party when Mr. Miyazaki returns to Shanghai at the end of next year. However, perhaps by next year, Mr. Tokutomi will propose shortening the age by twenty years to serve the country, then Mr. Miyazaki will be a young man of thirty, who especially needs to work hard. We sincerely wish Mr. Miyazaki's spirit will get better year by year, and his career will flourish year by year." Finally, Mr. Bisaka, head of Tairiku Shimpo, delivered a speech, stating: "I have worked with Mr. Miyazaki in Tokyo for many years. He is a veteran of the press, serving for more than thirty years. The close cooperation between China and Japan should start from the press. The relationship between the Chinese and Japanese press in Shanghai is very close now. Not long ago, we entertained Mr. Takaishi, president of Mainichi Shimbun, and today we are entertaining Mr. Miyazaki, which is a concrete manifestation of the close relationship between the press."

### Various Circles Enthusiastically Advance and Lend Funds to the Police Consumer Cooperative

The Consumer Cooperative of the First Police Bureau of this city is actively preparing, stipulating a capital of 40 million yuan.

### 66th Issue of Rice to Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Two Sheng of White Rice and One Jin of Number Two Flour

The First District Office announced: From March 25th to April 2nd, the 66th issue of rationed rice and flour will be sold by various retail rice stores in this district and by the rice warehouses of this office. During the above-mentioned period, citizens may purchase two sheng of white rice with the 66th rice purchase coupon bearing the registered number noted on the coupon, for a price of 23 yuan in national currency, and purchase one jin of Number Two flour with the 66th flour purchase coupon at the same rice store, for a price of 10 yuan in national currency. Furthermore, all retail rice stores in this district and the rice warehouses of this office will be closed for one day on March 31st.

### First District Office Improves Rationing Methods: Comprehensive Ration Card to Be Issued Starting in May

Since the merger of the First, Eighth, and West Shanghai districts, the Economic Department of the First District Office has been striving to improve rationing matters and methods, striving for simplicity to ensure people's livelihood. Yesterday, Mr. Wang Mai, chief of the General Affairs Section of the department, explained in detail the following points of improvement to the reporter:

### Numbers Printed on Each Coupon

The department currently handles the rationing of seven items: rice, flour, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, matches, and soap. In the past, separate ration coupons were issued for each item, and the purchasing procedures were frequent, which was quite troublesome for citizens to obtain the coupons. In order to simplify the process, the department decided to issue a comprehensive ration card starting in May. Each person will receive one card, and thirty numbers, numbered 1 to 30, will be printed in separate boxes on the card, with the registered number of the retailer noted. However, which item can be purchased with which number will be announced by the authorities at any time. Residents can tear off the number printed on the card and purchase from the designated retailer. At the same time, the registered numbers of retailers for various items will also be adjusted starting in May. Regardless of the store where the item is purchased, each card will be assigned a single number, and the store number will be based on the rationing merchant closest to the resident's home, so as to facilitate residents' purchases.

### West Shanghai Eighth District Under Unified Management

All rationing matters in the former West Shanghai Eighth District will continue to be handled by the department starting in the next issue. No. 57 Changan Road has been designated as the issuing office and is currently under renovation. Before the renovation is completed, it will be temporarily handled at No. 234 Huangpo Road (formerly Route Paul Henry). Furthermore, the rationing matters in the former Eighth District will also be under the unified management of the district, and the designated issuing locations are: No. 2 Nanhai Road (formerly Rue Fuli Li) for Taishan and Lujiawan districts; No. 485 Guilin Road for Luoyang and Petain districts; and No. 234 Huangpo Road (formerly Route Paul Henry) for Huangpu and Xiaodongmen districts. As for the coupon obtaining and rationing matters, they are exactly the same as in the First District.

### Household Increases and Decreases to Be Reported at Any Time

Furthermore, the former Eighth District and West Shanghai District did not accommodate the increase or decrease in household registration or the reissue or return of purchase coupons. After the department took over, it was decided to follow the old First District method for the above-mentioned situations. After obtaining a certificate from the neighborhood chief, the household registration tax receipt should be attached at any time, and the application for adding or returning the coupon should be reported to the designated coupon issuing office. Finally, it was mentioned that the addresses and registered numbers of the retailers of various items in the department will be adjusted uniformly starting in May to meet the needs of citizens and facilitate them.

### Special Consumption Tax in Various Districts Must Be Reported and Paid by the End of the Month

The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle the special wartime consumption tax. It has been levied since January 16th of this year in 15 key city and county areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, first levying the special consumption tax on retail items and banquets and hotels. It has been two months since then. In addition to the Shanghai urban area, other districts are newly established, and merchants and the public may inevitably be unclear about certain aspects. Although tax revenues in several districts are considered good, there are still some merchants and the public who procrastinate and fail to pay, and there are quite a few who attempt to evade taxes. In order to adjust tax policies and increase treasury revenue, the department has specifically ordered merchants and the public in various places to report and pay all taxes payable from now until recently in accordance with the law. Otherwise, those who fail to report and pay after the deadline will be severely punished in accordance with the law.

### Meningitis Epidemic Has Shown Signs of Abatement

According to the Health Department yesterday, the number of people receiving meningitis vaccinations every day is very enthusiastic. As of recently, more than 30,000 people have received the vaccination. It is said that the epidemic of meningitis has recently shown obvious signs of abatement, and the epidemic may still have a few patients discovered in the next week due to the change of seasons. However, in any case, it is hoped that it will disappear completely after next month.

Sports

### Football Ticket Prices Doubled

The Shanghai Football Association's league match this week, the甲組(First Division) match tomorrow, will be a match between a police team and the Jewish team at Jiaozhou Park. The day after tomorrow (Sunday) at 10:30 AM, the甲組(First Division) team Donghua will meet the Overseas Chinese team again. The football association authorities, in view of the inevitable crowding of fans, have decided to increase ticket prices starting tomorrow. Yesterday, the association issued a notice stating: "In view of the limited number of seats in the stands of the stadiums, and the fact that the number of spectators at each event exceeds the limit, resulting in disorder and difficulty in maintaining order, the stadium owners and the police authorities are quite dissatisfied. Therefore, it has been decided that starting this weekend, the price of tickets for matches at both the逸園(Yiyuan) and Jiaozhou Parks will be increased uniformly, to 40 yuan per ticket for ordinary seats and 80 yuan per ticket for special seats, in the hope of limiting the number of people and maintaining order in the stadium."

### Three Provincial Track and Field Teams to Hold General Practice on Sunday

The track and field teams of the Three Provincial Sports Associations in this city, in view of the approaching track and field season, will hold a general practice session at Hongkou Park at 3:00 PM this Sunday (the 26th) in order to prepare for battle. All team members will be present on time. The time the report was issued yesterday was 7:10.

Economic Sector

### Flour Committee Concludes Agreement with Banking Group: Flour Purchase Funds to Be Guaranteed by Warehouse Flour Certificates

Following the establishment of a 100 million yuan loan for wheat purchase with the Chinese and Japanese banking groups, the Flour Professional Committee has also jointly borrowed 50 million yuan from the two banking groups for flour purchase funds. The loan method is an overdraft of collateralized nature, using the warehouse flour certificates as collateral, with a term of six months and an interest rate of 8% per annum. The function of this fund is to purchase flour from various factories for unified distribution, but at the same time, it has a side effect on flour mills, that is, it can enable various factories to have funds to reissue acceptance bills and continue to purchase wheat. When buying flour from various factories, the committee will pay 20% of the purchase price in cash, and the remaining 80% will be used by the committee to repay the acceptance bills opened by the factory to the bank for purchasing wheat. In the future, if the factory needs to purchase wheat, it can continue to apply for acceptance bills. Regarding the flour mills under the control of the committee, there are 43 factories in the three provinces and two cities, including 12 in Shanghai, 4 in Suzhou, 11 in Wuxi, 8 in Changzhou, 1 in Zhenjiang, 1 in Yangzhou, 2 in Nanjing, 1 in Wuhu, 2 in Bengbu, and 1 in Taizhou. In terms of daily production, Bei Jian is the largest, followed by Fu Xin, No. 7, and No. 2.

### Iron and Steel Control Association to Investigate Inventory

The China Iron and Steel Control Association will conduct an inventory investigation of the iron and steel stocks of various cooperative unions under its jurisdiction in the near future, as this year is the actual production period. The categories include iron plates, screws, and zinc plates. At the same time, it has been learned that the China Machinery Control Association has drafted specific measures for the allocation of materials to assist Chinese factories.

### Jiangnan Paper Mill Expands Factory

Paper, which has a cultural mission, has recently become very expensive due to the smooth import of pulp raw materials. It has now been learned that the Jiangnan Paper Mill has successfully tested the use of local products to make paper and is now expanding its factory and rushing to build the project. It is expected that after completion in mid-April, it will be able to produce in large quantities.

### Grain Bureau Orders Various Industries to Report Member Rosters

In order to reduce the trouble in handling supplementary grain production registration, the Shanghai Special Municipal Grain Bureau has ordered the various grain industry trade associations to report the addresses, responsible persons, opening dates, total capital, and whether registration has been completed, and whether registration certificates have been obtained, within five days of receipt of the document, so as to verify and process them.

### Association Dynamics

The Shanghai Special Municipal Industry Trade Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai on Tibet Road at 2:00 PM tomorrow to elect the directors and supervisors according to law and discuss the draft charter.

In order to make the Shanghai junk boats, coal transport boats, and firewood boats closely connected and strengthen the transport capacity, the China Inland River 民船(Civil Boats) General Association has integrated the three trade associations and collectively called them the Shanghai Sailing Boat Trade Association. The association has established departments for firewood, lime, coal, and brick tiles at the lower levels.

The China South Import and Export Trade Association has been formally established. The association currently has 469 member units and is actively developing its affairs. The categories of materials managed have also been stipulated as follows: Various machinery and their parts; Metals (raw materials, non-ferrous metals, and their products, as well as silver dollars); Pharmaceuticals (for medical and industrial use, but excluding traditional Chinese medicine); Dyes and paints; Rubber (including old wire skin) and its products; Hemp and its products; Leather and fur; Tobacco; Cotton yarn, cloth, and their products; Soap; Paper (excluding burning paper); Cigarettes; Various automobiles and their parts; Gasoline and petroleum; Timber (logs); Ores and 洋灰(Portland Cement); Animal oils and waxes; Cotton (including 落棉(waste cotton) and machine-picked cotton); Sugar; Candles (and raw materials); Matches; Grass bags. The transfer of the above materials must be certified by the association's charter.

### South Pacific Frontline: Army and Navy Cooperatively Build the Battlefield

Thousands of miles from the motherland, the decisive battleground in the South Pacific, centered on New Britain Island, is continuing day and night in a bloody and tireless death struggle. Everything in that decisive battleground cannot be procured locally, so in addition to fierce fighting, the soldiers must also engage in construction warfare, and their labor is probably indescribable. In particular, the naval units escort transport ships fully loaded with troops, crossing the ocean under the enemy's aerial bombs and the enemy's潜水体(submarine force) activities, their labor is no less than that of the army units. This kind of collaborative army-navy desperate landing warfare, tireless to the death, with torches blazing and a well-practiced fighting spirit, is the true face of the frontline soldiers.

Linking New Ireland, New Britain, and New Guinea is a line that, for Japan, is the outer perimeter line of defense of the homeland and an important base line for operations in the South Pacific. Therefore, the enemy relies on its vast resources and numbers and wants to break through this line and come to wage a war of attrition. In island warfare with extended supply lines, the soldiers are fighting to the death against the enemy and nature, and they are suffering in every way. The army units' ammunition and rations must rely on the cooperative transport of the naval units due to the islands and terrain. Moreover, in the enemy's air superiority zone, there is the danger of group bombing, and the transport ships that painstakingly reach their destination will sink to the bottom of the sea if the unloading work is slightly delayed. There are many such examples. This is unknown to the soldiers fighting to the death on the front lines, but the desperate unloading work is being carried out under these circumstances.

### Cooperative Landing Operations

On Bougainville Island, the army and navy had long been cooperatively engaged in landing operations, truly demonstrating a valuable spirit of unity. Previously, on New Georgia Island, a naval officer served as commander of both the army and navy. When the army commander arrived, he replaced the naval officer as commander of both forces. This was not unique to New Georgia, but also occurred in New Guinea. The relationship between them was not merely "close," but from the beginning, they functioned as a single unit. Last year, on [date redacted], elite army aircraft, having decimated the enemy on Lontuba Island, eagerly departed from the [location redacted] base. One surviving aircraft, directing its course toward Lontuba Island, while patrolling the skies over Bougainville Island, suddenly spotted dozens of fighter planes. Initially mistaking them for enemy aircraft, upon closer inspection, they were indeed naval planes, coming to join the attack on Lontuba Island. The army aircraft, as if receiving a million reinforcements, their courage redoubled, braved intense anti-aircraft fire, and bombed enemy military installations. Upon confirming their successful strikes and beginning their return, the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense, and a large number of friendly aircraft were hit. Lieutenant Ando's aircraft, in particular, could not reach base, and he was forced to prepare for self-destruction or parachute at any moment. Though the aircraft's gunner had his thigh pierced by enemy fire, he acted as if nothing had happened, continuing to fire while sucking on an oxygen tube, until he collapsed in a pool of blood.

Lieutenant Ando continued to operate his damaged aircraft, attempting to return to friendly forces. With only twenty more minutes until they could return to Bougainville Island, the altitude was fortunately maintained at [number redacted] meters, but the landing gear had been destroyed, and a safe landing was impossible. Without a moment's hesitation, Lieutenant Ando, though knowing Lingering Root Beach [literal translation] Island was now within sight, resolved to land on the large sandy beach of the nearby isolated island. At once, the aircraft body swung to the left, abruptly facing the bank, and at this moment, the canopy had already flown off. Fortunately, the aircraft did not catch fire. A vehicle sped towards them like the wind, carrying naval garrison members. The garrison members, overjoyed at their safe return, were moved to tears and immediately transported Lieutenant Ando and the other crew members to the camp in the vehicle, treated their wounds, and offered them wine, showing a level of kindness not even extended to members of their own unit. Everyone was at a loss for words to express their gratitude, said Sergeant Rightmilling [literal translation] to the reporter when recalling the situation.

### Constructive Cooperation

The close cooperation between frontline army and navy forces is evident not only in combat operations but also in construction efforts. In the disease-ridden isolated islands of the South Pacific, nothing can be procured locally. From camps to roads, everything is made by the soldiers themselves. As the fighting becomes more intense, transportation becomes more difficult. To prepare for any eventuality, they must research methods for local food self-sufficiency, making their labors beyond description. Unlike the navy, the army units do not have mobile kitchens. If they consumed the crops of the indigenous people, the locals would starve, so in their spare time between intense battles, the soldiers cultivate the land as part of their combat duties. They have already cultivated many fields of various crops, achieving a state of self-sufficiency at the minimum level, which is a powerful asset for future operations. The navy also has many farmlands, opening up paths for local supply. The army and navy, hand in hand, march forward, striving to defeat the Americans and British, fighting day and night. No matter how the enemy counterattacks, they remain as unshakable as stone. Therefore, even those in the rear, in this unprecedented national war, must rise up and unite the front lines and the rear to destroy the enemy. Finally, we reiterate without reluctance that those on the front lines are neither army nor navy. All that exists is the solid visage of truly united, solemn Japanese soldiers. (Wing: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, February 12th)

### Mariana Sea Night Attack Record of Lightning Strike Aircraft

On February 23rd, following the Truk Islands, a comprehensive attack was launched on the Mariana Islands. The enemy's will to fight was extremely fierce, but the Japanese Navy's determination to win was even stronger. On the evening of the 22nd, following a report of the discovery of an enemy mobile task force, a lightning strike was decisively carried out at night, sinking three enemy aircraft carrier-type large warships, and destroying one aircraft carrier, achieving a great victory.

### Eager Departure of Attack Squadrons

On the morning of the 22nd, a certain Japanese airbase was filled with a determination to annihilate the enemy. Early in the morning, search aircraft, under the command of Sergeant Major [Name redacted], flew towards the distant sea, circling along the planned search line. Soon, they discovered the wake of an enemy mobile task force sailing below. At a location 470 miles east of [island name redacted], the enemy force consisted of at least [number redacted] aircraft carriers, along with battleships, cruisers, and destroyers forming a mobile task force. As soon as the base received this report from the search aircraft, it was thrown into a flurry of activity. With preparations complete, the first attack squadron was ordered to take off. Whether or not the enemy's attempt to invade Japan's South Seas territories would be thwarted depended on this mission. The skies above the base were now shrouded in secrecy, and the black curtain of night was about to envelop the earth. After the first wave took off, a second wave, commanded by Colonel [Name redacted], departed late at night. At dawn, a third attack squadron, commanded by Lieutenant [Name redacted], eagerly embarked on their expedition.

### Torpedoes Hit Enemy Ships

The first attack squadron, guided by [unclear reference], headed straight for the battlefield. In the pre-dawn sky, no moon hung, and the ocean was as dark as ink. The [number redacted] aircraft in the [number redacted] squad, after searching for the enemy in the darkness for many tens of minutes, suddenly came under attack from enemy night fighters taking off from an aircraft carrier on the flank. Tracers of various colors flashed past. Moments before this, the shadows of the aircraft carriers were visible, surrounded by fierce anti-aircraft fire. Advancing towards the side, they launched torpedoes, repelled enemy fighters, and quickly retreated. Looking back, they saw white waves erupting from the stern of the enemy aircraft carrier, followed by raging flames engulfing the entire ship. It was a truly selfless moment. After completing the attack, they flew back to their original defense sector individually. Sergeant Major [Name redacted] saw two fires burning far away on the dark sea. Before long, a large enemy ship sank into the sea. Having clearly witnessed the sinking of the enemy ship, the airmen could not help but exclaim with joy. It can be said that it was divine providence that they were able to achieve these results under such intense anti-aircraft fire and the challenges posed by night fighters, and in the obscurity of the night where it was difficult to distinguish directions.

### Continuous Expansion of Battle Results

The second attack squadron, commanded by Captain [Name redacted], was immediately attacked by enemy night fighters upon arriving at the battlefield. Each Japanese aircraft, overcoming the fierce interference of the enemy fighters, plunged straight towards the enemy ships. The blinding enemy anti-aircraft fire and the tracer rounds flying in the dark night sky created a scene of solemnity. Far away on the sea, an enemy ship struck by a Japanese torpedo burst into flames, illuminating the entire night sky. Near dawn, the third attack squadron, commanded by Captain [Name redacted], arrived at the battlefield and launched a final attack on the enemy forces, sinking ten large enemy warships. After completing the attack, the experienced Captain [Name redacted], aboard his reconnaissance aircraft, clearly surveyed the sea near the battlefield. The shapes of enemy ships were no longer visible, and heavy oil and other debris floated on the surface, confirming the results of the attack on the enemy. (Hiro: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, March 5th)

### New Tactics of the German Air Force

The country's retaliatory bombing against Britain and the United States has become increasingly intense recently. This month, British and American air forces bombed Berlin, with reports that as many as two thousand aircraft participated. According to foreign news reports, the aircrews of the British and American aircraft numbered twelve thousand. Including the headquarters staff and ground crew involved, it is estimated that no fewer than fifty thousand people were involved. Against this, the German aircraft numbered approximately one thousand, and the ground artillery units numbered approximately five hundred thousand. Therefore, the total number of personnel on both sides participating in this air battle reached approximately six hundred thousand.

The British and American air force formation consists of heavy bombers, light bombers, and heavy fighters, with a ratio of 3:3:1. Reconnaissance aircraft first probe the weather from the base to the target city and report back via telegram.

Upon receiving the telegram, the various bases scattered throughout southern England choose bombs and aircraft, and commence departure. Ordinarily, each base has about twelve to thirteen aircraft. To assemble one hundred aircraft, it is necessary to fly to a specific point from seven to eight bases to form a squadron. Fighter units lead the way, followed by heavy bombers, with fighters escorting them from above and to the sides. At the four corners of the heavy bombers are giant "flying fortress" aircraft that do not carry bombs but are equipped with fourteen machine guns and machine cannons, tasked with aerial patrol.

At the same time, the optical unit uses large numbers of short strips of paper and mica sheets covered in aluminum foil. When over enemy territory, the paper strips can disrupt the radar targeting systems, preventing them from accurately tracking, while the mica sheets reflect sunlight during the day and searchlight beams at night. Only shimmering light is visible in the air, making measurement with optical instruments extremely difficult.

German fighter units first engage the enemy fighter units, then attack their heavy bomber units. Recently, to cause the entire enemy squadron to collapse, they have been using fragmentation shells, which explode in the center of the enemy squadron, with considerable effect. These shells, even if they do not hit enemy aircraft, detonate within the enemy formation. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, March 11th) -

### Bankbook

— Sandy Plain

Last night, it drizzled and drizzled, raining all night long. In the morning, the sky was still gloomy, and the northwest wind was piercingly cold.

Meiling had been wide awake with insomnia all night, only falling into a hazy sleep as dawn broke. However, she awoke with a start a short time later, looking at the delicate "Omega" watch on her wrist, it was already half past nine.

She hurriedly got dressed, her fingertips feeling a little icy. Only then did she realize that the stove in the room had gone out long ago, and she loudly and quietly cursed.

"Zhang Ma, Zhang Ma!"

The door slowly pushed open, and Zhang Ma quietly slipped in like a ghost, her face full of smiles: "Miss, it's still early, why don't you sleep a little longer?"

"Stop talking nonsense, you old hag, you've been numbed by the New Year's bonuses these past two days. Look, the stove has gone out, and I'm freezing!"

"Yes, yes, I'll light it right away." Zhang Ma humbly replied, starting to work on the stove.

Meiling jumped out of bed and walked to the large mirror on the dressing table, fastening the last button on her collar. She spun around once, looking at herself in the mirror. The golden brocade glittered, enveloping her voluptuous figure. The stressful life of the past few days had added a touch of weariness to her delicate cheeks, giving them a sallow color. She felt agitated, filled with a chaotic feeling. She impatiently exclaimed:

"Hey, hey, go and get me a basin of water to wash my face, oh, and get me some snacks, quick, quick, I'm going out."

"Yes, but..."

"What? Stop talking nonsense, hurry!"

"But last night the master told me to tell you to stay home this morning, that young master Zhao is coming today..."

"Enough, enough, I really don't want to hear this nonsense. The people the master approves of are all those dull, bookish pedants. Do you remember that young man surnamed Qi who came to eat New Year's dinner on New Year's Eve? When I poured him wine, he was so flustered that he even knocked the wine glass to the ground. Humph, I really look down on such useless things!"

Meiling pursed her little mouth in the mirror, making a disdainful expression. Then she raised her right hand and struck a beautiful and charming pose very expertly.

Over her expensive gray wool coat, she put on a transparent raincoat, a new product from the USA. The light rain outside had started to fall again.

Zhang Ma poked her head in from outside and said, "Miss, the rickshaw is already waiting at the door."

Meiling took one last glance in the mirror, picked up her unusually bulging handbag, walked down the stairs, and then said to Zhang Ma, "Don't wait for me to eat!" She then climbed into the rickshaw's hood.

It was the morning of the fifth day of the New Year. The streets were deserted and cold, and the north wind invaded her entire body from under her cheongsam, making her shiver twice.

"Where to, miss?" the rickshaw driver asked after leaving the alley.

"Old North Gate, the platform!" Meiling's voice trembled slightly, partly because of the cold, partly because of excitement. She couldn't help but touch the banknotes in her handbag. At the same time, she couldn't help but think of her beautiful, exquisite bankbook.

She had a very deep impression of the numbers on her bankbook. - Last year, on her twentieth birthday, the number was exactly ten thousand yuan. That money had been accumulated since she was a month old. Of course, she had a particularly good feeling about New Year's. Every New Year, she could add one or two whole numbers. One hundred, two hundred, one thousand, two thousand...

Last New Year's Day, her father personally handed her the big red bankbook and said, "Ling, according to the law, twenty years old is adulthood. This money should be kept by you, but I hope you can take good care of it and use it well!"

Her classmate Xiao Ying's father was a senior manager at a business company. Meiling indirectly asked her to play the stock market. In the days before the New Year, the stocks were cleared out, and the amount of money in the bankbook was 67,000 yuan. Of course, it was proper to treat everyone, and a dinner at D.D.S. cost 4,000 yuan, which was a little painful. That day, she drank some wine and got a little tipsy. She danced a few fast waltzes with Xiao Ying. She felt a bit dizzy. Someone in the group suggested going to "The Platform" to "play." Xiao Ying's father was the first to agree, as he was an old hand. With one voice supporting the idea, a large group of people marched out of the iron gate and headed south. This was Meiling's first time, and she found it particularly new and interesting. She actually returned with a full victory, more than making up for the loss of her treat. What a way to make money!

School was on vacation; she was idle and bored. So she thought of that exciting and stimulating place again. She thought: Look, this is much faster than playing stocks. I can accumulate a very large number myself without having to spend any reward or treat fees. I want to get a "Spear" brand bicycle like Xiao Ying rides, buy a new [brand name redacted] "gramophone," and a diamond ring even bigger than the one on Xiao Li's hand!

So she hid it from her father and mother every day and ran to that place.

Her dreams gradually shattered, and the numbers on the bankbook decreased rapidly day by day. Fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand... On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, she rushed to the bank gate, but the doorman was already pulling the iron gate. She was no longer dreaming that beautiful golden dream, but secretly prayed: "God! Restore me to my original state!" But God's blessing did not descend on that place!

The first, second, third, and fourth days of the New Year, she lingered there all day long. On the evening of the fourth day, she returned home dejectedly, rummaged out the last eight stacks of banknotes, and stuffed them into her handbag. At the same time, she found that bankbook in her handbag and regretfully put it in the drawer. Today should be her last hope, oh God! Protect me!

The rickshaw stopped in front of "Ruby's" door. She waved familiarly to the young man and went through the doorway curtain.

A wave of sultry and unpleasant air rushed to her cold face, like a flame, quickly scorching her cheeks. In an instant, it scorched her whole body, scorching her chest. Seeing piles and piles of easily available banknotes piled high on the platform, the flame of her hope soared up again like a fountain. At this time, she was like a brave fighter, with her handbag as her weapon, preparing to fight the enemy desperately.

"Open it!" the sharp cry of the "Three Dice Treasure" girl sounded.

She walked to the crowded platform. Someone wearing a single layer of clothing had been defeated and had withdrawn. She immediately filled that gap.

The One Three Dice game on this platform had already opened nine consecutive "Big" rolls. The numbers recorded in the record book were two full columns of "red" characters. The philosophical theory that fat Mr. Chuan had instilled in her suddenly flew back into her mind: the dialectical "law of the interconversion of quality and quantity"!

"Big"'s quantity should have accumulated enough, right! She thought to herself:

--Then, it should change to "quality" -- "Small"!

She opened her handbag, wham! A stack of banknotes was thrown onto "Small." Her heart was full of confidence.

"Good: Opened 'Small,' miss, help me out, open a small roll so I can get my fix!"

That enchanting Guangdong girl flirtatiously struck up a conversation with her, then handed over a plate of dry, small oranges.

"Open it! Open it! Open! Three, five, six, fourteen points, big!" The girl with her face covered in powder skillfully opened the treasure bowl, and then put on a very realistic sigh of regret:

"Hey, these dice are not helping!"

However, she remained calm. She was still planning:

-- "Big"'s quantity has increased again; the possibility of a "quality" change has also increased, "Small"--

So two stacks of banknotes, wham! That Guangdong girl spoke Shanghai dialect again in a businesslike tone:

"Okay: bet again, this time it must open small!"

"Opened it, opened it! Double five, one two, twelve points, big! Straight run! -- The Guangdong girl made a face at Meiling. Meiling forced a casual smile. She pulled a cigarette out of her handbag, appearing very leisurely as she smoked. Her forehead began to perspire, her fingers were ice-cold, and her cheeks were flushed.

--Eleven consecutive "Big"! Damn it! It has to be "Small"! Damn --

Four stacks of banknotes, wham, wham, wham, with one wham open! Double four, one three, eleven points, big! --

--Eleven points! Damn, so much "quantity"! How can the "quality" change... Damn... Sixty-seven thousand... What a pity... What to do!"

Meiling's eyes were seeing gold stars, and her ears were filled with the noisy voices, curses, and cheers. She stared blankly at the three dice in the bowl. The dice seemed to enlarge and turn into three skulls.

She unconsciously threw the last stack of banknotes on "Small." She lowered her head, no longer having the courage to look at the bowl, only muttering in a low voice:

"Change 'quality'..." Change... "Law of the interconversion of quality and quantity"!..." However, the sharp sound of the Guangdong girl seemed like a strong electric shock:

"Three sixes ah!" Accompanied by the shouts of the crowd, like thunder, resounding in her ears, she seemed about to fall backward. Fortunately, someone behind her was pushing against her, supporting her body.

--It's over, it's over!

In an instant, she became a defeated soldier, no longer having any strength. She unconsciously, struggling, squeezed out of the crowd. She was aimlessly among the people, blindly walking east and west, bumping into everything. She only had one simple thought, what to do! What to do! What to do!

She reached into her handbag, no longer able to find a single bill. Maybe her fingers were too useless. She thought about sticking her head inside to look. She walked under the bright gas lamp and carefully searched again, but she was completely desperate. There was no help, no one sympathized, her heart was broken, her body was collapsing! What to do! What to do! Go back, no, sixty-seven thousand, what would her father and mother say. She seemed about to collapse on the ground, her whole body sinking, unable to support itself.

Beside the stairs, the ghastly green neon light was shining, and her nerves suddenly jolted: pawn, pawn, pawn? She thought of the gift her aunt had given her for her twentieth birthday: the watch!

Pulling back her left sleeve, the golden, streamlined "Omega" shone. It was her most beloved thing! Pawn it?

--No! But the number sixty-seven thousand was jumping before her eyes. She was unwilling, she wanted to make one last struggle -- there was only a glimmer of hope left! She lingered in front of the pawnshop entrance, her footsteps hesitant. She had never done such a thing before -- Shame! Immoral! However, the flames of hope and desire continued to dance, gnawing at her heart. She bit her lip.

The delicate watch left her wrist. She took the two stacks of banknotes in a daze, like a sleepwalker, and walked back into the crowded crowd.

But this foam shattered in one gust of wind. In the bustling sea of people, this foam did not stir up the slightest ripple, although this foam was irreparably destroyed!

Then it was that simple thought again: what to do! What to do!

Her mind was empty, as empty as foam. She only had to paint her hope on the empty foam! She wanted to create a new foam to maintain her hope!

She walked into the pawnshop in a daze again.

She came out in a daze again. She pawned her raincoat and coat!

Revealing the dazzling golden brocade cheongsam on her body.

Sitting in the rickshaw, her whole body was shaking, the north wind ruthlessly eroding her body.

Zhang Ma opened the door and looked at her with strange eyes. She lowered her head and walked up the stairs, opening the door to her room. The room was dark, and the fire in the stove in the corner was leaping with a dark red flame. Her eyes were full of tears, and the flames turned into countless red snakes, creeping and leaping. She didn't bother to turn on the lights in the room. She was only groping aimlessly. Her hand touched the nightstand. Subconsciously, she opened the drawer and took out the bankbook. She was very familiar with the delicate, rectangular, scarlet treasure. She aimlessly caressed it. In the dim light, she could still faintly recognize the inch-large inscription -- Paid!

### One of the Most Exciting Scenes in the Football League: A Preview of the Tung Wah vs. Overseas Chinese Athletic Association Match, Deeply Hope that Tung Wah Studies Tactics to Overcome Strong Opponent

At 10:30 AM this Sunday morning, a football league match will be held at the Recreation Ground, promising to be one of the most exciting scenes in the league. The contestants are the ever-victorious Tung Wah team and the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association team, which has transformed with foreign players. According to the current standings, since the Cosmopolitan team suddenly announced its withdrawal from the league, there have been no changes. Tung Wah still holds the top spot with an undefeated record. The remaining two matches are one against the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association and the other against the Police Force. As long as they maintain one draw in these two matches, there will be no problem for the championship. Therefore, this point is no longer worth emphasizing. What is important is whether they can maintain the title of the ever-victorious team. Considering the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's impressive performance of defeating the Cosmopolitan team 5-3 last week, they have indeed regained their former glory. Tung Wah's victory is not entirely optimistic. According to the author's analysis and contribution to Tung Wah's tactics, it will help wise men avoid oversights.

### First, Let's Talk About Momentum and Psychology

Based on Tung Wah's momentum, they are invincible. In order to maintain their undefeated record, they will naturally exert their strength. In this psychological aspect, they have the ambition to win at all costs. They should be able to work together and achieve success. The Overseas Chinese Athletic Association team has no hope in the league, only competing for rankings. The match against the Cosmopolitan team was exhilarating, showing that their momentum is not weaker than Tung Wah's. Furthermore, in terms of psychology, they have the ambition to overwhelm the ever-victorious team. Since the foreign players joined the Three Provinces Athletic Association, their lives have become stable, and they are loyal to their masters. The success or failure of this move greatly repays their owner. Therefore, in the foreign players' psychology, there is also a situation where they must win. From this perspective, momentum and psychology are almost equally important.

### Let's Discuss the Offensive and Defensive Strengths of Both Teams

Tung Wah's offense is better than its defense. All five forwards are at their peak. The excellence of the two wings is indeed better than other teams, but the defense seems to be slightly weaker. In particular, goalkeeper Zhang Banglun's inability to remain calm in the face of formidable opponents is a major shortcoming. The Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's foreign players do not have Tung Wah's sharp forwards. However, the whole team is very balanced, without special advantages or significant disadvantages. The whole team can attack and defend, and everyone is strong and healthy. The most valuable thing is that goalkeeper McNulty has the spirit of one man guarding the gate, invincible to ten thousand. His style of getting the ball to the person is unprecedented in Shanghai. Therefore, in general, Tung Wah's offense is better than the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's, but the defense does not seem as stable as the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's, and the difference between the goalkeepers is very large. It is difficult to predict the outcome, as each has its own strengths. However, a bloody battle will surely attract the attention of fans. It can be said that everyone will be out on the streets. In addition to appreciating the skill, we also place great expectations on our Tung Wah team. The author offers some humble suggestions to Tung Wah.

### Tung Wah's Offense Should Adopt a Dashing Strategy, and the Defense Should Avoid Rushing Too Far Forward

It is difficult to break through the gate guarded by the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's McNulty with brute force. It is necessary to use speed to dash into the near post and gently flick the ball into the goal, which is the easiest way to score and is also what McNulty fears the most. Fortunately, Tung Wah has Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Li Yao, who are quite capable of doing this. It is hoped that Lin Jing and Sun Jinshun will provide more opportunities for the three to dash in, so that goalkeeper McNulty will have no way to exert his ferocity. Furthermore, when Tan Fuzhen and Qian Xiangjin get the ball in the center, they can quickly pass it to the right wing between Jia Youliang and Han Longhai. At this time, with Longhai's speed, he can dash in to block a defender, allowing Youliang to calmly flick the ball. This is the most applicable tactic. Moreover, Tan is good at this flicking the ball (rarely seen recently), why not do it? As for Tung Wah's defense, they should cover the shooting area within 20 yards of the near post, leaving as few loopholes as possible. However, Bao Jie and Kabrow of the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association are good at taking cold shots from outside 20 yards, with exceptional accuracy and urgency. This point seems to be beyond Li Zhuang's ability to handle. In addition to Ji Gubanglun paying close attention, it is also hoped that Liang Shutang will use his full strength to entangle them or try to switch positions with Zhang Lingen. Because Zhang is taller and stronger, he should be able to block the opponent's long shots. In short, Tung Wah's defense should avoid rushing too far forward, the forwards should pay attention to the opponent's inside forwards, and the defenders should focus on the two wings. By being brave and intelligent, there is no reason why they should not succeed.

Latest news, the foreign players this time have also gained three new reinforcements, one center forward, one left wing, and one center back, preparing to make a desperate gamble, vowing not to be reconciled if they don't win against Tung Wah. If that's the case, then since the enemy team is pouring out all its strength, it is the time for our Tung Wah to show its might and skill. May our athletes not have any discouraged feelings and overcome the enemy. Is it only the author's hope? Encourage! Encourage!

### Hua Ying Basketball Team's Expedition to Jiaxing: A Camp Follower's Account by Mei Bixian

The Jiaxing Sports Ground specially invited the Shanghai Hua Ying Basketball Team to Jiaxing to perform exhibition matches in order to raise construction funds. The team's spirit is excellent, and it has received good reviews from the audience in the West Qing League. In terms of basketball skills, it was originally worth seeing, and the star power added to the appeal. People in Jiaxing rarely see the true face of Mount Lu. Their arrival one day was bound to cause a sensation. The invitation from afar was certainly not without reason. The Hua Ying team also felt obliged to organize and depart, taking an early train to Jiaxing a month ago. In addition to the team members, the accompanying members included consultant Bai Chuan and team leader Li Dashen, communication personnel Ni Xinfu and Shi Jiupan, as well as cheerleaders such as Xi Qiu Xia, Zhang Fan, Chen Juanjuan, Nai Yangliu, Zhang Minzhu, Wu Zengying, and comedic star Guan Hongda. However, the second sister of the four sisters, Chen Qi, was unable to accompany them, which was regrettable. The reporter was also invited to join the expedition and write a camp follower's account to do justice to this trip.

The train departed at 10:00 AM and arrived in Jiaxing at 12:10 PM. The local welcomers led them to the Grand China Hotel for lunch. A basketball game was originally scheduled for that afternoon, but the opposing team was also invited from Suzhou, and the train was delayed, so they could not arrive until after 6:00 PM. Therefore, it was impossible to hold the game. So, they temporarily invited female stars to perform songs and dances, which was also to increase revenue. As soon as the news spread, over 500 tickets were sold instantly. The female stars, in view of the love of the fans, gladly agreed and showed off their singing voices after the movie ended at the China Grand Theater. Yangliu sang "Exchange," Chen Juanjuan sang "Quit Smoking Song," Zhang Fan sang "Selling Candy Song," and Zhu Qiuxia sang "A Smile is Worth a Thousand Gold" and "Don't Forget Tonight," which were well received by the fans. Especially Zhu Qiuxia's song almost swept the crowd, and her reputation was truly well-deserved.

The entire group stayed at the Misty Rain Building, located in the center of South Lake, surrounded by water on all sides. The environment was extremely quiet. The bedding and utensils were all Japanese-style. Having lived in the city for a long time, one suddenly felt relaxed and refreshed, and all worries disappeared. Leaning on the railing and looking down, the waves were as smooth as a mirror. Looking up, the moon was faint and the stars were sparse, and the water was hazy and the clouds were casting shadows, which was another unique charm, making people exclaim in admiration. Suddenly, a song came from the water, gentle and sad. Hearing it late at night, it felt even more desolate. Su Shi described it as "like weeping, like complaining, like longing, like admiring, the hidden dragon dancing in the secluded valley, the lonely woman weeping in the lonely boat." This situation and scene were similar. The reporter recalled that he had come here on his honeymoon when he was newly married. Now, returning to the old place, the past events were vivid, but his wife had become a corpse in the yellow earth. He could not help but feel sad from the bottom of his heart and wanted to cry. Alas! Alas! If he had known that he would have these memories, he would have regretted taking this trip.

The game was held at Jiaxing Middle School at 11:00 AM the next morning. Hua Ying played against Ping Guang (the school team of Jiangsu Provincial Second Middle School). The field director Pu Yiping and Mei Xi (who could not play due to a foot injury) served as referees. After the start, Hua Ying won by skill and took the lead step by step. In the first half, they won 12-7, and the final result was 20-10, with Hua Ying triumphant. Hua Ying used a five-man defense tactic this time. The positioning was excellent, and it was impossible to improve it. The opponent found it difficult to find a gap to enter. The people of Jiaxing marveled at it. The opposing young students were better in endurance, so they fought bravely to the end, which is why the score did not go up very sharply. The entire Hua Ying team worked hard and made contributions, while the Ping Guang team was slightly less experienced and lacked basketball tactics. It was not easy to achieve this result in the mainland.

After the game, they rested briefly and returned to the Grand China Hotel for lunch. General Manager Wu Wenchao said that the expedition had been completed and they had returned victorious, so he urged them to drink a few cups. The reporter, who loved to drink, couldn't help but drink heavily with fellow townsman Tao Ji Bie Jun, gradually entering a drunken state. After that, he did not remember his actions. However, he seemed to gradually wake up in the rattling of the train. When he arrived at the Shanghai station, it was already after 9:00 PM. So he hired a car to return to his residence. The camp follower's account ended here.

### Sports Trivia

— Slim Reporter

Hua Ying Basketball Team captain Shu Shi flew to Beiping on the 21st for business. The team's instructor Qian Xucang accompanied him. It is heard that Shu, in addition to his business trip, is also picking up his wife, Murong Wan'er, to return to Shanghai. Qian Jun is purely taking a plane ride and sightseeing in northern China. The expected return date to Shanghai should be at the end of this month.

The Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team will be visiting Wuxi this month.

There are many new referees in the China Youth Basketball League. For example, Jin Botao's execution is no weaker than that of ordinary veteran referees. The metabolism of the new replaces the old, is it also the case in the refereeing world? In the end, it is also a good phenomenon.

Qiu likes to watch Jiabei performances, because the Northern School of basketball has a different style of viewing the ball. The Tongren basketball team is also extremely loved by general fans, because the coordination is wonderful, which seems to be incomparable to other teams.

The China United Basketball Team has won two championships in the West Qing and Chengyou Cups this year, and its reputation is at its peak. Unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat to the Tung Wah team in the China Youth League last week. It is said that China United was initially slightly contemptuous of the enemy, and later its endurance was not as good as that of ordinary football players. Indeed, however, the reporter deeply feels that in addition to these two reasons, the referee's abnormality is not unrelated.

The city's basketball league is well-promoted, but there are few promoters for school basketball. Recently, Mr. Zhang Juefei held a college basketball game, which should be the precursor to recent school basketball. Recalling the past Jiangnan Eight University Basketball Championships from the Zhizhi Five Tigers to the momentum of Jinan, it is still vivid in my mind. This time there will surely be another grand occasion.

The Green Team Women's Basketball Team, with a gathering of veteran players and the guidance of Qian Xucang, is naturally a good combination of beautiful flowers and green leaves. No wonder they were able to easily defeat the Three Provinces team in their first battle. Their use of the cross-shaped when trying to throw is even more worthy of promotion. It is also the result of Qian Jun's efforts. The so-called cross-shaped throwing is when the defender stands at the bottom of the basket to intercept the ball and pass it to the two forwards, while the two forwards shuttle back and forth on the left and right. This kind of throwing is not only for the sake of pleasing the eye, but also fits the actual situation. Because the defender in women's basketball never has the opportunity to throw the basket, even the right to free throw is exercised by the forward. Then the skill of shooting is indeed not necessary to practice, just like an old student singing, why bother practicing Qingyi? The principle is like this. May all teams follow suit, which is enough to improve the defender's interception and the forward's basket-running skills. Kang Ai Women's Basketball Team (photographed by Kang Zuchun)
