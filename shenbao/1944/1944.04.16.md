### Progressive Corrupt Officials: Yoshida Tosuke

Not long ago, I took a day off to visit Hangzhou. It truly lived up to its reputation, with many surprisingly beautiful scenes. Among them, what deserves special mention is the lively and crowded scene in front of the train station during the Qingming Festival. The people in uniform there were not leading a flock of lambs to the slaughter. Instead, these bipedal animals were not forming a long snake-like line, but were being mercilessly beaten with sticks. At that time, two passengers were pushed out of the line by the crowd behind them, and as the sticks came down, one of the passengers' heads was broken and bleeding. Unfortunately, this passenger forgot to wear a helmet when coming to the station, so they had to cover their head and scurry away. I was in such a long snake-like line, and I was afraid I would never get a ticket, so I was flustered and didn't know what to do. Just then, a person in a black uniform who had been watching me for a long time said kindly, "You're going to Shanghai, I'll sell you a ticket!" Then, from his waist, he pulled out a handful of train tickets to Shanghai that everyone was longing for. But the price was three times higher than the official price. This made the author admire the skillful and all-pervasive methods of Chinese corrupt officials.

Looking back two or three years, the most common methods used by Chinese corrupt officials were kidnapping and extortion. For example, one unfortunate thing was that because Chinese people also lived in Chongqing, they would sometimes write letters to friends in Shanghai. In the letters, they couldn't help but write a few words like "The weather has been good here recently." If such an ordinary letter fell into the hands of corrupt officials, the Shanghai friend would be in deep trouble and be suspected of being a Chongqing element, and the phrase "The weather has been good recently" would be considered some kind of code. Therefore, this Shanghai friend would be qualified to face a month or two of litigation. Naturally, the most effective way to dispel this suspicion was not eloquent refutation, but silent money (as the Roman maxim says, "Eloquence is silver, silence is gold"). Since God successively recalled the people who loved to use this method the most, this overly blatant method has become less popular in Shanghai. However, what has replaced it is widespread bribery.

Since the Greater East Asia War, China has suddenly become a country ruled by law, and everything is subject to restrictions. No matter what you do, you must obtain permission from the government. Otherwise, you will not succeed. However, ordinary Chinese people know that if you apply to the government for anything by following the official procedures, the response will definitely be a rejection. Chinese common sense dictates that if you want to get approval quickly for something you are applying for from the government, you need two things to grease the wheels: one is "face," and the other is the universally loved money. In the latter case, corrupt officials desperately exploit this Chinese common sense. For example, when an employee asks the government to raise the official price of a certain item, the official has the power to decide. This is a good opportunity for corrupt officials, so they start "direct negotiations," saying "Give me some money, and I'll approve it for you." After a process of "bargaining," and after the facilitation fee is determined, the official approves the price increase. In this way, the employee doesn't lose too much. Because the bribes paid to the corrupt officials will be added to the prices of essential high-priced items borne by the public.

And finally, there is the legal means regarding train tickets that I have already mentioned. No law says that it is wrong for people in black uniforms to buy train tickets. At the same time, no law says that it is wrong to sell your own train tickets to others. Everyone knows that this is neither bribery nor extortion. Although the scale may vary, the most common method used by capitalist old-timers, the corrupt officials of the United States, is this kind of legal means. It is said that during World War I, the decision for the United States to join the war was not made by the US government, but was actually caused by the Morgan financial group giving bribes to many political figures to ensure that its debts to the central bank were repaid. The most common way for this Morgan financial group to "connect" with government officials was to distribute stocks. For example, when Allegheny Corporation was established in February 1929, one share allocated to special shareholders was 20 yuan, but at that time, the market price of Allegheny stock was 31 to 35 yuan. Among the shareholders who received this allocated stock were Secretary of the Navy Francis Adams (1,000 shares), former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker (2,000 shares), and former Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, among other important figures. Buying 1,000 shares of stock with a market price of 31 yuan for 20 yuan is equivalent to receiving 11,000 yuan in cash. Now, unfortunately, this kind of legal bribery is also openly prevalent in China. For example, under the current wartime system, companies that are absolutely unnecessary are being established with capital of 50 million to 200 million yuan. It is said that when the black market price is 20 yuan per share, shares are being allocated at 10 yuan per share to key figures at the time of the company's establishment. (Translated by Lu)

### Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the Joint Japanese-German-Italian Special Committee meeting. The full text is as follows: "The Joint Japanese-German-Italian Special Committee is holding a meeting today in accordance with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact. I am delighted to have this opportunity to say a few words to you all. Looking at the overall war situation, the UK and the US have suffered defeats in every battle. Since last year, they have been shouting for a total counter-offensive and pouring all their efforts into pushing towards the borders of the Axis regions from the east and west. However, our strong defenses have not wavered in the slightest. The belief in victory and the undefeated state of Germany and Italy have made the Axis camp even more solid. I have the greatest respect for the brave struggles of the German and Italian allied forces. In particular, the German army on the Italian front has completely crushed the enemy's offensive and has resumed large-scale bombing of London. The Italian army is actively preparing a new formation and standing on the front line of the common front, fighting together, which is gratifying to hear. Under these circumstances, the enemy, the UK and the US, are becoming increasingly anxious. Recently, they have been clamoring for the formation of a second front, but this is exactly what Germany expects. I believe that in the future, the German army will not only be able to repel the enemy, but also inflict a thorough blow on the UK and US forces, so that Japan, Germany, and Italy can achieve final victory as soon as possible. In the Greater East Asia area, Japan is currently crushing the UK and US attempts to advance on the mainland and in the Pacific, and is securing the southern strongholds. In addition, the consolidation and unity of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia, the unified promotion of the war, and the strength of important resources in various parts of Greater East Asia are strengthening Japan's winning posture day by day. Japan is determined to maintain this posture, inflict a painful blow on the enemy, and complete the objectives of this war as soon as possible. Recently, the Japanese army has received great assistance from Burma and, together with the Indian National Army, is attacking East India and has crossed the Indo-Burmese border, stepping into Indian territory, achieving great results. In particular, the Indian National Army, commanded by Subhas Chandra Bose, is fighting for the liberation of its homeland with the cooperation of all of East Asia. Therefore, the atmosphere of liberating India is now spreading, which proves that our common goal of liberating the oppressed nations will soon be achieved, and we can all celebrate together. The UK and the US sacrifice other countries for their own prosperity and even attempt to dominate the world, which is unacceptable to us. This war is a righteous uprising by our Axis countries for self-preservation, self-defense, and the construction of world peace. The difference between the two is self-evident. The ambitions of the UK and the US have become increasingly blatant recently. Conversely, our determination to thoroughly crush the UK and the US has also become stronger. Although the East Asian battlefield is far away, the Axis countries must cooperate more closely to deal with the enemy, the UK and the US. Under these circumstances, Japan is determined to strengthen ties with European allies, crush the enemy's various conspiracies to alienate the Axis, and promote joint warfare in order to strive for the common final victory and achieve the common goal. I believe that the allied nations of Germany and Italy must also have this determination. Holding a committee at this important time can be said to be most appropriate. Here, I pray for the success of the meeting."

### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds on Two Sides of Imphal; Enemy Continues to Reinforce and Resists with All Its Might

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Indian front, the enemy is putting up a desperate resistance with strong reinforcements against the Japanese and Indian forces approaching Imphal from the north and south in order to defend Imphal. As a result, the battles in that area are becoming increasingly fierce. The strategic stronghold ten kilometers north of Imphal has been under siege for several days, with the two sides only about 50 meters apart. Therefore, fierce hand-to-hand combat has been taking place in recent days. On the 11th, after the arrival of elite Japanese and Indian troops, a general offensive was launched, and night attacks continued. By the morning of the 12th, most of the enemy troops on the high ground had been annihilated, and it was finally captured. Also, the battle for Senkhumai, a stronghold west of this high ground (four kilometers south of Bishenpur), has also been extremely fierce since the 11th. The enemy artillery positions on the high ground west of Senkhumai have been carrying out ceaseless spiritual artillery fire day and night, but the Japanese and Indian forces are also continuing to engage the enemy in close combat with powerful reinforcements. Corpses are scattered across the battlefield in that area, and the tragic scene is truly unbearable to witness. Now, the enemy forces defending Imphal are on the verge of collapse due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese army.

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese-Indian allied forces are currently advancing fiercely, cutting off the road between Bishnupur and Silchar, breaking through dangerous passes, and continuing to advance north with irresistible force. The main force reached the vicinity of Lanaima, ten kilometers southwest of Bishnupur, on the morning of the 13th, while a portion advanced to the Malon (high ground west of the Leimatak River), fifteen kilometers southwest of Bishnupur, threatening the only retreat route of the enemy's Fourth Army Corps. An attack posture has now been launched against Bishnupur. If the enemy loses Moirang and Bishnupur, Imphal, the stronghold of the Fourth Army Corps, will be threatened considerably. Therefore, the enemy is constantly dispatching reinforcement units with tanks and heavy artillery southward, trying its best to resist, but it is currently under heavy pressure from the Japanese army, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. The highway between Bishnupur and Silchar has not been used until now, but since the supply line from Kohima to Imphal was cut off by the Japanese army, the enemy has rapidly repaired the road, hoping to use it as an escape route. It has now been rebuilt into a fast road passable by cars, but both sides are currently engaged in a battle for control of the highway. Also, a unit of the Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army to cut off roads and penetrate deep into the enemy's ranks, launching surprise attacks at any time, and the enemy is in a state of chaos.

Indian Front Line, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in the Moirang area are currently continuing to put up stubborn resistance, relying on favorable terrain southwest of that area. Since dawn on the 13th, they have launched fierce artillery fire on the front of the Japanese and Indian forces in an attempt to stop the Japanese and Indian forces from advancing. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the vicinity of Moirang for several days. The enemy, due to the impact of the Japanese and Indian forces' flanking units, has moved towards the swampy area on the shores of Loktak Lake. The rearguard of the enemy's 23rd Division obtained reinforcements at midnight on the 13th and is now making a final stand there. Also, the enemy's Fourth Army is attempting to defend Imphal valley from annihilation by the Japanese army. Recently, it has been continuously airlifting reinforcements with large transport planes. The reinforcements from a certain area have been flying to the front line for several days, and the enemy's airlifted forces have shown a tendency to increase.

### National Government's Collaboration with Allied Forces Since Joining the War One Year Ago: Medals Awarded to Allied Generals

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government joined the war and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, the relations between the two countries have evolved from shared joys and sorrows to a life-and-death relationship. As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage and the National Government has been participating in the war for over a year, the outcomes of the collaborative operations between the Chinese and Japanese armies over the past year are what those concerned about national affairs eagerly want to know. To this end, we paid a visit to the military authorities and inquired about everything. What follows is a record of their conversation. During this period of participation in the war, our national army has consistently upheld the spirit of shared life and death with our allies. To cooperate with the Allied forces, the most notable instance was the Battle of Changde. When the Allied forces attacked Changde last year, the 12th Division and the Provisional 5th Division under the Wuhan Headquarters marched to the Shashi County area to collaborate with the Allied forces. From early November to late December, lasting over a month, they returned to their original defense posts after completing their mission.

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - When the national army was operating in Changde last autumn, they advanced to the (omitted) County area and jointly cleared out the rebel forces with the Japanese army. The following is a record of the combat results achieved by the 12th Division and the Provisional 5th Division of the Wuhan Headquarters: Near (omitted) County, the 12th Division annihilated 1,500 rebel soldiers of the 14th Army and crushed the troops of the Chongqing army near Qingni and Zhuyang Mountains. The Chongqing army abandoned 32 bodies and 100 prisoners were captured. A large number of rifles and other spoils of war were seized. In the Gong'an County area, the Provisional 5th Division defeated the New Fourth Army and the Chongqing army, with 232 casualties and 4 prisoners captured from the Chongqing communist forces. The national government forces suffered only (25) casualties.

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government returned to the capital, all military and political operations have proceeded very smoothly. Over the past four years, the cooperation received from various aspects of the Allied nations has been particularly appreciated. On the anniversary of the fourth week, in order to enhance Sino-Japanese friendship and to show appreciation for their contributions, the government awarded medals to the Allied generals who participated in the joint operations. The official order has already been announced. According to National Government Gazette (621), the recipients of the Special Grade Tongguang Medal include: Governor-General of Korea, General of the Army Koiso Kuniaki; Governor-General of Taiwan, Admiral of the Navy Hasegawa Kiyoshi; Governor-General of Hong Kong, Lieutenant General of the Army Isoya Renkuke; and Commander of the Taiwan Army, General of the Army Ando Rikichi. The recipients of the First Grade Tongguang Medal include: Lieutenant General of the Army Kita Seiichi, Harada Kumakichi, Nemoto Hiroshi, Kusunoki (omitted) Takashi, Vice Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General of the Army Yasuhiko Saburo, and Suzuki Munetsaku.

### Careful Processing Required for Company Registration Applications

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Recently, a responsible person from the Ministry of Industry stated that the Ministry has always strived for speed in handling company registration cases. It previously issued a circular to the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities, setting a deadline for review and transmission to avoid delays. Subsequently, considering that merchants and citizens in various regions may not be familiar with legal procedures and may inevitably make errors, instructions were given for supplementary corrections, which only added to the delays. The various procedures required for company registration applications were explained in detail and published in newspapers. Recently, applications for registration submitted to the Ministry have been processed promptly upon arrival. Even complex cases are expedited and completed within a set timeframe, with very few being backlogged. However, there are still many cases where procedures are not followed correctly, and instructions for corrections are issued. Recently, the Ministry has received reports from various regions stating that applications submitted later have been approved, while earlier applications have not yet been processed by the Ministry. All such cases are handled in sequence. The reason for the delay, after investigation, is often due to delays in correcting and resubmitting applications with incorrect procedures. Cases involving multiple transfers also take time. Some cases are not resubmitted after instructions are given, leaving no basis for processing. If companies could carefully handle matters before applying and ensure that procedures are complete, errors requiring corrections and delays would be avoided. It is hoped that all companies will pay attention to this. It was also stated that in recent applications for capital increases and registration changes, the investigation reports submitted by inspectors bear legal responsibility and should be handled with extra care to avoid false statements. The Ministry will also conduct direct investigations to verify the facts. If it is found that the reports submitted contain false or incomplete information, the company and the investigator will be held strictly accountable according to law. This is a special warning that relevant individuals in the business community should heed.

### Annihilation of Enemy Air Forces on the India-Burma Front

In early March, the enemy attempted to reopen the Burma Road and deployed strong fortifications in northern Burma to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. Starting on March 5th, they dispatched mixed British, American, Chongqing, and Indian airborne troops at night, landing near Gassam in upper Burma and coordinating with ground forces in the Fugong and southern regions, launching a large-scale counteroffensive in northern Burma. However, after the Japanese army's ground and air forces forcefully bombed the enemy air force's transport bases in eastern India, cutting off their supply lines, the enemy was annihilated within half a month, and their attempt was crushed.

Air Force Attacks

The enemy air force departed at night from the Haira airfield in Assam Province, India (25 kilometers southwest of Sircia). They had approximately eighty gliders, each about one hundred feet wide and forty-five feet long. Two gliders were towed by one Douglas C-47 transport plane under the cover of numerous fighter planes. They flew towards the vicinity of Gassam on bright moonlit nights. Approximately sixty of them landed about sixty kilometers south of Gassam. This type of airborne unit transported by gliders first landed one thousand men, and then Douglas aircraft brought in American engineering troops to build airfields, as well as mortars, anti-aircraft machine guns, etc., and immediately began building aircraft runways.

The other twenty gliders landed near a location eighty kilometers west of Gato. The crew members fled into the forest, and most of them were captured by the Burmese army and cooperating civilians. Another unit landed about sixty kilometers northeast of Gassam. On the night of the 6th, additional airborne troops landed to reinforce them, along with several mortars and anti-aircraft machine guns, large quantities of ammunition, fuel, equipment, and food. Subsequently, they continued to resupply at night. Paratroopers also came with the glider troops. As a result, the enemy's strength amounted to two glider brigades, some parachute troops, totaling more than three thousand men. They built airfields sixty kilometers north and thirty kilometers south of Gassam on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The troops landed south of Gassam then began to move, with Major General Wingate, who had been repeatedly defeated in the Fugong region last year, as their commander.

About one brigade of enemy troops landed south of Gassam and moved southwest through Gassam, crossing the Hueri River twenty kilometers south of Gassam and operating towards Gyegu, forty-five kilometers east of Gassam, attempting to infiltrate the Bhamo area. At the same time, about one division that landed sixty-five kilometers north of Gassam attempted to attack west towards the Mawrgausa area. A portion of them constantly moved around the landing site, coordinating with enemy ground infiltration units moving south from the north, supporting the parachute troops landing in the northwest of Gassam.

The enemy air force also exerted all its strength to assist the landing troops, working hard to supply them by air, attacking Japanese army strongholds, and firing on Japanese army troops, trying to hinder the Japanese advance. At that time, a large-scale response also came from the enemy air force's support bases in Dinsukia and partially from Sircil. On the 22nd, about one hundred enemy planes flew over Fugong, and more than thirty enemy planes operated in the Sircil area. The enemy's dedication to the mobile air transport of airborne troops can be seen from this.

Annihilation Process

Although the enemy air force exerted all its strength to transport the airborne troops, it was reckless and imprudent. Not only did they fail to block the India-Chongqing air route, but on the contrary, the Japanese army broke through into Assam Province with unstoppable momentum. On the one hand, the Japanese army ground troops regarded the enemy air forces as turtles in an urn, and calmly annihilated them.

Japanese army planes constantly attacked the enemy landing troops and glider airfields. On March 10th, they attacked the enemy airfield in Ianwa day and night, destroying its glider runway. On the 13th, they strongly attacked the enemy airfield in Monien, sixty kilometers north of Gassam. Six enemy Spitfire planes that took off to intercept were shot down, and four gliders on the ground were destroyed. At dawn on the 14th, they again raided the airfield, and all the bombs hit their targets, completely destroying the airfield.

By the 18th, the Japanese army had launched more than ten fierce attacks on the airfield, the surrounding wooded areas used for concealment, and the landing troops. By the afternoon of the 18th, the enemy had disappeared, and all of the enemy's airfields and air forces had been annihilated.

Confessions of Enemy Airborne Troops

The enemy landed untrained troops in the uninhabited jungles of northern Burma, and they were no match for the attacks of the Japanese army's elite troops. G.V.K., a sergeant in the British Air Force Airborne Troops Mortar Squad, invaded Burmese territory on the dark night of March 5th. On the ninth day after landing, the 13th, he was wandering in the jungle and was captured by the Japanese army. The following is the sergeant's confession:

In April 1943, the First Battalion of the King's Regiment of the Indian Expeditionary Force to which I belonged suddenly received a special mission to move to Olkia (90 miles east of Kochidon).

From that time until November, for seven months, I specialized in glider takeoff and landing training in the forest every day, assembling troops, and maintaining gliders. I was assigned as a non-commissioned officer attached to the mortar squad of the Third Company under the command of a certain Major, with two subordinates.

On the morning of March 5th, we were ordered to depart that night. We gathered at a corner of the airfield, lined up and registered. Everyone felt very nervous. Numerous gliders were arranged on the runway, which was more than forty kilometers long. The other squadrons were also making similar preparations. Our gliders were paired, and each pair was towed by a Douglas transport plane with a rope about 500 meters long. The glider was eighteen meters long and thirty meters wide. The pilot of the transport plane was an American.

That night, the stars were bright, and the moon was bright. We could see nothing but high mountains and rivers on the ground. After flying for about two hours, I didn't know where we had arrived. I only felt like we had made a big turn. The towing rope was suddenly cut. Our heroic spirit reached its climax. The glider made several large turns nearby and landed on the ground. Then our cannons and ammunition were placed on the ground. This was a jungle area of ​​unknown name with lush trees.

We gradually walked through the gaps in the forest. At first, eighteen of us walked together in a disorderly manner. After a few days, we were lucky enough not to encounter a single Japanese soldier, and we gradually relaxed and became less vigilant. But the truth was not so. On the ninth day, my three subordinates and I leisurely walked out of the warm forest. Just as we sat down and started smoking, we suddenly heard an unpleasant sound. In a flash, about twenty Japanese soldiers had spotted us and were rushing over. I was prepared to surrender long ago, and my subordinates agreed. We didn't make any unnecessary resistance and begged the Japanese army to surrender us. (Translated from the March 29th Asahi Shimbun)

### Transfer Ceremony of Chongqing-affiliated Properties in Shanghai Held Yesterday; 535 Items Transferred to Chinese Administration

The Allied Japanese authorities, in order to assist the development of China's industrial economy, after the National Government returned to the capital, transferred the enemy properties of the British, American, and Chongqing factions under their administration to China in succession. It is learned that the Allied forces again transferred 535 Chongqing-affiliated properties under military administration in the Shanghai area at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Zha Hotel on the second floor. Those present included Wu Songgao, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipality, representing the National Government; Shen Guanzhun, Counselor; Okazaki, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai; Lieutenant Kusago of the Troop Headquarters; Major Teshima of the Military Attaché's Office; Lieutenant Colonel Yamazaki of the Military Police; Investigator Kamiya; Major Egawa of the Army Department; Captain Tamaki of the Naval Fleet; and M. Matsuura, representative of the Japanese Shanghai Resident Group. The ceremony proceeded as planned. First, Counselor Okazaki delivered a speech on behalf of the Japanese side. Then, the representatives from China and Japan, Lieutenant Colonel Yamazaki of the Military Police and Major Teshima of the Military Attaché's Office, and Secretary-General Wu Songgao of the Municipal Government, signed the transfer documents. Representatives Teshima and Yamazaki of the Japanese authorities handed over the inventory of 535 Chongqing-affiliated properties to Secretary-General Wu, representing the Chinese government. While transferring the inventory, Secretary-General Wu stood up and delivered a speech of thanks. The transfer ceremony concluded at approximately 4:00 PM. Champagne was raised, and the guests dispersed in a spirit of amity. The speeches by Counselor Okazaki and Secretary-General Wu are recorded below:

Speech by Counselor Okazaki

In his speech, Counselor Okazaki, representative of the Japanese Embassy Office, stated: "I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to deliver this speech today on behalf of the Japanese side. Since the outbreak of this incident, the Japanese military has placed various Chongqing-affiliated factories and land and buildings owned by officials, citizens, and organizations deemed to have hostile relations under military administration, and has strived to preserve them or utilize them. However, since the return of the National Government to the capital in March 1940, we have decided to return and transfer them, and have gradually implemented the release of enemy property and the return to the authorities of your country and the transfer to the original owners. Regarding the 422 factories and various industrial enterprises under military administration, all have been returned to their original owners or other measures have been implemented as of July last year, and all have been concluded. These factories are now being vigorously utilized by the Chinese side in order to build a new China. On the other hand, regarding the Chongqing-affiliated properties, that is, the so-called old enemy property, land and buildings owned by officials and citizens, except for some currently used by the military, we have delegated the management and operation of ordinary enemy property to the Enemy Property Disposal Committee. In February of this year, we began transferring properties located in the Nanjing area, and then properties in various places were gradually transferred. This time, we have decided to transfer 535 properties in the Shanghai area to the Chinese side. Including this transfer, the total number of Chongqing-affiliated properties managed by the Chinese side reaches as many as 2,724. It is a great pleasure to see this. We deeply cherish the relationship between China and Japan. Regarding these received and transferred properties, we will take appropriate measures to stabilize people's livelihoods and complete the Greater East Asia War."

Secretary-General Wu's Speech of Thanks

Upon receiving the Chongqing-affiliated properties transferred by the Allied Japanese authorities, Secretary-General Wu Songgao of the Shanghai Special Municipality delivered a speech of thanks to the Allied authorities on behalf of the government, stating: "I am very pleased to be ordered to receive the Chongqing-affiliated properties returned by your country today. The government and people are extremely grateful that your country is entrusting the management of these properties to our government. On behalf of the government, I express my gratitude to all the representatives, and I pledge to manage them properly in order to live up to the purpose of the Japanese transfer."

Short Commentary

### Dock Services

Train and ship stations are often places where hooligans and thugs gather, taking advantage of the hurried nature of travelers to commit petty theft and deception for their own fraudulent purposes. This phenomenon is common in cities everywhere, especially in Shanghai. In the past, train stations have been gradually improved, but recent circumstances have once again made travel difficult. As for ship stations, the situation was bad in the past, and it is even worse now, making them a dreaded experience for travelers.

Half a year ago, the Chinese Social Enterprise Association established the Shanghai Dock Service Center to target the lurking hooligans and petty thieves, eliminate extortion, and provide services for travelers. This is undoubtedly a very necessary and appropriate measure. We hope:

The local police will provide full cooperation. Police officers are stationed at docks, and hooligans should not be able to act recklessly. However, in reality, hooligans are rampant, and the police are sometimes unable to attend to everything. Now that there is a dock service center to serve passengers, the police can focus on preventing petty criminals from succeeding.

Since the dock service center has been approved and established, the authority over passenger services must be unified, and there should be no overlapping organizations that add trouble to travelers. If authority is fragmented, not only will the dock service center be ineffective, but it will also create more opportunities for petty criminals, and travelers will continue to suffer.

Qiu Liangyu Writes Calligraphy on Fans: Qiu Liangyu's calligraphy is well-known. Recently, he has been specially writing calligraphy on fans, making connections widely.

Economy Association's Ninth Broadcast: The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association will hold its ninth regular broadcast at the Shanghai Radio Station today at 7:45 PM. The speaker will be Huang Jingwan, a director of the association and the director of the _Shen Bao_ Social Service Department.

"Phantom of the Opera" Performance: The Qingxie Theater Troupe, led by Li Mingjun, will present Ma Suinong's adaptation of the five-act horror play "Phantom of the Opera" starting on the 17th of this month at the Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road.

### Encouraging Savings to Absorb Idle Funds: Revised Savings Regulations for Consideration and Adoption by the Industry

In order to encourage savings and channel social idle funds into increasing production, the banking and money industry has compiled deposit regulations from various businesses through the Banking Association. After multiple discussions and revisions, carefully preserving the advantages, a total of eleven chapters and eighty-two articles have been completed. Matters such as deadlines and interest rates are listed in a special table attached to the end for consideration and adoption by the industry. There are two points to note: Savings business is currently extremely weak, and the recovery of savings in the future is expected. Therefore, promoting and preparing for this business should not be delayed. Current market interest rates are high, and the interest rates in the attached table seem insufficient to promote savings under the current situation. However, the attached table is just an example and not mandatory. Moreover, current market interest rates are not normal, and this should not be taken as a basis for comparison. It is also heard that the regulations include: General Rules. Current Savings Deposits. Fixed Deposit Savings Deposits. Fixed Deposit Withdrawal Savings Deposits. Zero Deposit Fixed Savings Deposits. Installment Interest Savings Deposits. Education Savings Deposits. Group Savings Deposits. Convenient Savings Deposits. Gift Certificate Savings Deposits. Supplementary Provisions.

### Cracking Down on Illegal Pawnbroking

— Xiao Zhenkai

The establishment of pawnbroking originated in ancient times, reserved for those who were disabled and unable to make a living otherwise. Earning interest without labor was not considered a respectable profession. However, impoverished commoners often relied on it for temporary financial relief, providing some assistance to the economic and social life of ordinary people. In recent years, the pawning period has been reduced from twelve months to eight months, and then to four months. Interest rates have also increased from 12% to 60%, plus storage fees and other charges. For every 100 yuan pawned, only about 70 or 80 yuan remained after deductions. Ordinary people were already suffering and barely surviving.

Unexpectedly, a type of illegal pawnbroking (or second-hand goods trading companies) has recently emerged in the city, specializing in taking advantage of people's misfortune and seeking exorbitant profits, making them even more cunning and ruthless than regular pawnbrokers. These businesses are located near gambling dens on Minguo Road, Luxiangyuan Road, and Nanyang Bridge in the South City, almost as close as　This is especially evident when one is close to gambling dens. They cleverly note "entrusted by the customer to sell on their behalf" on pawn tickets when receiving goods, making their intentions suspicious. The term is shortened to 30 days, and the interest rate is as high as 20-30%. If the pawning term is slightly exceeded, they falsely claim that the pawned item has been sold, demanding eight or nine times its value for redemption. The poor have no time to choose and are exploited and trampled on. There are countless victims, and the trend is not curbed but is instead becoming more rampant. Currently, various pawnbrokers in the old eight districts are also following suit, either changing their names to "second-hand goods trading companies" or claiming to "also engage in second-hand goods trading," growing like wildfire. Such exploitation and profiteering are not only outrageous but also violate the law. According to criminal law, lending money to others in urgent, reckless, or inexperienced situations and obtaining a significant profit that is disproportionate to the original loan constitutes a usury crime. Furthermore, obtaining another person's property through deception with the intention of illegally possessing it constitutes a fraud crime. Heavier penalties are imposed on those who commit these crimes as a profession. The purpose and methods of these businesses are clearly intentional violations, making them difficult to pardon.

To alleviate the suffering of the majority of ordinary people, it is hoped that the local procuratorate, which represents the country and is responsible for investigating crimes, will accept public opinion, exercise its powers, prosecute according to the law, and punish these businesses. Furthermore, it is requested that the Municipal Police Bureau cooperate in enforcing the law and shut down all illegal pawnbroking businesses in Shanghai to uphold the law and alleviate the suffering of ordinary people from exorbitant interest rates.

At the same time, it is hoped that the recently established Municipal Public Pawnshop (with a monthly interest rate of only 2%) will set up more branch shops in impoverished areas, such as Caojiadu and Zhabei, to regulate the lower-level economy and improve people's livelihoods.

### A Visit to the New General Benevolent Hall

— Chang Xin

After touring the New General Benevolent Hall with Director Lu and several Chinese and foreign nuns, I deeply felt that the hall accommodates people throughout their lives, a truly tragic and pitiful picture from birth to the elderly in their eighties and nineties. With perfect facilities, careful management, and a spirit of abundant love, the hall provides comfort and care, making it a paradise for those who suffer. When we saw the Chinese and foreign nuns and Director Lu treat the helpless elderly and children with compassion, enduring hardships, and fulfilling their duties, I felt deep admiration from the bottom of my heart.

To save the helpless who suffer, for the sake of the New General Benevolent Hall, a large charitable institution with a long history and perfect facilities, funding has become a concern, and the suffering are crying out for help. Therefore, I would like to loudly appeal here, urgently hoping that benevolent people from all walks of life will extend their warm hands, generously donate, and contribute as much as possible! "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Moreover, what about saving the lives of around nine hundred people? We firmly believe that "a drop of water can form a river." Therefore, regardless of the amount donated, we will use a sincere attitude to thank on behalf of the suffering. At the same time, readers should know that it is better to create blessings for your descendants than to accumulate wealth for them. The way to create blessings and accumulate virtue for your descendants is to donate money to save the suffering. As the saying goes, "It is most joyful to do good."

Finally, I want to shout three more times: "Using money for charitable causes is a way to obtain lasting happiness in the soul! Do what should be done quickly, don't wait until it's too late! Donate the money you want to donate quickly, don't wait until the money is no longer under your control, and you can't donate even if you want to! (End)

Three days have passed.

The cloudy weather at the time of departure continued, but since last night, the atmospheric pressure has been steadily decreasing. The waves have also become more ferocious.

"I'm afraid there will be a storm that we can't handle," a petty officer said to the cadets with a laugh, as if to intimidate them.

"There is nothing to fear because we have experience sailing in the Chinese seas."

"However, the weather in the Pacific is much more than that. You must know that the Pacific is the Pacific! How can it be compared to the sea?"

The cadets kept pretending that they knew a lot about the Pacific, but this was their first time, so they had to listen to others.

"Is that really so? Are storms that severe?" some people asked in small voices.

Soon, the bad weather really arrived, and the barometer gradually rose. Finally, the order to prepare for a major storm was issued.

The cadets on duty rushed back and forth on the deck, tying up movable objects. Suddenly, the ship began to rock as if tripping. They saw the waves rising into the air, even higher than the chimneys on their warship.

However, the cadets on deck were lucky. During the execution of the mission, strangely enough, they did not feel seasick. The cadets in the operations department, on the other hand, were the opposite. They started taking classes sitting down in such violent swaying.

There was no room as large as a classroom inside the ship. The body odor of the young people closed in a room kept increasing. The porthole glass that was closed to prepare for the storm was layered with moisture due to the motion of the ship. When they suddenly felt dizzy and their feet were on their head and their heads were heavy, they felt like they were going to throw up, which felt like their stomachs were turned upside down, with pressure on their throats.

(Damn it!)

They tried their best to endure and listen carefully to the instructor's lecture, but everyone's faces turned as green as grass.

Mr. Jin was no exception. But he was different from others. He was still sitting straight, taking notes on the outline of the lecture.

Soon, the swaying became more severe. Although they were struggling to resist the noises of the waves that entered their ears and the pitching motion that violently attacked them by surprise. Immediately, they found that some people were pressing their mouths and running out of the ship's chamber. They couldn't hold back, and one by one they began to retreat.

Cold sweat dripped from Mr. Jin's forehead. His breathing also became hurried.

(I can't go on...) Just as he was thinking this, he heard the instructor give the order to "take a break." He rushed to the restroom without thinking twice.

After the rain, the sky cleared, and the Pacific was truly calm. The next day, after a thorough cleaning inside the ship, they saw the blue sea sparkling with sunlight.

"Lao Gu, I didn't expect you to be so afraid of storms," said Cadet Nakano, because he was the first to run out to vomit, so he couldn't help but admire Mr. Jin.

"That's right. The guys who could finish yesterday's lecture are all heroes!" Cadet Jiateng also added.

Mr. Jin habitually narrowed one eye and said with a slight smile, "To be honest, I also vomited."

"You also vomited?" The two were stunned and asked in unison. "When?"

"When? After you guys!" He told everyone the truth without hesitation.

"How useless. You threw up too?" Nakano and Kato, and others all laughed. If the lecture had continued for another minute, perhaps Mr. Jin would have run out of the ship's room to vomit even earlier than the instructor. It can be said that it was a close call, but Mr. Jin was able to hold on. As for his feelings when he ran to the toilet, Mr. Jin said with a smile: "I am by no means unafraid of storms. I said I was not afraid of the small storms in China, but now I am so afraid, wouldn't that be embarrassing?"

"However, that being said, the question is when you vomited. Lao Gu, who vomited last, must be said to be great," Okayama frankly acknowledged Mr. Jin's greatness. In short, since everyone vomited, there was no need to put on airs. At the same time, everyone agreed, "In short, lectures are needed when the sea is calm." So the topic of storms was considered finished.

### Chongde Elderly Memorial Book Charity Sale

Madam Nie Zeng Jifen inherited the teachings of Zeng Wenzheng, practicing virtue and being admired by society as a model woman of the generation. Her descendants, Mr. Yuntai and others, wrote about the origins of her great blessings and longevity, documenting the elderly woman's diligence, thrift, and stories of cherishing virtue, compiling them into a memorial book. The Nie brothers and sisters generously donated one hundred copies yesterday, which is highly appreciated. The price of paper has also increased several times recently, making it difficult to reprint in the future. The selling price is 50 yuan, and all proceeds will be used for poverty relief.

Picking Up Money and Not Keeping It: A woman named Chen Zhao Ashun went shopping at Zhenhua Store on Lafayette Road. When paying, she accidentally dropped 300 yuan in cash and a citizen's card inside the store. Wang Chengtian, an apprentice, picked it up, but the owner had already left and could not be returned. He sent it to our office to be claimed. The owner is requested to come and claim it within a week. If the money is not claimed after the deadline, it will be used for poverty relief.
