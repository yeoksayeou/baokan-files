### Japanese Planes Brave Adverse Weather to Fiercely Attack Morotai Island and Leyte Gulf, Enemy Airfields, Ships, etc. Sustain Heavy Damage

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 25th: The Japanese Air Force in the Philippines, braving adverse weather, fiercely attacked enemy airfields on Morotai Island and enemy warships in Leyte Gulf on the 22nd and 23rd. On the 24th, they fiercely attacked enemy airfields and landing points on Leyte Island. The battle results are as follows: (1) Morotai Island: more than 25 locations hit and set on fire, more than 20 locations exploded. (2) Leyte Gulf: 2 transport ships sunk, 2 landing craft sunk, 1 destroyer destroyed, 1 transport ship destroyed. (3) Leyte Island: more than 9 locations hit and set on fire (including one major explosion). Japanese aircraft losses: 1 self-detonated, 17 not returned.

Frontline Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A combined formation of Japanese Air Force fighter-bombers made a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on Morotai Island at midnight on the 22nd, breaking through the enemy's intense anti-aircraft fire, dropping many heavy bombs, and setting fire to more than 20 places on the airfield's runways and protective structures. All Japanese planes returned. On the night of the 23rd, a combined formation of fighter-bombers again strongly attacked the island, inflicting heavy damage, and all planes returned safely. The battle results of this attack include more than 20 enemy military facilities destroyed and burned, 52 large aircraft set on fire, 20 medium aircraft set on fire, 2 heavily damaged, 2 small aircraft set on fire, and also many enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.

Japanese Military Base on the Front Line in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese fighter squadrons, braving adverse weather, raided Leyte Island, echoing the fierce advance of Japanese land troops. In addition to controlling the airspace over Carigara, they also raided Balugo, an enemy stronghold. That night, Japanese bomber squadrons again attacked Leyte Island, fiercely attacking Tacloban, where all bombs hit the enemy's landing points in Tacloban. After thoroughly bombing the enemy's searchlight positions, material storage areas, and other military facilities, all planes safely returned to base. On the morning of the 24th, they strongly attacked the enemy airfield in Tacloban, Leyte Island, repeatedly subjecting the airfield to fierce dive-bombing. In addition to destroying its runways, four enemy aircraft on the ground were set on fire, and a subsidiary facility experienced a major explosion. In this attack, one Japanese plane did not return.

### Japanese Military Strength on Leyte Island Has Increased

Philippine Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army on Leyte Island is building fortifications on the highlands east of the central mountain range, waiting for reinforcement troops to arrive before launching a counterattack. Since the beginning of November, new elite reinforcement troops of the Japanese army have successively arrived at the front line, and the Japanese army's combat strength has suddenly increased. The enemy forces are finally forced to adopt a defensive posture, and due to excessive losses before and after the landing, the enemy forces' supply is gradually becoming difficult. However, the enemy forces in Carigara are actively reinforcing their forces, attempting to gain a superior position. On the other hand, they are also moving troops from Bapa on the west coast of Leyte northward, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's supply line along the Ormoc coast. However, the Japanese reinforcement troops have already made contact with the defending troops and are flanking and encircling the enemy forces coming from Carigara, driving them back to the vicinity of the coast.

Japanese Suicide Squad Blows Up Enemy Tanks

A Certain Japanese Military Base on the Front Line in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy forces on Leyte Island are constantly afraid of the Japanese army's melee attacks and are actively using tanks. The Japanese army has formed suicide squads and special attack teams for battlefield destruction and has established great battle achievements. Brave warriors of the suicide squad, holding explosives weighing thousands of kilograms with special devices, lie in ambush in low-lying areas to counter tank shells. When enemy tanks advance to close range, they ignite the fuse of the explosives, rapidly throw them at the tank's vital parts, and then retreat. In an instant, the enemy tank is completely shattered. The enemy soldiers advancing with the tanks, caught off guard, are all dismayed and flee in panic. The Japanese assault teams then charge forward, killing soldiers and generals. As a result, the enemy forces all raise their hands, lower their heads, and surrender. The Japanese army's special attack teams appear and disappear miraculously, and are active on various parts of the Leyte front line, truly frightening and chilling the enemy forces.

### Comprehensive Battle Results of the Japanese Air Force in the Eastern Waters of the Philippines

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle results obtained by the Japanese Air Force from the 21st to the 23rd and the additional battle results of the 19th are recorded as follows: (1) Battle results of the 21st: At around 9:30 AM on the 21st, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy aircraft carrier groups (composed of several ships, including transport ships) in the waters east of Mindanao Island, and a bomb hit the central part of an enemy standard aircraft carrier. The enemy aircraft carrier immediately stopped and tilted greatly. However, after the Japanese planes bombed, they quickly retreated, so it could not be confirmed whether the ship had sunk. However, it is highly likely that the ship has sunk. In this battle, two Japanese planes did not return to base. (2) Battle results of the 22nd: On the 22nd, the Japanese Air Force attacked an enemy transport convoy in the southeastern waters of Siargao Island, sinking one enemy medium-sized transport ship with a torpedo. In this battle, two Japanese planes did not return to base. (3) Battle results of the 23rd: At around 6:30 PM on the 23rd, the Japanese Air Force, braving adverse weather with overlapping dense clouds, strongly attacked an enemy transport convoy escorted by cruisers, destroyers, etc., in the eastern waters of Mindanao. A torpedo hit and sunk one enemy large transport ship, and a torpedo sank one enemy destroyer or cruiser. In this battle, one Japanese plane did not return to base. (4) Additional battle results of the 19th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 21st that the Japanese Air Force bombed an enemy mobile unit in the eastern waters of Luzon Island on the evening of the 19th. The battle results were the sinking of two enemy cruisers and the destruction of one aircraft carrier and one battleship. Later, it was further determined that in this battle, the Japanese Air Force also destroyed three enemy ships of unknown type, causing them to catch fire. It is expected that all three enemy ships have been sunk, and it is believed that these three enemy ships were mostly aircraft carriers. Also, in this battle, the Japanese side's losses totaled eight aircraft that did not return to base. Later, it was further determined that one more aircraft also did not return, bringing the total to nine.

### Enemy Planes Raiding Tokyo Shot Down and Damaged Fourteen

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:50 AM on the 25th: Regarding the battle results obtained by the Japanese army in the vicinity of Tokyo during the enemy air raid on the 24th, the following has been determined: five shot down (including those announced on the 24th), one of which was shot down by ramming, and nine enemy planes were damaged. In this battle, seven Japanese planes have not yet returned (including the ramming plane).

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy American Air Force, which is actively consolidating its bases for air raids on Japan in the Mariana Islands, finally raided the vicinity of Tokyo after noon on the 24th. On that day, enemy planes, at an altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 meters, divided into several echelons, with as few as six and as many as more than ten, intruded into the suburbs of Tokyo, and some even intruded into the airspace over Tokyo. Because the enemy planes feared the strength of the Japanese anti-aircraft defenses, they were all lightly equipped, carried very few bombs, and the amount of bombs dropped was also small. In addition, the Japanese anti-aircraft defenses were very active, so the Japanese side's damage was very minor, with only a few small fires, which were immediately extinguished without any problems. In this battle, the Japanese side's battle results, according to the announcement as of 5:00 PM, determined that a total of three enemy planes were shot down. Detailed battle results are currently under investigation. The purpose of this enemy plane raid is naturally often seen as destroying the source of Japanese combat power and launching a large-scale attack, but on the other hand, it also contains the purpose of political propaganda. In San Francisco, the enemy American side broadcast at 1:30 PM (Japan time), when enemy planes were raiding Tokyo, that they were launching a large-scale air raid on Tokyo and were heavily bombing factories and other facilities. They also said that this air raid was a pincer operation conducted from bases in the Mariana Islands and bases in China. This statement is completely fictitious. The only base from which the enemy planes launched was the Mariana Islands base. From this, the intention of their strategic air raid is clearly visible.

### Mr. Kurusu's Speech

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Mr. Saburo Kurusu, who was the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary when the United States issued an ultimatum to Japan three years ago on November 26, and was in charge of Japanese-American negotiations, delivered a speech at the Kasumigaseki Hall at 7:00 PM on the 25th, titled "Diplomacy Does Not Allow Perfunctoriness," discussing the various efforts made by Japan at that time in the hope of completing the negotiations and the obstruction by pro-war factions in the United States, resulting in the issuance of the ultimatum on the 26th, attempting to place Japan in a deadly position and initiating hostilities. At the same time, he also spoke about the international situation, saying that the British and Americans believed that the speech delivered by Chairman Stalin indicated that the Soviet Union was about to change its past neutral attitude towards Japan, and used this as a pretext for major propaganda. However, this kind of tactic by the British and Americans is nothing more than their usual trick and is of no value. We should always remain calm, face the current state of the international political situation, and further understand the complex relationship of interests between nations. He then pointed out how hypocritical and incomplete the so-called post-war plans of the enemy British and American camps were, and finally said that the world peace that Japan hopes to achieve is the widespread implementation of the various principles of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the world, thereby achieving true world peace based on justice.

Weekly Commentary

### Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution?

— Yoshida Tosuke

Q: The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still negotiating intermittently, but is there really a possibility of cooperation between them? If the two parties can truly cooperate, it would be equivalent to opening a new era in the history of the Chinese revolution, and even in the history of all mankind. Precisely because the significance is so great, people are surprised when they hear that the KMT and the Communist Party are negotiating again. This negotiation may, as in the past, end in a break!

A: As you said, the negotiations between the two parties are constantly at risk of breaking down. Currently, the strength of the Chinese Communist Party is 470,000 regular troops and 2.2 million militia forces. The Chinese Communist Party advocates that this number should be reorganized into five armies and sixteen divisions, while the Kuomintang advocates that it should only be reorganized into four armies and ten divisions. It is generally said that this difference in opinion is the main reason for the stagnation of the current KMT-CPC negotiations. However, I believe that the difficulty of the KMT-CPC negotiations does not lie in such military issues, but in the different understandings of the nature of the Chinese revolution by the KMT and the Communist Party. Only if their opinions are completely consistent can genuine cooperation between the two parties be realized.

Q: What exactly is the nature of the Chinese revolution?

A: Every Chinese person knows that the problem of the Chinese revolution is essentially a peasant problem. How to destroy feudal forces and the exploitation and oppression of international imperialism, and liberate the peasants from their suffering. This is the content of the Chinese peasant revolution. Whether the Chinese revolution can succeed depends on whether the peasants participate in the revolution. Sun Wen, a farmer's son who "took taro and millet as his staple food and never ate rice," loudly exclaimed to Kuomintang members at the Guangdong "Peasant Movement Training Class" on August 23, 1924:

"Our revolutionary government wants to create a country with the people as its subject. Because peasants account for the absolute majority in our country, if peasants do not participate in the revolution, our revolution will lose its foundation. The Kuomintang's reorganization this time, to enable peasants to participate in the revolutionary movement, is to build a foundation on the peasants. To make the peasants the revolutionary foundation of our party, this is your responsibility."

Then, he explained the goal of the peasant problem, saying: "We tirelessly talk about the peasant problem because we want to solve the suffering of the peasants and enable the tillers to have their own land. The main goal is to prevent the fruits of the peasants' year-round hard work from being taken away by others. Today, the peasants only get 40% of the fruits of their year-round hard work, while 60% is taken away by the landlords. In addition, the government's taxes are not entirely paid by the landlords, but mostly have to be contributed by the peasants. This current situation in China is truly unfair and outrageous. This dark and unreasonable situation we are in could not be made public in the past, but now the time has come to openly promote it to everyone. What we want to promote now is the first time ever. Since you are propagandists, you must be sincere in your hearts, diligent in your service, and strive to seek happiness for the peasants... Peasants will not achieve happiness if they do not unite to form their own strong organizations. In order for peasants to achieve happiness, I hope you 'go to the people' to carry out propaganda and unite the peasants. If the peasants can all rise up and unite, then our revolution can be achieved immediately."

In this way, it can be clearly understood that the Chinese revolution is a peasant revolution! If the KMT and the Communist Party do not have the same attitude towards this kind of peasant revolution, then the two parties can never cooperate.

Q: But those who guide the Chinese revolution are not peasants, but revolutionary intellectuals in the cities, and those who sponsor the Chinese revolution are the urban bourgeoisie, especially the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia from Sun Wen's point of view.

A: The Chinese revolutionary movement was initially driven by both the Kang Youwei faction and the Sun Wen faction. Everyone knows that Kang Youwei was a progressive element of the old-fashioned literati class, while Sun Wen was a representative of the emerging bourgeoisie, a modern intellectual. At that time, within the country, the autocratic dictatorship of the Qing Dynasty had reached its peak, and the great powers, taking advantage of this undemocratic politics, began to carry out territorial and economic aggression against China. However, the autocratic dictatorship of the Qing Dynasty was unable to resist this aggression by the great powers. Moreover, the more economic concessions it made to the great powers, the more helpless China's finances became, so it had no choice but to increasingly strengthen its exploitation of the people to compensate for the huge deficit in the national treasury. The so-called people are the peasants who make up 90% of China's population. Therefore, the burden on the peasants increased, and the rural economy fell into bankruptcy. Therefore, if anyone rose up among the peasants, there would be an immediate response everywhere. However, the peasant movement, due to its lack of knowledge, only resisted the direct rulers in the local areas, and never expanded into a national people's struggle against imperialist aggression. For this reason, in semi-colonial countries, it is none other than progressive urban intellectuals who lead the peasants to wage a struggle against imperialism. Initially, in this struggle, the old-fashioned intellectuals of the Kang Youwei faction attempted to unite the people's resistance against the imperialist powers by taking advantage of the peasants' belief in the Manchu Qing autocratic regime, in order to fight against the imperialist powers.

Q: Didn't Kang Youwei want to reform the autocratic political system of the Manchu Qing using Western methods?

A: At that time, the urban bourgeoisie's belief in the Manchu Qing autocratic regime was far less than that of the peasants. Especially the bourgeoisie in Guangdong and Shanghai, who had long been in contact with foreign countries, did not want to overthrow the autocratic and dictatorial bureaucratic politics and implement democratic politics themselves. Even Sun Wen went to see Li Hongzhang in 1893 and put forward some "Suggestions to Li Fu Xiang". Anyone who has read this letter knows that Sun Wen was not a born revolutionary. (Of course, Sun Wen's autobiography said: "Since the year of Yiyou—1885—when the Sino-French War failed, I have been determined to 'overthrow the Manchu Qing and establish a Republic'." However, this record is indeed problematic, because believing what a person says in their autobiography is to be fooled. Everyone knows that when a person describes their past, they will inevitably embellish and beautify it to justify themselves.)

Kang Youwei knew the attitude of this bourgeoisie towards the Manchu Qing, and only then did he realize that the Manchu Qing could not maintain its past autocratic regime. Therefore, he wanted to first change the autocratic regime into a form that the bourgeoisie liked, wanting to unite the trust of peasants and the bourgeoisie under the name of enlightened despotism, thereby preventing the aggression of the great powers.

Q: If Kang Youwei, as you said, sincerely supported the Manchu Qing and wanted to make the Manchu Qing reassert its national power in the world, then why did the Manchu Qing exile him? Since there were also figures like Zhang Zhidong within the Manchu Qing government who wanted to use Western civilization to consolidate the Manchu Qing's autocratic regime, shouldn't they have united?

A: As you said, the Westernization Movement of Zhang Zhidong and Li Hongzhang and the movement of Kang Youwei and others once wanted to merge. In fact, at one point, Zhang Zhidong was even a supporter of Kang Youwei within the Manchu Qing government.

To categorically assert that the bureaucrats of the late Manchu Qing Dynasty were always a group that supported imperialist aggression is an oversimplified and naive judgment. If we admit that they were this group, then there is no way to explain Lin Zexu, who led the Opium War. The first to combine with imperialism in China was comprador capital. When the power of comprador capital was still weak at first, the bureaucrats did not want to combine with them. On the contrary, the bureaucrats represented the common demands of the Chinese nation and wanted to drive imperialism out of China. Zhang Zhidong was also one of these people. He wanted to work hard to consolidate the Manchu Qing government, so he believed that it was necessary to adopt Western culture, and thus he took the initiative to initiate the Westernization Movement. However, what he was very worried about at the time was that if Western culture was adopted universally and deeply, then the Confucian ideology (that is, China's national essence ideology) that maintained the Manchu Qing social organization would be completely disintegrated. Therefore, he proposed a mediation method in his famous "Exhortation to Learning": "Chinese learning for internal learning, Western learning for external learning; use Chinese learning to cultivate the body and mind, and use Western learning to deal with worldly affairs." This is the same as the "Japanese spirit, Western skills" ideology of the Meiji Restoration in Japan. There is a simple saying in Chinese, namely "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application." He believed that adopting Western culture was indeed out of necessity, but if this led to the elimination of China's national essence ideology of Confucianism, then China's unity would be broken and the social organization would be destroyed. However, the mainstream of Chinese Confucian ideology even criticized this kind of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" ideology as "not the way of the sages," "heretical doctrines, floods and fierce beasts," and attacked the Westernization Movement as "traitors to morality" and "scum of the literati." Therefore, Kang Youwei used Confucius's theory of the Great Unity to embellish and decorate his own theories, hoping to open up a broad road of thought in China. However, many bureaucrats saw through his deception and called it "Confucius on the surface, Western in essence," which was also a matter of course. Kang Youwei depicted Confucius's world of Great Harmony as a kind of democratic internationalism, even saying that Chinese and foreigners would freely intermarry here, and that the boundaries of countries would gradually disappear in the world, with the whole world united under a common government, women and men being equal, the sick, the old, and the young being protected by the state, and children not being the private property of their parents, but citizens of the state, which were all fundamentally different from the past Confucian ideology. As for his senior disciple, Liang Qichao, known as Kang Youwei's Yan Hui, went even further and even attacked Confucius. Liang Qichao once said the following: "Let me speak of the kinds of slaves of the heart! Then let me discuss the way to get rid of them! First: Do not be a slave to the ancients. Ancient sages and heroes all made great contributions to a group, and we should love and respect them. However, the reason why the ancients are the ancients, and the reason why I am me, and the reason why the ancients were able to become sages and heroes, is it not from my own hands? Otherwise, there would be no later sages if there was a sage, and there would be no more heroes if there was a hero. For example, Confucius recited the laws of Yao and Shun, and we recite the laws of Confucius. We should also think about why Confucius was able to become Confucius, because he stood outside of Yao and Shun. If Confucius were a slave to Yao and Shun, then there would definitely be no more Confucius after a hundred generations."

It is imaginable how Kang Youwei's faction's remarks aroused the indignation of the national essence faction at the time. I do not think that the bureaucrats and the literati class at that time were "the imperialist faction." On the contrary, the bureaucrats felt that Kang Youwei was "the imperialist faction" and opposed him. For example, Gu Hongming, who once served as Zhang Zhidong's private secretary, explained the reasons for their opposition to Kang Youwei as follows:

"The Chinese literati class and the common people are all half a pound of exclusionists and reactionaries. The latter may be even more so. The only class in China that is neither exclusionist nor reactionary is the compradors and upstarts who have made fortunes through foreign trade. Therefore, the general public rose up to oppose Kang Youwei's radical destructionism (Jacobinism). Because Kang Youwei's radical destructionism wanted to completely Westernize China... Therefore, when the general public saw that foreigners and the great powers openly supported Kang Youwei's radical destructionism—which people believed brought ugly and terrifying monsters—they stood up in anger and threw the ugly and terrifying monsters covering the souls of Kang Youwei and all the foreigners residing in China into the vast ocean to be buried in the belly of the fish. This was naturally inevitable. This position is the inherent cause of the Boxer Rebellion's violence."

From this, we can also understand the reasons for the Zhang Zhidong faction's opposition to the Kang Youwei faction. At the same time, we can also know how Kang Youwei would be criticized by those who condemned even Zhang Zhidong's Westernization Movement as "traitors to morality" and "scum of the literati." Although there was a distinction between reactionary and progressive in the criticism of this group of people, most of the Chinese people at that time, just as they experienced in the "Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians" movement during the Meiji Restoration in Japan, had surging emotions of indignation. When these indignant and passionate emotions turned to erupt against the Manchu Qing government, the great cause of the Xinhai Revolution was completed. Those who directed this national sentiment against the Manchu Qing were, in terms of class, the urban bourgeoisie, and in terms of leaders, Mr. Sun Wen.

### Western Front Southern Flank: The Battle Situation is Still Unstable; American and French Troops Break into Strasbourg

Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th. Huitong News Agency: The situation on the southern flank of the Western Front is still unstable. American and French tank units of the U.S. Seventh Army, after breaking into the Zabern lowland, have made slight progress to the southeast. Their vanguard has entered Strasbourg, where fierce fighting is underway. The area entered by the anti-Axis forces in central Alsace is still small, but General Patch will inevitably attempt to expand it, generally moving rapidly southward in order to make contact with the French First Army entering Saint-Dié, and advance towards the Rhine River in a pincer movement. If this happens, the German forces in the Vosges region are at risk of being surrounded. However, the French First Army is currently preoccupied with its own situation, and it is still questionable whether it can carry out this mission. Although the German defense line is now more fluid, it can still crush the enemy's encirclement plan. Even if the U.S. Seventh Army can quickly advance to Strasbourg, it will not be able to win this battle. Therefore, the subsequent developments will be the same as the situation after the British army broke through Nijmegen.

Fierce Battle Raging on the Aachen Front

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th. The focus of the Western Front has changed again and again, and is currently concentrated in the Aachen area, and the British and American forces, seeking to invade the Ruhr industrial area, are also extremely restless. The German Supreme Headquarters has also confirmed that the above report is generally accurate. It is said that in the battles in the Aachen area over the past week, the British and American forces have lost 320 tanks and at least 20,000 troops. Furthermore, the U.S. Ninth Army, which is advancing towards Cologne, has now reached the Rur River valley west of the Rhine River and is advancing 26 kilometers away from Cologne. In addition, the U.S. Third Army under Patton, which is operating on the southern flank of the Western Front, is currently fighting with the German army in the Metz area, with one part reaching a location 85 kilometers from Saarbrücken, and another team breaking through the Alsace-Lorraine line east of Saarbrücken. Taking an overview of the above-mentioned Western Front battle situation, it is impossible not to recognize that the German army is at a disadvantage.

### Sunday Tram Timetables Adjusted; Slightly Extending the Time Due to the Large Number of Passengers

The hours of operation are from 6:30 AM to 10:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. Tomorrow (27th) will still be the usual 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

Since yesterday (24th), four routes have been running: Route 4 from the Bund to Shanzhong Road and Route 10 from the Bund to Lujiazui. Because the number of trams running is small and the number of passengers is large, in order to avoid crowding and prevent rushing, the company sent personnel to implement queueing at each tram and bus stop a few days ago.

### Police Officers Must Not Obstruct or Extort Merchants' Transportation

The police bureau of this city stipulates that economic law enforcement matters should be handled by the economic police, and other police officers must not participate in or spontaneously investigate goods. Bureau Chief Chen, in his capacity as bureau chief, has issued secret and supervisory orders to this effect on June 1st and July 4th of this year. However, it has been found that recently, there are still some unscrupulous police officers who obstruct cargo transportation and use the name of investigating goods to create difficulties for merchants or even extort money. This is a violation of discipline. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. Except for the economic police, no other police officers may intercept cargo transportation en route or create difficulties for vendors on the pretext of investigation. Those who dare to violate this will be severely punished upon discovery. All supervising officers are ordered to strictly order their subordinates to comply and to inspect and prohibit the occurrence of such illegal activities at any time.

Therefore, the Opium and Narcotics Investigation Section and the judicial sections of various sub-bureaus are ordered to comply, and opium addicts with the above-mentioned official opium should not be arrested.

### Unified Control of Material Collection and Distribution by the Commerce Control Council

### Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing to End at Month's End; Purchase Promptly as Scheduled

The temporary cotton cloth rationing is about to expire. This reporter made a special visit to Mr. Gao Ai-zhou, the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Business Office of the cloth wholesalers, to inquire about the rationing situation. According to him: "This office was ordered to handle the temporary cotton cloth rationing in this city. It was a new undertaking with no precedent to follow. Fortunately, with the guidance and assistance of all relevant parties, we were able to complete it. Now, the cotton cloth that should be allocated to each retailer has been fully distributed. The temporary rationing will temporarily end at the end of this month. However, after checking, the duration of this temporary rationing was set from June 1st to November 30th of this year and will not be extended. There are now less than five days until the deadline. Citizens who have not yet purchased with their certificates should do so promptly as scheduled. Once the deadline has passed, they will become waste paper.

### Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Shelters to Reduce Casualties

Fire Prevention Drinks: Water Preparation

(3) For example, a bomb falling in the center of the road seems capable of destroying all underground installations, such as water pipes and gas pipes. If directly hit, they are very likely to lose their effectiveness. Therefore, sufficient fire prevention water should be prepared, and the importance of water wells that can be used as drinking water in emergencies should be re-recognized. At this time, the reliance on gas, water, and electricity should be forgotten. In addition, preparations should be made in advance for communication and reporting when telephone lines are unavailable to ensure thoroughness.

(4) The idea that incendiary bombs can only cause fires and bombs can only cause destruction should be corrected. Bombs also have considerable heat and burning power when dropped, which can easily cause fires.

(5) Firefighting, rescue, and other facilities are limited, and can only be deployed at key points in emergencies. Therefore, it is necessary to abandon dependence on these facilities. Emergency rescue and initial firefighting training should be carried out in various areas, and efforts should be made to ensure that all kinds of training can be effectively utilized.

The Bystander Attitude Must Change

(6) In past air defense exercises, the training level of the Baojia and other personnel directly responsible for air defense has made considerable progress, which is gratifying. However, some citizens still adopt a bystander attitude. Therefore, if an actual air raid occurs, the majority of citizens are likely to be in danger. Some arbitrarily sit in rickshaws or watch aerial battles, while others repair roofs, thus suffering unexpected disasters. Therefore, in order to thoroughly promote air defense awareness, all citizens should take shelter in the future, and the general public should participate in shelter drills or other actions during normal air defense exercises.

Eliminate the Spread of Pro-Enemy Rumors

(7) Sometimes, friendly aircraft in aerial combat drop reserve fuel tanks for operational convenience, causing some people to mistakenly believe that friendly forces are dropping bombs, thus spreading rumors. This should be recognized and not trusted. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that some unscrupulous elements spread rumors, engage in pro-enemy behavior, or attempt to profit themselves. Citizens should cooperate more to eliminate these rumors. Anyone who unintentionally spreads rumors will be subject to severe penalties under military law.

(8) Furthermore, on the 21st, when enemy aircraft blindly bombed a certain location, some Baojia members from other areas went to visit the affected area. This behavior had a significant impact on the authorities' rescue efforts and should be avoided. Assistance to the authorities in the affected area is welcome, but mere sightseeing is prohibited. Baojia cadres should pay attention to this.

Hospitals Should Admit and Treat Patients as Much as Possible

The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department has noted that many civilians are injured during air raids, and general hospitals (including public and private) and physicians have an obligation to assist in rescue. Therefore, the department has specifically notified all hospitals and physicians' clinics in the city that if anyone is injured in an air raid, whether sent by the authorities or seeking treatment on their own, they must be treated immediately. Seriously injured patients should be allowed to stay in the hospital for treatment within the capacity of each hospital or clinic and should not be refused. It is reported that the Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department, together with personnel from the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, will be dispatched to various hospitals in the city to investigate the ward facilities and the number of beds in each hospital in preparation for necessary needs.

### Second Kamikaze Attack Unit

When the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet announced to the entire army the great exploits established by the First Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Shikishima Squadron on the Surigao Strait, the entire navy, filled with gratitude to the airmen fighting in the Philippines, resolved to destroy the enemy and their morale was further boosted. Prior to this, when the news of the formation of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit was first announced, all officers and men of the naval air force believed that this was a golden opportunity to fulfill their long-cherished wish, and they all wanted to join the Special Attack Unit, vying to be the first to carry out a suicide attack. Thus, the Second Special Attack Unit held a solemn naming and farewell ceremony on the 27th before departing from the base to the battlefield.

Departure Instructions

At 10:00 AM on the 27th, the enemy fleet, which had been heavily attacked by both the Japanese sea and air forces in the naval battle off the Philippine Islands and was on the verge of collapse, stubbornly approached with its surviving ships in an attempt to cover the army on Leyte Island. The Japanese naval air force, regardless of dawn, day, dusk, or night, continued to depart from the Philippine air fortress one after another without rest... continuous attacks left the enemy with no chance to breathe. At the base, reports and departures were intertwined, and enemy mobile units and ships in Leyte Gulf were successively buried at the bottom of the sea. In the midst of this tense and intense situation, the Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit quietly departed. In the skies above a certain place, friendly aircraft were flying out to attack. The Commander-in-Chief summoned the flight-suited crew members to headquarters and solemnly held a ceremony to deliver the orders. On the verdant ground, the crew members, with Commander K at the center, were neatly lined up. Their captain was Lieutenant 〇〇, 25 years old. They were all from pre-flight training or flight training, and the youngest was only 19 years old. Soon, the Commander-in-Chief walked to the platform, and the faces of the brave men all turned towards the Commander.

"Order of October 27th, Showa 19

Hereby order the air unit commanded by Commander K, Commander of the air unit at a certain base, to form a Special Attack Unit, with Lieutenant 〇〇 as the captain. The unit is named as follows:

Unit name: Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit

Squadron names: 'Loyalty,' 'Valor,' 'Pure Loyalty,' 'Utmost Sincerity,' 'Sincere Loyalty'"

The order was personally handed down by the Commander-in-Chief. The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, whose loyal souls would leave a lasting legacy, was thus born. The crew members stood upright and motionless. Next, the Commander made a farewell speech to them.

"Expecting not to return alive from battle is something the enemy can also do, but to be prepared from the beginning to sacrifice one's life to accomplish one's mission is something they cannot do. To demonstrate this great spiritual power, to reveal this supreme and pure spirit of sacrifice, is to be worthy of being a soldier of the divine land! Now, you have all done it, and you are truly the soldiers among soldiers!"

The Commander's sincere words were powerful and came from the heart. The crew members' expressions were firm and tense, like statues. The Commander continued, his voice even louder.

"You will certainly achieve your goals on your journey! Your loyalty, valor, pure loyalty, and utmost sincerity, your unparalleled achievements, will move the Emperor, and your parents, whether they are alive or not, will be truly gratified, and a hundred million compatriots will be grateful and moved. I deeply look forward to your success!"

The farewell speech ended. Soon, the Commander calmly said in a solemn tone: "Now, let's have a farewell drink!" The Commander and all the staff held a sincere farewell banquet in a corner of the square. Under the lush greenery, a white-clothed table was set with wine. The Commander, the staff, the Commander, the Deputy Commander, the Flight Commander, and the crew members faced each other at the national table.

"A toast, to wish you a safe journey and success!" The Commander raised his glass, and the crew members' glasses were filled with sacred wine. They smiled and drank it all in one gulp. At that moment, the hearts of the Commander and the crew members became one. It was early in the day, and each unit took one last commemorative photo. Those who were seeing them off bid farewell with tears, while those who were embarking smiled and departed. Thus, a new chapter was added to Japan's glorious history.

Hitting the Mark Every Time

The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, which departed that day, was commanded by Captain 〇〇, leading the squadrons of Loyalty, Valor, Pure Loyalty, Utmost Sincerity, and Sincere Loyalty, with Squadron Leader 〇〇 and Captain A commanding the escort fighter squadrons to provide cover.

At 2:30 PM, the aircraft waiting for departure, with bombs guaranteed to hit their targets loaded under their wings, began to start up in the line. Captain 〇〇 led the crew members in a line in front of the command post. Amidst the clatter of the aircraft engines, Captain 〇〇 made a clear departure report, his voice filled with the belief that they would win. The fate of the motherland rested on this battle!

"Now, we are giving up our lives to embark on the glorious mission of attacking enemy aircraft carriers."

After listening to this report, Commander K solemnly encouraged everyone:

"Good luck, do your best!"

At this moment, the Commander's eyes flashed with a look of hope. After that, the Flight Commander specified the key points regarding the attack strategy, and then Captain 〇〇 gave a final pep talk to the crew:

"If you are going to your death and you don't pay attention to the enemy fighters, you are terribly wrong. Although our escort squadrons will deal with the fighters, we should carefully protect ourselves before we reach the enemy mobile unit. If you die before you reach the enemy ships, your deaths will be in vain! So, you must still be on guard against enemy fighters. Watch carefully!"

The crew members nodded in unison. They would not die until they reached their targets. When they found their targets, they would desperately crash into the enemy ships. The only reason they wanted to preserve their lives was to die in the right place!

Thus, a few moments later, "Ah, let's go!" The crew members ran to their aircraft. On the way, they patted the fighter pilots who were responsible for providing cover, smiling and begging:

"Hey, please watch my final moment!"

After that, they casually threw the cigarettes they were smoking on the ground and stomped on them with their flight boots, quickly walking towards the aircraft.

The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, from the Commander to the crew members, just like in their normal training, calmly and unhurriedly, one aircraft, two aircraft, three aircraft, departed in succession from the base from which they would never return. Commander-in-Chief, Commander K, the Flight Commander, and the maintenance crew waved their white cloths. The aircraft formed a magnificent formation in the sky above, circled the base once, and then flew east. Until the aircraft disappeared into the distant horizon, no one moved a step. Commander K remained at the base, praying for the success of the mission.

"Let the Divine Wind rise with human bombs, resolutely advancing, and even ghosts and gods will make way!" Just like this belief, the results of their loyalty were brought to the headquarters. The Kamikaze Special Attack Unit went to the Gulf of Leyte and the eastern sea of the Philippines, successfully hitting many enemy ships and establishing great merit.

### Fallen Star

— Yi Xuan

I don't often take buses; unless the road is very long, I prefer to walk. But after a major illness at the office, my physical strength greatly declined. Every morning, I had to take the tram to school; sometimes I carried painting supplies. In the crowded car, it was truly a great burden, even more tiring than walking. At this time, a kind old man would often give up his seat. Later, it almost became a routine. If I didn't have a seat, I was extremely grateful, but other than a soft "Thank you," I could only gaze at his silvery white hair, offering sincere thanks in my heart.

We got off at the same stop. I often followed behind him, watching him stoop, his hands inserted into the pockets of his worn-out overcoat, slowly walking step by step into the cemetery near my school.

What a desolate place a cemetery is. Under the pure white tombstones, whether lying there is extraordinary talent or unparalleled beauty, now they all decay in their bodies like ordinary people. Here, you can't hear joyful laughter or see pleasant expressions. Although there are lush trees and vibrant flowers, there's not a trace of vitality. Even the songs of birds are filled with lonely and tragic tunes. Here, there are only brimming tearful eyes and soft sobs. Why does the old man go there every day without fail? Could his relatives be buried inside? So, in addition to respect, I also felt sympathy.

It was a drizzly, late-autumn morning. The gloomy sky was like a huge lead block, gray and lifeless. I felt an unusual tightness in my chest and was mentally distracted, with some slight melancholy and some light complaints. The car was more crowded than usual. When we reached our destination, the car hadn't stopped yet, but the door was already open. I stood at the door, waiting for it to stop. Unexpectedly, a casual glance nearly made me fall forward. At this moment, an arm stopped me. When I slightly regained my senses, preparing to thank him, suddenly, as the hand withdrew, I exclaimed in surprise. That hand, except for a part of the thumb, was just a flat piece of flesh. I leaned woodenly against the wall of the car, forgetting to move. I realized that this was the old man's right hand. In that instant of exclamation, I met his kind gaze and also heard a slight sigh. In that glance and sigh, there was sadness, there was blame. Although I didn't know the reason for his missing finger, how painful is it to be disabled? For an elderly disabled person, how could I have treated him so rashly, almost disrespectfully?

I really wanted to rush up and apologize to him, beg for forgiveness, but I didn't do it. My mood was uneasy all day. At any moment, I could imagine an old man, wandering among the tombstones, lamenting all that he had lost. This kind of melancholy weather, coupled with an uneven and bumpy fate, is unbearable to look back on! Pitiful old man!

For several days in a row, I deliberately left early. I was ashamed of my rudeness. I dared not meet those deer-like, kind eyes again. But even so, it couldn't restore peace to my soul. On the contrary, this impression became more and more painful in my heart.

"Child, sit here!" I met him again. When I just got on the car and saw him, I unconsciously held my breath, lowered my head, and turned my back to him, but his left hand still touched my shoulder. When I looked up to thank him, from his kind, condescending gaze, I knew that he had forgiven me.

School life is like a quiet stream of water. Occasionally, throwing in a small stone will cause ripples to spread in circles. Therefore, the news that all the middle schools in the city would jointly hold an art exhibition next year on New Year's Day drove us crazy. Everyone was concentrating on conceiving how to create a great work to win that gold medal.

The green grass had all withered and yellowed. Except for some evergreen trees, all the branches were bare. The natural world presented only the scenery of winter. The students all began to work nervously, but my bookshelf was still a blank sheet of paper. I didn't want to paint an ordinary painting and waste time and effort. My mentality was ridiculously absurd, in that I had to win the championship honor, even though my grades were only good enough to be the best in our school. After two weeks of consideration, I decided to do a sketch of the cemetery. I wanted to pour all my strength into completing it.

The next day, I stepped into that desolate garden with extreme hope. Among the countless upright crosses, I solemnly looked around, preparing to find a suitable place to paint.

Ahead, there was a woman kneeling beside a tomb, crying. Not far from her, there was a man silently offering flowers. I quickly set up my painting supplies and worked attentively. By evening, I had drawn the entire outline, but looking at it carefully, I always felt that the result was not as perfect as I had hoped. It was getting dark, so I had to pack up and come back to paint again tomorrow.

The next day, I spent the whole day trying to modify that draft, but I couldn't get it right. Annoyed, I seemed to feel someone behind me. Looking back, it turned out to be the old man.

"Failed?" he asked me very gently. "Yes," I frowned tightly.

"You forgot something!"

"What did I forget?" I rummaged through my paint box. I didn't forget anything.

"You forgot to put your emotions into it! Therefore, your painting has only become colorful paper without a soul!" "Emotions?"

"Yes, emotions are the soul of art. When you hear a wonderful piece of music, you can rejoice or grieve with its notes. Similarly, a successful picture can also express the author's emotions and thoughts, and control people. Why did you come here to sketch? Are you trying to show people that this is a tragic place, that it has swallowed many people's loved ones, separated them into two worlds, leaving behind poignant longing and heart-wrenching grief? But you didn't paint those emotions into it. You only painted some dull images!"

I suddenly understood, and at the same time, I couldn't help but admire his wisdom. I had always thought that he was just a pitiful cemetery caretaker, but now I felt like I was as small as a grain of dust.

The setting sun was sinking in the west, crows were flocking back to their nests, and the west wind was blowing through the bare branches, seeming to play a lonely song for the world. I looked at the densely arranged crosses in front of me. The old man slowly walked between the tombstones, often bending down to pick up the withered bouquets that the mourners had offered.

My inspiration suddenly surged. I resolutely rearranged the paper, breathed on my frozen fingers, and started working again.

From then on, every time I painted, the old man would always guide me. Doubts also began to sprout in my heart. Several times I asked him, "You must have studied painting, right?" "No, no," he shook his head, walking further away.

My painting was finally completed. The teachers all praised it highly, the students cast envious glances, and I myself was full of pride.

The day before the exhibition opened, I learned his address from another young man who also frequented the cemetery. He lived in a dim attic. When I pushed the door open and went in, he opened his eyes wide in surprise and looked at me. His cheeks had a fiery blush. I touched his burning hot forehead. Anxiety made me forget all words of comfort.

"Sit for a while! I really wanted to visit your exhibition, but my illness just won't get better." That voice was as low as a mosquito's buzz.

"Tomorrow is the final. I really hope you come!"

"I also long to come. You know art is my life, but I..." He stopped talking. At this moment, I immediately noticed the many picture frames hanging on the wall. I couldn't help but walk over to admire them. The vigorous brushstrokes, the unique layout, all showed that they were not from an ordinary hand.

"Whose works are these?" I turned back to ask the old man, but he closed his eyes and didn't say a word. Suddenly, I realized that these might be the old man's works. Just then, I discovered the two words "Lin Yu" in the lower corner of a painting.

This familiar name attracted me. Finally, I blurted out in a low voice, "Oh! Lin Yu!" "How do you know him?" It was the old man's weak voice.

"He was my uncle's classmate. I often heard my uncle talk about him. He was a talented painter."

"A talented painter..." the old man muttered to himself, a look of resentment seeming to be revealed on his face, his eyes shooting out bright rays, "Talent without money and power to cultivate it only leads to decline."

"You also know him?" I deliberately probed.

"Yes," he closed his eyes again, "He's finished! Poverty forced him. For his wife's childbirth expenses, he had to work in a factory. As a result, a machine crushed his finger, and his wife had a miscarriage and died. He drifted alone in the world, spending all day guarding his wife's grave..."

"Lin Yu is you!..." I exclaimed in surprise. The corners of his mouth twitched, and tears constantly welled up in his sunken eye sockets.

"But why don't you hold exhibitions?" After a long time, I came up with this sentence.

"Alas! You are still young. You don't understand that this is a world of power. I don't have a lot of money to promote myself, and I don't have famous celebrities to tout for me. And I don't want to beg for pity from others because of material deficiencies, insulting the sacred art... It's over! I'm finished!"

I felt dazed, as if in a dream, but I knew that this was a real dream.

The room gradually darkened, and people and things all wore blurry shadows.

"You can go back!" His voice was even weaker. "Go back! Don't mention me to anyone. In my life, I least want to receive other people's pity."

I still stood there, not moving. "Maybe I'll get better tomorrow."

Until the final the next afternoon, my mood was still in a state of turmoil. I didn't believe that society was so cruel to an artist. At the same time, I was still thinking about how to help this impoverished old man. My body was in the exhibition hall, but my mind was far away. I seemed to hear someone shouting my name, but I was still lost. Only when the surrounding students were urging me did I wake up from my dream and stand up.

I finally achieved my goal. The gold medal was pinned on my chest! "This is not my honor. This is given to me by Lin Yu."

After the meeting, I rushed to the old man's place at the fastest speed. The room was still as quiet as yesterday. I tiptoed to his bedside. He was lying there peacefully. I couldn't suppress the joy in my heart. I wanted to share this joy with him.

I gently took his hand, just about to wake him up, but his hand was already as stiff as stone. I only felt a bone-chilling coldness seeping into my heart! Freezing my blood...

### Eulogy and Preface for Elder Toyama Mitsuru

— Wen Lanting

Indeed, to recall bright virtue may evoke shared sorrow across different eras; to admire outstanding talents may stir mutual lamentation despite separate countries. How much more so when residing in countries of the same continent, where deep affection exists for heroes who have lived through life, and witnessing the nurturing of courage to perform heroic deeds by a commoner; welcoming neighboring good friends, engaging in heart-to-heart discussions. Remembering the previous contributions of aid, which truly benefited our country! Toyama Mitsuru of Japan is a revered elder of the Eastern nation. As a leader of an opposition party, he served as a respected figure through four dynasties. Tracing back to his founding of the Genyosha, to gather young people, and publishing the Fukuryo Shinbun to propagate his principles, his devotion to national affairs, not to be swayed by major parties, has long been known throughout Kyushu and praised by neighboring countries. Uniquely, for fifty years he has assisted our country's revolution, supporting the success of our predecessors, with integrity and sincerity, worthy of gratitude. Initially, when our Father of the Nation (Sun Yat-sen) was besieged in London, he traveled east to Japan, immediately interacting with Elder Toyama. Subsequently, when the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established in Tokyo, as a base for rebuilding revolutionary strategies, many in Japan's government and public supported it, and Elder Toyama especially assisted and guided from the side. And when the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the Father of the Nation returned from overseas, Elder Toyama promptly rushed to Shanghai to welcome him. Since then, our country's patriots who went to Japan to visit Elder Toyama almost all listened to his teachings and received his guidance. Therefore, according to what my Chinese ancients said, "accepting exiles, generously loading carriages," his spirit of chivalry is like that of Lord Lu who lost his family, and "offering silk to reciprocate," his friendship with Wu neighbors is like that of Gongsun Qiao, diminishing the merits of Qin, and treating gold as trifling. Considering his noble spirit, it is even like that of Lu Zhonglian. Now, I hear that Elder Toyama passed away on October 6th of this year, enjoying a lifespan of ninety years. Considering the vastness of the ocean, and the war being at its height, hoping for harmony between the two countries, the venerable elder has suddenly departed. In the past, Yanling had a memorial erected for a traveler who died, and the judge of Lu, passing by, inscribed it on a tablet. When Xu Jun died, the Duke of Wu hung his sword for him. These were all individuals who were not of the same country, yet their admiration for the illustrious demeanor led to repeated expressions of sentiment. May we follow their example, and thus write a eulogy:

"Oh, Elder Toyama, a revered elder of the Eastern nation, a progressive of the intelligentsia, and a close friend of the Father of the Nation. His character is fit to be cast in gold, his reputation is admired like the Big Dipper. Why not a hundred years, to suddenly hear of his passing away? Before the Restoration, he was born in Fukuoka, not seeking officialdom, but his name spread widely as he gathered like-minded individuals, having both courage and knowledge, ready to serve the country, with a strong determination to uphold the Emperor. He greatly advocated the East Asian Alliance, consistently adhering to his principles, thinking to unite the two countries. As for our Father of the Nation, seeking to save the country, their views coincided, and they were perfectly aligned. Throughout his revolutionary life, he frequently traveled to the East, relying on Elder Toyama's management, the Father of the Nation passed away, his spirit entering the netherworld, Elder Toyama came to hold the ropes, his old tears flowing freely. Human schemes, and ghostly machinations, national relations were complex and conflicting, brotherly customs, holding up against foreign insults, fortunately with enlightened intelligence, setting right errors, the friendship was aligned with the Alliance, East Asia could be independent, and it’s great flag flies high, the sea waves fly and roar, victory is in sight, the morning light is subtle, the principles have been thoroughly implemented, the Rising Sun shines again. Elder Toyama could not preside, at ninety a sudden loss. Elder Toyama returns to the nine springs (the afterlife), his name remains in the histories, a lifespan of ninety years, spent in striving for the homeland, his successors carry on his will, following in the footsteps without changing, honored in life and mourned in death, moving neighbors and those afar. Times are difficult, like wind and rain, at sea we remember and give a final tribute, the elite will all come, remembering the merit of you, with one heart. Our friend has sorrow, and I, too, am bathed with sad emotion."

### A Record of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru

— Ding Mo

At the mention of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, anyone in the world with even a slight knowledge of East Asian affairs must have heard of that illustrious figure.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru was not only a promoter of the Japanese Empire but also a friend of the East Asian revolution.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru lived for ninety years, spanning the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras since his birth in Ansei 2 (i.e., 1855). His life can be described as the modern history of Japan's rise. The reason why Japan has become so strong, leading East Asia, and displaying its power to the world is due in no small part to Mr. Toyama Mitsuru's advocacy and promotion within the broader social strata.

He harbored great ambitions from a young age. He opposed clan politics and was dissatisfied with the autocratic tendencies of the political system after the Meiji Restoration, thus advocating the civil rights movement. However, while promoting civil rights, he still advocated respecting the imperial family and preserving the traditional character of the Japanese state. The famous Genyosha, which he led at the time, promoted these three main principles:

(1) Respect for the Imperial Family

(2) Promotion of National Power Overseas

(3) Respect for Civil Rights

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru was truly the pioneer of the Japanese nationalist movement. He combined influential figures in the general society to engage in activities to promote the prestige of the Japanese Empire, and to promote Pan-Asianism. Its headquarters was the Genyosha, initially gathered by fellow countrymen in Fukuoka. The Genyosha occupies a very important position in the history of Japanese national movements. During the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, many members of the Genyosha dedicated themselves to the country and established great achievements. The Genyosha has produced successive generations of talented individuals. The former Prime Minister Hirota Koki, who is now an important minister of Japan, was Mr. Toyama Mitsuru's proud disciple. The current Director of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau and Minister of State, Ogata Taketora, and others are also figures who came from the Genyosha.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru had a broad mind, and his disciples were all over the country and even in East Asia. He greatly admired the words of Lu Xinwu of the Ming Dynasty, "Enlarge your heart to answer the things of the world, empty your heart to contain the good of the world," and established them as a motto. He also believed that a person's heart should and can be stripped bare like a person's body, advocating to serve people with virtue and sincerity. One can imagine his magnanimity. This is also precisely why he was able to absorb a large number of patriots under his command.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru also loved Sinology and worshiped Confucius and Mencius, so he was also a scholar. He was very sympathetic to China. When the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, was engaged in revolution, he received a lot of help from him. Leader Wang Jingwei often sought guidance from him during his lifetime.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru not only gave great support to China, but also to the revolutionary movements of other countries in East Asia. When the Indian patriot Bihari Bose fled to Japan, he was also protected by Mr. Toyama and was able to avoid trouble.

Such a giant has now abandoned us and passed away. According to Japanese people, hearing of Mr. Toyama's death is like losing a loving father. People throughout East Asia must feel the same way.

When Mr. Toyama was alive, he devoted his entire life to national affairs as an ordinary citizen. He died without any official rank or position, which is truly rare in the world.

On September 27th of this year, Mr. Toyama wrote and presented the words "Loyalty, Courage, Righteousness, and Valour" and "Eternal Imperial Fortune" to his acquaintances. These have become Mr. Toyama's last words.

It is said that disciples Hirota Koki, Ogata Taketora, Miyagawa Gorosaburo, and others will compile a biography of Mr. Toyama. The biography will be very different from the ones previously published. The content will mostly be things that Mr. Toyama verbally recounted, which are very precious. The title is tentatively set as "The Complete Biography of Toyama Mitsuru." Once this book is published, Mr. Toyama's life will surely be made known to the world in detail.

— Ding Mo

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru is not only the promoter of the Emperor of Japan, but also the friend of the East Asian Revolution.

Mr. Toyama Mitsuru lived for ninety years, since his birth in Anzheng two years (ie 1855), across the Meiji, Taisho, Showa three generations, his life can be said to be the modern history of Japan's construction. The reason why Japan can have such a strong, leading East Asia, Yangwei the world, Mr. Toyama Mitsuru in the vast social strata to promote the power, its merit is not to be eliminated.

He had great ambitions in his childhood. He opposed the feudal political system, and he was not satisfied with the political form of autocratic tendencies after the Meiji Restoration, but introduced the civil governance movement. However, while introducing civil rights, he still advocated respecting the imperial family and maintaining the traditional character of the Japanese state. The famous Genyosha, which he led at that time, advocated such three major programs.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament: Class A Hua Lian Advances Another Round; Will Face Formidable Opponent Da Hua This Week

The Shen Bao Cup basketball tournament has become increasingly clear in its standings since Hua Lian Pharmaceutical's victory over the Shan team this week, and Da Hua's forfeit to Zhong Bei. Hua Lian still has two matches left, against Da Hua and Zhong Bei, both of which are difficult challenges. Success will depend on the strategy of Zhang Xiangxiang and Yan Youling, as well as the efforts of all players. The results of this week's Class A matches and noteworthy games are recorded below, with brief comments. There were no significant Class B matches this week, but next week's matches, including Ren Yu vs. [blank] in Class B Division One, and Da Hua Fat Team vs. Zhong Bei vs. Ling You in Class B Division Two, will all be battles for the championship, sure to be intense.

This Week's Class A Results

20th (Monday)

Hua Liang Wins Against V Team 35-28

Da Hua Wins Against Ming Xing 30-26

22nd (Wednesday)

Hua Lian Wins Against Shan Yu 32-25

Ren Yu vs. Tong Ren: Alarm Ends Game Prematurely

24th (Friday)

Zhong Bei Wins Against Da Hua by Forfeit

Recent Class A Standings

The following four matches are worthy of comment from the past week.

Hua Lian Defeats Agile Shan Team

The match between Hua Lian and the Shan team was particularly anticipated by fans, and the temporary price increase by this newspaper was to benefit the scholarship fund. Before the match, many predicted Hua Lian would win, and the result was as expected. Hua Lian's victory was mainly due to their experience and composure, as well as their successful tactics. The team adopted a man-to-man defense. Their positioning consistently kept them within arm's reach of their assigned player, the most suitable position for man-to-man defense. Being too close makes it easy to foul or be tricked, while staying within arm's reach allows one to block the opponent's throws and makes it difficult for them to break through. This limited the opportunities for Shan team's Lin Weicong and Chen Qingjiang, leading to their defeat. Individually, Hua Lian's Wu Chengzhang was the most successful player on the court. He almost single-handedly took care of the missed shots under the basket, making him a major contributor to Hua Lian's victory. As for the Shan team's performance, their quick shots were pleasing to the eye, beautiful, and clear. Lin Weicong's first basket and Chen Qingjiang's two breakthroughs were moments of brilliance. Their defeat was due to not yet reaching a state of perfected skill. At times they seemed overly eager, while at other times they were too hesitant. However, as an emerging team, their progress is commendable. With some guidance, their future is limitless.

Ren Yu and Tong Ren to Complete Game Tomorrow

Ren Yu versus Tong Ren was also an evenly matched contest. With much at stake regarding their rankings, both sides gave their all. In the past, the Xuan family team, led by Shen Shou Xuan Jun, was known for its offensive prowess, but Xuan Jun's illness has affected their strength. Fortunately, Lu Dazhen has come to Shanghai to join the team, so the impact has been minimal. However, the team's unremarkable performance this season is due to the players' work commitments, which limit their training time together. Under the management of Chen Weiyuan and the guidance of Yu Huanzi, the Ren Yu team has made progress. The match between the two teams was exciting, with a tense atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Ren Yu was leading 32 to 25 with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining when the air raid siren sounded and the game could not continue. After discussion, the authorities decided to complete the game tomorrow (27th) at 6:15 PM. Players from both teams should take note and arrive on time.

Hua Ying Triumphs, Ming Xing Retreats in Defeat

Hua Ying's performance in the Shen Bao Cup has not been as good as Ming Xing's, so many predicted that Ming Xing would defeat Hua Ying. Unexpectedly, Hua Ying's main player, Bao Songjia, rushed over from Suzhou to help the team, boosting morale. Conversely, Ming Xing's Wang Jinghu was unable to come to Shanghai, and He Xiaoguang also did not appear. Furthermore, Tao Shaosheng happened to be unavailable. With the addition of [blank] Qiao Lai [blank] to participate in the game, the team suffered a great loss. Each member of the Hua Ying team performed normally. Wang Xuewu's shots were smooth, Bao Songyuan was active, and his ability to guard the opponent's center was a major reason for their victory. With Ming Xing missing players and Fan Xirong committing four fouls, their defeat was inevitable. In this match, the importance of coaching was evident. During halftime, Qian Xucang's instructions to the players were thorough. As a result, the players were able to follow his advice, leading to victory.

Zhong Bei and Da Hua Deliver a Remarkable Performance

Both sides delivered a remarkable performance, full of suspense. Da Hua adjusted its lineup and used man-to-man defense, choosing players with high stamina as a countermeasure. However, in my opinion, Da Hua's man-to-man defense was too tight. With sufficient stamina, it would be very effective, but because the team had one or two players whose stamina was insufficient, they failed to achieve the ideal result. Zhong Bei's [blank] style has its merits, particularly their individual skills. However, the players' recent form has declined. Shen Yugong, the team's soul, has recently had bad luck with his shots, often missing the basket, probably due to lack of practice. In the first half of the match, Da Hua played freely, winning 17 to 10. In the second half, Zhong Bei suddenly recovered, putting on a final push and eventually taking the lead by five points.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (5)

(5) One-Handed Underhand Pass

The one-handed underhand pass is more widely used and valuable than the two-handed underhand pass, especially for short passes. In addition to using one hand to grip the ball slightly underneath when passing, the other methods are similar to the two-handed underhand pass. This type of pass is used under the basket. When the opponent approaches and spreads their arms for defense, the ball can be quickly passed under their arm to a teammate running towards the basket for a shot, which is particularly effective.

(Scholarship) Bounce Pass

The value and application of the bounce pass are increasingly significant. Regardless of the offensive strategy, this type of pass is [blank]. [Blank] is especially useful when [blank] is close to the defense, or [blank] when executed in the corner. [Blank] is particularly effective for deceiving the opponent, pretending to pass high or shoot, leaving the opponent unable to anticipate.

This type of pass can be executed with either two hands or one hand, depending on the position of the opponent, but it is mostly done with two hands. When passing to a teammate running forward to receive the ball, the ball should be spun backward to shorten the angle of the bounce for easier reception. The method of spinning the ball is to press and rotate the ball backward and downward with both thumbs. To make the angle of the bounce longer, do the opposite and rotate the ball forward. Regardless of the [blank] distance, the ball must bounce off the ground, with the rebound reaching the receiver's abdomen. The ball should hit the ground near the defender's feet and under their extended arms. This should not be used if the opponent is defending from more than two [blank] away, as it can easily be intercepted.
