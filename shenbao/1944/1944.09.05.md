### Relief Movement for Victims of Bombings

Since the start of the Hunan campaign and the Japanese army's occupation of Changsha and Hengyang, the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing has increasingly displayed frantic and desperate behavior. According to various sources, the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombing peaceful areas, especially the areas around Hankou, Changsha, and Hengyang, which are relatively close and frequently bombed. Moreover, their bombing targets are not military strongholds, but indiscriminate bombing without a clear target, resulting in damage to the lives and property of innocent people. In particular, civilians have been displaced and families have been torn apart, which is extremely tragic.

Based on the compassion that "everyone possesses," we cannot stand idly by and must find ways to provide relief to our compatriots who have been innocently affected. Secondly, from the government's standpoint, the people in the peaceful areas who have been affected should be given the utmost care. The people of Changsha and Hengyang are just now coming over in droves, and it is especially necessary to appease the refugees to show the government's love for the people. At the same time, in order to win over public support and let the people under Chongqing's rule understand the genuine love of the government within the peaceful areas, this is even more important politically. Therefore, we should do our best to support the relief movement initiated by the people.

Based on the above motives, we advocate initiating a movement to provide relief to civilians affected by the bombings, organizing a relief association, planning fundraising and relief work, promoting it through civic leaders, and encouraging people from all walks of life to contribute money and effort to jointly promote its success. As for the steps to be taken, we suggest the following:

Charitable organizations or civic leaders should immediately take the initiative to discuss and organize a preparatory committee, appoint respected civic leaders to all positions, and then decide on the way forward. Civic leaders are usually enthusiastic about charitable and public welfare causes, and they will certainly not shirk their responsibilities and will be happy to accept.

The media should do their best to promote the movement, arouse public sympathy, and encourage people to contribute money and effort. For large donations exceeding a certain amount, the government should commend them. If necessary, organize fundraising teams to solicit donations separately to maximize the effect.

The banking and money industry association should designate several banks and money houses to collect donations. Donation reports should be published in newspapers to enhance credibility. A separate committee should be established to manage the donations, and the finances should be absolutely transparent.

It is currently early autumn, and deep autumn will arrive in the blink of an eye. The weather is getting colder, and the two things that disaster victims need most are food and clothing. At this time of transportation difficulties, the principle for food should be to obtain it locally, remit funds to the affected areas, and purchase and distribute food locally. For example, Changsha and Hengyang are both located in the rice-producing center of Hunan, so there is no problem in procuring it locally. In terms of clothing, local procurement should also be the main focus if possible. Otherwise, we can only discuss with the Cotton Control Association to allocate ordinary cloth and cotton, and transport the raw materials or finished clothes to the affected areas.

If funds are remitted to the disaster-stricken areas to purchase relief supplies locally, please ask the local civic leaders and the government to assist in the process. The relief association in this city will send staff members to make contact in order to maximize efficiency. If goods are purchased and prepared in this city for transportation and distribution, the transportation problem is extremely important, and full assistance from the Allied authorities is particularly necessary.

The Allied authorities launched the Henan-Hunan campaign with the goal of destroying the enemy's U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing and removing obstacles to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, they have no hostility towards the people in the war zone and have repeatedly stated that they will preserve vitality and protect the people wherever the army goes, and have expressed indignation at the indiscriminate bombing by the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing. If this city launches a relief movement for the victims of the bombings, we firmly believe that they will do their best to cooperate, which is our final expectation.

### Fierce Fighting Continues on the Coast of Dien Bien Phu - Infighting in Anglo-American Forces in Southeast Asia

Central Pacific Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - On September 1, a unit of American troops invaded the coast of Nasdi, 20 kilometers south of Dien Bien Phu Island. Japanese and American forces are currently continuing to engage in fierce fighting in that area.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, the British "Tribune" magazine on the 2nd revealed the infighting between Mountbatten and Stilwell within the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia: "Under Mountbatten, Deputy Commander Stilwell, who represents the American forces fighting in the East Asia Theater, often disagrees with Mountbatten on the issue of China. Although the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia have repeatedly held headquarters meetings in the past six months, Stilwell has only attended twice. The British Indian Army even criticized him as a "verbal fighter." The United States has repeatedly attacked the British forces in India and Burma as incompetent, but what has Stilwell contributed? Although he boasted about opening the Ledo Road, his actual performance was that he used a large army of 12,000 to attack a very small number of Japanese troops in northern Burma, spending two months without achieving any results. Only when the Chongqing army came to the rescue was he able to advance. His own ability can be seen."

### Attention Should Be Paid to Judicial Independence - Both Funding and Talent Are Important - Talk by President Wen of the Judicial Yuan

Wen Zongyao, President of the Judicial Yuan, recently expressed the following views on judicial issues: "The quality of the judiciary is closely related to the support of the people. The people's lives, bodily freedom, property, and reputation are all entrusted to the judiciary. If the judiciary is good, the people's rights will be protected, and they will naturally be supportive. If the judiciary is bad, the people's rights will be lost, and they will naturally be betrayed. Therefore, since the French jurist Montesquieu advocated the theory of the separation of legislative, judicial, and executive powers, the judiciary of all civilized countries has been independent. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, created the Five-Power Constitution, but in addition to the legislative, judicial, and executive powers, he added the powers of supervision and examination, and his advocacy of judicial independence remains unchanged.

Our country's judiciary originally had real officials, such as the scholar-officials of the Tang and Yu dynasties, the Secretary of Justice of the Zhou dynasty, and the Court Commandant of the Han dynasty. However, due to the lack of a clear system and unclear authority, it was difficult to say that the form and spirit were independent. In the past, those who exercised judicial power belonged to administrative officials, and their independence was even more remote. It was not until the preparation for constitutionalism, in the second year of Xuantong, that courts and procuratorates at all levels were established in the provincial capitals and commercial ports, separating the judiciary from the executive, that the foundation for independence was laid. Since the founding of the Republic of China more than 30 years ago, although many courts have been added successively, the country has suffered frequent disasters, and peace has not been seen. The judiciary has also been greatly affected, not only has it not been independent, but it has also deteriorated. Now, with the cooperation of our ally Japan, we are fortunate to have abolished the unequal treaties and revoked extraterritoriality. The judiciary should be thoroughly reformed in a timely manner in order to repay the goodwill of our ally. It is shameful and frightening to say this.

If the judiciary is to be independent, we must pay attention to two things: first, funding. In the past, our country's judicial funding was not borne by the central government, but by the local governments, so the administrative heads of the provinces regarded the senior judges and procurators as their subordinates. The annual judicial budget was often cut, and even if the budget was fixed, it would be discounted and delayed, and they would not be willing to issue it in full and on time. They interfered in litigation cases at will, and senior judges and procurators had to rely on their superiors and seek perfection in a roundabout way. After the return of the National Government to the capital, the government corrected this malpractice and changed the judicial funding to be paid by the national treasury, which was a major turning point in the reform of the judiciary. However, there are many important government affairs to be undertaken in a country, and the country's financial resources are almost exhausted, so what is allocated to the judiciary is still a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. In addition, prices are rising endlessly. Judges are busy day and night hearing lawsuits, and when they look around, they see their families crying out in hunger and cold. Those who have support will find better places to work, and those who do not have support will live a difficult life. Unworthy people will change their morals, disregard their reputation, take bribes and pervert the law, and turn right and wrong upside down. Can such a judiciary still be independent? The second thing is talent. The ancient saying is that a mere law cannot be self-enforcing, and the lamentation of the difficulty of finding talent cannot be avoided even in a prosperous age, let alone today when comprehensive peace has not yet been realized. The Examination Yuan held two higher examinations in the years of Gengchen and Wu, and only recruited more than 20 judges. The Judicial Administrative Department has held judicial officer training courses for many years, but the number of graduates is also very small. When vacancies occur in courts and procuratorates at all levels, it is difficult to find suitable personnel to fill them. Cases that should be heard by a collegial panel cannot be opened for a long time because there are not enough judges. Litigation is backlogged and the people are suffering. Can all of this be blamed on the judges' dereliction of duty? In addition, many senior judges have retired, and a general influx of young newcomers have suddenly shouldered the responsibility of judging and prosecuting, losing their leadership, and the danger is even more worrisome. Therefore, in today's world, judicial talent and judicial funding are equally important. If these two important things cannot be done, then judicial independence will remain an illusion."

### On the Road to Jiangpu

— Min Xian

Short Report from Nanjing - The reporter has been investigating the actual situation in various rural villages in the suburbs of the capital in recent days and has seen an outline of the situation in each village. He then crossed the river and entered the territory of Jiangpu County. Although the county is only separated from Nanjing by a river, the situation is very different.

Fourth Master's Arrogance - After leaving Pukou Station and entering Gaoli Township, many unnatural phenomena were discovered, and several young people paid attention to the reporter and asked where he came from. It turned out that although the township was only more than 20 miles away from Nanmen Town, where the Jiangpu County Office is located, it was actually a place occupied by the Fourth Master (the villagers call the New Fourth Army the Fourth Master). Difficulties occurred repeatedly, but luckily no accidents occurred.

Special Forces - Then, when turning into Beicheng Township and Wenhe Township, what was seen and heard was different. It turned out that there was another special force in these two townships, the so-called Captain Li Tingfu, who had more than 100 guns and hundreds of men, specializing in robbing homes and not subject to any control. Although it was said that the captain was sent by Chongqing, the work he did was not beneficial to Chongqing. In short, it was a mess. The reporter, posing as a benefactor, stayed in these two townships for several hours. The rural situation on the surface was similar to that of the suburbs of the capital, but the internal hardships were unspeakable. In short, without security, rural construction is out of the question.

Clean Land - When entering Nanmen Town, the heart was relieved. The town is now the location of the Jiangpu County Office and has 1,120 households and more than 10,000 people. Together with the neighboring Dongmen Town, it is the clean land of Jiangpu County. In order to investigate the rural situation, the reporter still went outside the town and had individual conversations with most of the farmers. Most of them were disturbed and uneasy because security could not be ensured, and the harvest was not good, and usury was rampant. Most of the farmers were groaning in hardship.

Unaware of Increased Production - The reporter repeatedly asked the farmers whether they were touched by the government's emphasis on agricultural production and the establishment of institutions to promote it in recent years. They were completely unaware. When asked at various relevant institutions, such as township, bao, and town offices, the response was generally uninterested. Some said they had seen it in the newspaper, and some said they had received one or two official documents about increasing production. In short, it had no effect at all. From this, it can be seen that if this great cause of national construction relies only on establishing many institutions, formulating plans, and issuing high-sounding theories, without going deep into the bottom, it will be difficult to achieve results.

This year, because the Japanese army began the mainland operation, the 12th Central Committee Plenary Session was hastily convened in late May to discuss countermeasures. After the battles in Henan and Hunan came to an end, the mainland operation has plunged the Chongqing side into crisis, so the Chongqing government is holding the Political Council meeting to report on various situations.

Once the above conditions are met, the Soviet Union is prepared to receive a Finnish envoy in Moscow to discuss armistice and peace terms. The Finnish authorities have considered the steps to coordinate with the Soviet Union, and Parliament immediately agreed to this policy and gave the government a vote of confidence. Regarding relations with Germany, this decision should be made due to the changing circumstances. The agreement signed by the previous Prime Minister with Germany was not approved by Parliament and does not have legal value under national law.

Relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union will become closer after Sheng Shicai's resignation, but this may lead to the biggest event in East Asia's future.

In the current decisive battle period where the fate of the nation is at stake, the center of war guidance is naturally the standing bureaus of the army and navy. In the current era of total war, the driving force is military force. Diplomatic warfare, economic warfare, and ideological warfare, which are closely related to this, should be vigorously deployed. However, the goals of each of these are to maximize the function of military force and achieve final glorious victory. Now that the battlefield is about to spread to the homeland, the responsibility of defending the country is becoming increasingly important. Matters regarding the use of troops and operations are exclusively under the control of the Supreme Command. However, Japan's political situation and administrative structure, even in general administration, bear a significant responsibility, directly or indirectly, to the army and navy authorities. This is why the Japanese army and navy authorities hold the decisive key in war guidance.

However, the state of modern warfare, "beginning with the army and navy, ending with the national strength, is already limitless. The integration of the military and the people" is strongly demanded. Especially in the current fierce decisive battle situation, there is no distinction between the battlefield and the rear, and all national strength is devoted to the war. From this point of view, the close connection between the commander and the state is absolutely crucial for the army and navy authorities at the center of war guidance. Furthermore, the harmonious cooperation of the army and navy authorities ensures the invulnerability of the war guidance line. The above two major issues must be said to be the biggest goals in war guidance. Coordination between Command and State Affairs

The Imperial General Headquarters, the supreme organ for planning strategy, has been established since the China Incident. Repeated troop deployments and operations have been planned by the Imperial General Headquarters.

However, the current state of the Greater East Asia War differs from the situation in the Russo-Japanese War, where military preparations accumulated during the ten years of perseverance after the Triple Intervention were used to fight. In order to continue the massive war of attrition, a huge amount of military production is necessary as a rear-force supply to support the bold operations at the front line. Moreover, due to the direction and scope of command, it is inevitable to turn all national strength into combat power. On the other hand, the scale and scope of troop deployments and operations are naturally determined by the limits of combat power. As a result, the interdependent relationship between command and state affairs has become increasingly prominent with the prolongation and intensification of the war. Currently, the close connection between command and state affairs is being strongly promoted.

The Supreme War Guidance Council, established last time, will adapt to the demands of this situation. Although the Liaison Conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government has achieved great results, it has not reached the supreme goal of unifying politics and war. The Supreme War Guidance Council this time aims to formulate fundamental policies for strengthening war guidance and to align and coordinate political and military strategies. From this point of view, the shift from "liaison" to "inseparable closeness" is clearly a major leap forward.

So, how should the relationship between the Guidance Council and the Imperial General Headquarters be understood? The supreme command of troop deployments and operations is solely the responsibility of the Imperial General Headquarters, and no other organization is allowed to interfere. However, judging from the recent rapid development of the war situation, more fundamental requirements for operations and troop deployments will be proposed from the Supreme Command. On the one hand, in order to meet these requirements, the state must strive to nationalize combat power as much as possible. Here, the political and military strategies are aligned and coordinated in the Guidance Council, and combat power and other conditions are further reviewed to formulate the fundamental policy of war guidance. The so-called fundamental policy of war guidance can be interpreted as a broad strategic policy encompassing command and state affairs. Accordingly, although the relationship between the Guidance Council and the Imperial General Headquarters is not legally defined, the guidelines decided in the Guidance Council must be considered by the Supreme Command.

However, this relationship depends on the operation of the Guidance Council. Therefore, only a solid combination created by mutual trust and cooperation among the constituent members can be flawless. The timely, appropriate, and powerful deployment of war guidance is what the nation unanimously expects.

Close Coordination between the Army and Navy

The harmonious and close coordination between the army and navy is indispensable for war guidance. It has been two years and nine months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The greatest driving force for fighting against the enemy, the United States and Britain, who have not dominated the world for centuries in this unprecedented war in history, is the seamless cooperation between the army and navy. There is no need to emphasize this again.

Countless examples of the army and navy cooperating and responding to each other on the front lines and in various theaters of the Greater East Asia War. Especially in the Pacific theater, the operations of the army and navy are inextricably linked. However, the requirements for future operations are not limited to troop deployments and operations. The close coordination between the army and navy is also desired in state affairs, and great expectations are placed on the Reporting Council for this.

General administration, especially military production administration, remains complex and fragmented even after the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions due to the intervention of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Munitions. As a result, order adjustments and factory management cannot be said to be sufficient, which is an undeniable fact that hinders the expansion of military production.

This demand will continue to increase in the future. Moreover, due to the progress of the war, the transportation of military supplies to the south may become more difficult. In addition, the enemy's attempts to reduce our military production by air raids on the homeland, although only guerrilla-style, will increase in scale and frequency in the future. Even in this situation, it is imperative to maintain the rise of military production. Therefore, it is hoped that a prompt decision will be made to truly strengthen the close coordination between the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Munitions, especially between the Army and Navy authorities, which is the biggest key to increasing military production. In the previous cabinet meeting, Ministers Sugiyama and Yonai stated:

"The Army and Navy, in this fierce battle situation, are essentially fighting together to complete the war."

It can be seen that the Army and Navy authorities will cooperate more in various aspects in the future, which is what the nation expects.

In addition, in order to maximize the mobility of military supplies, the close integration of operations and production administration, and the rational use of military and civilian ships have recently been proposed. Other issues will be resolved after the adjustment of command and state affairs and the further coordination of the army and navy.

The current top leadership of the army and navy, after the recent reorganization, has returned from the one-headed system of Generals Tojo and Shimada in military command and military administration to the two-headed system of Army Minister Sugiyama, Chief of the General Staff Umezu, Navy Minister Yonai, and Chief of the Naval General Staff Oikawa. The harmony of these four respected generals is the driving force for powerfully promoting war guidance, and it is to them that the 100 million people place their complete trust.

### Ministry of Justice Issues Directive: Implement Stringent Discipline, Orders Each Level of Court to Admonish Subordinates Separately

The Ministry of Justice, in order to rectify legal discipline and enhance the dignity of judicial officials, issues a directive to all subordinate courts and prosecutors' offices, etc., to earnestly admonish each official, strengthen their spirit, and rectify discipline. The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, upon receiving this directive, shall immediately notify each prosecutor accordingly.

Minister Chen Discusses Improving Shanghai's Judicial Administration

Minister of Justice Chen Enpu, who recently came to Shanghai, returned to the capital yesterday and made the following remarks: Since the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai, the courts and prosecutors' offices have received a large number of cases. After arriving in Shanghai, I immediately summoned the heads of the high and local courts to instruct them on everything. It was decided to divide the criminal division of the local court and the investigation division of the local prosecutor's office into several units. The allocation of cases will be based on the police stations that transfer them, and the presiding judges will handle them at any time, slightly alleviating the suffering of the defendants in custody. Currently, the backlog of cases and the number of criminal defendants in detention have been greatly reduced. Furthermore, if the local court and the local prosecutor's office can merge in the future, the handling of cases will definitely be more rapid. The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office detention center holds over one thousand inmates, which has led to some criticism. After discussing it in person, I immediately ordered reforms. Inmates with unruly behavior are temporarily sent to the Shanghai Prison for confinement, and efforts are being made to improve the center. The center's expenses and the monthly rent for inmates' food and accommodation reach two million yuan, and we will provide as much funding as possible.

### Thoroughly Clean Up the City, Strictly Investigate and Suppress Smoking and Gambling, Hoping Citizens Will Cherish Themselves and Abstain

The municipal government is determined to thoroughly eliminate smoking, gambling, and drugs in order to refresh the cityscape of Shanghai. It has successively closed down gambling dens and opium dens in the southern part of the city. However, investigations have revealed that some illegal operators are still active, privately setting up opium dens to serve customers, which is illegal. The police bureau has specially established a smoking and drug investigation unit, which is actively engaged in investigation and suppression work. Opium dens will be wiped out, and private opium smokers will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, some gamblers have had the audacity to open inns or gather to gamble in secluded alleys and brothels, profiting from skimming the winnings, creating a disguised form of small gambling platforms. Strict investigation and suppression of social security and the cityscape will be carried out. Once discovered, both the owners and gamblers will be severely investigated. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will truly cherish themselves and abstain from smoking and gambling to avoid breaking the law.

Addiction Treatment Hospitals Welcome Those Who Want to Quit

Because the government is actively implementing a strict anti-smoking policy, addiction treatment hospitals have been widely established in various places. In the Shanghai area, the Ministry of Health has also established the Shanghai Addiction Treatment Hospital at 190 Chezhan Road in the southern part of the city. The hospital was officially established last month and accepts those who smoke opium and take highly addictive drugs for treatment. The hospital has spacious buildings, complete equipment, and specialized doctors. The wards are divided into first, second, and third class, with low fees. Currently, all those admitted are voluntarily seeking treatment. After quitting, the hospital issues a certificate. According to those who have been admitted for addiction treatment, the treatment is good, and the quitting method is new and painless. The first-class wards have one person per room, and the second and third-class wards have two people per room. The admission procedures are very simple. It is hoped that those who are addicted will quickly seek treatment so that they can escape the bitter sea as soon as possible.

### New Union Hosts Banquet for Chief of the Information Department, Kishi

Those who were invited included Chief of the Information Department Kishi, accompanied by Section Chief Liang, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and, from the New Union Association, Osaka Yoichi, Xu Liqiu, Jia Bao, Chen Bin (represented by Ren Yunpeng), Jin Xiongbo, Shao Zhizhi, Huang Jingqi, Lu Feng, Moriyama Takashi, Nichi Seikenma Tsuruko, Cheng Zhongquan, Ren Yunpeng, etc. First, Jin Xiongbo, the monthly chairman of the New Union Association, gave a welcome speech, saying: "We are very honored that Chief Kishi has taken the time to visit us today. The Chief has always been concerned about the press in our country, especially the press in Shanghai. Our association is very grateful for this. China and Japan are allied countries. Today, as the war enters its decisive stage, the mission of propaganda is becoming increasingly important. We hope that the Chief will continue to guide us on how the press should do its best to contribute to the East Asian War." Chief of the Information Department Kishi then gave a reply. The atmosphere was lively, and the banquet ended at 2:30 pm with everyone enjoying themselves.

### Rice Allocation for Teachers: Measures to be Announced Soon

Due to the recent abnormal price fluctuations, the livelihood of teachers and staff in schools in this city has become particularly difficult. The Municipal Commodity Allocation Office, acting on the instructions of the Mayor, is quickly preparing a special rice allocation for teachers and staff. Detailed measures will be officially announced within days.

### County Police Division Established: Personnel for Each Section Determined

In order to direct and supervise police affairs in the county area, the Shanghai Police Bureau has specially established a County Police Affairs Division, headed by Deputy Director Lu concurrently. In order to strengthen the organization of the division, three sections have been set up: General Affairs, Administration, and Judiciary. The personnel for the section chiefs have also been announced. The Chief of the General Affairs Section will be concurrently held by Shi Yitang, Deputy Section Chief of the General Affairs Section. Zhao Shizan, Chief of the Administrative Section of the Xieqiao Branch Bureau, has been transferred to be the Chief of the Administration Section. The vacant position will be filled by Liu Bingheng from the Yimiao Branch Bureau. The Chief of the Judiciary Section will be transferred to Jingyang, Chief of the Judiciary Section of the Hubai Branch Bureau. The vacant position will be filled by Peng Shilin. In addition, Deputy Chief Secretary of the Bureau Bu Jieru will concurrently serve as the Secretary of the County Police Affairs Division. Meng Xianqi, Song Da [unclear], Chu Pei, and Wang Zhilin will serve as supervisory commissioners of the division. The above-mentioned personnel have officially reported for duty.

### Sugar Industry Professional Association: Being Considered for Abolition

In order to strengthen material control, the National Government's Executive Yuan has already ordered the reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce and Trade Association, and the control organizations for major commodities such as rice, flour, oil, cotton, and daily necessities have all been reorganized separately and established as control committees, which have now been established. Regarding the original Sugar Industry Professional Association, it is heard that the Chamber of Commerce and Trade Association is currently studying and considering the matter with the relevant authorities. In the future, it may be abolished, and all matters related to the supply and demand of sugar will be incorporated into the daily necessities control organization for strict control and management.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration: Deadline at the End of the Month

The Bureau of Economy believes that, since the municipal administration has been unified, a citywide industrial and commercial census must be actively carried out. Since the implementation of the citywide industrial and commercial general registration, various industries have been actively applying for registration at the bureau in recent days. However, many industries are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not registered. In order to consider the difficulties of businesses, the bureau has repeatedly extended the registration deadline. However, in order to complete this task, the registration deadline will be at the end of this month and will not be extended again. Those who have not registered after the deadline this month will be punished according to regulations or have their businesses suspended. Those industries related to food and beverages must also apply for registration within January.

### Nationalities of Greater East Asia Have Awakened and Risen: Minister Matsudaira Gives Speech

A Giant Tide of Self-Awareness Among the Peoples of East Asia

The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held yesterday (4th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Minister of Information Matsudaira gave a speech, stating that the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia has universally risen from under Anglo-American oppression, and that the Anglo-American powers are feeling a significant threat as a result. The main points are recorded as follows: Minister Matsudaira first stated: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the peoples of East Asia have been stirred by a giant tide of self-awareness, and the Anglo-American powers are feeling the greatest threat. The Third Department Chief of the Japanese Government Information Bureau, Inoguchi, also recently gave a detailed speech on this matter and pointed out the article written by British writer Mills published in the June issue of the American Merchant Magazine. The content of the article stated that the Japanese army in Manchuria is the vanguard of the Asian people, and Americans should recognize this. He also stated that, not only should the newly rising independent nations of Burma and the Philippines be recognized, but also the new political organizations of Java and Malaya should be recognized. If the problem of European and American countries excluding the immigration of the peoples of Greater East Asia cannot be solved, the peace of the Pacific cannot be solved. Just like the Cairo Conference, which advocates maintaining peace by force, there is no other way. This war is a misstep for the Anglo-American powers themselves. If the Anglo-American powers do not have an ideal and good solution to the problem of the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia, they will undoubtedly fail in this war. At the same time, he also pointed out the content of an article written by the famous British commentator Condit, published in the Daily Bulletin on August 30, which criticized British and American parliamentarians for deeply recognizing the danger of the revolution in India. Condit explained that the problem of American blacks is more profound than the independence of India. In the future, if equal status and opportunities are not given to people of color, the Anglo-American powers will be doomed to failure in this war. The peoples of color have now awakened and are no longer willing to endure the oppression of the white race. The inferior views held by the white race have no basis, and they should actively recognize the self-awareness of the peoples of Greater East Asia.

Anglo-American Powers Feel a Significant Crisis

Minister Matsudaira continued by saying that the Anglo-American powers now feel this crisis and recognize that the Greater East Asia War is an Asian revolutionary movement. The impact has spread from Manchuria and the Republic of China in the north to Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines in the south, and then to Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo, Malaya, Annam, and other ethnic groups. Young people everywhere have awakened and risen up, willing to shed blood and sweat and sacrifice to complete their own development and independence. Therefore, this impact has spread throughout Greater East Asia, and the Indian independence movement has been launched. In addition to the activities of the Indian National Army led by Jiang Tela [unclear] This further stimulated the self-awareness of the national religious ethnic groups. Recently, the Pan-Arab talks were held with Egypt as the center, and were held in Alexandria, [unclear] The air of Arab ethnic unity is easily formed into an anti-British atmosphere. In July of this year, the British Minister to Syria was assassinated by Arabs, which can prove the awakening and self-awareness of the Arabs. Therefore, the self-awareness of the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia has universally affected the various ethnic groups under the repression of the Anglo-American powers and is gradually promoting the early awakening of the Anglo-American powers.

### Nanshi Districts Establish Air Raid Lookout Towers; Personnel Assigned to Watch for Air Raid Alerts

The Nanshi District Baojia Self-Defense General Headquarters, in light of enemy aircraft activity, in order to comprehensively improve air defense in the entire Nanshi area, has specifically issued orders to all subordinate detachments that they should each establish lookout towers. After an air raid alarm is issued, personnel should be immediately dispatched to the towers to watch for signals. If signals are detected being launched upwards, the location should be clearly identified and reported to the Allied Forces Gendarmerie for thorough investigation and punishment.

Reader's Support for Education News

### Upholding the Decree Forbidding Daoist Rituals and Fulfilling the Heavenly Duty of Saving Students from Dropping Out of School

Yesterday, the No. 1 Lianbao, Nos. 2 and 3 Bao Offices in the Taishan District raised over 60,000 yuan by saving money from traditional "Daoist rituals" and using it for "educational assistance." The significance is profound, and the good intentions are admirable. The wording of the original letter is also very pertinent, hoping that the practice of holding Daoist rituals throughout the city will cease from now on, and that public funds will be used for good deeds. This truly upholds the decree forbidding Daoist rituals and fulfills the heavenly duty of saving people. What could be better? The original letter stated: "Our Bao" residents used to hold Zhongyuan Daoist rituals. "Yulan" is a transliteration of a Sanskrit term, meaning "saving hungry ghosts who are upside down." But in these times, people are not as well off as "ghosts," and the upside-down situation is even worse than that of "ghosts." Therefore, we are saving the money from the Daoist rituals and using it for your newspaper's educational assistance fund. This can be considered upholding the decree forbidding Daoist rituals and fulfilling the heavenly duty of saving students from dropping out of school. Although the amount is small, it is intended as a token to encourage others.

Yesterday's Educational Assistance Received: Taishan District No. 1 Lianbao, Nos. 2 and 3 Bao Offices: 63,100 yuan (Heming Shoe and Hat Store: 20,000 yuan; Lao Zheng Xing Silver Store: 5,000 yuan; Shi Cheng Gong Ji Silver Store: 4,000 yuan; Zheng Da Educational Supplies, Zheng Da Chang Money Exchange, Zheng Xing Hao, Yi Feng Tai, Ying Yu Shoe and Hat Shop, Shanghai Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Allied Business Bank: 2,000 yuan each; Cai Hang Sheng, Long Tai Chang Zhao Chang Tobacco Shop, Guang Da Building Factory, Hua Cheng Leather Shoe Shop, Fu Xin, Wu Hua Silver Store: 1,000 yuan each; Wei Zheng Mao Pharmacy, Tao Zheng Ji, Sun Wang Sheng, Chun He Shi, Fu Tai Egg Shop, Gong Da, Ju Yu Guan, Hong Yu Cloth Shop, Zhou Wen Fu, Zhang Qi Gao, Gong Ping Shoe Shop: 500 yuan each; Zhang Fei Ran: 400 yuan; Cai Chang Shou: 300 yuan; Lu Wen Dong, Xu Guo Zheng, Wu Lao Zheng, Zhu Yi Sheng, Le Jia Sheng, Yuan Jing Xiang, Xu Yin Gui, Xia Zhi Li, Zhang Ruo Liang, Hu Song Ting, Wu Xiao Shi, Tang Yun Qing, Zhu He Sheng, Zheng Fa Xiang, Da You Sheng, Da Dong, Jiu He Xiang, Zheng Zheng Guan: 200 yuan each; Tang Rui Zheng, Gao Ru Chang, Sun Ling Zhen, Long Ju, Wang Zheng Yuan, Duan Dong Fang, Wang Shi Fu, Shi Yao Fang, Qing Mei Ju, Chen Er Pin, Yu Zhi Qing, Shun Xiang, Wang Jin Rong: 100 yuan each.

Shanghai Water Zheng Ye Tong Yi Tang (represented by Mr. Jiang Pu Chen): 6,000 yuan; Zheng Hong Yu (returned assistance money): 3,000 yuan; Li Ming Fu, Lu Zi Zhou, Ku Xin Zhe: 500 yuan each; Pu Yi Ying Nian Yuan; Total received: 73,620 yuan; Balance remaining: 16,228,230 yuan.

### China Film Company Charity Performance: "Eternal Love" to Benefit Education; Showing at the Grand Theatre on the 8th and 9th

China Film Company's newly produced film "Eternal Love" will be shown at the Grand Theatre starting on the 8th of this month. This film was personally designed and supervised by Mr. Zhang Shankun. The plot is lively, the structure is novel, and the performance is particularly lavish. The film can be completed in two hours, and it features 26 stars singing a total of 43 famous songs. It can be called a groundbreaking masterpiece in the film world. Movie fans who have not visited a film set can get a panoramic view of the real work under the mercury lights. Those who have not been to a dressing room can see the true faces of the stars and feast their eyes on beauty. The singing stars include the late Ruan Lingyu, as well as Hu Die and Chen Yunshang, who have left the film industry; the famous red stars Li Xianglan and Li Lihua; and the golden voices Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, and Li Qiuxia. The variety is dazzling, like thousands of reds and purples. The company authorities have generously designated the first two days, the 8th and 9th, as charity performances, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to this newspaper's educational assistance fund, the Xinwen Bao's loan scholarship fund, and the vagrant labor camp expenses. Ticket prices are: upstairs 3,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan; downstairs 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 300 yuan. Both newspapers' distribution offices can also sell tickets.

### Materials Investigation Committee Holds Closing Meeting

The Materials Investigation Committee has been ordered to dissolve by the Executive Yuan and has been instructed to prepare for closure. So far, the closure matters are mostly ready, but the question of which agency should take over the unfinished matters after the closure is still pending discussion and decision. The committee has specifically scheduled a closing meeting for 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 5th) to discuss everything, and we have learned that Mayor Chen and Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry will personally attend the meeting.

### Primary and Secondary School Principals Bid Farewell to Former Director of Education Bureau

The principals and staff of public primary and secondary schools in the first and eighth districts of this city held a tea party at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to bid farewell to the former Director of the Education Bureau, Lin Zheng An, and welcome the new Director, Zai Ying Fu. More than 300 principals and staff from various schools attended. During the event, the former Director Lin gave a speech, stating that the reason for his resignation was not that he was tired of education work, but that after five years in office, he had roughly established a framework for the reorganization of education in Shanghai. In the future, the important task of carrying it forward should be left to predecessors with more knowledge and experience, and Director Zai is the most suitable candidate. The new Director then gave a speech, stating that the strong Anglo-American character of the public primary and secondary schools in the first and eighth districts will be reduced under the unified municipal administration, and that they will follow the national curriculum and move forward in step. As for the teaching staff of various schools who have served for ten or twenty years or more, this spirit of dedication is particularly admirable.

### Health Bureau Forms Injection Inspection Team

The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is actively carrying out the second phase of epidemic prevention injections. Although the weather is gradually turning cooler, the cholera danger period has not yet passed. Therefore, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau has strictly warned the epidemic prevention personnel under his command not to slack off. Recently, the Epidemic Prevention Section, in addition to the original injection teams, has formed two mixed injection and inspection teams to inspect pedestrians on the main roads of various districts at any time. If anyone is found not carrying a certificate, they will be forcibly injected, and the police bureau will assign two police officers to accompany the team to assist in their work. It is reported that the number of injections in the second phase, as of now, is about one million. Among them, the Hongkou area, which is under the responsibility of the Navy Baojia Squad, has already had more than 500,000 injections. Waterborne epidemic prevention matters are the responsibility of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, and they are also actively promoting it. The authorities hope that the citizens of this city will promptly request injections to assist the government in completing the epidemic prevention work as soon as possible.

### Boiled Water Shops Illegally Raising Prices

Since the restriction of tap water supply in this city, the water flow has been small. Unexpectedly, a small number of boiled water shops are taking advantage of this opportunity to sell each ladle of boiled water for five yuan in order to make exorbitant profits. This is not uncommon in the Nanshi area. It is hoped that the authorities will stop this in order to reduce the daily water burden of the citizens.

### Trademark Bureau Recompiles Registration Instructions

The Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has recently actively adjusted trademark administration. In order to enable the industrial and commercial sectors to understand the registration instructions for trademark applications, a detailed description of the registration process is provided. Industrial and commercial enterprises wishing to apply for trademark registration can directly inquire at No. 30, Lane 83, Yuyuan Road.

### A Review and Outlook on Government Purchase of Yarn and Cloth

— Shi Huichen

The government has been purchasing yarn and cloth for exactly one year now. As an employee of a weaving factory, I will briefly discuss the main points of my personal experience below: The purchase order was announced on August 10th of last year, with a deadline of September 6th. The entire industry commented, "In order to punish hoarding, reduce speculation, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, we will overcome all difficulties and resolutely do this." Today, it goes without saying that it has not achieved the expected results. However, the industrial and commercial sectors understand the government's good intentions and have not complained at all. The people's cooperation with the government's policies and their loyalty and sincerity are evident here.

Looking back on the past year, those in the factories involved with yarn and cloth have been stagnant, hoping every day that a unified distribution system will be realized as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, not only is there no distribution in sight, but most of the first-phase payment has not yet been settled. This has caused industrial and commercial enterprises to suspend work and sit idly by for years. Especially for factories that use cotton yarn and cloth as raw materials, workers cannot be completely dismissed, and staff cannot be completely reduced. Continuing to operate without raw materials, and changing to other industries without funds, they are not understood by the government above, and blamed by employees below. In addition, the cost of living is increasing and the burden is getting heavier. They are wandering around all day, unable to do anything. The suffering in this situation is something that outsiders cannot know, let alone government relief.

Logically speaking, since the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city have suffered so much pain by cooperating with the government's policies, the government should provide assistance within the scope of not violating national policy. It can be said that there are four points:

1. Regardless of whether it has been inspected and accepted, the first phase of payment should be settled quickly (those that have not been inspected and accepted should, of course, speed up the inspection and acceptance. The blame for the delay is not with the merchants.) to show good faith.

2. The second phase of payment should be issued in advance to provide funds for management and operation.

3. Fixed-term deposit certificates should actually be allowed for full mortgage. (In the past, it seemed to be nominal rather than actual.)

4. The raw material distribution limit should be implemented within a specified period to ensure continued production.

If the above four items can be implemented quickly, then the losses and suffering suffered by the industrial and commercial enterprises in the past year will not be entirely meaningless. After all, the purpose of the control policy is to "increase production" and "rationally distribute," which are the unchanged principles. Without production, how can there be distribution? Therefore, our government has specifically designated this year as the year of production. It is especially important for the government and the people to work together towards this goal and strive to move forward in order to fulfill our responsibility as East Asians and complete the desire for final victory.

On Wednesday of this week, the Harmony team will play against the Friendship team in the A group final. This match was postponed from last week due to scheduling conflicts. Harmony suffered a crushing defeat against Huatong in their first match, so they must give their all against Friendship, or their championship hopes will be jeopardized. In addition to the B, C, and D group finals and the A group Friendship vs. Huatong match this weekend, an additional performance match will be added, with White Horse playing against Weilian. This will undoubtedly be another exciting event. The schedule is as follows:

Table Tennis Group Finals: Friendship and Jingwu Triumph
The All-China National Table Tennis Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Table Tennis Association, held its "Up," "Joint," and "Association" group finals yesterday (3rd) at 1:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Jingwu Athletic Association. Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, Fu Hanjun, Chen Jimao, Zhang Zhihong, and others served as referees, with Hu Jiankun and Li Shaoguang as recorders. In the match between the Postal Workers team and China Electric in the "Up" group, the former won 5-2, securing the top spot in that group. In the match between Jingwu and Yue Lian in the "Joint" group, the competition was fierce. Jingwu narrowly defeated Yue Lian 4-3, claiming the top spot in the "Joint" group. In the final match of the "Up" group between Friendship and Harmony, the former had abundant talent and boasted first-class players such as Jiang, and thus won easily 6-1. However, the fact that Jiang lost to the young Chen Huiliang was certainly unexpected and a dark horse. The above six teams, having secured the top two spots in their respective groups, will have a championship final to determine the national championship.

Naval  Iwata Takeo Written by, Hong Yang Translated

Cherished Wish (11)

In the singing class, there are many retired soldiers and people related to communications, but there is absolutely no one as young as Sanfu, who is only twenty-three years old, so everyone likes him. From the first day he took office, he cut his artist's disheveled hair short, making his face look particularly young, and his expression was somewhat flattered, truly like a little servant.

He enjoys working in this cheerful and bright atmosphere within the department. This cheerfulness and brightness is different from when he is with his artist companions. Even when busy, there are jokes, but there are no pranksters. It always feels like no one wants to show off their "hobbies" outwardly. Soon, Sanfu realized that this was the naval spirit, and he dared not be careless.

As Lieutenant Colonel Feitian said, his job is very simple. The leaflets with transmission-style drawings are stacked high in the narrow compartment. He thinks this is an easy task, and as for being casual and lazy, their conscience no longer allows him to do so. He has deeply absorbed the atmosphere of the department, and the awareness that he is a member of the reporting department has emerged in every cell of his body. The thought of penetrating the navy has unknowingly disappeared.

But once, unexpected good news reached his ears.

"Muta Koukun, you and photographer T-kun will participate in this small exercise!"

This was the order issued by Lieutenant Colonel Feitian.

Sanfu exclaimed, "Oh!" and was laughed at by the lieutenant colonel for a long time.

Although it is called a small exercise, it is by no means a small-scale exercise. It is different from basic exercises, and involves various warships participating in large-scale operations and combat actions.

Longfu and T staff member boarded the [blank] warship from a certain naval port. For the first time becoming a "shipman," he was as happy as ascending to heaven. However, on the vast and expansive ocean, when the exercise began, he was transferred from a battleship to a light cruiser, and then to a destroyer, so that he could observe the battle from all possible angles. He saw the trajectories of torpedoes, like shooting stars, converging on the battleship from all directions. Longfu watched carefully as the main guns of the main battleship flashed and emitted smoke of a certain color. This was an unexpected sight of light and color that could not be imagined in a movie. However, the majestic appearance of the I-class submarine surfacing suddenly stirred up a large wave in his heart. (138)

(12)

Not long after returning from that exercise, Longfu received a letter from Zhenren that he had been longing for.

(Where did it come from?)

Thinking of this, he looked at the back of the envelope, which had the door number of his hometown in Kagoshima written on it.

According to the content of the letter, Zhenren had spoken to Wu in Zhenshi and was going home to visit his relatives. The letter said that he was very happy to see his mother, brother Siji, and the teachers at No. 2 Middle School. He further wrote that he had heard that Longfu was serving in the reporting department, and he was very happy. He also said that he had been promoted to lieutenant, and that they should encourage each other and vow to sacrifice everything for the country and the nation.

However, he wrote in detail about bringing back hemp fabrics for the family, which made his mother very happy. He also said at the end that he would soon return to his post, but he failed to write where exactly he was being posted.

After reading this letter, Longfu immediately ran to the post office on the main road and sent a telegram to his father.

—Zhenren is in Kagoshima.

This short telegram contained a profound meaning. He himself was unable to discuss the marriage with Zhenren in a letter. Fortunately, Zhenren had gone home, and his father could meet Zhenren to negotiate directly. If the situation allowed, he could go to see him with his younger sister. In short, he should not miss the good opportunity. He believed that the short telegram hinted at these meanings.

Several days later, his father wrote back. It turned out that his father and sister had already met Zhenren before receiving Longfu's telegram. Zhenren, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant, appeared proudly and energetically at the door of Longfu's house an hour before he was scheduled to return to his post. He had only returned home to visit his relatives for one night. His father introduced Longfu to Zhenren, but because his own mother had declined, he more resolutely declined Longfu's father. However, his sister did not say a word, and only stared at each other at the door for a few minutes. Of course, his father was a little dissatisfied. This was all in the letter.

Longfu stepped on the carpet and felt very regretful.

(Wouldn't it have been better to say a word?)

Thus, he resented his younger sister for not being clever. Why had she, who did not treat men as men, become so traditional? Zhenren unknowingly felt that she had become a traditional girl from the Satsuma region. However, Longfu knew very well that the Sama girls who always obeyed and did not assert their own opinions had a burning desire in their hearts.

He certainly felt that what he had recently seen in the exercise was complete, and he had finally achieved his long-cherished wish to serve in the "Navy." The happiness of having his wish fulfilled was great. However, his younger sister's writing was not like this. When will his younger sister's long-cherished wish be fulfilled?

Community Service: Johnson Chemical Factory Establishes Work-Study Program

Since the launch of the reader scholarship program by this newspaper, countless out-of-school youths have been assisted. However, due to limited donations, only tuition assistance has been provided. In this era of soaring prices and difficult living conditions, it is even more difficult to study in peace. Therefore, a work-study program has been conceived to generate income for scholarship students without interfering with their studies, in order to supplement insufficient living expenses. After consultations with Johnson Chemical Factory, they expressed great sympathy and agreed to jointly organize a work-study program for scholarship students. The initial products for promotion will be [blank] water and ink powder produced by the factory. If the sales performance is excellent, other daily necessities produced by the factory's affiliated companies, such as soy sauce, coal balls, and leather shoe polish, will be gradually added. Students can make use of their spare time to promote the products to classmates, businesses, and households in the vicinity. The commission is tentatively set at 20% of the selling price to show consideration. The work is extremely convenient, does not interfere with studies, and provides valuable commercial sales experience. It is truly a win-win situation. The number of part-time salespersons for this program is tentatively set at 200, limited to middle school and university students receiving scholarships from this newspaper. Those who wish to participate in this program can come to this office to obtain an application form. Qualified applicants will be recommended to the Johnson Chemical Factory office to arrange for receiving goods. The offer is valid while supplies last. Please pay attention.

The Educational Character of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Public Schools

Ueno Taihei

(1) Introduction

The Shanghai Municipal Council has become a historical term. The Chinese schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council (Note 1) were renamed Shanghai Special Municipal City Schools on August 1st of last year. Time flies, and the reform of the school's name and structure has already been a whole year. However, most of the municipal schools that were formerly established by the Shanghai Municipal Council still use the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council schools on their signs and in people's speech. This may be because the former Chinese schools have decades of history and are deeply rooted and difficult to change the name suddenly; perhaps the former Chinese schools do have a special status that makes people happy to call them. We do not want to delve into this superficial problem of naming. However, according to the statements published by the educational administrative authorities in various newspapers from February 20th to 25th of this year, it can also be proved that the former Chinese schools have some special features. (Note 2) Regarding these special features, we do not want to praise them as advantages, nor do we want to denigrate them as disadvantages. It can only be said that they are different from the public or innovative. Originally, education cannot be carried out away from the times and social environment. So now there is no need to criticize the past from the perspective of the new era. What is described in this article is nothing more than a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the education of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese schools for decades, so that people who are enthusiastic about education can choose and correct them.

(2) Characteristics of the Starting Point

The former Shanghai Municipal Council has always adopted a passive attitude towards education. Its purpose was only to improve the people's knowledge, reduce criminal behavior, and maintain the safety and order of the concession. In 1911 and 1933, the Education Committee repeatedly stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council only had a moral responsibility for education, and did not regard education as an inherent responsibility like other administrative organs, and adopted a positive approach. For decades, although various Chinese committees have worked hard to hope that the authorities will change their course, they have not been able to get rid of the conservative old habits under the rule of the British. For example, after 1928, although the Shanghai Municipal Council seemed to want to change its educational policy and claimed to implement the so-called "Eight-Year Education Plan," it eventually gave up halfway and did not reach half of the standard. (Note 3) Although the Chinese Education Department was established in the midst of difficulties, it has not opened up much new territory despite its best efforts. Originally, more than 95% of the people in the concession were Chinese, so of course all or at least 95% of those receiving school education should be Chinese. Then the names of "Chinese" Education Department and "Chinese Children" School (Chinese Education Office) (S.M.C. School for Chinese Children) are not necessary at all. The reason for this is nothing more than that the concession authorities are dividing a cup of leftovers for the sake of Western schools. The starting point of the passive aesthetic influenced the educational policy of the Shanghai Municipal Council for decades. The administrative authorities are like this, and the schools under their control are of course not easy to be active in development. But it is precisely in this environment that if one can overcome all difficulties to seek construction, it is also a time when the festival is seen, and it is worthy of praise.

(3) Characteristics of Curriculum and Teaching

The curriculum of Chinese secondary schools - the curriculum of Chinese secondary schools does not follow the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, but takes preparing for admission to Hong Kong University or Cambridge University in the United Kingdom as the highest goal. However, primary schools can still be implemented in accordance with the curriculum standards. The general situation is briefly described as follows.

Comparison of Chinese and Western Courses
The curriculum of Chinese secondary schools is divided into two types: Chinese courses and Western courses. Chinese courses refer to Chinese studies, Chinese history and geography, and the rest are completely Western courses. Comparing the two, Chinese and Western are not opposed to each other. The former is only a subsidiary subject. Students obviously do not pay attention to Chinese due to environmental reasons. Here, let me cite a few simple examples to illustrate the general situation.

1. The salary of Western teachers is higher than that of Chinese teachers.
2. The Chinese teachers of the Beiqu Laohua Real Public School did not have offices, while the Western teachers all had comfortable writing desks. Because of this, when Chinese teachers came to school, they could only sit on the benches on both sides, which was quite similar to the current eagle head shop. This matter is still passed down as a joke, and it can also be seen that Chinese teachers are despised.
3. Students like to speak English. It seems out of fashion not to include two sentences of English in Chinese. Although it is difficult to accurately count the time spent preparing for homework, at least Chinese is regarded as a secondary matter.
4. In Huayi Middle School, there are many Chinese teachers with excellent foundations in Chinese studies who have to be inferior to others.
5. In many subjects that do not need to be taught in English, teachers often use English to teach. The commands in physical education and the books and explanations in science are mostly used in English, which shows its importance.
In this case, it is not easy to improve the Chinese level. If students' Chinese level is not self-taught at home, it can only be attributed to the foundation of their childhood. Only Mr. Huang Zhongsu, the vice principal of Nie Gongcheng Chinese Public School, had a unique vision and once drafted a plan to improve Chinese teaching and put it into practice. Although he focused on ancient prose such as Han Yuwen and Tongchengwen, his plan was indeed famous for a time. Unfortunately, due to environmental reasons, other schools could not earnestly follow it. But at least in Chinese secondary schools, a ray of dawn has been released for the future of Chinese studies. As for the primary school curriculum, although it is said to be in accordance with the curriculum standards, more guidance is added to the Chinese subject. After graduating from primary school, students should feel that their Chinese level has not reached the standard. And the connection between primary and secondary schools is even more difficult to connect. (To be continued)

Free Smoking Cessation: Fourth Session Completed

The temporary free smoking cessation center, co-founded by this office and the Nantong Road Middle School Righteousness Association, has completed its fourth session of smoking cessation. The participants were sent off on the 3rd of this month, and at the same time, a trial was held for the participants of the first, second, and third sessions. All participants attended on time. The results of the trial were quite good, and there were no cases of relapse, which shows their strong determination. On the same day, the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute held a banquet at the Chinese Teachers' Association, with Zhou Yuying, Director of the Welfare Department, Chen Dongbai, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Welfare Department, and Ding Fubao, Guan Suishuang, Li Suizhi, Deng Qingshan, Zheng Digong, Liu Zhigang, Liu Buqing, Lu Zhixue, Zhou Mengbai, Zhang Dounan and other medical and pharmaceutical elders, totaling more than 30 people, so they were able to participate in the grand event and encouraged the smoking cessation compatriots and expressed their sympathy for the establishment of the free smoking cessation center. During the banquet, Dr. Sun Zhujun, Zhao Boyi, and Sun Shanjun of the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute gave enthusiastic hospitality and explained in detail the efficacy and function of the institute's latest product, "Shengkang Duping" smoking cessation injection, until 4 o'clock, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.

It is heard that the institute is planning to adjust its smoking cessation methods due to rising prices and tight funds. The institute plans to restrict the enrollment of smoking cessation participants to those between the ages of 20 and 40 and will conduct smoking cessation twice a month. Smokers who wish to register should pay attention.
