### Travelogue

— Chun Zai

This time, I got a chance to travel. Starting from Guangzhou Bay, a village market in the corner of the South Sea, I took a plane, passing through Hainan Island, Guangdong, Taipei City, and Shanghai. On the day I arrived in Shanghai, the first friend I met was Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao. After the usual greetings, he asked me to write an article for Shen Bao. Because of our old friendship, I couldn't refuse, so I wrote this [Travelogue]. People in Shanghai may not know what kind of place Guangzhou Bay is, because Guangzhou Bay is too small compared to Shanghai. It only accommodates more than 60,000 people, roughly speaking, it is only one-ninetieth of Shanghai. That's why I call it a village market. People in village markets everywhere easily know about Shanghai, but people in Shanghai don't easily know about village markets everywhere. This is a natural phenomenon. First of all, I want to tell Shanghai people about one thing in Guangzhou Bay, that is, the price of rice in Guangzhou Bay has remained between 2,000 and 2,600 yuan per stone for the past two years, without a sharp rise. What's the reason? The rice produced in the Leizhou Peninsula can be freely transported into Guangzhou Bay City. The Chinese and Japanese authorities there adopt a welcoming and facilitating attitude towards rice entering the market. Secondly, important merchants in Guangzhou Bay, such as Chen Xuetan and Lai Ze, do not want to make money from the rice business. They are in a position to purchase and sell flat-priced rice in large quantities on behalf of the citizens. Therefore, the citizens of Guangzhou Bay always eat rice at a not very high price. I passed through Hainan Island in a hurry, and there is nothing to say. I stayed in Guangzhou for two weeks. What I saw was that the spirit of the Guangdong people was not decadent because of the war. They were still working hard and running around, each seeking their own way out. I admire the people of Guangdong. They have a spirit of perseverance and unyielding. They seem to be much stronger and braver than the French in Guangzhou Bay, while the French in Guangzhou Bay all show a kind of wandering and dispirited, lost attitude on their faces. The plane stopped in Taipei City for one night. A friend and I stayed at the Shinkao Hotel. This hotel is first-class in Taipei City. Two people, one night, three meals, with one extra dish for each meal. When I looked at the bill before leaving, I was very surprised. I calculated in my mind that one night and three meals for two people must cost 2,000 to 3,000 savings certificates, which is equivalent to 400 to 500 yuan in current gold, but the bill said 26 yuan. At first, I thought the accountant had missed a zero. After asking again, I realized that there was no mistake, it was exactly 26 yuan. My Chinese compatriots? This is not a small matter. It proves that the strength of the Japanese government is a hundred times greater than that of China, because the power of the banknotes issued by the Chinese government in people's lives is only one percent of theirs. Taking one percent of other people's power to talk about equal cooperation, I am worried for the government. What is gratifying is that the spirit of the Chinese people's hard struggle is definitely not inferior to the Japanese people's spirit of risking their lives for the country. The difference is that the Chinese people lack faith and their spirit cannot be concentrated and developed for the country, while the Japanese people concentrate all their spirit under one belief, and are willing to die for their motherland. From this point of view, China needs political reform and the integration of national spirit. It must go through these two surgeries to achieve the goal of [national construction must be successful]. In the current situation, I want to ask: Our compatriots in Shanghai, do you have the courage to reform politics and the determination to [integrate spirit]? Among the various publications that Mr. Chen gave me, Mr. Yoshida Toyu's article attracted my personal attention the most. He is a Japanese scholar, but he has learned the ability to speak for China. Some Chinese people suspect that he is lying. I don't know Mr. Yoshida. It wasn't until Mr. Chen invited me to dinner that he introduced me at the table. I am not qualified to guarantee whether he is a liar, and I only admire him. I don't completely agree with what he said. To be honest, I think his research on Chinese affairs has only reached the stage of entering the hall, not yet entering the room. A China expert cannot be made in eight or ten years. I have one thing that I can testify to the Chinese compatriots on behalf of Mr. Yoshida, that is, the lying skills of ordinary Japanese people are generally below the level of ordinary Chinese people. For example, there are thieves in China, and there are also robbers in Japan, but nine out of ten Chinese thieves refuse to confess when they are caught by officials; Japanese robbers are only worried that you can't catch them. If they are caught, nine out of ten will honestly confess when asked. This is one proof that Japanese people's lying skills are quite low. Secondly, some Chinese people commit suicide, and some Japanese people also commit suicide. Chinese people commit suicide by hanging, swallowing opium, and drowning; Japanese people commit suicide by disembowelment, jumping into volcanoes, or sleeping on the railway and being crushed to death by trains. Studying the different methods of suicide between the two countries, the psychology of the people in the two countries is different. Chinese people still have some meaning of lying in death, implicitly. Because hanging can still be untied and rescued. Swallowing opium can still be lavaged and intestines washed. Drowning can still be thrown into the net of a fisherman and rescued. As for the Japanese, once they die, they are dead, because the belly is cut open and cannot be sewn up again. Jumping into a volcano turns into ashes. Under the train, there is no complete body. Their suicide is a genuine and honest suicide, while the Chinese contain the hope of [Lishan Old Mother][saving people from danger]. Even at the moment of death, there is still a 70% or 80% plan. Therefore, I use the lying skills of ordinary Japanese people to measure Mr. Yoshida. I believe that eight or nine out of ten of the words he published are from his heart, and not deliberately showing off to us. As for whether what he said is correct or not, it is up to the readers to decide freely. My travelogue will also come to an end here for the time being.

### 160 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over Taiwan

Nine enemy aircraft carriers, destroyers, etc. sunk. Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 14th: (1) On the 14th, a total of about 450 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Taiwan twice. In the afternoon, about 100 B-29 aircraft flew from China, but they retreated without dropping any bombs. (2) Since October 12, about 160 enemy aircraft have been shot down over Taiwan, as far as is known at present. The Japanese side has suffered some losses of aircraft, ships, and ground facilities. Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 14th: The Japanese Air Force has recently continued to attack the enemy mobile unit on the eastern sea of Taiwan. The battle results confirmed so far (including those announced this morning) are as follows: Three aircraft carriers sunk, three ships of unknown type sunk, one destroyer sunk, one aircraft carrier bombed and destroyed, and one ship of unknown type bombed and destroyed. Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Central Pacific dispatch, the enemy's attack focus on Peleliu Island since the morning of the 12th has shifted to the Mount Mizuho area in the central highlands. A large number of enemy troops entered a part of Mount Mizuho under the attack of flamethrowers, but the Japanese garrison forces launched a fierce night attack that night and completely repelled them. On the other hand of Peleliu Island, the enemy seems to be reorganizing and repairing damages. According to reports, the flamethrowers used by the enemy in this battle have hardly played their effect due to the Japanese side's special defensive devices. Bali Papan, 14th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the air raids by the U.S. Air Force on Bali Papan have become more and more frequent. After intercepting by the local Japanese army, from September 30 to October 10, a total of 40 B-24 aircraft and 7 P-38 aircraft were shot down, and 44 B-24 aircraft and 5 P-38 aircraft were destroyed, totaling 96 aircraft.

### Acting Chairman Chen Broadcasts

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The 14th is the anniversary of the independence of the Philippines. Acting Chairman Chen made an exchange broadcast that evening. The original text is as follows: [Today is the anniversary of the independence of the Philippines. On behalf of the 450 million people of the Republic of China, I would like to pay my unlimited respects to your country. Although the Republic of China has fortunately not been colonized by Britain and the United States among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, it is not far from the situation of being a colony. Therefore, the pain of your country in the past is the pain of China, and the glory of your country's independence and liberation today is also the glory of our country. Our country and your country can be said to share weal and woe. Therefore, today the Republic of China extends its greatest respect to your country. On this most celebrated day, our two countries should not forget that although the liberation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia has been realized, it has not yet been completed. First, because the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, in order to complete this immortal and great cause of Greater East Asia, all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia should unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression. Not only should the land of Greater East Asia not be reduced to colonies of Britain and the United States and the people of Greater East Asia become people exploited by Britain and the United States, but also we should ensure that there will never be such unjust and inhumane things in Greater East Asia forever. Second, we should remember that there is still an India among the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, which is still used as a battleground by Britain and the United States, and is used as a rear area for re-aggression against Greater East Asia. We should help them achieve freedom and liberation with one heart and one mind, so that all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia can be completely liberated and completely independent. We already know that your country is suffering in order to seek thorough liberation, and it is at the most important juncture. We express our deep sympathy and concern for your country, and we are preparing great assistance, hoping that the people of your country will intensify their efforts to complete the great cause of the genuine liberation of the Philippines. Your country must be joyful and happy today on the anniversary of independence. At the same time, the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia are also joyful and happy for your country, and are preparing to support your country's complete independence with all their strength. I wish your country freedom forever and independence forever].

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the anniversary of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines, President Laurel exchanged broadcasts with Japanese Prime Minister Koiso. The main points are as follows: Today is the anniversary of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines. On behalf of all the Filipino people, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for all the congratulatory remarks given by Your Excellency. Today's world is actively building a new order. The independence of the Philippines has been one year old, and I have infinite feelings. At the beginning of the founding of the country, although we have suffered hardships, on the contrary, we have been able to overcome these hardships and, at the same time, better savor and cultivate our destiny. This difficulty is an excellent test for us. All the hardships we have suffered will become the foundation for consolidating our resistance, strengthening our unity, and achieving success in the future. Grasping this unwavering belief, I believe that our hopes will be gradually realized. This anniversary is also a good opportunity to re-recognize our national beliefs. In other words, we have discovered that we are at the time when we can fulfill our mission under the grand and upright position of the new world order. We are determined to fully cooperate and understand our Japan, and at the same time, we firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War, which aims to promote the rights of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, will be victorious. I believe that the Japanese people's determination to move towards final victory will be able to connect the total power of 1 billion people in Asia. Here, I would like to express my deep respect to the Japanese people.

### Reasons for Past Changes and Suggestions for Future Countermeasures

The recent Shanghai market price problem has become increasingly serious, and all parties are extremely concerned. Citizens are eagerly awaiting the authorities to respond. Mr. Xu Tianshen, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, in addition to answering the questions raised by reporters on the matter at yesterday's 13th press conference, made a comprehensive report on the city's entire price problem and expressed his opinions. First, he explained the importance of wartime price policy and the price changes over the past year. Next, he pointed out the crux of the price problem and the process of establishing the Price Review Committee. Next, he listed the types of official prices and agreed prices. Finally, he proposed countermeasures for managing prices in the future and several suggestions to the central government. The report lasted for one hour and the content was very important, sufficient to serve as an indicator for handling price problems in the future. The full text of his report is recorded below: Today's press conference in this city, I am invited to attend the report on the price issue in this city. The mayor is most concerned and attaches great importance to this issue. I believe that you and all citizens are also most concerned and attach great importance to this issue.

### The Most Serious Moment

The price problem in this city has now reached the most serious juncture, but the problem is complicated and involves many aspects. It cannot be explained clearly in a few words. However, the success or failure of the price policy can determine the success or failure of the entire controlled economy. It is not only closely related to the future of the Great East Asia War, but also the key to social stability lies here. To ensure the victory of the Great East Asia War, it is necessary to stabilize the prices in the rear. This is something that everyone already knows, so I don’t need to elaborate on it. Speaking of it, wartime price increases are a natural trend. According to general observations and the summaries of economic experts in the past, the reasons for wartime price increases are nothing more than: (1) shortage of material production and reduced sources; (2) decline in the purchasing power of money; (3) concentration of population and imbalance between supply and demand; (4) inconvenient transportation; (5) merchants taking the opportunity to manipulate, hoard, and speculate; (6) anxiety in the market, buying and storing materials, and spitting out loans, etc. But I believe that there are other special reasons for the continuous surge in prices in this city that cannot be ignored.

### Three Major Trends

Let me talk about the course of price changes over the past year. Since taking office, under the wise leadership of the mayor, I have been concerned about the price problem day and night, and have been constantly working hard to stabilize the work, but all efforts have been ineffective. Among them, there were three major trends. The first trend occurred from December of last year to January of this year, because the coal panic triggered a general surge in prices. The second trend was in May and June of this year, because the price of rice suddenly soared from 4,000 or 5,000 yuan to over 9,000 or 10,000 yuan, which then promoted a general surge in prices. The third one has been since last month and has not yet stopped. In this trend, the black market price of gold soared, restricting the use of electricity, stimulating the panic of manufacturers; furthermore, the Mi Tonghui's repeated changes in the method of prohibiting the free entry of rice have caused the price of rice to rise to more than 14,000 yuan, and the black market price of coal has risen to more than 100,000 yuan. Such a surge is really chilling to think about. Just imagine, how can ordinary citizens and the working class live? If this continues, the future is truly unimaginable.

### The Failure of Effort

Why is it that our efforts have been uniquely ineffective against these three waves of price surges? The ideal is very simple: because the price problem is a comprehensive problem. It is not a problem of one industry or one item, nor is it a problem of one place or one city. It is necessary to gather the central and local governments, the Allied powers, government and public, all trades and professions in our country, to work together, strive in unison, and make overall plans before there is a possibility of thorough resolution. If partial control is implemented, at most it can only achieve the point of treating a headache when the head hurts and treating a foot when the foot hurts. Because the root of the disease cannot be eradicated, only temporary relief is achieved, and thus the disease becomes cyclical. When suppression begins, prices temporarily stop rising. After some time, the old disease recurs, and the rising tide begins again, with even greater force.

Not only that, prices are comprehensive, whole, and interconnected. If rice prices cannot be stabilized, then the prices of all commodities cannot be stabilized. But rice prices are not easy to stabilize alone; other prices must be stable before they can be stabilized. If coal prices cannot be stabilized, then the prices of all commodities cannot be stabilized, and coal prices cannot be stabilized alone; other prices must be stable before they can be stabilized. This can be applied to the prices of all commodities. Therefore, we advocate managing prices. The prices of all commodities, whether controlled or uncontrolled, must be managed simultaneously. To assess prices, one should take into account the general price level. Then, the power of price management and the power of price assessment should be centralized and unified; at least, it should not be the case that multiple industries and businesses manage themselves, assess themselves, and act independently. However, the current control system seems to adopt separate controls for one industry or even one item. Although they can be connected to each other, the dispersion of management power ultimately violates the unity of prices. Therefore, everyone strives to stabilize the prices of goods, but the result is that no one can do anything. We all know that to stabilize prices, we must first stabilize necessities. However, the prices of the most important necessities, such as rice, flour, coarse grains, kerosene, salt, sugar, matches, candles, bread, milk, meat, eggs, tobacco, vegetables, and local fruits and goods, are not within the reach of our Economic Bureau's Price Assessment Committee. Therefore, at a liaison meeting between the Municipal Government and Japanese journalists, I reported on the price problem and raised this situation. At that time, they were all shocked and sighed. But the fact remains the same to this day.

### A Comprehensive Problem

According to general principles, prices should increase production, but in Shanghai, prices have risen sharply, and production has declined. What is the reason for this? It is because prices continue to rise, and people's faith in money has been shaken. Everyone is hoarding raw materials and supplies and is unwilling to engage in production. Therefore, the higher the prices, the more production decreases. So, I lament that everyone in Shanghai is now expecting low prices, but on the other hand, intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, they are all creating high prices or fueling the rise in prices.

Speaking of this, I really don't want to say more, and I can't say more. In short, the city's price problem is a link in the comprehensive price problem, and it must be planned comprehensively. Partial treatment cannot be effective. Of course, I will never shirk this partial responsibility. Therefore, let me just talk about the partial price problem of the physical objects managed by our local Shanghai economic organization. (Continued on page 2)

### Deeply Hope China Will Cooperate in Material Resources to Jointly Complete the War

Japanese Vice Minister Takeuchi Elaborates on Impressions of Visiting China. Allied Japan's Vice Minister Takeuchi of the Greater East Asia Ministry, who came to China for sightseeing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (14th) from Beijing. He met with Chinese journalists in the city at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, 9th floor. Vice Minister Takeuchi was accompanied by Information Minister Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office and arrived on time. The journalists presented five questions, and the Vice Minister answered them in detail. The details are as follows:

### Material Assistance

1. The Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce. What are Japan's hopes for China? (Answer) The Greater East Asia War has become increasingly fierce, and Japan's wartime system has become increasingly solid. The Japanese government's policies are completely aimed at adapting to the current war situation. Therefore, the policies implemented are strengthened. In other words, Japan's economic policies focus on industrial expansion and labor mobilization. Therefore, the preparatory work for the introduction of the system has been launched and implemented, and the national will to fight is even more high-spirited. My hope for China is as follows: At this time when China and Japan are jointly completing the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army is conducting wars in the vast areas of mainland China and the southern Pacific. In order to carry out this operation, a lot of resources are needed. The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for East Asia, and the nations of East Asia should actively concentrate all their efforts to strive for this war. As for China, the Japanese army is fighting bravely on the front lines, and the materials needed are deeply hoped that China will share this responsibility. Not only China will bear this responsibility, but also the Allied countries in Southeast Asia should also share this responsibility. China is a member of the Greater East Asia. Coal and iron in North China, food in Central China, and other materials are hoped to cooperate.

### Impressions of Visiting China

2. What is the mission and impression of your visit to China? (Answer) I have no special mission for this visit to China. After attending the ceremony in Manchuria, I came to China for sightseeing, from Beiping, Nanjing to Shanghai, to inspect the various wartime situations in various places. The impressions gained in North China are as follows: I have seen the situation in various places and cooperated enthusiastically, which is a very good phenomenon and very happy. At the same time, I learned that the harvest of Chinese-produced patterned wheat is smooth, and the rice harvest is also good. The grain is the basic problem of stabilizing people's livelihood. I am very happy to learn about the good phenomenon of Chinese grain. The same is true in Central China, which is very optimistic. At the same time, I have passed through the cities of North China and Central China, and I have expressed my feelings a lot. The cleanliness and vitality of the streets are a manifestation of China's economic prosperity. I am very happy from the bottom of my heart.

### Price Countermeasures

3. What are your impressions of the three major cities of Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai during this trip? (Answer) The most common and serious problem that I have seen in the major cities during this trip to China is the rising price problem. However, the government has taken appropriate measures. The price countermeasure is the countermeasure to the inflation of currency. The national government is working hard for this, and Japan is also making the greatest effort to help in terms of this currency and materials. Not only now, but also in the future. The people of all countries feel the pain of the price problem. Therefore, to solve the price countermeasure, the government authorities should try their best to solve it, and the people should also stand up to cooperate, and the military, government, and people should work together to solve the rising prices.

### Liberate East Asia

4. What is the economic construction plan for Greater East Asia during the decisive period of the Greater East Asia? Please show me one or two. (Answer) Regarding the construction plan of Greater East Asia, the declaration in the Greater East Asia Conference in November last year was adopted based on construction. This is the construction of Greater East Asia. According to the alliance treaty signed between China and Japan last year, and Japan's new policy toward China, it is determined based on the moral spirit of the Greater East Asia declaration. All future construction of Greater East Asia will also be completed based on this declaration. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, there has been the independence of the Philippines, followed by the successive completion of the independence of Burma and East India. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is the liberation of one billion people in East Asia. The completion of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the liberation of East Asia. Therefore, all nations in East Asia should overcome all difficulties, assume all responsibilities of each country, and strive to complete the final victory in order to liberate East Asia. This is the first step in the construction of Greater East Asia.

### Philippine Independence

5. What are your thoughts on the anniversary of the independence of the Allied Philippines? (Answer) The Philippines was born independently in October last year. Our Japanese government will spare no effort to give the greatest assistance to complete the independent system of the Philippines. After the Philippines completed its independence, President Laurel also made great efforts to establish the wartime system in the country. Now the national system of the Philippines is becoming more and more complete, which is very different from a year ago. Recently, the Philippines declared war on Britain and the United States and joined the East Asian joint front. We express our respect for the determination of the Philippines. Since the independence of the Philippines, the Japanese government has provided great assistance in the economic, cultural, and political aspects to complete the domestic system of the Philippines. The most obvious is that recently the Japanese domestic bank and the Philippine government ordered a loan of 200 million yuan to establish the entire financial system in the Philippines.

### The Industry and Commerce Association Held the Fifth Members' Congress

The New Third Board of Directors Took Office Yesterday. The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Association, on the occasion of the second anniversary, coincided with the fifth members' congress, which was held yesterday (14th) at 2:00 PM in the clubhouse on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building on the Bund. Chinese and Japanese members attended enthusiastically and were in high spirits. The details are as follows:

### Meeting Situation

Chinese and Japanese members attended the meeting, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaowei, Wu Yunqi, Gu Nanqun, Chen Riping, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Chu Zhongsheng, and other Chinese members, and Allied Japanese members Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Aoki Takashi, Kurimoto Toraji, Tsutsumi Takashi, Ichihashi Hikoji, and dozens of others. Former Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro delivered the opening speech. Then, Chen Binhe made a report on the association's affairs. Then, the new board of directors was announced and took office on the spot. After the new chairman delivered a speech, Chen Ziyi, Luo Naji, and Masuzawa Renpei were welcomed to join the association. At the end, tea and snacks were enjoyed, which was full of enthusiasm. The list of the third board of directors of the association is as follows: 1. On the Chinese side, Chairman Wen Lanting, Standing Directors Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunqi, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Director Wang Boyuan, Jiang Shangda, Wu Zhenxiu, Chen Ziyi, Chen Shaowei, Chen Binhe, Xu Xiaochu, Ye Fuxiao, Dong Daoning, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Lvdeng, Guo Shun, Luo Naji. 2. On the Japanese side, Vice Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Standing Directors Aoki Takashi, Kurimoto Toraji, Director Kawamura Nijiro, Ikoma Minoru, Kawaguchi Kenichi, Kojima Eizo, Ueba Tetsuzo, Ichihashi Hikoji, Nishikawa Akitsugu, Tsutsumi Takashi, Murakawa Yoshimi, Fukuda Tatsuma, Haga Kinroku, and Nagafuji Sanro, Tachikawa Dansan.

### Chairman's Speech

Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro delivered the opening speech, saying: [The enemy, Britain and the United States, have begun to desperately try to attack Japan, and China joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9 last year. At the same time, the Philippines in Southeast Asia also declared war on the enemy on the 30th of last month. In addition, Myanmar and India have successively become independent and joined the war. However, the ambition of the United States and the United States for East Asia has not been eliminated, and it has always invaded as its colony. If the countries of East Asia are invaded by the enemy, they will be reduced to colonies forever in the future. Now, the only way to strive for the final victory is how we should deal with the aggression of the enemy, Britain and the United States, only by working together with one heart and helping each other in the same boat. Therefore, the position of this association is also based on this point of departure. I hope that all of you present here should overcome difficulties, overcome all difficulties, and do your best to achieve the goal. In the past, this association cooperated with the authorities on the problems of fuel and food for the people of Shanghai. This summer, it held several symposiums to contribute the results of the discussion to the cooperation between China and Japan and to promote it. I express my gratitude and hope that you will continue to move forward with the established goals and contribute to China and Japan with the power of one member, then the future benefits will be extraordinary.]

### Wen Lanting's Speech

The new chairman of the current session, Wen Lanting, said: [Today, this association is holding a second anniversary celebration and the fifth members' congress at the same time. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of this association two years ago, it was named the Industry and Commerce Association, originally hoping that people from the Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce circles would communicate their feelings and be the forerunner of civil cooperation. For the past two years, the Chinese and Japanese members of this association have been moving forward as much as possible towards this goal. However, in fact, China and Japan are now allies who share the same joys and sorrows, which has exceeded the scope of friendship. Therefore, we should go further in the future and practice the work of the alliance. Now, the two countries of China are allied in combat. How should we cooperate and contribute the greatest strength together? Of course, our industry and commerce circles should work hard in the wartime economy, such as increasing production, suppressing prices, assisting in the controlled economy, and developing the national economy. These problems all require the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce circles. However, no matter what wartime economic problem is achieved, the most important thing is to take into account the national conditions, the people's sentiments, and the local environment, so that it can be twice the result with half the effort. Finally, I dare to say without boasting: The rational solution to Shanghai's economic problems depends on our joint efforts very eagerly. At the same time, it can be said: Whether our efforts are appropriate or not will not only have a great impact on the Shanghai region, but also have a very important position in the national livelihood and even in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, I hope that all members, especially members of the Allied countries, will pay special attention to the importance of China's national conditions and people's sentiments, as well as the importance of the local environment, and work together to deal with and solve the wartime economic problems.]

### The Special Tax Sales Should Develop Invoices

Director Chen Published a Speech. Director Chen of the Special Tax Office of the city spoke to reporters yesterday, saying: [The special consumption tax was originally an important source of tax revenue for the country and local governments under the wartime system. Although the scope of collection is very wide, the burden on the people is very fair. As long as all stores can abide by the law and report and pay the taxes collected on their behalf truthfully, the treasury revenue will naturally increase day by day, and the funds for municipal construction will not have to worry about being insufficient. However, it is a pity that incidents of stores taking advantage of the situation to conceal and erode tax funds are often discovered. Since I took office, I have tried to rectify the situation and ensure that there are no malpractices, so as to live up to the expectations of my superiors. It has now been decided that all retailers, regardless of the size of the transaction, should use invoices as proof. Stores that do not have invoices should print invoices immediately for use in order to facilitate the investigation by this office. As for the citizens who purchase goods, they must ask the store for invoices. If there are personnel from this office inquiring, they should immediately present the invoices for verification as proof. If a store refuses to give an invoice, it means that it intends to embezzle tax funds. The public who purchased the goods should immediately report to the investigation section of this office (Room 258, 3rd Floor, Municipal Government, Telephone No. 12810, extension 36) for factual reporting. Once verified, the store will be severely punished, and a portion of the supplementary tax and fines will be given to the reporter as a bonus to show encouragement. I hope that all stores will take care of their business ethics and never erode tax funds, so as not to interfere with the penalty office. I also hope that all citizens will cooperate with this office as much as possible at any time to maintain national taxes.]

### Household Rice Continues to be Supplied

The Central News Agency reporter learned from the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office that the supply of household rice in the city will continue. It has now been decided to start the procedures for selling out at the food retailers from the 16th, and the city will be able to universally sell it around the 20th. And the total amount of rice reserves is about 200,000 bags due to the cooperation of various parties, so all kinds of rumors are self-defeating, and citizens do not need to worry needlessly.

### Development Meeting for Local Autonomy Association

The Shanghai Special City Local Autonomy Association was initiated by enthusiastic people in the city. Yesterday (14th) at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a development meeting. More than 20 people, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, and Ding Fubao, attended. Chen Zhongfu was elected as the temporary chairman to announce the purpose of the meeting. Then, Wu Xiaohou reported on the development process, saying that this city is the economic and cultural center and the source of political strategies in the country. In view of the needs of the environment and in line with the expectations of the citizens, the association was initiated to assist in the progress of local autonomy and to promote civil opinion institutions to assist in the implementation of constitutional government. Then, 44 articles of the articles of association were discussed, and Chen Zhongfu, Wu Chengyu, Wu Xiaohou, Chen Dongbai, Shen Tianxin, Shen Simin, Feng Yunchu, and other seven people were elected as standing preparatory committee members.

### Brief News

### Wu Zhongxing's Charity Photography Exhibition is in its Last Two Days Today and Tomorrow

The [Wu Zhongxing Charity Photography Exhibition] organized by this newspaper was the fifth day yesterday. It happened to be Saturday, and even more people came to visit. Wu is an internationally renowned photographer, and his masterpieces are not easily published. This is the first time to hold a solo exhibition in China, and all the products are the crystallization of the past 20 years, so the guests are very crowded. Today and tomorrow are the last two days of the charity exhibition, and there will be no more exhibitions. I hope that comrades from all walks of life who are interested in photographic art will take the time to appreciate it and not miss the opportunity.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Amusement Tickets Funds Transferred for Assistance

The Xin Xin First Building, affiliated to the Xin Xin Company, previously co-organized a transfer with this newspaper and the News to replenish the two newspapers' scholarship funds. Yesterday, the company sent a letter saying: [Dear Sir, Xin Xin First Building, affiliated to our company, co-organized the Mid-Autumn Festival Amusement Party with your newspaper and the News on the 1st of the month. It was previously decided that all the income from the business on that day would be transferred as half of your newspaper's scholarship fund and half as the News's loan fund. Today, the statistics show that a total of 497 seat tickets were sold, earning 497,000 yuan. After deducting 11,500 yuan for round-trip transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the actual amount is 485,500 yuan. Now, half of the 242,750 yuan is sent with the letter. Please check and accept it.]

Held at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM. There will be a total of 11 football league matches today.

Only Huatong will play for the Chinese team, facing Shanghai Police. The match will be held at Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM, judged by Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Tickets are 100 and 200 yuan. Under the leadership of Jiang Yimen, Huatong won the Group A championship with Lianyi in the first small ball league this year. Its strength can be seen. However, Shanghai Police is the police team from last season. In addition to Ke Laituo playing for the Portuguese merchants, the original team has plenty of fighting power. Huatong must be careful to deal with this strong enemy. The other two Group A matches will be held at Jiaozhou Park in the afternoon. The four-way foreign generals will have a showdown. Qiuwendu will face Portuguese merchants, followed by German merchants facing Jilin.

News sent at 7:10 PM, transferred from the first page

### Price Evaluation Committee

Before I took office, there was already a price evaluation committee established within the Economic Bureau, but because the concession had not yet been recovered, the scope of evaluation was limited to the urban area, so the organization was simple, and due to the environment, it was difficult to promote it in fact. After I took office, I was ordered by the mayor to reorganize the price evaluation committee. I deeply know that the responsibility is arduous, and strengthening the organization is not enough to complete this mission. I planned a plan and asked the mayor to serve as the chairman of the committee, and I planned to serve as the secretary-general. Later, because the mayor was busy with official duties and could not take care of it, he handed it over to me to be the chairman. The members are all concurrently held by the heads of the relevant agencies. Finally, with the intention of strengthening the organization, additional members were hired, so the current members are the heads of the following relevant agencies: 1. Municipal Government, 2. Ministry of Industry, 3. Economic Bureau, 4. Police Bureau, 5. Health Bureau, 6. Distribution Office, 7. Business Coordination Committee, and its affiliated associations: 1. Rice Coordination Committee, 2. Cotton Coordination Committee, 3. Daily Necessities Control Committee, 4. Flour and Wheat Control Committee, 5. Oil and Grain Control Committee, 8. Central Reserve Bank, 9. Media. In the past, the price management of this city followed the methods of the original Old Public Bureau's Material Control Bureau and the old No. 1 District Economic Office. Later, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Industry, it was divided into two types: official prices and agreed prices. Official prices refer to the prices of the most important commodities, which have already been evaluated and announced two months ago. Agreed prices refer to the prices of secondary commodities, which are agreed upon by the guilds themselves and submitted to this bureau for record. The types of commodities with official prices are as follows according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry: 1. Food category: Rice, flour; 2. Seasoning category: Salt, edible oil; 3. Fuel category: Coal, briquettes; 4. Miscellaneous category: Soap, matches, candles, paper, Western medicine; 5. Clothing category: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth; 6. Livestock category: Beef, pork.

### Daily Necessities

According to this list of items, the evaluators can only evaluate paper and Western medicine. The prices of other items are controlled by other agencies and are not evaluated by our Evaluation Committee. After careful research and arrangement by the Evaluation Committee together with various industrialists, businessmen, and economic experts, it was determined that the following 100 or so items are daily necessities and must be officially priced and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The list of these 100 or so items is as follows: 1. Food category - Rice and rice products: Rice, corn, wheat crumbs, zifan. Flour and flour products: Flour, cut noodles, bread, pancakes, fried dough sticks, biscuits. 2. Attached to other foods - Beans and bean products: Soybeans, red beans, dried broad beans, sprouted beans, soybean sprouts, tofu, dried tofu, oily tofu, hundred pages, fermented bean curd. Fresh beans: Broad bean pods, cowpea pods, flat bean pods. Melons: Cucumber, winter melon, eggplant. 3. Vegetable category - Chinese cabbage, Shanghai bok choy, small Shanghai bok choy, vegetable knots, chicken feather vegetables, cabbage, spinach, Da Ke vegetables, leeks, salted Chinese cabbage, salted snow vegetables, potatoes, sweet potatoes, white radish. Southern goods: Daylily, wood ear, bianjian, line powder dry. Fish: Fresh yellow croaker, fresh ribbonfish, salted yellow croaker, salted ribbonfish. Eggs: Duck eggs, chicken eggs. 4. Seasoning category - Soy sauce, coarse salt, sugar, edible oil. 5. Fuel category - Briquettes, firewood, coal, waste wood. 6. Miscellaneous category - Soap, matches, candles, cigarettes, toilet paper, watch core paper, toothpaste, toothbrush, boiled water, exercise books, small regular script books, practice books, writing brush, pencil, newsprint, glossy paper, rough-edged paper. 7. Clothing category - Cotton cloth, cotton, underwear, socks, towels, shoes, wooden yarn. 8. Livestock category - Meat: Fresh pork, fresh beef. Attached aquatic products: Snails.

### Points to Note for Management

Regarding the management of commodity prices, this bureau has consistently emphasized the following five points: 1. The prices of agricultural and industrial products should maintain equilibrium in terms of exchange relations. 2. The economic interests of producers and consumers should be harmonized. 3. Production should be encouraged, consumption should be economized, and production planning should be implemented. 4. The principle of low prices should be adhered to for people's daily necessities and military supplies. 5. Political power should be guided towards the rear economic construction of the Greater East Asia War.

There are still many aspects that need to be improved in future evaluation work. For example, evaluation standards should be based on cost accounting, so the production costs that constitute the cost should be distinguished, with special attention to achieving the principle of reduction. This bureau has divided general production costs into the following eight categories: 1. Raw materials, 2. Wages, 3. Electricity (i.e., motive power), 4. Transportation, 5. Interest, 6. Production equipment depreciation, 7. Taxes, 8. Operating expenses.

To cope with the current severe situation, this bureau will step up measures to crack down on speculation and hoarding. Regarding the prices of controlled goods, we are separately consulting with the competent authorities in charge of control and convening various trade associations to discuss [autonomous control] measures. In addition, we have strictly ordered each trade association to instruct its member firms to clearly mark the prices of all goods sold, and not to raise prices without authorization. We will also print the prices evaluated by this bureau into booklets to serve as standards for cracking down on illegal price increases. At the same time, this bureau encourages people to report offenses to gather public opinion, and a special task force has been set up within the bureau to gather experts to constantly study countermeasures. We also jointly established a liaison meeting with the Economic Security Department to unify operations.

### Recommendations to the Central Government

We further recommend to the Central Government to urgently find ways to improve the following matters in order to achieve both immediate and long-term effects: 1. Guarantee the supply of raw materials to producers; 2. Guarantee the supply of electricity to producers; 3. Improve transportation to facilitate the flow of goods; 4. Improve the rationing system, striving to increase the variety and ensure adequate quantities; 5. Economic control agencies should prevent their commercialization; 6. The government should find ways to subsidize the prices and fees of public utilities and should not repeatedly increase prices to avoid stimulating general commodity prices; 7. A central organization for national commodity price control should be established immediately.

Regarding increasing production, in the agricultural sector, this bureau has added a department to effectively promote the agricultural production increase plan promulgated by the Central Government. In the industrial sector, this bureau has contacted the embassy to conduct factory electricity registration to prepare for increasing factory electricity use.

This is a general overview of our efforts in commodity price management. However, we still need to work together with relevant parties such as embassies, consulates, military police, the Economic Security Department, various control agencies, trade associations, and the press. The work is indeed difficult, and the system is indeed imperfect, but it is our duty to do our best, even if it means exhausting our efforts. We hope that you will provide guidance and assistance from time to time so that our work can increasingly approach the goal of stabilizing commodity prices, which is what I sincerely expect.

Expectations of Representatives from Various Countries

The Third Greater East Asia Writers' Conference will be held in Nanjing, China, for the first time. Convening such a cultural international conference of representatives while the fierce flames of war are approaching the country can be said to be an unprecedented feat in history. The international conferences of the enemy, Britain and the United States, are despicable and dirty meetings for dividing spoils, but comparing them with ours reveals that the Greater East Asia War has a true meaning of not invading other people's territories, and at the same time proves how firm our belief in victory is. The Mainichi Shimbun has specially put forward the Greater East Asia Literary Prize and is sparing no effort to assist the conference, and this is its intention. Therefore, it will publish a special issue to collect the determination of writers' representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia for the Oriental cultural conference to be held in Nanjing, the capital of the new China.

### Japan's Riichi Yokomitsu

As the war intensifies, the international unity of writers becomes more necessary, which is what everyone who hopes for the victory of the Greater East Asia War thinks. The East Asia Writers' Conference initially started as a political demand, gradually became an intellectual request, and further evolved into a planned cultural harmony. Forming a solid natural will into a tangible form is the first such phenomenon since Emperor Meiji.

From a cultural perspective, this is merely a superficial observation. Ignoring this meaning is unwise. It is not something every country can do to hold a cultural festival during the decisive battle while expanding one's vision.

Non-urgent matters should be put behind, but this non-urgent matter put in front at this time can be said to be a practical manifestation of the desire to closely connect peacetime aspirations with decisive battle aspirations.

The war itself, in the Orient, is always a war of harmony, no matter when. The more intense the war, the faster the speed of harmony, but what is manifested everywhere is the harmony of conflict. This is the harmonizing character of the East, which is a natural requirement and is also free of any embellishment.

It goes without saying that East Asian affairs should be resolved by East Asia. I do not want to delve into the reason why such an obvious matter becomes unclear here, but what needs to be known is the fruits of the collective Greater East Asian goodwill, wishes, thoughts, pursuits, and aspirations summarized by the previous conference, which everyone knows. What is hoped for at this Nanjing conference is that past accounts do not need to be settled again, but we must clearly recognize our common enemy among the enemy countries. We must explain the reasons for the lack of clarity to the entire East Asia, and at the same time, we must let the general public know, and even the enemy countries cannot but praise the virtues of the East.

There is no longer a need to explain what war is. It is the time for action. This has certainly become a common saying, but we must further understand the enemy's intentions in this unprecedented and astonishing war. Because concepts are just concepts, they are the most urgent economic actions.

For this reason, cultural aspects, as important as tangible economic aspects like money and materials, can convey the correct meaning of this war, hint at the future, organize the past, and give historical significance to the people of East Asia. This is the new challenge in cultural aspects. The importance of the Nanjing Conference lies in this. Various mistakes are the mother of success.

### China's Gong Chiping

The Third Greater East Asia Writers' Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on November 12, the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, with several dozen writers from China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The purpose and significance of convening the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference, as indicated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, is for the countries of Greater East Asia to respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation, thereby elucidating the culture of Greater East Asia.

In the past century, the culture of the four oceans, based on Anglo-American utilitarian thought, has invaded East Asia under the guise of military and economic power, causing great trauma and harm to Eastern culture.

As a result, China, with its 5,000-year-old culture and history, has experienced political corruption, warlord infighting, and social disorder. The purpose of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led by Japan and breaking the Anglo-American invasion to liberate the East Asian nations in this Greater East Asia War is to aim at the Anglo-American invasive culture and strike a fatal blow, while also restoring Eastern culture and developing the inherent culture of each nation. However, thinking of this year as the most urgent life-or-death moment, writers should also join forces with the military authorities to strive for victory.

In other words, now that the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, in order to transform the New East Asia, promote Eastern culture, and build a new world culture, the countries of East Asia should respect each other's traditions, give full play to the creativity of each nation, and mobilize all the cultural figures of Greater East Asia to accomplish our common highest ideal.

The previous two conferences were all convened in Tokyo, but this conference is convened in China, which of course has its special significance. (From Nanjing)

### Philippines' Ignacio

We also welcome the convening of the conference in Nanjing, because it will determine the uniqueness of Greater East Asian literature on the basis of a strong cultural organization in the New Order. Since the conference is being held under the current difficult decisive battle stage, and because of transportation obstructions, representatives from all countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot attend, so only representatives from Japan, Manchukuo, and the Republic of China will be dispatched. However, if possible, we, the Republic of the Philippines, would like to send at least one representative to attend. I believe it is always a supreme honor to have the opportunity to meet with representatives from various countries.

In this important era, what we writers must recognize is that we must achieve victory in this great war. Only after victory can the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia be completely liberated from under the iron heel, the literary spirit of East Asia can gain freedom, and the necessary atmosphere for fully developing creative literature can be nurtured.

Philippine writers have three hopes for the conference:

First, it was decided in 1942 to send a representative to the First Greater East Asia Writers' Conference in Tokyo, but unfortunately, no speech was delivered. Therefore, at the Third Conference convened in Nanjing this time, no matter how poor we may be, we want to make a small contribution and hope to deepen friendship with representatives from various countries.

Second, the First Conference was convened when the Philippines had not yet achieved independence, but now the Philippines is also an independent country, so today's Philippine writers want to stand on an equal footing with other independent countries and freely discuss everything with the Greater East Asia representatives. At last year's Greater East Asia Writers' Conference in Tokyo, our Republic sent Bautista and me to attend. Writers are also an organism living in this great turbulent era, so they want to often make contact with various countries to gain inspiration.

Third, among all the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, everyone should understand that the Philippines has been under the domination and control of Western European foreign races for 400 years and is in a special state. Therefore, we hope that other friendly countries will sympathize with us and help us become a true East Asian country. If so, it will give prosperity to the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere. Finally, I cannot refrain from saying that even though our battle situation is in such a tight stage, Japan is still concerned about the cultural improvement of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is really grateful. It is grateful to be preparing for the booming cultural flower of the peaceful era after the Greater East Asia victory. (From Manila)

### Thailand's Nuya

It is truly a miracle and a joy that the countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are convening a grand Greater East Asia Writers' Conference while the war is intensifying. The countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should use this conference to fully exchange culture, correctly guide the people of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in combat, and hope for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, thereby establishing Greater East Asian culture. To be honest, Thailand has mostly been influenced by French literature. The era of Rama II was an era of translating French literature. During the reign of Rama IV, English literature was temporarily popular, especially Shakespeare, but it was later influenced and dominated by French literature again.

However, after the establishment of the Pibun regime in 1938, together with His Royal Highness Prince Wan Waithayakon, the director of the then National Library, and Mr. Birt, the national essence literature of Thailand was restored, and this continues to this day.

Thailand has produced unprecedented poets such as Sunthorn Phu and Pao (whose famous work is [Golden Mountain]), but unfortunately, there has been no opportunity to introduce Thai literature to the countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere until today. The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to be held in Nanjing this autumn will follow the prosperity of the culture of the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and complete this introduction, which is of immeasurable significance. (From Bangkok) —Translated by An from the September 16th Mainichi Shimbun—

### Greater East Asia Literary Prize - Assessments in Various Places -

Amidst the waves of deadly battles, the Co-Prosperity Sphere Writers' Conference for the construction of Greater East Asian literature will be held in Nanjing, and it has been decided that the glorious Second Greater East Asia Literary Prize will be awarded on the last day of the conference. The First Greater East Asia Literary Prize was decided at last year's Tokyo Conference, and award ceremonies were held in Japan, Manchukuo, and China. Unfortunately, the South Seas region did not have the opportunity to win the glory of the First Prize because no excellent works appeared. Therefore, over the past year, the enthusiasm and the absorption of the concept of the New Order in the South Seas region have made rapid progress. The Philippines, Java, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, and other countries have convened assessment committees since August and are working hard to select candidate works.

In Java, a collection of poems called [Hero of the Times] by Manos Muruf, a leading writer in the local literary scene, and a novel called [Not for Me] by Yao Gardahati Majia have been submitted for review. In Thailand, the Thai Cultural Council is currently collecting and reviewing works, because winning the Greater East Asia Literary Prize is also a supreme honor for Thailand, so the Cultural Council's review and assessment are very cautious and serious. In Japan, more than a dozen works, including [The Founding of Manchukuo] by Kenichi Kenta, are being discussed by the assessment committee. In Manchukuo, [Rebirth] by Guding is said to be the most promising. In China, Kusano Shimpei is leading the assessment, and he is painstakingly selecting works every day.

### Friendship Lingers Forever

— Chen Jingru

In my childhood memories, besides being full of innocence and mischief, it seems strange that I developed a fondness for a little girl at that time, and I still deeply miss her to this day. She was my fellow villager and classmate, and it should have been seven or eight years ago.

The Central School in N Town is a famous elementary school. In this school, I smoothly completed the orthodox basic curriculum. I remember when I was entering the first semester of the fifth grade, I noticed her presence in the same class. With her round face, an adorable smile, a nimble figure, and elegant demeanor, I felt that she was a very lovely person. Perhaps it was the unique reserve of a young girl. She didn't like to talk to people much, so her surface didn't have the unrestrained enthusiasm of a southern girl, but she always exuded infinite purity and sincerity in solemn calmness. She was intelligent and excelled in all subjects, especially in Chinese and spelling. Her works were often published on the wall newspapers organized by the alumni association, and she wrote beautiful calligraphy, which won the praise of teachers and students throughout the school. At the end of the semester, her academic performance was either first or second in the entire grade.

I don't know who arranged it, but during the four semesters of senior elementary school, she and I sat at the same desk in the same class. Because we were closer, we established a friendship that was different from ordinary relationships. In the morning light and under the evening glow, we walked side by side to school or home. On weekends, we often strolled in the garden, on the road, and in the fields, casually discussing various academic problems. In this frank and innocent friendship, our knowledge progressed silently together.

After graduating from elementary school, a long summer vacation separated us. Whenever I was cooling off on a summer night, I would naturally think of her, her round face, her beautiful smile... A burst of inexplicable joy would flash through my heart. Regarding her character and her studies, it was like looking up at the stars in the dark sky, giving me a feeling of nobility and brightness.

Soon, we met again in the first-year classroom of the business school at S Middle School. I felt that she was becoming more beautiful and lovely as a young girl should be than before, but she still maintained the same silent, studious spirit as in elementary school. After extracurricular activities, other students were noisy, fooling around, or going home, but she always buried herself in the books in the library or quietly read by the small stream behind the campus. Sometimes she and I would appear at the same place at the same time, under the trees in the square, or on the stone steps by the clear stream, and after she greeted me familiarly, she would lower her head and quietly read her book. Perhaps because she was a little older, she was no longer as unreserved between boys and girls as before. But when I occasionally glanced at her back, she would secretly turn her head to look at me, and when I caught her, she would give me a charming smile without saying a word. Once, the school held a student work exhibition, displaying excellent papers and notebooks from students of all grades separately, and I found that she spent most of her time carefully reading my [Life Diary] notebook. When I walked up to her, she hurriedly pretended to be looking at other people's notebooks. I still can't figure out why, a young girl's heart.

Her tireless efforts enabled her to achieve above-average results in all aspects, and her name was routinely praised by teachers and students throughout the school. Before the summer vacation, the school held a school-wide gathering, and she received the most prestigious special prize from the principal. In a burst of warm applause, her apple-like face became even redder and more beautiful. This beautiful radiance symbolized her future shining with unparalleled brightness.

Then, the scorching summer came with the god of war, and the entire town fell into scorched terror. We separated in the rubble, and that was seven or eight years ago. Such a long time, and now at the ends of the earth, I wonder where she is living?

Opening the curtain of youth, I feel like a lonely traveler in a desert land, but when that familiar image of a round face and a beautiful pen reappears in my heart, I no longer feel lonely. I seem to hear the sound of matching footsteps in front of me. How can I not keep up?

Who is she? What is her surname and what is her name? Please forgive me for not explaining further. Anyway, there is such a classmate that I will always remember in my heart.

### A Father's Lament

— Xu Jialing

I am a father of ten children, and I blame myself for this. In this day and age, I've raised such a large brood of little monkeys. Monkeys can perform tricks and earn money, but my bunch only want to eat, wear clothes, and study, without earning a single penny. Of course, I can't blame them for not earning money, because I haven't invested enough in them. I wish I could stretch them all up instantly, which would save a lot of rice and shorten the tormenting time; at least I want to blow them up one by one, so they don't look all skinny and yellow, making me sad.

The eldest is studying at university, the second and third are in high school, the fourth is in junior high school, the fifth, sixth, and seventh are in elementary school, the eighth stays at home, the ninth just learned to walk, and the tenth is still breastfeeding. Fortunately, my sons and daughters are ambitious; the eldest got a scholarship, the second and third got student loans, the fourth is completely free in school, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh are all getting fee reductions, which really lightens my burden as a father. But the cost of supplies for a semester is still considerable! People always say that I am lucky to have such a large group of children, and that they are all ambitious and willing to study. I am certainly very happy, but the shadow of life will soon drive my happiness away.

Sometimes, I suddenly have strange thoughts: Why do my children want to study so much? How great it would be if they weren't so keen on books! The eldest could work in a bank, the second could be a nurse, the third could be a trainee, and the fourth and fifth could be apprentices… Alas! They could help me so much! At least they could take care of themselves, but they just love books… Alas… Of course, I know this idea of mine is completely wrong, but I still often think about it.

Every month, we need to eat at least one *shi* of rice, burn one *dan* of coal briquettes, and there's oil, vegetables, rent… It really makes me dizzy, but I only earn 6,000 yuan in reserve notes. Even though I've quit smoking and drinking, it's still not enough! As for how to get through the days, I'm a bit confused; it seems like enduring grievances, sleeping out of frustration, going to the pawnshop, arguing with my wife, hitting the children…

In fact, my wife is indeed miserable enough. Her family was originally very well-off, and she had been enjoying a good life since childhood. Now, she's followed me, this poor devil, and has really suffered a lot of grievances. There are no servants at home; from morning to night, she cooks, washes vegetables, washes clothes, all by herself. When she has free time, she has to teach the eighth to read, watch out for the ninth falling, and breastfeed the tenth… Sometimes, she even has to go to relatives to borrow money, helping to find ways to make a living. I also understand her virtue and diligence, but for some reason, I often argue with her, making everyone shed tears.

In the morning, to save coal briquettes, we buy snacks to eat. The seventh brought in a *dabing youtiao* (flatbread and fried dough sticks), eating as he walked. I said to my wife, "Look, why did you give him a whole *dabing youtiao*? What if it makes him sick! Next time, just give him a *dabing*, that's enough." The child seemed a bit embarrassed, but didn't dare to cry. My wife silently made the bed. In fact, I also know that a *dabing youtiao* is definitely not harmful for a nine-year-old child, especially since he'll have thin porridge for lunch today! I love my children and want them to grow up fair and chubby, living like little princes, but for some reason, I'm being stingy with a single *youtiao*.

Whenever prices jump, my wife always sighs and says, "We should buy this thing soon, we should buy that thing soon." I often want to take the money out of my pocket and tell her to go buy it. But when I calculate the days, there are still half a month before payday, and I can't help but sigh and answer her, "Well, the poor always eat expensive goods."

Of course, I also have happy times. For example, when the eldest gets the best prize, the second and third get first place, the fourth gets above 95 points… The ninth can bring me slippers and hang up my hat, and the tenth can call me "Papa." At this time, I can't help but rejoice that I have such a group of good children, and I fantasize about the future world. Involuntarily, a few drops of hot water squeeze out of my eyes.

But the real-life problems are pressing in front of me again, and I don't know when this fantasized future world will arrive.

My only comfort is this fantasized future world; otherwise, I would have given up on living long ago.

### The Riddle of Life

— Ni Xiaotong

When a person enters the world, he is ignorant and unaware; but in the moment before death, he is still bitterly making a final struggle! When he is babbling, he seems to be happy like an immortal; in childhood, he is truly innocent; but in adulthood, he is always thinking wildly!

If he is praying and burning incense, he is speaking one thing but thinking another; once he comes into contact with society, he lies about everything about himself; when he reaches the stage of employment, he naturally becomes a soulless liar!

When his hair turns white and his teeth fall out, he cannot help but long for his past; but he cannot help but feel sad! But not long after he dies silently, he is forgotten by people!

Ah! This is the riddle of life! (For Aid to Education)

### Birthday

— Wang Zhicheng

Today,

is your birthday;

From morning on,

sink into deep thought!

This day,

who remembers it?

No one remembers it,

except your mother.

Don't let tears

flow from lost childhood:

rolling on treasures in the deep pool,

on your lips,

bite on hope!

With burning eyes, gaze intently,

live, live on…

Sunlight

fills the window;

There is a path outside—

people come and go,

these figures,

so close,

yet strangely distant!

The existence of life is originally—

a beautiful dream,

a fallen star,

an awakened lamplight,

a soaring shadow,

longing floats and sinks in the heart,

weave some hopes for your life,

the autumn wind may bring news of winter!

Except your mother,

no one remembers,

who can remember?

This day,

sink into deep thought!

From morning on,

your birthday,

today. (In response to remuneration)

### On Viewing Mr. Wu Zhongxing's Photography Exhibition

— Jiaxi

In recent years, the trend of calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Shanghai has been very popular, and there have been many photography exhibitions as well. However, Mr. Wu Zhongxing's photography charity exhibition, which is currently being held, can be considered the most satisfying one.

Mr. Wu is fully engaged in photography in his spare time, and has continued to study and refine his skills for more than 20 years, so his achievements and attainments are very valuable. Mr. Wu enjoys a high reputation internationally, and has been selected for international exhibitions several times. However, Mr. Wu's works are not well known in his own country, which is the result of his dedication to his work and his lack of self-promotion. This time, at the invitation of this newspaper, he is holding a charity exhibition to help students, which is also the first time that Mr. Wu's photographic works have been publicly seen by the audience!

Among the works on display are masterpieces that have participated in overseas exhibitions, as well as recently completed works that have not yet been published. Although there are only a little over a hundred pieces, they are all representative works, giving people a sense of being overwhelmed by their beauty. For example, "Double Purity" has won many praises in overseas exhibitions, and fully expresses the color beauty of oriental books in photographic technology. "Warm Spring in Wuling" also gives people an unforgettable impression with its bright colors and light. "Snow on a Stream Bridge," "Snow Bamboo," and "Snow on a Fishing Beach" give people a sense of being in the severe winter. "Playing with Objects" makes good use of the contrast of strong light, which is very skillful. "Pagoda Reflection on a Stream Bridge" and "Jade-like Running Spring" add a variety of colors, further emphasizing the expressiveness and realism of the image. The even and appropriate coloring also shows that the author is also a master of coloring. From "Autumn Light Gladly Reaches the Bamboo Fence" and "Frozen Sparrow," we can also know that the author is a master who likes to draw materials. The above are all the author's strengths, which are worth noting and solemnly introducing.

Hundreds of viewers who came to appreciate photography filled the venue, and they concentrated on staring at the images. Not only were there Chinese people, but also many expatriates from Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. In the past two days, many articles introducing and criticizing the exhibition have also been published in foreign-language newspapers. This is of course because art has no borders, but the author's works are rich in strong appeal and undeniable charisma, which cannot be ignored.

### Post-Viewing of the Two Charity Football Matches: An Examination of the Strength of This Year's Top Four

— Bixian

This year's football league has already begun last weekend. There was only one match in Group A, which was a friendly match between Lianyi and Erti. The strength was too disparate to be worth discussing. However, there have been two charity football matches, with the opponents being the four major giants of Chinese and Western football: Donghua, Lianyi, Qiaolian, and Pushang. At the beginning of the season, fans are overjoyed to see such a good show. After watching the two matches, the author feels that the Group A league will not escape being dominated by these top four teams. Therefore, I will briefly describe the two charity matches and then comment on these top four teams.

### First Match Ends Unhappily

The first charity match was held last week between Donghua and Qiaolian. Last year, Qiaolian suffered the humiliation of six defeats, so the team was eager to vent their pent-up anger in this match. Therefore, after the start of the match, all that could be seen was the Hu'er players running wild. The Donghua players, caught off guard, only knew how to defend. However, ultimately, their experience and skills were not inferior to their opponents, so they were still able to take a 2-0 lead. Unexpectedly, just when they thought they had a sure win, the foreign players had plenty of stamina, and scored three goals in a short period of time, coming from behind. With more than ten minutes remaining, Qiaolian left the field in protest of the referee's decision, resulting in an unhappy ending, which was a bit of a disappointment. Based on this match, I will comment on the two teams.

### Donghua

Last year, their sharpness created a new record, winning every match without a single defeat, which was commendable. There is a saying: "If you don't advance, you retreat, like sailing against the current." In this match, Donghua clearly showed no progress, and even a few players seemed to have regressed. This is certainly a common phenomenon at the beginning of the season, and should not be overly criticized. However, after examining the ambitions of the other strong teams this season, and their recruitment of new players, the author earnestly hopes that Donghua will practice harder and constantly improve their skills. Then, it should not be difficult for them to win the championship again this year.

### Qiaolian

Their exquisite individual techniques and abundant stamina have long been recognized by football fans. What they lack is the ability to use their brains and cooperate well. If they can improve these two points, there is no limit to how far they can go. In their first appearance this season, it was felt that they still did not use their brains enough. However, they have already paid attention to the team's cooperation. Their performance was no longer just relying on brute force as before, and there were some small moves and delicate passes. If they can further refine and improve their tactics, then this year's Qiaolian will be a force to be reckoned with.

### Second Match Shows Lianyi's Excellence

The second charity match was held this Wednesday, also at the Racecourse, with Lianyi taking on Pushang. With the addition of two young players, Luo Shoufu and Gao Xiuqing, Lianyi's front line has washed away its past sluggishness. In addition, the rest of the old players have been practicing hard during the summer, and their physical strength has improved, resulting in an excellent performance. Pushang also did their best to distribute their lineup, taking both offense and defense into consideration. Therefore, the match was extremely intense. Lianyi ultimately relied on their combined efforts to exert their maximum power. Young player Gao Xiuqing was particularly outstanding, scoring two goals, and they defeated the talented Pushang by a score of 4-2, which was not easy. Both teams showed significant improvements.

### Lianyi

The individual skills of their players were superior to those of other teams. Last year, they quietly withdrew midway, for their own reasons, causing fans who loved their skills to sigh in vain. However, the scattered spirit of the team members last year is also an undeniable fact. This year, the team is determined to restore its reputation. In addition to inviting new players, the old players are also striving to improve. Therefore, the entire team has already returned to its original state, and the two new players are indeed capable, so their performance has its merits. Their aggressive style is certainly different from Donghua's delicate style, but it has a kind of loveliness that is pleasing to the eye. I hope they will continue to move forward, and there are great hopes for them this year. Cheer on, Lianyi players!

### Pushang

This year's lineup distribution is very thorough. Veteran players such as Costan and Baoxiuo have joined forces, which is no different from a disguised version of the once-powerful French team. Although they lost to Lianyi 2-4 in the previous match, it was really a symptom of the "early season disease." Based on their well-organized lineup, experienced veterans, and cunning tactics, they will definitely improve as the season progresses. Although they may not be able to win the championship in the league in the future, they will definitely be a major threat to the two strong teams, Donghua and Lianyi.

In summary, the four teams mentioned above are the most likely to win the championship in Group A of the football league. The next most likely is the Shanghai Police team, which has not yet shown its face, and may have unexpected results. Today, the Shanghai Police team is playing Huatong in their first match, which will show us what they are like. But no matter what, they will not be as good as the four strong teams mentioned above.

### The Division of Strength Among the Teams in Group A of the *Shenbao* Cup Basketball League is Already Clear

— Jiemei

Since the start of the *Shenbao* Cup basketball league, although it has only been a little over a week, the division of strength is already clear. Last week, the author introduced the strength of the ten teams in Group A, which has now been confirmed. Currently, the teams that remain undefeated are Hualian, Zhongbei, Dahua, Shante, and Huanan, while the teams that have already lost are Mingxing, Huaying, V Team, Renyu, and Tongren. Each has their half, and the boundaries are very clear. Although this cannot be taken as a final conclusion, the general order will not change much.

Looking at the situation of the teams over the past week, it is felt that the promising teams are all scheming and competing with each other. For example, the Hualian team has recruited Western star Brett and is about to bring in the northern star Chuan Jinsheng to help. Their ambition is beyond words. And the Zhongbei team has Zhao Zhilin, Li Baozhong, and others staying in Shanghai, and has also obtained the addition of national player Yin Huanwen. Thus, the strength of the north is melted into one furnace. In the future, the bloody battle between these two strong teams will be a rare event in recent years. Currently, fans are already using the battles of Hua, Zhong, and Da as talking points. The next most likely is the Dahua team, which also has ambitions to contend for the championship. The sudden appearance of veteran players such as Zhen Xianglong, Xu Wenkui, and Lu Zhongen is clear, and they will definitely be strong rivals to Hualian and Zhongbei in the future. As for the young players of the Shante team, their skills are improving day by day, which is obvious to all. Whether they can have a transcendent harvest in the future depends on their experience and adaptation on the field, and it is difficult to predict to what extent. The other teams all have good spirits, and they will definitely use all kinds of tricks to win in the battle for fame and position, and strive to perform their skills to win the appreciation of fans, adding a glorious and happy chapter to this basketball cup.

Also, among the matches next week, the match between Dahua and Shante on Friday will be the most eye-catching. The situation of the two teams is developing. Although it is not a battle for the championship, its impact on everyone is very important. Therefore, this match is allowed to be the most stimulating scene after the start of the *Shenbao* Cup.

### Miscellaneous

Miss Huang Xingfen, the mainstay of the Yuan Team's women's volleyball team, has been a leader in the volleyball world for more than a decade. As a veteran, she does not let down those who come after her. Miss Huang is scheduled to marry Mr. Yang Yicheng, a giant in the business world, on the 21st of this month. It is expected that after the marriage, it will be difficult to see Miss Huang's style on the court.

Zhang Banglun, the goalkeeper of the Donghua football team, is also good at basketball. He serves the Dahua team in the *Shenbao* Cup and performs very well. His wife must come to support him every game, so he is very energetic. Mrs. Zhang is gentle and quiet, and also has research on basketball. She often points out things to Mr. Zhang, which is a good partnership with like-minded people.

After the death of Jia Youliang's father last month, a memorial service will be held today at Zhuangyan Temple on Beile Road. The Jia brothers have a wide circle of friends, and it is expected that there will be a grand funeral. (Jing Duan)

### The Sports-Loving "Yang Family"

The Dahua men's and women's basketball teams are well-known teams in Shanghai. The players have excellent skills and a humble attitude. Their leader, Mr. Yang Shuding, is in charge of everything, and his achievements are remarkable. Whenever the team plays, whether it is in Group A or B, he personally goes to the field to guide them. He also visits other sports competitions and has a strong interest in them. It is said that Mr. Yang is nearly sixty years old, but he is full of energy and is a giant in the financial world. He and his wife and children visit sports competitions, and they are very happy. His son, Yuan Kai, is a valuable entrepreneur of Qianjin. Yuan Long is currently a professor at St. John's University and a famous player on the Dahua team. His daughter also likes to play ball, and the residence has a court. The whole family loves sports, and people like to call them the "Modern Yang Family." (Yuān)
