### "Miserliness" and "Enthusiasm"

The police consumer cooperative in this city, since the police actively prepared and carried it out, will soon reach two sentences. Regarding the capital of 10 million yuan, they have also requested advances from all sectors of society and various industry trade associations, hoping to finalize it by April 10th, collect the funds, and then establish it. It is heard that some industry trade associations have recently held meetings to remit payments, while some associations are watching and declining. The situation with shops and wealthy individuals remains the same.

From an objective standpoint, we have repeatedly offered our humble opinions regarding the advance of funds. In short, the police bear the responsibility of maintaining public order. The level of service efficiency directly affects the quality of public security. And the quality of public security directly affects the tranquility of the entire city. Organizing a police consumer cooperative directly improves the lives of the police, and in short, it improves the efficiency of police service, increases the strength of maintaining public order, and maintains the tranquility of the entire city. This is not just empty theory, but a suitable fact, which should be commonly recognized by citizens who understand things slightly. Although, due to the deep-rooted habits of the foreign-managed patrol room in the past, the citizens' impression of the police is not satisfactory, but since the recovery of the concessions, many new talents in police administration and Allied experts have participated in the work, and there is indeed a gradual spirit of rectification. However, in fact, it cannot be changed in a short period of time. Therefore, we should adopt an attitude of not blaming the past and expecting the future, and jointly assist in solving the difficulties in the lives of the police, and then train them to become modern police, so that they can fulfill the important mission of maintaining public order. First, do your best to complete this task, and after the work is completed, then review the past and improve it. In this way, the purpose of completing the work can be achieved, and at the same time, the bad impressions of the past can also be eliminated. If, because of the bad phenomena in the past process, the goal of the entire work is denied, and it is not enthusiastically completed, then the result will be that the completion of the work is hopeless, and even the bad impressions in the past process will always exist and will not be eliminated. This result is certainly not the narrow attitude that those who hope to complete the entire work should adopt.

To put it more thoroughly, improving the lives of the police is not the goal, but the goal is to improve service efficiency after the lives of the police are improved, so that they can take on the responsibility of maintaining public order and protecting the tranquility of the citizens. Therefore, improving the lives of the police is a means, while ensuring public order is the goal. Because the patrol room had an unsatisfactory impression in the past, they are unwilling to improve the lives of the police. If the lives of the police cannot be improved, the incident itself is small, but the difficulty in ensuring the entire public order has a great impact. Of course, we are not saying that the lives of the police should be improved, and that the police's lack of service ethics can be different. This point is obviously listed, and we have to emphasize and point out to inform all sectors of society.

Finally, we hope that the industry trade associations and people from all walks of life who are still watching and hesitating will advance funds, with interest and guarantee, which is not a donation at all. We believe that the reason for whether you are willing to advance funds lies not in genuine powerlessness and difficulty, but in the difference between "miserliness" and "enthusiasm"!

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to today's announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters, the air combat results achieved by the Japanese road team in various battle lines in March were a total of 487 enemy aircraft shot down (including 45 that were unconfirmed). The number of Japanese aircraft lost also reached 93. Compared with the results in February, the number of aircraft shot down increased by 80. Moreover, due to the special circumstances of the Burmese battle line and the Bismarck Islands, the total number of enemy aircraft attacked in February was 21,044, and in March it was 18,329. Although the number decreased slightly from February to March, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese army increased sharply. This was all due to the hard work of the Japanese army's first-line troops, and the Japanese army's loss of aircraft was 80 in February and increased to 93 in March. The battle situation was quite tragic.

### Japanese troops in the Indo-Burma border occupied the Tadam Fortress and pursued and inflicted heavy damage on the British army.

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Indo-Burma front telegram: About a brigade of the British 24th Division, in the Kabaw Valley, held the Molei Fortress about 4 kilometers north of Molei a few days ago. After the position was captured by the Japanese army, the enemy was forced to retreat to the mountains in the northwest on the 1st after being pressured by the Japanese army from the north and south. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack and pursuit from the east, and finally broke into Tadam. The remnants of the enemy army were severely damaged, and the Japanese army completely occupied the area.

A certain base on the Indo-Burma border, 5th (Central News Agency) - About a brigade of the British 20th Division, after retreating westward to the mountains along the Tadam-Palel highway from Tadam, joined forces with about a brigade of the British 23rd Division stationed in its rear position, attempting to make a final struggle. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from the east for this purpose. At the same time, another Japanese army controlled its retreat route and inflicted heavy damage on it. After losing its retreat route due to the Japanese army's attack, the enemy repeatedly launched meaningless counterattacks in an attempt to struggle to the death, but was still severely damaged after the Japanese army's attack.

The Myitkyina airport was bombed again

A certain base in Burma, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's government rushed bomber squadrons twice bombed the newly established enemy airport about 40 kilometers from Myitkyina, the landing area of the enemy airborne troops, on the evening of the 3rd and at dawn on the 4th, destroying 4 enemy aircraft on the ground and 7 gliders, and setting them on fire. At the same time, the high-shooting machine gun positions around the airport were also heavily damaged. Afterwards, all Japanese aircraft returned to base safely.

The enemy intelligence team was uncovered

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - A certain base on the Burmese front, 5th telegram: The enemy intelligence unit of 200 men under the command of British Major Hicklem, etc., was rounded up by the Japanese army and special task force on the 14th of last month, and was recently executed by the Japanese army. According to reports, before the Japanese army captured Rangoon last spring, the intelligence unit used the dense forest area southeast of Toungoo as its stronghold to investigate the stationing of the Japanese army, the location of the airport, and the distribution of its forces, and planned to disrupt the public order in the area and collect intelligence. At the same time, Major Hicklem had been training spies for a year since last spring, and had repeatedly contacted the Calcutta Command Department by radio (these radios were transported by aircraft from Calcutta) since last summer. The weapons they were equipped with were only more than 30 war machine guns and box guns and hunting guns for self-defense. Therefore, the enemy's commando team that attempted to disrupt the rear positions of the Japanese army in Burma and the arrest of Hicklem this time were major losses for the enemy. From then on, the Japanese army no longer had to worry about the rear and could devote all its efforts to the offensive operations against India.

British and American sides express uneasiness

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi: The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Army Headquarters stated in its war report on the 4th that no new changes had occurred on the Indian front, but according to previous news, after the Japanese army north of Imphal completely cut off one of the supply routes of the British-Indian army, in order to further isolate Imphal, the surrounding offensive taken from the north and east seemed to be further strengthened. Reuters special correspondent on the 4th strongly stated that the tense situation on the northern front of Imphal was not optimistic, and the Japanese army's continued westward advance north of Imphal was no longer optimistic. Moreover, a United Press reporter also admitted to the defeat of the British army, saying that the British-Indian army had engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the dense timber area east of Imphal, and had no choice but to retreat to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in Manipur, and had exhausted its forces too much. Moreover, the New York Times stated in its editorial on the 4th that it was greatly concerned about the success of the Japanese army in the Myitkyina battle, that the British army's attempt to retake Burma had failed, and even the political unrest pervading India could not be suppressed, and the battle situation in northeastern India had isolated Stilwell and increased it. Moreover, due to the repeated statements made by Chiang Te-la Pau-Sze, it further caused shaking.

Indians in Europe are extremely excited

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the Indian National Army began to attack India with the urgent assistance of the Japanese army, it was deeply moved by the Indian nationals living in Europe, and all hoped that the day of their motherland's independence would come as soon as possible, especially the "Free India League" in Berlin, Paris, and Bai Luhan Er, etc., were particularly eager for the independence of their motherland. Among them, 200 Indians who participated in the British army's operations on the Tunisian front and the Italian front and were captured by the German army expressed their belief that we are willing to organize the European troops of the Indian National Army, join the European front, and risk all dangers to go to the Burmese front to serve the country for the independence of India. Nambiar, the commander-in-chief of the troops stationed in Europe and the minister in charge of affairs, expressed his deep gratitude for this, and expressed his gratitude for the Japanese army's actions in attacking India this time. The Japanese government stated its fair attitude at the same time as the Japanese army entered India, saying that it would hand over the occupied areas to the rule of the Indian provisional government, which was completely different from the British government's false promise to grant independence to India after the war. Moreover, this fair measure taken by Japan left a very deep impression on the nationals of various countries in Europe. At the same time, Indian Minister of Affairs Nambiar, in addition to sending a telegram to Bose on behalf of his European comrades to congratulate him, made a speech at the Central Headquarters in Berlin on the 3rd, roughly saying that after the Japanese-Indian army entered India, the long-awaited Indian nationals immediately recognized the correctness of the policies adopted by Bose. The military and political assistance of the Japanese army to India was fair and just. At the same time, this fair and just arrangement by the Japanese army aroused great excitement among European comrades. Although the anti-Axis camp had made various propaganda about the war situation, the Indian people were not only not confused by it, but continued to join the Indian National Army, and their trust in the Axis camp's combat power was extremely strong. This was evidence that they firmly believed that the Japanese-Indian army would win the war against Britain, but before India has completed its independence, there are considerable difficulties. I am even more determined to strive to complete the construction of my motherland.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has worked even harder to consolidate the rear and cooperate in the war, which made him jealous of the enemy, and therefore died for the country. He is indeed a sacrifice of the Greater East Asia War. While deeply mourning, my colleagues are deeply encouraged! We will certainly inherit his ambition, redouble our efforts, and continue to struggle to complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.

### Definitely not the Offensive Line of War Life

Suspension of Affairs

This extraordinary measure in the current war requires government officials to first emulate and emulate. It is easy to see from the government's intention to set these guidelines. These guidelines consist of ten items, which include suspending peacetime or long-term leisure affairs and undertakings. The wax candle well wipes the two price increases of Peng Mule Cook Shih Bimi twice. However, the two-fold sophistication of this is more directly required for the expansion of the teaching team than for the ordinary officials, and there are still many people to bear. The government is always involved in this, and it is appropriate to stop the various affairs and undertakings of the official offices and public groups, or to substantially reduce them, for a year or so.

Sure Reward and Punishment

For the price of official history, the reward and punishment control, the frying revolution on December 31st, the service order for the official changes during the extraordinary war, the punishment and punishment order for civil servants, and other four orders will be implemented from January 4th. Its fun is not to pay others, official affairs, especially companies and inlays that have a relationship with the current situation, etc. Strive to improve the efficiency of affairs, so that hunger will be on duty and there will be no regrets. The government, in order to inspire this order, requires the people to decorate Junji's cooperation. Regarding the strengthening of posture, the thoroughness of that by calling and drinking must be intensified, and the natural improvement of more obvious branches and spears is also to bear the meaning of dismantling the two.

Reduction of Holidays in Official Offices - The reduction of holidays in official offices is to make continuous original desires. If the ball is walking, there is a strong desire for the power of the vast, there can not be a day or an hour of formation code. From now on, the official offices, state dates, and festivals will all be business work. Driving in Xu Ding or Ye Korea, the villainous affairs of the people who are engaged in direct relationship with this item can not be handled outside at any time. Only the system of calling the holiday of Lishou within Huai, for example, people who do things on the day of the house period, take a day off another day.

May the first teacher appreciate and reward.

### Carpathian Battles Hold Important Position; Historical Facts Favor Defenders

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Haitong News Agency: Observing the current situation of the major battle on the southern route of the Eastern Front, the Carpathian Mountain range will hold a considerably important position. During World War I, attacks from the east were blocked here. In late September 1914, the Soviet vanguard pursued the Austro-Hungarian army into the valley, but progress was slow. From the winter of 1914 until the spring of the following year, they could only seize a few key strongholds. Soviet casualties were heavy. In the autumn of 1914, the situation for Germany and Austria-Hungary was quite precarious. The Austro-Hungarian army was very weak on the Carpathian highlands, and the enemy's offensive was fierce. At this time, German reinforcements arrived to help, skillfully using the dangerous terrain of the mountains to fight the enemy, turning the crisis into safety. Historical facts show that the German army's fighting power in this war is much stronger than that of the Austro-Hungarian army in the past. German generals can calmly deal with the enemy. It should be known that the Soviet army's sharpest weapon is the tank, but in mountain warfare, tanks cannot easily exert their power.

Soviet Union Intensifies Pressure Downstream of the Dniester River

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The climate on the southern route of the Eastern Front has changed, with wind and snow, so the war has slowed down, but there are still fierce battles in Outer Nistria. The Soviet army is advancing towards Tiligul from the lower reaches of the White Bug River, and the battle is currently underway. The enemy attempted to cross the Tiligul River near Novaya and Oilyu, but failed. German counterattacks defeated enemy troops who had reached the west bank of the river. The Soviet Union continues to apply pressure downstream of the Dniester River from Verkhneslavka, aiming to cut off the German army fighting in the Odessa area, but the enemy cannot prevent the German army's planned westward retreat. It is expected that the German army will use Oilyusa as a base to conduct a strong resistance in the defenses south of the city. In the area between the Dniester and Prut rivers, the enemy attempted to cut off the railway between Kishinev and Iasi, but failed completely after facing strong German resistance. The enemy's progress towards the lower reaches of the Prut River and the Danube Delta was therefore blocked. Romanian divisions launched a strong counteroffensive in the middle reaches of the Prut River, repelling the enemy's offensive, so the enemy's progress towards Iasi achieved nothing.

Three Important Cities Under Siege

The Soviet army on the western section of the front continues to advance, but its vanguard is blocked near Stanislaviv and Kokomya. The Soviet attempt to break through from Brody towards Lviv was also blocked by German defensive fire. The battle for the fortified cities of Ternopol, Brody, and Kovel is still developing. The battle for Pskov on this route continues. In Monday's battle, the German army won a complete victory.

German-Hungarian Cooperation to Defend European Fortress

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet Union's psychological warfare against Romania, with the assistance of Britain and the United States, is a kind of inappropriate goal. The enemy attempts to use the military development on the Romanian border to make propaganda saying that, from a military point of view, Romania has been abandoned by Germany, so the Romanian army's continued resistance is not only a meaningless sacrifice, but also hinders the possibility of a solution. However, the German command's handling of the Hungarian incident shows that the German army attaches importance to Southeastern Europe. Germany will do its best to counter the military and political interference in one corner of the enemy's European fortress. In military terms, the German side believes that the Soviet army's advance can be blocked and lost territory can be recovered by strengthening cooperation through German-Romanian joint bloodshed.

### Soviet Union Has No Territorial Ambition Towards Romania, Molotov Declares

Moscow, 5th (Central News Agency) – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with a group of foreign journalists on the evening of the 2nd to announce the movements of the Soviet army in the southern part of the Eastern Front. This was the first time that the Foreign Minister had made a statement to a group of foreign reporters since the start of the war. The gist of it is as follows: The Soviet army, having reached the Prut River, is pursuing the German-Romanian army and is crossing the river at several locations, successively advancing into Romanian territory. It is also stressed that the Soviet government has no intention of acquiring Romanian territory, nor of changing Romania's current social organization. He also said that before issuing this statement, the Soviet Union had informed the British and American governments and obtained their agreement.

### Romanian Capital Bombed for the First Time; Hungarian Capital Bombed Again

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: On the afternoon of the 4th, German and Romanian fighter planes engaged in a fierce air battle with American bombers over Romania. At that time, the American bomber formation suffered heavy losses, and the invading enemy planes were also subjected to extremely fierce anti-aircraft fire, especially densely around the outskirts of the Romanian capital. American planes indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs on the Romanian capital, causing some damage to residential areas.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: At least forty-four anti-Axis planes were shot down yesterday over the Romanian capital, of which thirty-two were shot down by Romanian fighter planes, and it is reported that several were also shot down by Bulgarian fighter planes and anti-aircraft fire, but the exact number is not yet known. However, the wreckage of thirty-five planes has already been found in Romanian territory.

According to Haitong News Agency, British officials announced: Anti-Axis bombers bombed the Romanian capital yesterday. This is the first time the Romanian capital has been bombed, and the third time in six days that a Balkan capital has been bombed.

Budapest, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: According to official announcements, the enemy launched a terrifying air raid on the Hungarian capital on the night of April 3rd. Fortunately, land air defense teams and fighter planes cooperated to defend the city, so the bombing did not have a large effect.

Swiss Airspace Violated Again

### America Applies Economic Pressure to Turkey

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – After the breakdown of the British-Turkish military conference, the British government immediately prohibited the export of military supplies to Turkey. According to the Washington dispatches of the Times and the Daily Telegraph, it is reported that the American government, also based on the Lend-Lease Act, has stopped exporting oil and other materials to Turkey. Under the major premise of cooperation between Britain and the United States, strengthening diplomatic and economic pressure on the Turkish government is a trend that is bound to occur. The Times also commented on this in a special article, saying that although the United States has not yet officially acknowledged the above-mentioned events, the American government is observing the Turkish government's attitude towards the anti-Axis camp, so this measure has been taken. In addition, if neither of the countries involved in the trade agreement notifies of its termination by the end of April, it can continue to be effective afterwards. Although the American authorities have not confirmed the termination of the treaty, their hope to abandon the agreement is an undeniable fact.

### Admission of the Badoglio Government Exposes New Weaknesses in the Anti-Axis Alliance

Compared with its positive attitude towards the Balkans, Poland, and North Africa, the Soviet Union's policy towards Italy is more passive, as if it were completely entrusting Italy to the sphere of influence of Britain and the United States and expressing an attitude of indifference. Therefore, taking advantage of the Soviet Union's passive attitude, Britain and the United States quickly engaged in military and diplomatic work towards Italy during the period when the Soviet Union was busy attacking on the Eastern Front, attempting to bring Italy into their own pockets.

Purpose of Granting the Italian Fleet to the Soviet Union

When the US President announced on March 3 that one-third of the Italian fleet would be granted to the Soviet Union, the British media expressed great surprise that Britain had not announced it at the same time and had not even been notified in advance. This is of course the inevitable trend in the attitude of Britain and the United States arbitrarily disposing of other countries. But why did Roosevelt suddenly make this announcement? This inevitably creates a strange impression.

According to a Reuters Moscow dispatch on the 15th, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Badoglio to begin diplomatic relations began on March 6, and Roosevelt's announcement was made during the preparatory negotiations between Moscow and Badoglio. Was Roosevelt's announcement intended to give the impression that Moscow was demanding one-third of the Italian fleet? Or did it indicate that Britain and the United States were prepared to concede to this point? It is difficult to say for the moment. But Roosevelt clearly intended to undermine the negotiations between Moscow and Badoglio.

The Soviet Union has adopted a realistic diplomatic policy in this war, so it does not want to launch a communist revolution in Italy. Nor does it support the anti-monarchist parties led by Sforza and Croce to plot to replace the fascist regime of Badoglio. This is only because the internal situation in Italy is chaotic and it is difficult to predict its future. Judging from past history, the result of the Italian communist movement after the last World War was the creation of Mussolini's fascist regime, so the Soviet Union dared not act rashly.

Stalin's Realistic Diplomacy

The reason why the Soviet Union publicly recognized the Badoglio government today is that the situation in southern Italy has stabilized and the recognition of the Soviet Union can strengthen the Badoglio government. This is also a manifestation of Stalin's realistic diplomatic policy. Stalin advocated: "Do not instigate communist revolutions in other countries, but expect countries around the world to establish regimes that adopt pro-Soviet policies."

The special significance of the application of this general Soviet diplomatic question lies in the recognition of the Badoglio government this time. The Soviet Union took this action unilaterally, without consulting Britain and the United States beforehand. As a result, Britain and the United States were greatly alarmed and expressed disapproval of the Soviet Union. Moscow took the opportunity to launch a diplomatic offensive against Italy.

In the international arena, according to a Naples correspondent of the London Times, the anti-Axis Italian Administrative Committee has hardly held any meetings and has no activity. Therefore, although Britain and the United States constantly contacted the Badoglio government through the military operations headquarters, the Soviet Union and the North African regime, which participated in the Italian Administrative Committee, believed that the committee had gradually lost contact with Italy. The European Advisory Commission in London also does not attach importance to the committee. This is the result of Britain and the United States wanting to monopolize the work on Italy. The Soviet Union's recognition of the Badoglio government is a fierce attack on Britain and the United States' desire to monopolize Italy.

Following the Government-in-Exile

After the Badoglio government obtained Moscow's recognition, it immediately severed relations with Finland and at the same time restored diplomatic relations with the Chetnik government of Yugoslavia. The governments-in-exile of Yugoslavia and Greece, which had fled to Cairo, also followed the Badoglio government and intended to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow.

The Soviet Union's purpose in recognizing the Badoglio government is to establish pro-Soviet regimes everywhere, which is a manifestation of Stalin's broad diplomatic policy and the strengthening of the Soviet Union's political offensive in the Mediterranean. The method adopted by Britain and the United States is not to take a clear attitude towards other countries, standing in the middle of the anti-revolutionaries and radicals, without losing the sympathy of both sides, and calling it a democratic method; the Soviet Union is different, based on power politics and using decisive methods.

Neutral countries have adopted a passive attitude of prolonged observation towards the Soviet Union's actions this time. This is regarded as a natural reaction by the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union will not therefore seize the initiative in Italian diplomacy and arbitrarily control Italy. Britain and the United States have already built strong bridgeheads against the Soviet Union along the Mediterranean coast in Lisbon, Algiers, Cairo, and Turkey. Therefore, the Soviet Union's advance this time, like the Soviet Union's advance into North Africa last fall, will allow Britain and the United States to gradually build up their own solid traditional territories, and it has its special significance.

Britain has now sent Sir Noel Charles to the Badoglio government to counter the Soviet Union. The embarrassment of Britain and the United States and the new weaknesses of the Anglo-American-Soviet alliance, which are attracting worldwide attention, are trying to cover up, and are exposed before the eyes of people around the world.

### Spring Sacrificial Ceremony to Confucius Solemnly Held at the Confucius Temple Yesterday; Secretary-General Wu and Mayor Di Presided over the Ceremony

Yesterday (5th) was the national day for the spring sacrificial ceremony to Confucius. The city government authorities specially held a sacrificial ceremony to Confucius at the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple in the South City to commemorate the great spirit of the most sacred and wise teacher, and to promote Chinese culture. Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary-General Wu) presided over the ceremony, accompanied by Director Lin Jiongan of the City Education Bureau, Director Lu Ying of the Second Police Bureau, Director Yuan Houzhi of the City Finance Bureau, and Director Sun Wuqi of the City Social Welfare Bureau. Section chiefs of the city government and representatives of various organizations and institutions participated in the ceremony, as well as several hundred students from various schools. The Second Police Bureau band played music, and members of the bureau's Special Service Brigade and the Seventh District Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, as well as the Municipal First Middle School Youth Corps, were dispatched to maintain order at the scene.

Solemn Ceremony

The interior of the hall was simply decorated. Offerings were placed in front of the tablet of the teacher Confucius and the tablets of the sages on both sides. Red candles were burning brightly, and offerings of fruit, tea, and other items were made. At exactly 10 o'clock, the solemn ceremony began. With the sound of music, the chief celebrant took his place, the accompanying celebrants took their places, and the assisting celebrants took their places. Everyone stood at attention, sang the national anthem, and bowed three times to the teacher Confucius in the most respectful salute. The chief and accompanying celebrants then presented offerings separately. After the music was played,

Respectfully Reading the Sacrificial Text

The sacrificial text read: "On the 5th day of the 4th month of the year Jia Shen, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, the Mayor of Shanghai Special City, together with his staff, reverently offer flowers and clear wine to the Most Sacred Teacher Confucius, saying: O Teacher, your laws are eternal, your way surpasses all kings, your virtue is united with heaven and earth, your brightness is the same as the sun and moon. You gathered the great achievements of sacred learning, truly unprecedented for the people. Your way lies in loyalty and reciprocity, adapting to the times, passing on the sixteen-character legacy, opening up thousands of years of culture. The sounds of bells and drums fill the halls, harmonious and elegant songs illuminate the grand ceremony. Now, at this spring sacrifice, we respectfully prepare the ritual, and together with our subordinates, express our admiration. The spring breeze warms all things, like your kindness in nurturing and educating. The rain of transformation knows the time, offering a song of harmony and praise. We respectfully follow the rituals to honor the Resurgent Yan Hui, the Ancestral Sage Zeng Shen, the Transmitter Sage Zisi, and the Second Sage Mencius, and hope that our offerings will resonate." Then, Secretary-General Wu gave a speech.

Chief Celebrant's Speech

City Government Secretary-General Wu, representing Mayor Chen, presided over the ceremony and gave a speech, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Shanghai Special City Government is holding a spring sacrifice to the Most Sacred Confucius. I am greatly honored to represent the Mayor in participating in this ceremony. The greatness of Confucius is something that you all already know. I would like to briefly describe my feelings as follows: Confucius's doctrines are unchanging throughout the ages, unlike general philosophies of society. I have also studied ordinary philosophy, and it is only suitable for the time of its creation, unlike the teachings of Confucius, which have been passed down for a long time, remaining unchanged for thousands of years. As far as I know, the thoughts and personalities of many great people in the world are inconsistent, but Confucius's teachings are united with his personality. Confucius's knowledge has permeated modern national organizations. We know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are based on Confucius's teachings. It can be seen that the teachings of Confucius, thousands of years ago, contain profound truths." Finally, after singing the Confucius Memorial Song, a photo was taken, and the ceremony concluded with the sound of music.

### Pacific Operations: Enemy's Absurd Propaganda; Minister Matsushima Reports His Views

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox claimed on the 31st of last month that the U.S. had more than 50 aircraft carriers participating in Pacific operations. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 2nd, U.S. naval task forces had fiercely attacked the Caroline Islands. Their exaggerated propaganda has long lost credibility both internally and externally. Therefore, the eyes and ears of the world are focused on the true situation of the Pacific war. On the 4th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that six enemy ships had been sunk or destroyed south of the Caroline Islands, completely shattering the enemy's fabricated propaganda. Commander Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China shared his views yesterday (the 5th) as follows:

Enemy Fighting Strength Is Extremely Weak

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox boasted that 50 aircraft carriers had been dispatched to the Pacific. However, most of the aircraft carriers currently used by the U.S. Navy are rapidly built auxiliary carriers with extremely weak combat power. Since the end of March, the U.S. mobile forces seem to have deployed a considerable force for a counterattack in the Western Caroline Islands. The first day of this battle was a very difficult night battle, after which there were repeated night air battles between the two sides. The actual results achieved by our side are probably more than what was announced by the Imperial Headquarters. Therefore, the enemy's reports have often been relatively subdued, especially regarding the damage to ships, which has been kept secret. The reason why the enemy has repeatedly carried out this unreasonable counteroffensive operation before its war preparations are fully completed is to rapidly advance its air bases in the South Pacific and gain a foothold in the Philippines or China. This would extend the dying life of the Chongqing government, at the same time cutting off the transportation lines between the Japanese mainland and the South Seas, disrupting the unity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Decisive Battle Opportunity Gradually Matures

Why is the enemy so anxious? It is because the communication of the anti-Axis camp is deteriorating, especially due to the extremely tense domestic situation in the United States. However, on the one hand, the enemy's use of the land bases of the Marshall and Atmiralty Islands, or driving the mobile force, in an attempt to break into our inner defense line, cannot be ignored in the progress of the war. The enemy will use all means to get closer to our homeland defense line, and we must not neglect to be vigilant against this. In order to deal with this counteroffensive by the enemy, preparations for the decisive battle of the frontline air force and fleet are being strengthened day by day. The timing of the decisive battle has gradually matured. The intense skirmishes that are being repeatedly conducted now are actually the prelude to the formal naval battle. During this period, our side must also be prepared to endure considerable losses, because bold tactics are necessary to achieve the final goal. It is hoped that the people of the Axis powers, especially the people of the Greater East Asia countries, should not be misled by the enemy's recklessness, but should always maintain a calm mind, work hard to enhance their combat power, and not miss the good opportunity to destroy Britain and the United States. This is of utmost importance.

### German Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Lautenschlager, Passed Away

Buried Yesterday in Hongqiao Cemetery

Dr. Sv．Lauten．Schloger, the Consul in the German Consulate General in Shanghai, had served in the German diplomatic service for many years and was highly respected. He was transferred to Shanghai a few years ago to assume his current position. Consul Lautenschlager was deeply talented and erudite, and treated people with kindness and affability. He made great contributions to promoting Sino-German relations. Unfortunately, he passed away on April 2nd due to a minor illness, which was deeply mourned by all who heard of it. Mr. Lautenschlager's remains were buried at the Hongqiao Cemetery on Hongqiao Road at 3 p.m. yesterday. Local Chinese officials, as well as officials from friendly countries and German expatriates, went to pay their respects and lay wreaths in an endless stream. The funeral procession was solemn and grand.

### A Police Station's Baojia Office Announces Claim of Citizen Certificates

The Baojia Office of the First Police Station of this city has successively received many citizen certificates found in mailboxes by the post office. They have now been handed over to the Baojia sections of the respective branch bureaus for safekeeping. Any citizen who has lost their citizen certificate can go to the Baojia section of the respective branch bureau in person to apply for its return, without any fees.

### Zhabei Household Coal Balls Will Be Issued Starting Tomorrow

The Economic Bureau of this city has decided to start selling the second phase of household coal balls in Zhabei, District 3, starting tomorrow (7th) and ending on the 17th. Citizens can purchase them at designated retail stores with their certificates. Each person is entitled to fifteen catties, priced at eight yuan and forty cents. Failure to collect them within the deadline will be considered a waiver, and no reissuance will be made.

### New Residence Permits in the Western District Will Be Reissued as Scheduled

After the Baojia sections in the two districts of West Shanghai, Changning and Huashan, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Baojia Office of the First Police Station of this city, the West District Office was established, and the reorganization of the Lianbao was completed earlier. It is now learned that the household registration investigation in the Western District has also been meticulously handled by the office, and most of it has been completed. Therefore, it has been decided that the reissuance of new residence permits in the Western District will begin on the 10th of this month.

### Group A Football League Nears Conclusion; Donghua Wins the Championship

The Match Against the First Police Team Is Insignificant to the Overall Situation

The Group A Football League is nearing its end. Donghua has won all nine matches and has already won the championship. Only the match between Donghua and the First Police Team remains, and the outcome is no longer significant to the overall situation. Because Lianyi withdrew, the First Police Team is expected to win the second place. The Portuguese Merchants team is currently ranked fourth, but they still have two matches against the Three Provinces team, which they are sure to win, so the team should be able to surpass the Overseas Chinese Association and rank third. The Jewish team is fifth, and the Three Provinces team is at the bottom. In addition to the Portuguese Merchants team's match against the Three Provinces team this week, there are only two matches left in this group, and it will all be completed. The Group B and C matches will also end soon. After that, various cup matches will begin. Also, because the Shanghai United Stadium suffered heavy losses in the match between Donghua and the Overseas Chinese Association last week, it will be difficult to hold matches there again, so they are trying to find a solution. Here is a record of the Group A situation:

In the first game of Group A, the ever-victorious Zhongbei will face the All-Stars. The All-Stars are a newly formed team, and their strength is still far from Zhongbei.

### Emergency Increase in Cotton Production

The Executive Yuan passed the emergency cotton production plan on April 4th. The draft was based on the opinions jointly reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee. It must be thorough and meticulous and in line with implementation, which is undoubtedly. We don't need to discuss how to urgently increase cotton production any further.

What we want to say is that after the emergency cotton production plan is passed, it must be implemented without delay. After implementation, we must actively seek to establish close links with the textile industry to promote a high degree of cotton cloth production.

On the eve of cotton cloth rationing, we must reiterate the cotton cloth rationing system, that is, the centralized rationing and sale of cotton cloth must not hinder the needs of the people while adapting to the needs of the military. Therefore, cotton cloth rationing must be made popular among the people. However, to make comprehensive rationing not a problem, we can only start from promoting a high degree of cotton cloth production. Therefore, the textile industry in the emergency increase in cotton production must be comprehensively adjusted and strengthened. Large-scale textile companies and small-scale yarn weaving factories should be supported and nurtured equally, based on their capital, labor, and equipment. There are the most small-scale factories scattered throughout the interior, so based on the principle of "gathering axillary fur into a robe," those small factories that feel a lack of machinery should find ways to use the machinery of large-scale textile companies that have stopped working due to power restrictions and move it to small factories. In addition, there must be a comprehensive adjustment plan for the supply of raw materials, capital, and labor. Only in this way can the planned expansion of cotton cloth production after the emergency increase in cotton production be guaranteed, and the rational supply of cotton cloth rationing can be expected.

Children's Day Special Issue 3

### Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center: Great Performance for Children's Day

The initiator of Children's Day - the China Ciyou Association, held a warm celebration ceremony at the Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center on Daxing Road, which it independently manages, on this year's 13th Children's Day, and also featured stage plays and operas such as "Female Shi Hui."

At 3 p.m., the courtyard and rooms were filled with cheerful guests and boys and girls. Most of the guests were donors and sponsors. They were so happy to see the lively, healthy, and intelligent children they sponsored, to see the children wearing neat scout uniforms, special boat-shaped hats, and happily and respectfully saluting the guests and visitors!

The celebration began, and there was no room left in the guest seating. How lively! The children, led by the "small orchestra," entered the arena in formation.

Unparalleled Warmth and Excitement

"We celebrate today with unparalleled warmth and excitement, celebrating the Children's Day of the Republic of China," said the young chairman, Zhang Yuehua, a graduate of the school. Her fluent Mandarin caused the Zhen of all the guests in the hospital. The young chairman emphasized the glorious significance that the China Ciyou Association presented to the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China to designate April 4th of each year as Children's Day and was finally approved in the 21st year and officially stipulated. She pointed out the special significance of celebrating Children's Day in the Shanghai Ciyou Hospital, which is hosted by the China Ciyou Association.

Old Kang's Face Was Crimson

The opening speech of the young chairman made the current chairman of the hospital, Lin Kanghou Guangsheng, so happy that his face was crimson and he couldn't stop smiling. He went on stage to let Yang Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center know about the great success of cultivating talents. He said that it is a very difficult thing to rescue and educate children in distress, and it is a great joy to be able to cultivate a few talents like scooping gold from the sand. However, the hospital has selected countless pearls and diamonds from the sand for decades and has refined every grain of rough sand into white gold! His words moved the whole hospital even more, and many benefactors increased the amount of their recognition and sponsorship on the spot!

The program began. The Children's Day song concert with the "small orchestra" accompaniment, the singing expressions of "Little Soldiers" and "Confused King," the singing of "Cultivation," the singing expressions of "Cat and Sparrow" and "Doll Sick," and the singing of "Patriotic March" did not seem like children's performances but rather a grand performance by a music academy. In particular, the performances of the stage plays "Walking," "Salvation," and "Oppression," whether in terms of consciousness, performance, effect, or scenery and props, were not inferior to those of a large theater troupe. The success of several child actors, such as Wang Youpu and Zhang Yuehua, far surpassed the performances of ordinary theater troupes. No wonder everyone called Zhang Xiao as "Female Shi Hui."

Although the "Stacking Arhats" section of the performance was a common physical education performance, the agile movements, strong physique, neat clothing, and happy spirit, every small, red, rounded face, gave people such a lovely and pleasing impression!

During the performance, the doorbell kept ringing, and donations from philanthropists from all walks of life were sent, especially the donations from industrialists Ding Boque, Pan Bohua, and Jiang Shengju, etc., were the most numerous, with carts of toys, stationery, and various kinds of goods. Today, Mr. Ding also came to participate in the celebration with his wife and daughter despite his illness. He not only sponsors several orphans, but also communicates with the children from time to time. Mr. Pan is busy with business, but he is also prepared to assist the hospital in expanding its educational and care business for the benefit of the country and the nation.

The person in charge of education and care, Director Yao and Mr. Zhang, etc., talked about the fact that the education and care of distressed children still needs greater support from all parties. It is said that the China Ciyou Association has raised more than one million yuan in donations since the 15th of last month to today, which is still far from the goal of two million yuan. They said that each sponsorship of a child costs about 500 yuan per month, which is only 6,000 yuan per year. After the sponsorship, the child is like your own child, and achievement reports and health reports are sent on a regular basis. For the sake of the children, for the sake of the community and the country, I hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will do more good deeds!

### Xin Puyu Hall Receipt Report

Mr. Zhang Zhenxiang sent a letter saying: "For the full moon of my son, I have received congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, and I have converted them into cash to make up 10,000 yuan. Now I send the money and ask you to transfer 4,000 yuan to Xin Puyu Hall, 3,000 yuan to the Nursery Hall, and 3,000 yuan to the midwifery fund."

Miao Jechen 100 yuan, Chen Rongfang Laoer Yao Wu Hui 3,806 yuan.

### Two Children's Homes: Combining Work and Study, Engaging Both Hands and Brain

First Home

On the playground of the First Children's Home, many children in matching uniforms are sunbathing or playing. This place has only one large hall, which is very spacious and divided into several rooms, such as classrooms, offices, a shoe-making department, a carpentry department, a workshop, and dormitories. A pile of wheat is stacked at the head of the hall, which is one of their staple foods. Next to it is a large millstone. The children in the home use their spare time after class and work to grind flour and make porridge for themselves, which is both exercise and production! In the kitchen at the back, many children are chopping grass, washing dishes, or doing other chores. They manage their own meals.

They wash their own clothes and make their own clothes without relying on others! There is a clothing department in the home. Anyone who likes this work, and passes the teachers' evaluation, proving they are indeed suited to the work, can start learning. This department is supervised by a woman in her thirties, and there are more than a dozen students learning. Because there are too many, they are divided into morning and afternoon shifts. Two students have already completed their coursework and can cut and sew on their own. Some can even operate sewing machines and have been introduced to underwear factories for employment. The clothing department also accepts outside work. When I entered, there was a purple cheongsam on the table that was not yet completed. In this way, they can earn two or three thousand yuan per month. But if you ask about the capital when they "opened shop"? You might find it very amusing: only five silver dollars. Indeed, five years ago, five dollars was enough to buy some scissors, rulers, thread, needles, and so on.

They also produce leather shoes. Although the students cannot make a complete shoe on their own yet, each shoe contains some of their hard work and participation. Some shops come here to wholesale or place orders! This place also makes several thousand in profit each month. The opening fee was only fifty yuan, which was used to buy shoe lasts, knives, hammers, hemp twine, nails, and the like. A cobbler teaches the children. The instructor of the carpentry department is naturally a carpenter! It didn't cost a penny to start. The plane, saw, hammer, pliers, etc., were all brought by the teacher, and his students learned with their bare hands.

They combine work and study, using both hands and brains. This is the trend towards an ideal society where the boundaries between mental and manual labor are eliminated, and the distorted phenomenon of mental laborers ruling over manual laborers will never be seen again! The actual situation of studying is the same as ordinary primary schools, divided into six grades with a six-level compound teaching system. They learn Chinese, mathematics, and general knowledge. Foreign languages ​​are temporarily postponed. Some sixth-graders will enter middle school next semester.

The expenses of this First Home are currently no less than 600,000 per year. However, only a few staff members are running around to raise the money. This requires the assistance of all sectors of society. They also hope to raise more funds to accommodate more poor children.

Second Home

The Second Children's Home is located on the quiet Nanshi Theater Road. Its surroundings are desolate, with broken tiles and collapsed walls everywhere. The playground is very large, overgrown with weeds. Groups of three to five children in new uniforms are running happily, enjoying their annual Children's Day.

In a building near the playground, there is a reception room, teachers' dormitories, and a girls' dormitory. A very large room is sparsely furnished with only a few single iron beds. The bedding is neatly arranged. There is also a medical room here. A female doctor treats them for scabies, trachoma, dysentery, tooth diseases, and other ailments. Due to the temporary lack of equipment and the high cost of medicine, they are often helpless and unable to make the children completely healthy.

Broad beans are blooming with small purple flowers, releasing a faint fragrance. This is the children's own vegetable garden. They will soon be able to eat the fruits they have planted. In this vegetable garden, there is a brick-paved path. After walking along this long path, there is a row of houses, which are classrooms, boys' dormitories, dining hall, and kitchen. The kitchen is spacious, but very dilapidated. Inside, there are three or four large jars filled with pickled cabbage, and a lot of coal is piled up, which is their current fuel. Their diet is also very austere. They often eat vegetarian food, with meat only once a month. They have porridge twice a day, and rice once, accompanied by coarse grains. The dining hall consists of two large rooms, with long tables and long benches inside. It is quiet and empty. The desks and other items in the classrooms are a bit old, but still neat. They are repaired by the children themselves! Four or five children are gathered together, reviewing their lessons. The walls are covered with examples of calligraphy in large and small characters, and compositions. Upstairs is the boys' dormitory. The rooms are even more spacious, with only five or six people occupying a large room. However, there are no beds here; they sleep on straw mats laid on the floor with some bedding on top. Of course, this is much better than sleeping in an attic.

This house can accommodate another two or three hundred poor children. However, due to insufficient funding and the problem of food, it cannot expand its work. Here, I not only loudly appeal to people from all walks of life to donate money, medicine, books, school supplies, etc., to the home, but also hope that the authorities will increase the number of rations of rice, cloth, and coal briquettes for orphans and poor children. This is truly a matter of urgency!
