### Promoting the Consumption of Coarse Grains

Recently, the black market price of rice has entered a state of stagnation. Even if it doesn't rise again, the current price poses a threat that is difficult for the average citizen, especially those in the salaried class, to cope with. The fluctuation of rice prices has continued for two weeks. During this period, most wealthy families either have stored grain or have not yet suffered directly from the high price of rice. However, ordinary households do not have more than a week's worth of stored grain. Therefore, the three meals a day from now on will be completely dependent on the current high-priced rice. The income of the salaried class is generally only three to five thousand yuan. What they earn in a month can only be exchanged for three to five "dou" (a unit of dry measure) of rice. How can they support their family life? How can they get through the years ahead?

Seven out of ten reasons for the high black market price of rice are man-made. The actual cost for farmers should not exceed three thousand yuan per "dan" (another unit of dry measure). What is most regrettable is that after the government announced the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" on May 24th, it did not simultaneously stipulate the maximum price for rice in the producing areas. This gave unscrupulous rice merchants in various localities the opportunity to speculate and make exorbitant profits by taking the opportunity to raise prices. The original intention of the government authorities was to fully consider the interests of the hard-working farmers by adding reasonable profits based on actual costs. Unexpectedly, the amount of rice stored in the rice-producing areas was actually more in the hands of rice merchants than farmers. Unscrupulous rice merchants took the opportunity to succeed. Therefore, once the government announced the new measures, they raised prices wildly. In the case of our city, they colluded with unscrupulous rice merchants in the producing areas, echoed each other, and exhausted their ability to speculate and make exorbitant profits. The black market skyrocketed and became uncontrollable. After verifying the evidence against these speculators who only care about private interests, they should be immediately punished with wartime capital punishment as a warning to those who come after.

For the present plan, on the positive side, we have repeatedly suggested countermeasures to dredge the sources of supply in order to stabilize rice prices. On the negative side, we must promote the consumption of coarse grains to reduce the need for rice. In terms of nutritional value, coarse grains are better than white rice. In many non-rice-producing areas, people who use coarse grains as their daily food generally have stronger physiques. For example, corn and naked barley can be ground into flour for cooking rice. Shanghai people call corn flour "six-grain flour" and think it is food for livestock. However, in the areas of Jiangbei that specialize in corn production, people use it as a regular food from July to April of the following year, relying on it for a living for three years out of the year. The method of making rice is to grind corn into flour, grind and sift it evenly two or three times, the flour is extremely fine, mix it in boiling water, and it will mature into rice in a short while. It is originally very fragrant and delicious. If you mix two to five percent of it with white rice, it will be even more fragrant and suitable. If you eat the same amount of corn flour rice compared to white rice rice, corn flour rice is more filling. Secondly, naked barley is also one of the main types of coarse grains. From April to July every year, it is also a regular food for people in the producing areas, and it can also be ground into flour for cooking rice. Wheat ground into flour can only be used as noodle food and cannot be cooked as rice. Southern people are not accustomed to noodle meals every meal, so the application of naked barley is actually greater than wheat. Rice-producing areas originally use rice as a regular food. Most of Central and Southern China are rice-producing areas, so they do not know the value of corn and naked barley, and even look down on them as used for livestock. Now the environment is changing and white rice is difficult to obtain. We hope that Shanghai citizens will pay attention to the equal value of coarse grains and eat them together. We hope that the authorities will purchase coarse grains such as corn on a large scale and distribute them as flour in place of rice. However, when purchasing, you must pay attention to dryness and cleanliness, and do not allow adulteration with water or mildew. When grinding flour, you must strive for fineness to maintain the value of corn flour as a food and arouse the interest and habit of citizens to eat it together. In this way, the degree of demand for white rice can be reduced, and there can be more ways to regulate food for the people.

Finally, I hope that the municipal authorities will promptly organize price stabilization, and implement it at the same time as coarse grain distribution, so that the grain price will receive real pressure and gradually return.

### National Schools' Funding Will Be Issued According to the New Budget Education Ministry Stipulates Measures to Increase Tuition Fees

The process of discontinuing National Chekiang University and the closing method. Since the restoration of National Chekiang University, the school buildings have not yet been recovered, making it difficult to purchase them. The equipment is simple and crude, and there is also a lack of professors and talents in various departments. Very few students apply for admission. Under the current situation, there is really no need for the school to exist. The Ministry has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order the discontinuation. The students who pass the exams in the current semester will be given priority for admission so that they can continue their studies. The closing methods are roughly as follows: (A) The existing faculty and staff of the school will be placed by the Ministry or introduced to other universities to take up teaching positions. (B) The school will hold the semester exams ahead of schedule this semester, and all students who pass the exams will be given a certificate of study by the school so that they can transfer to other universities. In addition, the Ministry will issue an order to the national universities in Beijing and Shanghai to give priority to admission. (C) All the school's assets will be received and kept by the Education Department of Chekiang Province for disposal. (D) The school should be completely closed before June 15th of this year and reported for record. Readjustments of matters relating to students studying in Japan. Recently, in order to adapt to the wartime environment, friendly countries have agreed with the Ministry to stipulate that the number of students studying in Japan in the Huazhong area this year will be limited to fifty, in addition to the 25 subsidized by the Greater East Asia Ministry. The Ministry has already informed the provincial and municipal governments to order the education departments and bureaus to comply with this and has published a public announcement in the newspaper. Planning and compiling the National Calendar of the Republic of China for 1934.

Of these, 150 students will be funded by the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, and 183 will be funded by Chinese public and private funds. It is learned that these students studying in Japan will take academic examinations in various provinces and special municipalities in early August and then go to Japan in mid-September.

### Braving Heavy Artillery Fire from Mount Yuelu Japanese Troops Surround Changsha City

Hankou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese troops, in the general offensive against Changsha, braved heavy artillery fire from the Chongqing troops' artillery positions on Mount Yuelu and pressed towards Changsha. On the morning of the 17th, they crossed the Yuehan Railway, attacked the southern side of Changsha, and occupied a corner of it. Since the Japanese army carried out the first and second Changsha operations, the Chongqing army has built solid defensive positions in the area, making it a major fortress. The Chongqing army's resistance is extremely tenacious. However, the Japanese troops continue to attack fiercely, and the hardship is beyond description. Fierce street fighting is currently taking place in Changsha City.

(Another dispatch) The Japanese troops attacking Changsha broke into the city wall in the southeast corner of Changsha City at 8 a.m. on the 18th. The Japanese army has completely surrounded the city for eight kilometers, so the situation of the Chongqing 4th Army, 2nd Division is in imminent danger. The Chongqing army continues to provide stubborn cover with artillery fire from Mount Yuelu and its east side Tianma Mountain artillery positions. However, with the cooperation of the Japanese ground troops and Japanese aircraft, the airspace over Changsha has been completely suppressed, and the Chongqing army positions are bombarded with huge shells. The Changsha battle for defense has reached its climax.

Japanese Army Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The advanced troops of the Japanese Central China Army have now reached the outer city of Changsha, the Chongqing 4th Army's base. On the night of the 14th, the Japanese army first occupied the strong first-line position of the Chongqing army led by Ma Jingchuan on the Yuelu Mountain side of the Changsha River. At the same time, other troops also attacked and occupied the Chongqing army's first-line position on the south side of Yuelu Mountain in the early morning of the 16th, braving the rain. Later, on the evening of the same day, they occupied the forward position guarding the outside of Changsha City. The Chongqing 4th Army, which is currently defending Changsha, includes four divisions, including the 96th Division and the Provisional 54th Division. They have built heavy artillery positions and mountain artillery positions based on the natural terrain, as well as a defensive embankment known as the "iron wall," attempting to defend Changsha to the death. Changsha, an important stronghold in the Chongqing 9th War Zone, has been under the third Japanese operation since the Changsha operation in January of the year before last and is now within the scope of the Japanese army. The sound of artillery is deafening, and the two sides are engaged in fierce fighting.

Fierce Attack on Tianma Mountain

Hunan Japanese Army Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Changsha, the largest stronghold in the 9th War Zone, is now completely surrounded. Although the Chongqing 4th Army wants to break through the Japanese army's encirclement, it is desperately resisting, but the Japanese army is bravely advancing through the Chongqing army's machine guns and mountain artillery fire on Tianma Mountain, the outpost position of Yuelu Mountain. Tianma Mountain is located on the opposite bank of the southern end of Changsha City, a hill with an elevation of 167 meters and a circumference of 2.5 kilometers, forming the outer perimeter position of Yuelu Mountain. Attacking from the south of Changsha, overlooking the Japanese army, it can be seen at a glance, making it a strategically advantageous point for the enemy. The capture of Tianma Mountain can control Changsha's lifeline. Under the joint efforts of the elite Japanese air and ground forces, the final fierce attack on the mountain has begun.

Advising the Chongqing Army in the City to Ceasefire

Japanese Army Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) Before launching the attack on the Chongqing 4th Army, the Japanese army, in order to avoid war damage to Changsha City, preserve the scenic spots and historic sites, and avoid harming innocent civilians, has been distributing leaflets by aircraft since the 17th, advising the Chongqing army in the city to cease fire. Before the Japanese army operated in Henan, it could not bear to see the ancient capital of Luoyang suffer war damage, and it had previously endured operational disadvantages. Now it is taking such just measures for Changsha again.

The Chongqing Army's Retreat Route Has Been Cut Off

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan front is as follows: The Japanese army has circled around to the east of Changsha and is advancing fiercely. It is currently attacking Lukou Station (a key point where the Yuehan Railway and Xianggui Railway connect, closest to Hengyang). The Chongqing Military Commission has announced that it is continuing to fight north of Lukou. Although Changsha is still in the hands of the Chongqing army, the retreat route from the city has been cut off by the Japanese army, so the Chongqing army defending the city is in despair.

Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bombard Chongqing Army Base

Japanese Army Base in China, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to thoroughly eliminate the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the Japanese bomber squadrons divided into two teams and launched a surprise attack on Yushan Airfield in Jiangxi Province and Lishui Airfield in Zhejiang Province at 1:50 p.m. on the 17th, bombing the runways and affiliated military facilities, rendering them unusable for a time. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.

Downed and Destroyed Many U.S. Aircraft

Hankou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The new Japanese air force has launched a large-scale bombing campaign in order to eliminate the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and cover the Japanese army's advance. On the 17th, it also attacked Changsha, the Chongqing army's base, and encountered seven Chongqing and U.S. fighters, including Kazis P40 and P51 aircraft, over Changsha. They immediately engaged in an aerial battle and shot down one P40 aircraft and heavily damaged one aircraft.

Anqing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) At 10 p.m. on the 18th, more than a dozen enemy fighter-bombers, composed of enemy P38 and P25 aircraft, attacked Anqing. However, after being intercepted by the Japanese fighter squadron, five of the enemy P8 aircraft were shot down (one of which was confirmed), and two were completely destroyed. The Japanese army suffered no damage in this battle.

### Southern Local Chieftains Cooperate with the Japanese Army and Voluntarily Increase Production

Balikpapan, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) When the Japanese army entered Tarakan and Balikpapan in South Borneo, the first local chieftain of Borneo, Tengarun Hou, and other local chieftains quickly went to Balikpapan to express the natives' determination to pledge allegiance to Japan. When the Netherlands was in power, they were deprived of all education from their hands and squeezed to an unlimited extent. They could only endure and pray for the arrival of a god of salvation. At this time, the Japanese army suddenly descended before them, shattering the Dutch forces in one fell swoop. Therefore, they were all extremely excited. In the more than two years of military administration that followed, they promoted their education in order to make them self-sufficient in food and clothing, and did not hesitate to give them any assistance. Japan has never had the oppression and racial prejudice of the British, Americans, and Dutch against other nations, and always uses deep sincerity to guide them to develop upward. Therefore, Tengarun Hou and Bulungan Hou are now extremely grateful for Japan's gentle guidance and are cooperating with the Japanese army to complete the Greater East Asia War. The local chieftains are also working with the natives to develop war resources and increase production.

### Ruthless Judgment

— Hermit of Jiangnan

Recently, Britain and the United States have been unsparingly attacking Chongqing, criticizing it for being unmodern, lacking power, not inclined to democratization, and lacking internal unity. On the other hand, Wallace, as the U.S. Vice President, was sent to Chongqing. The United States has also signed a new credit agreement with Chongqing, promising to increase assistance under the Lend-Lease Act. Britain has also followed suit, praising Chongqing as "one of the four powers." She also used a cleverer way, pointing out the nature of the many faults of feudal Chongqing without saying much, which is precisely what makes Chongqing a powerful factor. These are all the means of "coercion" and "inducement" that Britain and the United States have habitually used against Chongqing.

However, the Soviet magazine "War and the Working Class," published this month in Moscow, examined and analyzed Chongqing's resistance, and immediately criticized: "Chongqing's elite troops suffered the greatest defeat in the Henan campaign. The Chongqing authorities used the backwardness of China's economy, the lack of military equipment, and the inadequacy of British and American military assistance as reasons to explain this disastrous failure. Many plans have been drafted in the anti-Japanese war zone, but none of them are for building the military and industrial foundations of Chongqing." Chongqing's Kuomintang recently held a secret 12th plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, passing a plan for revival, and this criticism was published after it was disclosed by the Chongqing Standing Committee.

The magazine also stated in another section: "There is a strong tendency of defeatism among Chongqing officials. In the past two years, twenty commanders have led their soldiers to join the peace camp. Seeing this, it is not surprising that the Chongqing army was defeated in Henan. Under the current situation in Chongqing, there is a reason for it."

After the Henan campaign, fierce battles broke out near Changsha, Hunan, and the Chongqing army retreated steadily. But as the magazine pointed out: The military defeat, "Under the current situation in Chongqing, there is a reason for it," so that result was expected.

This detailed analysis by the Soviet magazine is completely different from the "coercion and inducement" policy of Britain and the United States. Its observation is realistic. The criticism of Chongqing by Britain and the United States is to drive Chongqing to fight to the end for its war and political interests. On the contrary, the criticism of the Soviet publications, purely from the perspective of a third party, pointed out the mistakes of Chongqing. We do not want to say much about the analysis made by "War and the Working Class," but we want to point out that when the world war has progressed to a decisive stage, and this word is spoken by the Soviet publications, it is really a sharp stab straight into the heart of Chongqing. In the early days of Chongqing's resistance, the Soviet Union praised Chongqing as a hero, sometimes even with a legendary color. We ask the Soviet Union to recall that scene once again.

"War and the Working Class" was founded in June of last year. Since that time, only two articles in the magazine have involved Chongqing. The first was written by Loguf, a sharp news reporter who was a Shanghai correspondent for TASS. The article was published last August and discussed Chongqing's resistance strength. The second is the one mentioned above. These two articles did not unexpectedly relax their fists for the defeated fighters, nor did they show the tendency observed by the Moscow publications in the early days of Chongqing's resistance. What is the reason?

Along this line, it is not difficult to gradually resolve the rights of Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East and the border incidents in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang Province. In an essay commenting on the Japan-Soviet fishery treaty, the magazine said: "We must note that the conclusion of this treaty clearly indicates that the two countries are willing to abide by the spirit of the neutrality treaty and resolve all major issues between the two countries equally." This remark should be noted by Chongqing's supporters. Judging from the path Chongqing has taken, the Chongqing regime is meaningless to the Soviet Union. Although the Moscow Declaration has recognized Chongqing as one of the four powers, the Kremlin only regards Chongqing as a local regime.

The development of the war is progressing at an astonishing speed. At this time, a strong and fair neighbor makes this ruthless judgment on Chongqing, which was once listed as one of the four powers, which is what the pro-war elements in Chongqing should think deeply about.

### The Japanese Army Employs Clever Tactics in Northern Burma Chongqing Counterattack Fails on the Salween River Front

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Chongqing army on the Salween River front has lost a large number of soldiers and weapons, and its subsequent attacks have been in vain. The Japanese army's defense is as solid as an iron wall, and the Japanese army's operations are particularly clever, so the Chongqing army's attacks can only be met with failure and gain nothing. On the 10th of this month, the Chongqing army attempted to recapture the Longling area, and attacked with about two divisions. The Japanese army immediately counterattacked, forcing them to retreat eastward. The Japanese army also annihilated hundreds of Chongqing soldiers who attacked near the Datoujie area. In this battle, the Chongqing army left 233 bodies behind, and the Japanese army captured mortars, heavy machine guns, automatic rifles, and countless other military supplies. Also, at noon on the 14th, the Japanese army troops and the Chongqing troops attacking Jiangxuanjie engaged in a fierce artillery battle. The Chongqing mountain guns, field guns, etc., were all destroyed. The Chongqing army, which was collecting supplies airdropped, was also severely attacked, so the Chongqing army's attempt has vanished. At this time, the enemy in the Myitkyina area also launched an attack in response in order to seize the northern Burma position. However, new Japanese elites also arrived one after another. According to the battle results ascertained on the 12th, the enemy corpses alone numbered 2,500.

### Germany Attacks the Heart of Britain With New Weapons Emerging Endlessly British Authorities Urgently Seek to Reform Air Defense Institutions

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News: Another secret weapon of Germany may appear soon. German authorities said that after the German Meteor bombs have been constantly bombing London and Southern England, another new weapon will come out to assist. Seventy percent of the enemy troops currently invading Europe are Americans rather than British. However, the bombing of London by the German new weapon is precisely hitting the heart of Britain, and it is impossible to escape. London has announced the number of tons of bombs dropped on Germany every day. It is said that more than 50,000 tons of bombs have been dropped in Berlin alone. Germany will now repay them double. It is heard that the personnel releasing the meteor bombs have written the words "Revenge for Cologne" and "Retaliation for Berlin" on each bomb with powder.

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to London reports: The British government is deeply embarrassed by Germany's retaliatory attacks with unmanned aircraft and knows that the usual air defense organization is ineffective. It has decided to reform rapidly. It was announced on the evening of the 17th that the British Southern anti-aircraft gun teams should innovate their organization in order to intercept the German unmanned aircraft, and concentrate the maximum firepower to try to block them before the unmanned aircraft reach densely populated areas. It is heard that the unmanned aircraft have no ordinary aircraft accompanying them.

### Mysterious Weapon's Structure and Power

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News: Unmanned aircraft and meteor bombs were originally manufactured by a small number of workers. These workers have been isolated from the outside world for many months to prevent the leakage of secrets. These new weapons attacking London and Southern England have been effective, and are now being manufactured on a large scale.

Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German unmanned aircraft have plunged the British people into extreme terror. As for what they really are, the German military has declared that they are new types of explosive bodies of the largest caliber. A reporter from a Swiss newspaper reported that this rocket-type aircraft has the explosive power to destroy atoms. It is an automatic explosive bomb remotely controlled by radio waves, dropped from high altitudes, and fired at the target after hundreds of kilometers. This type of bomb has wings on both sides, and its appearance is very similar to an aircraft. The British newspapers are making all kinds of speculations about what it is. It is said that there are two shapes, one is about six to eight yards long with wings on both sides, and the other is slightly smaller than an ordinary fighter plane and similar to a free-style aircraft. Although its explosive power is still unknown, there are two possibilities due to the different methods of manipulation. One is that it is manually controlled by radio from a special aircraft in the rear, and the other is that it is fired by artillery from a base on the Atlantic coast, about 30 to 40 kilometers from the coast. How it is manipulated is still a question. What impact this automatic aircraft will have in this war is an important question. However, why did Germany not use this novel weapon earlier? Perhaps because of technical difficulties, or in view of the importance of the Normandy battle, it was used to exert strategic effects. If so, the German army will definitely supply it together with other weapons for a long time. The German government authorities issued a statement yesterday, asking that this kind of weapon is not for one or two demonstrations, and will continue to be used in combat operations in the future. This shows that the German military authorities have considerable confidence in the quality and quantity of this weapon.

### Enemy's All-Out Effort to Seize Cherbourg Meets Strong Resistance

 Allied Forces Landing on the West Coast of Cotentin

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): On the thirteenth day of the anti-Axis forces' landing in France, they have occupied some areas but have yet to secure a suitable base for advancing against German defense lines. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces are making every effort to seize major seaports. Having failed to capture Le Havre, they have no choice but to attack Cherbourg. The plan to take Cherbourg and cut off the Cotentin Peninsula is being launched simultaneously, but capturing Cherbourg will come at a heavy cost. General Bradley is fully engaged in the plan to cut off the peninsula. After reaching Vicomte on Friday, he used all of the American army's reserves the next day to continue the westward advance. Fierce fighting is currently underway, with the German army putting up strong resistance, but they are fighting with a relatively small number of troops. The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure on the Carentan-to-Périers highway, but progress is minimal. The left flank of the U.S. First Army launched an attack towards Saint-Lô between Ville and Torigni-sur-Vire the day before yesterday, but were met by German forces on the outskirts of the city and suffered a hasty retreat. The right flank of the British Second Army at Caumont and the left flank east of the Orne River are both adopting defensive positions, with troops east of Caumont having retreated to Livry. The British Second Army's central forces are attacking Tilly-sur-Seulles, but are also being blocked by German forces. There has been no change in the battle situation on the Tilly-sur-Seulles and Caen front.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): The anti-Axis headquarters announced that the anti-Axis spearhead forces have reached the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, near Barneville.

### German Forces Prepare to Defend Fortress to the Death

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): Well-informed sources here believe that it is not impossible for American forces from the Vicomte area to reach the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, as there are very few German troops stationed in that area. However, the general view is that even if the American forces reach the west coast, it will not affect the overall war situation, as there are no important transportation facilities in the area west of Vicomte. It has also been learned that a large army is stationed in the Cherbourg fortress, and it contains a large amount of military supplies and food, in case the area is cut off.

### Fierce Battle in the Suburbs of Saint-Lô

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): Authoritative sources state that the British newspapers' report last night that the anti-Axis spearhead had reached Saint-Lô is absolutely untrue. The enemy infantry division, under the cover of tanks, advanced to the suburbs of Saint-Lô but was repulsed by the German army back to its original position. In this battle alone, the American army suffered approximately one thousand casualties and one hundred were captured. The position is back in the hands of the army yesterday.

### Channel Fleet Activities Indicate New Landing Attempt

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to the latest reports from the Normandy front, the anti-Axis forces are currently preparing to launch a new landing operation somewhere, and it is reported that a large fleet of anti-Axis ships is cruising in the Normandy coastal area.

### Soviet General Promoted to Marshal

### Japanese Garrison Inflicts Damage on Enemy in the Torokina Area

Enemy Aircraft Attacking Rabaul Shot Down

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the South Pacific, enemy forces attacked the Torokina area of Bougainville Island at 9:00 a.m. on June 3rd. The Japanese garrison used hand grenades and engaged in combat for three hours, leaving fifty enemy corpses behind before the enemy retreated. On the 4th, another twenty enemies attacked, and the Japanese army killed five of them, repelling the attack.

### Enemy Landing on the Adriatic Coast Foiled

Pressure Increases on the Perugia Front

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The German authorities announced on the 18th that at dawn on the 16th, anti-government forces attempted to land between Ancona and Senigallia on the Adriatic coast with landing craft of 250 tons, fully loaded with small military trains and artillery. The German coastal defense forces immediately repelled them. On the 17th, the enemy forces attempted to land again with five pairs of landing craft, but one was sunk by German artillery, and the rest scattered.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): South of Lake Trasimeno in Italy, the American army deployed two tank divisions, exerting extremely heavy pressure. The enemy also attempted to break through towards Perugia but was repulsed. However, the enemy reinforced with more tanks, and it is expected that the fighting there will soon reach its peak. Lake Trasimeno, with an area of 129.6 square li, is the site of the meeting between Hannibal and the Roman Empire in 217 BC. As for the German army's right flank at the city of Grosseto, the withdrawal has been completed, and the American forces are advancing north from there.

### Trans-Celebes Highway Opens to Traffic

Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The trans-Celebes highway connecting North and South Celebes was opened to traffic on the 8th of this month. From now on, various materials will be continuously transported from Central Celebes. Although a certain area in the interior of the island was once isolated, it will now serve as a crucial hub for the collection and distribution of materials, centered on Central Celebes, since the completion of the road. The current situation there is as follows:

Industry: The production of both paddy rice and dry rice in the area can exceed self-sufficiency. Timber and livestock production are the leading industries. Before the war, the production of ebony was 250 tons and ironwood was 375 tons, with a total value of 270,000 guilders. Resources for exporting resins are also abundant. There are tens of thousands of livestock, including cattle, wild goats, and pigs. The aborigines have stated that if leather is needed, it can be supplied in large quantities locally. There is only one existing lumber mill. To actively enhance combat power, a new one, similar in size to the existing mill, is being built and is expected to be completed in September of this year. At the same time, it is planned to purchase a large number of circular saws, band saws, and other equipment. In addition, lumber mills operated by overseas Chinese are being mobilized to expand lumber production to three times the current amount. There are several existing shipbuilding docks, and all of the newly added ones will be completed by the end of this month.

### What I Saw on the Train

I boarded the train that departed from Songjiang at 8:50 PM. To observe the actual situation of rice transportation, I occupied the elevator entrance outside the carriage, keeping my eyes wide open, fearing that I might miss a person or a bag of rice. It was already dusk, and the station staff's flashlight flickered intermittently in the moonlight. Among the two second-class carriages, a news reporter stood watchfully, looking for material for his report. At this time, they, the small-scale traders, began to act quickly and boldly. From the opposite side of the platform, they were busy loading bag after bag of rice. I had just seen a man accepting rice bags by the carriage door when another man used that man's shoulders and head as a stepping stone, agilely climbing onto the roof of the carriage like an ape. He probably loaded about four bags of rice. Suddenly, the flashlight flashed. "It's already so crowded, there's no room for more people! And they're still going up!" the station staff said, walking away. I wanted to open the door to see the overall loading situation. I grabbed the handle and pulled, but with a creak, the door remained closed. There was a reason why it wouldn't open. It turned out that a child had hooked his body onto the door hinge on the steps of the entrance. This is my territory, and I won't let the enemy peek in. He was stubbornly guarding it along with the rice.

Suddenly, a woman in her thirties or forties carrying two bags of rice came over, stuffing a bag of about four dou (a unit of dry measure) of rice deep into the seat of the second-class carriage opposite, and then slipping into the second-class carriage herself. Later, the conductor discovered it, dragged it out, and asked, "Whose is this?" Everyone said, "I don't know." The conductor got angry and dragged the bags of rice outside the carriage. The man on the roof of the carriage happened to dangle his feet down, leisurely smoking a cigarette. "Ahem, you're really too reckless, rice thief!" The conductor tapped the man's feet with a small stick. The man quickly retracted his feet like a frog landing on land, quietly hiding his body. A feeling of mixed joy and sorrow welled up in the reporter's heart. "Today's work is 99% done, all that's left is to pay 30 yuan for luggage at the ticket office in Shanghai. Haha, I can make another profit!" He was probably thinking this with a smile in a safe place.

### What I Heard on the Train

I must report the real feeling of the rice train to the readers faithfully—

The reporter engaged in a verbal battle with a woman. Sparks flew from under the train, and the wheels rumbled. The man was a reporter, the woman was a rice trader; the reporter felt itchy in his heart.

"Do you have a ticket?" the reporter asked in awkward Shanghainese.

"Of course I do, sir. But even if I do, this is the border between second and third class, and the conductor might come and make a fuss, I'm really worried!" she said.

"Where are you going? How many dou did you buy?"

"To Fengjing, only three dou. She sat on one bag herself, and she let the reporter sit on the other bag. In the past, Mito Komon was happy to be hit by an old woman for sitting on a straw bag, but in the elevator entrance of the train, there was no one to hit the reporter. The reporter sat down peacefully and started talking to her about various things. Because I couldn't understand everything she said, I felt like I was entering a tiger's den without catching the tiger cubs. It was truly regrettable. The gist of her words was as follows:

"I started selling rice two months ago. My husband died in Ningbo after the incident, leaving behind two children, one twelve years old and the other eight years old, neither of whom have attended school. We have a total of five partners. If five or six people work together in this business, it's easier to take care of each other. Although the monthly income is said to be over 10,000 yuan, it's not actually that much, because we don't run every day, and even though the price of rice has gone up, the train fare and 'expenses' have also increased. So even though income has increased, expenses have also increased. At first, we only ran to Songjiang, but now we run to Fengjing, because rice is cheaper in Fengjing. The rice is bought from the rice shops in Fengjing. The rice shops buy from the farmers, and we buy from the rice shops. The rice shops are very shrewd, they only want to raise the price of rice. We can only make money if the price of rice in Shanghai is especially high and the price of rice in Fengjing is especially low. People in this world always want to make a profit for themselves. The most difficult thing is that there are fewer third-class carriages, so it's not easy to get on. And the railway company stipulates that riding without a ticket or riding second class with a third-class ticket will be fined ten times the fare, which is really difficult! But if you have money, it's okay to pay it. But if you take the rice to offset the fine, wouldn't that be too outrageous? We do this business out of necessity, wouldn't it be better if the railway didn't make a fuss? The biggest difficulty in this business is getting on the train. If it were easy to get on the train, there would definitely be more people running this business. Of course, I'm going again tomorrow."

She took out a cigarette and asked the reporter for a light. Her cigarette seemed to be a "three-gun" brand! The woman with a purplish-red face, smoking and talking about rice. This impression was too deep.

### Rice Thieves

The train arrived at Xujiahui. Many rice and people got off. It was the same at West Shanghai. Xujiahui, West Shanghai, and North Station, there were a total of about 500 people getting off at these three stations. The warriors on the roof of the carriage also climbed down from above when the train approached West Shanghai. His partners helped him down, one by one opening the top of the carriage. In addition to the bags of rice that were carried down, he was also wearing a "rice vest." Rice on his back, rice on his chest, truly a rice bulletproof vest. I think this big man was carrying a total of about two shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice.

At West Shanghai Station, a major incident suddenly occurred. Just as the reporter was chatting excitedly with the woman who was getting off at North Station, he suddenly heard a woman's laughter. Looking over there, it was a beautiful young girl, about eighteen or nineteen years old, nicely dressed, although she was crying very sadly, she did not lose her beauty. The conductor walked out of the carriage and ran into another second-class carriage. It seemed that a bad person had stolen four dou of rice that had been placed there, and had gotten off the train in Xujiahui with one foot first. The girl, crying, recounted the illegal behavior of the railway staff. Two young railway police officers and a man who seemed to be the conductor's assistant, seemed to have shown their manhood because of the beautiful girl's coquettish cries, and the three of them went to ask the Japanese conductor to come. The conductor came, but the lost item did not appear. The girl, full of anger, attacked the conductor. The conductor, unable to do anything, had no choice but to say "damn it," and adopted the Thirty-Six Stratagems and ran away in a state of disarray. The remaining three young men and the beautiful girl searched carefully in that area again, but the lost item was finally lost. The reporter couldn't help but think of the farmer at Songjiang Station who had lost 5,000 yuan and was sitting on the ground crying, "Alas, there are still five children at home, alas." This sick China! A deep and inexplicable feeling arose in the reporter's heart.

### The Waiting Crowd for Rice

When I walked out of the ticket office, the reporter thought that the material for describing the situation of transporting rice to Shanghai was finished. Little did I know that it was not over. Outside, a large crowd of another group of rice merchants was waiting to buy the rice brought by the rice traders. They were probably going to resell it to hoarders. There were many people, and they followed behind the returning rice traders, asking loudly, "Are you selling rice?"

From Songjiang to Shanghai, the reporter carefully observed the actual situation of rice being transported into Shanghai from the elevator entrance of the second-class carriage. But this was from the perspective of the second-class carriage, and it was the situation seen by a Japanese person. If a capable Chinese reporter were to enter the third-class carriage and observe with great detail, he would be able to deeply feel the importance of the rice policy. Even though twelve import points have been designated, the rice problem will only become more serious.

"The time for fighting has come!" After leaving North Station, the reporter felt that, before the success of the rice policy, the reporter's responsibility to write about rice had not been lifted from his pressing mood.

Now is the time we should pay attention to rice. (End) (Translation by Ji, from the June 12th "Mainland News" dispatch by Special Correspondent Takemoto)

### Municipal Advisory Committee Hosts Police Chiefs for Cordial Discussion on Police Duties and Compensation

Since its establishment, the Municipal Advisory Committee has been actively assisting the municipal government's work in various areas. Yesterday afternoon (the 19th) at 4:30 PM, the committee hosted senior officials from the city's First and Second Police Bureaus at the First District Public Office for a discussion on issues such as the duties and compensation of the city's police. Details are as follows:

### Officials from Both Bureaus

From the First Police Bureau, Deputy Bureau Chiefs Masao Watanabe and Chengde Su, Chief Secretary Rifu Sun, General Affairs Section Chief Ji Lin, Deputy Section Chiefs Nikko Nakano and Zhiliang Xue, Special Higher Police Section Chief and Economic Security Section Chief Shigeru Goshima, Deputy Section Chief Yunbo Yao, Administrative Section Chief Qi Lv, Deputy Section Chief Watanabe, Judicial Section Chief Shiyu Li, Deputy Section Chief Kenjiro Kan, Baojia Section Chief Wu Xian, Deputy Section Chief Mitsuharu Shigeta, Fire Department Chief Kiyomi Ide, Deputy Section Chiefs Guocan Xia and Longquan Chen, Police Section Chief Huimo Yao, Training Section Chief Kenkichi Ninomiya, and chiefs of the Huangpu, Laozha, Xinzha, Jing'an, Jiangning, Putuo, Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Xinshijie, Tilanqiao, Yulin, Yangshupu, Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu, Huashan, and Changning Branch Bureaus attended. From the Second Police Bureau, Chief Shao Jieren, Secretary Chief Yitang Shi, Section Chiefs Yuzhai Zhang, Benyuan Yao, Pei Chu, Chief Inspector Jisheng Chen, Shaosheng Zhu, Delin Wang, Inspection Section Chief Shaoyi Guo, Liang Chen, Police Brigade Chief Tingdong Wang, Detective Brigade Chief Qiutan Su, Water Patrol Brigade Chief Dianjia Zhang, and chiefs of the Municipal Center, Zhonghua Road, Xieqiao, Hubei, Yulin Road, Yimiao, Xujiahui, Zhabei, Dongchang Road, Yangsi, and Gaoqiao Branch Bureaus attended, totaling over one hundred people.

### Details of the Discussion

The Advisory Committee was represented by Standing Committee Director Sihao Li, Standing Committee members Kanghou Lin, Jinxian Zhao, Riping Chen, Benhe Chen, Kangyuan Xiang, and Kailiang Shen. Committee member Kanghou Lin presided over the meeting, which began promptly. First, Director Li explained that he was unable to attend due to illness and requested Lin to chair the meeting in his stead and report on the current status of the Advisory Committee's work. Lin then elaborated on the work of the Advisory Committee since its establishment and the purpose of inviting the attendees for discussion. Subsequently, Committee member Benhe Chen expressed his hope for future police-civilian cooperation and provided his views on improving police compensation and the Economic Security Section. Then, Deputy Bureau Chief Watanabe, Bureau Chief Fu, and Economic Security Section Chief Goshima successively expressed their aspirations to fulfill the police's natural duty of protecting the people and to do their utmost for local security. Finally, acting Chairman Lin expressed his gratitude on behalf of all the citizens to the chiefs of both police bureaus for their enthusiasm in defending the region. Tea and refreshments were then served to all attendees, and the gathering concluded amicably after two hours.

### Speech by Kanghou Lin

Kanghou Lin said in his speech: "We are holding a tea party today, and we are very grateful for the presence of senior officials from both bureaus. The main work of our committee has been disclosed in the newspapers. First, we discussed the issue of daily necessities, as well as issues such as finance, education, and rural security. Today's invitation to you is directly related to you, that is, the security issue that you all want to discuss. Although the Security Committee of our committee has not yet started work, we sincerely hope that the senior officials of the police bureau will cooperate with us, exchange ideas, and make Shanghai's security more substantial. This is the common desire of our committee and the police authorities. Secondly, since its establishment, our committee has been deeply concerned about the police's compensation and the current status of the work of the Economic Security Section, and hopes that all relevant officials will express their opinions. I recall that when I first met Deputy Bureau Chief Watanabe, I mentioned that the police in the West are best managed in Germany, and in the East, Japan is the most complete. Now, with the cooperation of Japanese police officers and our country's police officers in this city, we will be able to rival the police in Germany and Japan in the future. I also hope that we can meet often in the future and review each other. At the time of the Greater East Asia War, if security is poor, it will have a significant impact on the war. This is the first time we have hosted you, and we represent the people's sincere hope. Thank you for your hard work."

### Speech by Benhe Chen

Standing Committee member Benhe Chen said in his speech: "I firmly believe that you are very aware of the recent difficulties in the lives of the citizens of this city. At the same time, the citizens are also very concerned about the lives of the police. If the lives of the citizens are not stable, it will affect the security of the city. And if the lives of the police are not stable, they cannot concentrate on their duties, and security will not be on track. In March of this year, the First Police Bureau initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative, and so far, the funds borrowed from all sectors have exceeded 30 million yuan. Together with loans from the Central Reserve Bank, the China Hsing Bank, and the Fuxing Bank, the total will reach 40 million yuan. This proves that the citizens are willing to do their part to improve the lives of the police. Recently, we have repeatedly suggested to the municipal authorities that police funding must be fully increased from the next year onwards in order to completely resolve the issue of police living conditions. In the past, the 'patrolmen' managed by the British and Americans took an antagonistic attitude towards the citizens, and the citizens were afraid of them. I have been to Japan three times and witnessed that Japanese police officers treat the people kindly and show that the police and the people are like one family. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, senior Japanese police officers have participated in the police work of this city. We have high expectations that they will change the unreasonable situations of the past era of British and American rule. The police in this city really need to be retrained. Their service attitude and their loyalty to their duties should be thoroughly improved. To give an example, the Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and other places were originally guarded by the Japanese Navy. When we passed by, we always saw them standing at their posts and performing their duties. Now that the police are stationed there, we often don't see anyone at their posts, and they are even just standing there looking at the scenery, just like passers-by, abandoning their posts. Therefore, we hope that under the guidance of Japanese experts, they will be retrained to be loyal to their duties and improve their attitude. We deeply hope that the kind attitude of the police towards the people that we have seen in Japan will be universally realized in Shanghai. The police consumer cooperative was originally intended to improve the lives of the police. Therefore, the work of the cooperative should be based on two major principles: handling matters quickly and truly improving the lives of the police. We request that the municipal authorities fully allocate food to the police to ensure a stable life. The establishment of the Economic Security Section, with Mr. Goshima as the director, has greatly reassured the business community in this city, because Mr. Goshima is fair and honest and has always been respected by the business community. In the current environment in Shanghai, the establishment of the Economic Security Section is necessary. In the past, the establishment of economic and administrative organizations often had more drawbacks than benefits, or more drawbacks than benefits. We hope that the Economic Security Section will pay attention to this. We also have several expectations: First, fully protect legitimate merchants. Second, fully protect production factories. Third, respect the customs of the Chinese business community, especially the attitude when dealing with them. Fourth, severely punish profiteers who only care about their own interests. At the same time, not only should Chinese people be treated this way, but Japanese people, regardless of their relationship, should be treated equally. Finally, I can also report that the Advisory Committee is currently suggesting to the authorities that they change the food distribution method and give priority or increase the allocation to civil servants, police, security teams, transportation workers, production workers, and general laborers. For people who are unemployed and are not natives of Shanghai, the authorities will provide assistance to evacuate them back to their hometowns. Please pay special attention to the Baojia Section. The municipal government is raising funds to purchase rice and grains and is opening up rice shops. The above-mentioned personnel will be given priority at the shops.

### Statement by Supervisor Du Zheng

Deputy Director Du Zheng of the First Police Bureau stated, in summary: "I am honored to participate in this Municipal Government Settlement Inquiry Committee as a police executive. I have been working in Shanghai for three years, and during this time, I have witnessed the antagonism between the police under the management of the British and Americans in the past and the people. I have been making every effort to correct this and to ensure that the people and the police are united and cooperate. Furthermore, Shanghai used to be a city of terror, with criminals hiding, and frightening incidents occurring daily. Since the establishment of the Baojia system, and thanks to the cooperation of the people, public security has gradually improved. However, since the return of the Shanghai concessions to China, more than a year has passed. Unfortunately, the activities of some unscrupulous merchants have led to rising prices. Therefore, the most important task of the police is to ensure public security, and I hope that the people will cooperate to promote peaceful and prosperous lives. I see the current situation as similar to that of Japan during the Meiji Restoration forty years ago. At that time, the Japanese government hired police expert Mr. Henry to improve the domestic police system. Now, the Shanghai police are being assisted by Japanese personnel. Since I have been hired by the Chinese government, I should cooperate with Chinese police affairs to establish a new Chinese police system. This is my important responsibility. Next, I hope that in the future, the general public of this city will actively communicate, discuss, and make suggestions for the improvement of the police system. I am sure that the gentlemen of this committee, who are all prominent figures in this city, will be happy to support this. In addition, regarding the issue of improving the treatment and living conditions of the police, salaries have recently been increased by 60 percent. However, given the current high prices, we should find ways to provide affordable goods to the police. Regarding the police consumer cooperative, we have also received assistance from the Civic Welfare Association in securing funds, and we have already begun distributing daily necessities. We have purchased large quantities of rice from other regions to supply to the police officers and their families. Finally, we have also completed a comprehensive plan for Shanghai's public security."

### Statement by Lu Ying

Director Lu Ying of the Second Police Bureau stated, in summary: "The situations of the First Police Bureau and our bureau are different. Before the incident, the existence of the concessions led to various differences. However, even after the incident and the return of the concessions, although the names have been unified, there are still slight differences in practice. I have been in charge for six years, and I have been serving the police force with a sense of sacrifice. Over the years, I have gradually improved the facilities, and I have received mutual assistance from the Allied agencies and colleagues in the First Police Bureau, which has led to today's achievements. There have been many difficulties, and my efforts must be aimed at the police cherishing the local community and enabling the people to live and work in peace. I am very grateful for today's reception by your committee and for being able to gather together with colleagues from the First Police Bureau."

### Statement by Shigeru Gojima

Chief of the Economic Security Division, Shigeru Gojima, stated, in summary: "In general, the police in this city have close contact with the people in form, but in reality, their feelings are often separated. This phenomenon should be reformed. Therefore, after the establishment of our division, the task of inspecting materials must be carried out by the economic police of our division. No other police are allowed to participate in the inspection. This is the established policy of our division. Before the establishment of our division, many people thought there was profit to be made and asked to work for us. Later, because there was no profit to be made, they left one after another. I am strict in my work, and I am afraid that the scope is broad and there are inevitable shortcomings. I hope everyone will cooperate. The working policy of our division is to focus on the big picture, focusing on the distant and the important. We do not engage in trivial pursuits for general business people, but we will never tolerate treacherous merchants, profiteers, and speculators in order to eliminate the toxic currents of Shanghai society. Finally, please provide instructions at any time on what should be promoted and what should be reformed in our division."

### ### Household Sugar Rations to Be Universally Sold Starting Tomorrow, Increased to Ten Ounces Per Person

The household sugar rations that the city's residents have been eagerly awaiting will be sold starting tomorrow (the 21st) after being approved by the Economic and Commercial Cooperative. In light of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, when residents will need more sugar, this period's sugar rations have been increased to ten ounces per person. Residents in the First District can purchase sugar at designated sugar stores with their thirteenth-period sugar purchase certificates, while residents in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts can purchase sugar with their fourteenth-period sugar purchase certificates. The valid period for this period's sugar purchase certificates is said to be until the 30th of this month, and the price will also be slightly adjusted.

### ### Cotton Cloth Merchants Engage in Malpractice, Hoping for Immediate Reports

Regarding the temporary cotton cloth allocation in this city, the Commerce and Trade Association formulated the methods and designated retail stores. It also sent a letter to the municipal government to instruct the Economic Bureau to distribute cloth purchase certificates on its behalf. After receiving the order, the Municipal Economic Bureau obtained the cloth purchase certificates from the Commerce and Trade Association according to the actual number of households reported by each district office and forwarded them to the district offices for distribution to residents. Residents can purchase allocated cotton cloth at designated retail stores for the price of one and a half yards per person. All cloth patterns are publicly displayed in the store windows for people to choose from. All residents of this city, except for those who have recently moved in or were just born, can receive one cloth purchase certificate, which means that everyone can purchase one and a half yards of allocated cotton cloth. However, recently, the retail merchants have not been fully complying with the methods stipulated by the Commerce and Trade Association. The variety of patterns displayed is not plentiful, and the sizes are insufficient. If one requests to exchange the cloth, the merchants often make excuses that there is no stock, and even add abusive words. This violates the original intention of the government's cotton cloth allocation policy. The Municipal Economic Bureau is said to be very concerned about this and hates these cunning merchants. In addition to secretly sending personnel to investigate in various places and sending a letter to the Commerce and Trade Association to strictly order the retail merchants to make immediate corrections, it also hopes that the residents will cooperate closely. If the purchased cotton cloth is of insufficient size or is damaged, they should report it to the Municipal Economic Bureau, the Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau, the Second Police Bureau, or the Commerce and Trade Association at any time so that they can be punished according to the law.

### ### Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank to Move to New Address

The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank at 15 The Bund has experienced exceptional business growth in recent years. As the original location is insufficient for office space, the bank has specially renovated the building formerly built by the Bank of China at 23 The Bund for several months. The interior layout is brand new, and the renovation is now complete. The bank plans to move in and begin operations on July 1. It is said that the new location has been scheduled, and all departments of the bank, including the Investigation Department, the Issuing Bureau, the Foreign Exchange Bureau, and the Financial Inspection Department, will move in in stages.

### ### Gold Speculators to Be Retried on a Scheduled Date

On February 10th and March 8th of this year, the First Police Bureau arrested eighteen gold speculators, including Tang Shiqing and Chen Zhonghan, for violating Article 2 of the "Law on Hoarding Essential Commodities." The case was previously heard by the criminal court of the district court, but due to the serious nature of the case, the hearing could not be concluded by noon. Therefore, the hearing was rescheduled. It has now been learned that the district court has scheduled the retrial to continue on the morning of the 23rd.

### ### Master of Ai Ju Ge Donates Calligraphy and Paintings to Support Education, on Display at the Chinese Painting Academy Starting Today

Our newspaper's seventh scholarship program has begun. It is expected that scholarships for the next semester will increase sharply, and we are calling on all parties to help us raise the target of ten million yuan. Mr. Liang Zhongyi, master of Ai Ju Ge, promotes education with unwavering enthusiasm and provides strong support for scholarship campaigns. He recently donated 250 pieces of Qing Dynasty calligraphy and paintings from his collection to our newspaper for charity sale to support education. These calligraphy and paintings are on public display at the Chinese Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road from today until the 25th. All sectors are welcome to visit and purchase these items. You can protect masterpieces and support education at the same time, which is truly a win-win situation.

### ### Soliciting Fan Paintings for Charity Sale to Support Education

In addition, our newspaper is launching a campaign to solicit fan paintings, both old collections and new works are welcome. Once a considerable number has been collected, they will be put on public display and a charity sale will be held. All proceeds will go to support education. We sincerely hope that calligraphers, painters, and collectors at home and abroad will generously donate. Please contact the scholarship office of our newspaper or call us to arrange for someone to pick them up. All expenses incurred by our newspaper in running the scholarship program will be borne by our newspaper. All proceeds from charity football and basketball games and charity sales of calligraphy and paintings will be used for scholarships. No funds will be used for expenses.

### ### Municipal Bureau of Education Decides to Lay Off Redundant Staff

In order to comply with the authorities' laws and regulations and implement administrative streamlining to improve work efficiency, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has issued an order for all its agencies to comply. It has been learned that the Municipal Bureau of Education recently held a bureau affairs meeting and decided to lay off 23 redundant staff members in five departments, as well as the accounting, advancement studies, and specialist offices. All laid-off personnel will be given three months' salary as severance pay to show sympathy.

### ### Semi-Annual Settlements of Banks and Financial Institutions, Interest Payments to Be Processed Today

The business settlements that banks and financial institutions in the city routinely handle are scheduled for the end of June and the end of December each year. The semi-annual settlement for the end of June this year began last week, and all departments are extremely busy. All banks and financial institutions will complete the interest payments on deposits in the savings and current accounts today (the 20th). All customer deposit interest will be calculated up to the 20th of this month. Interest from the 21st to the 30th will be carried over to the second half of the year. By the end of this month, all banks and financial institutions will have completed their semi-annual business settlements. The 1st and 2nd of July will be regular holidays for banks and financial institutions after the settlements, and business will resume as usual on the 3rd. It is said that during this settlement period, all new loans from banks and financial institutions will be temporarily suspended, and old loans will be actively recovered, so the financial situation in the city has been unusually tight recently.

### ### People's Whereabouts

Finance Minister Zhou Fohai has completed his mission in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing at 8:30 AM yesterday morning. Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan also traveled to Nanjing in the same car.

In addition, Minister of Industry Chen Junkong arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM on the 18th for official business.

Jiangsu Governor Chen Qun left Shanghai by car for Jiangsu at 4:00 PM yesterday. Vice Minister Wu Kaisheng traveled from Shanghai to Nanjing in the same car.

Letter to the Editor: In the "Nanshi Health Authorities Inspect Epidemic Prevention Certificates" item in your local news section on the 19th of this month, after the phrase "It has also been learned," it states that epidemic prevention certificates issued by the Central China Epidemic Prevention Association are considered standard, and that those who have been vaccinated by private physicians must exchange their certificates at the Health Department. This is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The current epidemic prevention certificates are issued by the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, not the Central China Epidemic Prevention Association. The Health Department of the First District Office has already stopped exchanging certificates for those who have been vaccinated by private physicians. If registered practicing physicians wish to obtain epidemic prevention certificates, they must apply to the Fourth Division of the Municipal Health Bureau, which can issue 50 certificates free of charge each time. To avoid misunderstandings among the public, please publish this letter of correction. - Epidemic Prevention Section, Health Department, First District Office, Shanghai Special Municipality

### ### Charity Fire Service Football Match Today, China United vs. Portuguese League, 5:30 PM at the Racecourse

The Shanghai South Fire Service United Association is organizing a charity football match to raise funds for the fire service renovation. China United will play against the Portuguese League, starting at 5:30 PM today at the Racecourse. The referee will be Deng Xiaoliang, and the linesmen will be Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui. The officials of the organizing committee have already appointed Yao Zhenyuan as the secretary, Yu Cuo as the general manager, and Zhang Le as the manager. Mr. Wen Lanting has been invited to kick off the match, Mr. Wu Songgao will present the awards, and movie stars Han Langen, Guan Hongda, and Yin Xiucen will host the charity auction of footballs. Tickets are available in three categories: grandstand tickets for 200 yuan, infield tickets for 2,000 yuan, and infield tickets for 5,000 yuan. The China United team has selected six players from Donghua and five players from Lianyi, supplemented by the Yu brothers from the First Police Team, forming a powerful team. The team configuration is considered appropriate. Liu Xianhan will be the goalkeeper, and Li Mi and Li Yichen will be the defenders, providing a balance of firmness and flexibility. The midfield line will consist of Tan, Song, and Zhang, which is also considered ideal. The forward line will be led by A. Dai, with Xu Wenkui and Han Longhai assisting on the left and right. The wings will be occupied by Li 㙓 and Gao Baozheng. The Portuguese League team has a stronger defense than offense. Therefore, the defense is tight, and Oliveira, V. Sousa, and Fu En are the core of the team's offense and defense. Other players such as Vikse, Xu Erz, and A. Rochalio are all brave warriors. When the two teams meet, China United has a higher chance of winning, but the Portuguese League is by no means an ordinary team and will do its best. There will be many exciting moments. Spectators are advised to exit through the Huangpi Road gate.

China United: Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Li Yichen, Song Lingsheng, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Xu Wenkui, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Gao Baozheng. (Reserves) Li Tiansheng, Zheng Yingquan, Yu Lihua, Yu Liming.

### National Forum - Suggestions for the Rice Control Committee

- Yu Nong

The price of rice in this city has reached tens of thousands of yuan per stone, an unprecedented price that has caused widespread anxiety and a sense of impending doom. The reasons for this situation are none other than the failure to distribute household rice on schedule, its irregular and unpredictable nature, and the lack of explanation to reassure the public. Furthermore, there is no effective solution to remedy the situation, leading the general public to believe that the rationing system is gradually disappearing, resulting in a rush to purchase rice on the black market for relief. This is one factor. In addition, the government's announcement of the temporary procurement outline for rice in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the provision in Article 5 that rice entering the city without a transport permit will be treated as private rice, have led many to believe that farmers will no longer be able to freely transport even a few pecks of rice for sale, which would have provided a source of relief. This will also create a major problem for the black market rice that the city relies on for relief, leading to an even more desperate search for supplies. The farmers are also confused about the so-called application for transport permits and fear that any mistake will result in confiscation and fines. Farmers are already like birds startled by a bow, so how dare they try? They remain hesitant, resulting in even scarcer supplies. This is another factor.

Therefore, the Rice Control Committee should address the problem by prescribing the right medicine. First, it should encourage the transportation of rice by purchasing merchants to increase the supply, while making reasonable small-scale purchases of military police rice and household rice to ensure that household rice can be distributed on schedule (with prices set separately, of course) to reassure the public. Third, the free transportation of rice by farmers should not only be increased in quantity to at least one stone, but also simplified in terms of procedures to allow for complete freedom. Any procedure that directly or indirectly hinders the free transportation of rice by farmers should be abolished to increase the supply. I have read the Rice Control Committee's announcement on the procedures for applying for permits to transport rice into Shanghai, which is divided into three categories, A, B, and C. Category C is specifically designed for farmers transporting less than five pecks of rice, and is limited to one day of validity and expires the next day. I believe this requires discussion.

Since the first principle is to encourage farmers to freely transport rice, the limited quantity is too small. Why is it necessary to have a certificate? What does the certificate prove? If the purpose is to prove the origin, it is impossible to prove it at the entrance. If the purpose is to collect statistics, it is sufficient to have someone register at the entrance. Once the rice has entered, it should be allowed to be bought and sold freely, and there is no need for proof. Furthermore, since various permits are stipulated not to incur any fees, this expense should be saved at a time when paper is expensive and printing materials are scarce. Second, most farmers transport rice into the city by carrying it on their shoulders or backs and walking. They are not only selling their rice but also selling their labor and time. The entrance will inevitably be crowded, and if everyone must be asked and fill out a statement, what will be the delay in procedures and the waste of time? I firmly believe that there will not only be chaotic scenes of people rushing to be first, but also opportunities for corruption and abuse of power. The result will not only cause great suffering to the farmers but also double the cost of their rice transportation, which is not the way to encourage farmers or suppress rice prices. Third, most farmers are illiterate and have unclear speech, so it is easy for mistakes to occur in the rice they carry and the certificates they fill out. Moreover, farmers carrying heavy loads and sweating are more likely to lose or damage these certificates. What will be the farmers' suffering when they encounter strict inspections and difficulties from the police at every five steps and the guards at every ten steps in the city? The abuses are unspeakable. Fourth, since there is a certificate for rice moving within the city, all moving rice will have a certificate. How will household rice be moved, and how will the rice subsidies distributed by factories and organizations to their employees be moved? Furthermore, if the certificate is implemented, the police along the way will be most diligent in performing these duties, and every bag of rice will be checked. In the future, all kinds of evils will be carried out in the name of checking certificates.

Therefore, based on the above four points, the issuance of certificates seems to be more harmful than beneficial and should be avoided. As for the Rice Control Committee's provision that "the storage of rice for consumption is limited to three months, and exceeding the limit will be considered as hoarding and will be punished," the original intention of this legislation is to prevent hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, which is not to be criticized. However, we believe that there is a big difference between reasonable "accumulation" and illegal "hoarding," and they should not be treated the same. "Store grain to prevent famine" is an ancient saying (each place has grain storage facilities based on this idea). Therefore, it seems clear that storing more rice for consumption by one's family should not be considered hoarding. For example, a family of eight may be able to store rice for six months or a year (but in fact, rice cannot be stored for more than half a year unless it is stored in a special facility). In fact, those who have prepared for themselves are not as easily panicked as those who have not, as is the case now. It is those who have not been able to obtain household rice and have not made preparations who have largely contributed to the current high rice prices of tens of thousands of yuan. Those who have already prepared are not involved. Otherwise, with everyone rushing to buy, the price of rice could easily reach 50,000 yuan. The facts are clear. Therefore, the authorities should not only not ban storage but also encourage grain accumulation to reduce the severity of unforeseen circumstances (such as sudden problems with transportation, etc.) and even, in desperation, borrow grain from those who have stored generously to provide some relief. Saving the desperate is an ancient saying, and it is likely that a temporary request will be possible. Therefore, if the purpose and behavior of storing grain are indeed for self-use to prevent famine and not for hoarding, speculation, or profiteering, it is a reasonable "tax" and should not be considered a crime even if the storage exceeds three months. However, if the purpose and behavior are indeed for hoarding, speculation, or profiteering, it is illegal "hoarding," and the amount hoarded, even if it is less than three months' worth, should be punished as hoarding to comply with the law. Furthermore, once the storage of grain is limited to three months and exceeding the limit is illegal, every household will have to be thoroughly inspected, and every peck of rice in and out will be a matter of imprisonment. The number of people in the household, their ages, whether they are young or old, the amount of grain they eat, and whether they have relatives or friends visiting will all become major problems. Homes will become fraught with troubles, and the abuses that will result are unimaginable. Policymakers must be cautious from the beginning. Furthermore, the authorities have suddenly ordered that grain storage is limited to three months without a probationary period. What will happen to those who currently have more than three months' worth of grain? If they continue to store the excess grain, they will be guilty of exceeding the limit. If they sell it immediately, they will be guilty of speculation and profiteering. They will be guilty whether they advance or retreat, and it is not clear how they will be handled. In summary, it seems that the restriction on storage is more harmful than beneficial and should be avoided. Furthermore, the fact that rice in both cities cannot be stored for long and cannot be stored in excessive quantities has already become a natural restriction, so there is no need to have a law to regulate it, which may only lead to abuses.

### Naval Painter (4) Navy

— Iwata Toyoo Barracks, Sayang Discussion

"Ah, it's finished!"

The calligrapher Ichiki, who was talking with Tsuruhara at a small table in the drawing room, said this with a smile when Takao removed the cloth covering the painting.

Takao had originally intended to wait until Atsushi returned before showing the painting to Ichiki, but because the moving company delivered it unexpectedly early, he had no choice but to open it in front of Tsuruhara.

"There's a number 50 frame in that place. Put it in there and let me see it on the bookshelf!"

Takao did as his teacher said. Then he looked at his own books again, perhaps because of the calm light of Atsushi and the drawing room, which he always felt was more elegant than at his own home.

"Sure enough, it has finally become the warship I longed for. The waves and fog are very well researched."

The calligrapher did not seem very interested in warships, but always pointed out the advantages of many seascapes in detail. Takao was half happy and half hesitant.

"In short, this book on warships is very rare. Mr. Tsuruhara, what is your critique?"

Ichiki smiled and looked at his friend who was smoking.

"You are right, it is a very rare book. This is only to say that you can't find it at any exhibition, it is a very rare painting."

Tsuruhara's argument was a bit sarcastic.

"What you said is certainly right, but what's wrong with it? What do you think?"

"Perhaps it is using something that should not be used as a subject as a subject for writing."

"No, what I have set is the emotion contained in the writing. But can't warships become material for expression?"

Ichiki tilted his head. (103)
