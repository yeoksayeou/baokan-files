### The Anguish of Chinese Youth

The mentality of youth is progressive and full of emotion. With a progressive heart, there must be progressive goals and hopes; however, when encountering obstacles and setbacks on the road of progress, and failing to immediately achieve what is expected, one is easily moved by emotion and easily becomes distressed.

From the perspective of youth regarding the nation, youth are the most patriotic part of the citizenry. The nation they love is complete, whole, and unified. The textbooks they read in elementary school are about loving the motherland and the national state; the education and edification they receive in middle school are also about loving the motherland and the national state. Furthermore, they further understand the tragedy of national division; history teaches them how rare and difficult it is for the weak to become strong again, and for the perished to be revived. Therefore, they are even more unwilling to see history repeat itself in their most beloved motherland. As for university, there is no need to mention it; in various lectures and teaching materials on political science, economics, and history, they are given valuable lessons, gaining a deeper understanding of their own country. Their minds are innocent, their ideals are pure, their passion is precious, and they have only one goal: "There is only one motherland." However, while they have their national ideals, they also see the reality of the nation today. Ideals and reality cannot be reconciled into one, but instead form a huge contradiction. Contradiction is their obstacle and setback. Thus, the first and greatest anguish arises in their hearts.

Furthermore, regarding youth and education, youth not only want to receive school education, but should also receive education above the basic level. They have aspirations and far-reaching desires, hoping to contribute to society and the country, and to serve humanity in the future. Precisely because of this, they are particularly interested in the education they should receive, and precisely because of this, they have even greater ambitions for their future. Their urgent desire for learning is a good sign for the future of the country. But what is the reality? The rising prices and increasing difficulty of life - do these help or destroy the desire of young people to study? The increasing hardship of teachers and the increasing difficulty of obtaining books - do these help or destroy the desire of young people to study? All of these things run counter to the ideals of young people to study, and are contradictions between ideals and reality. Contradiction is their obstacle and setback. Thus, the second and greatest anguish arises in their hearts.

The anguish of youth is by no means limited to this. These are only the greatest of their anguishes. If the anguish of youth is not resolved for a day, the strength of youth will not be guided and developed for a day. Therefore, the government has the responsibility to find ways to relieve the anguish of countless youth across the country. In particular, those who lead youth movements in the government need to pay attention to self-reflection.

However, a distressing environment and a distressed spirit are two different things. The current environment is indeed distressing; however, the spirit of youth should still be uplifted. They should never be dominated by the environment. According to the opinions of the education sector, the entrance examination results of various universities this semester are worse than in the past, which is clear evidence that the spirit of youth cannot be uplifted. Therefore, on the government's side, there is of course a practical responsibility to relieve the anguish of youth, while on the youth's side, they should also uplift their spirits, create a new environment, and not be dominated by the environment.

Contents of Various Japanese Budget Proposals

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's proposed temporary military expenditure special accounting budget and other budget proposals for the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet have been finalized after negotiations by various ministries, and were discussed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 5th. After Finance Minister Ishiwata gave a detailed explanation, it was decided to present them to the Emperor in the afternoon, and the Information Bureau released the contents at 5:00 pm. The contents are recorded as follows: Supplementary proposal for the special account budget for temporary military expenditure; Supplementary proposal for the total budget for revenue and expenditure for Showa 19 (Republic of China 22); Contractual matters for which the national treasury bears the burden other than the special account budget for public bonds and coal supply and demand adjustment, of which the additional amount of temporary military expenditure for direct warfare is 25 billion yen. The cumulative total of the additional amount of this item's accounting for Showa 19, together with the amount decided by the 84th Diet, totals a huge amount of 63 billion yen, which is a sharp increase of 36 billion yen compared with the additional amount in Showa 18. The wartime financial system is now complete. At the same time, it was also decided to add a supplementary budget for general accounting related to the Ministry of Finance's expenses, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's food, coal, and firewood production increase, and temporary Diet expenses. The total amount of revenue and expenditure is 385,444,000 yen. Therefore, the total budget for general accounting this year, including this additional amount, actually reaches 20.558 million yen. Secondly, the public bond special accounting supplementary budget proposal is about 5.2 billion yen, and it was decided to issue new price bonds to cover this temporary military expenditure supplementary budget. In addition, the contractual expenditure that the national treasury bears the burden of outside the budget is estimated to be 639 million yen, including 500 million yen for food, coal, and firewood production increase and the next year's arable land improvement expenses. Including the temporary military expenditure, general accounting, and the supplementary budgets for various special accounts, and the one passed by the 84th Diet, the total amount is 83.558 million yen. After deducting the duplicate expenses of 7.25 million yen, it is counted as 76.352 million yen, which is an actual increase of 39.2 billion yen compared with the 37.09 million yen in Showa 18. Temporary Military Expenditure Decided to Issue Public Bonds

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The additional budget proposal for temporary military expenditure to be submitted to the Japanese Extraordinary Session of the Diet is counted as 25 billion yen, of which 20 billion yen is for regular expenses and 5 billion yen is for reserve funds. This money is borrowed from the Southern Development Bank and collected from miscellaneous income from public bonds. The contents are divided as follows (in millions of yen): Southern Development Bank loan (19,200), public bonds (5,197), miscellaneous income (1,602). The 28.2 billion yen borrowed from the Development Bank has reached 70% of the temporary military supplementary budget. This budget is based on the increase in war expenses on the continent and in the south. The cumulative Southern Development Bank loan this year is 25.2 billion yen, and the burden on the residents of the south to complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly heavy. Since the China Incident, the cumulative temporary military expenditure budget to date is 137.128 million yen.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government submitted this year's general special budget supplementary proposal the day before the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet was held, and announced that the additional amount of the temporary military budget was 25 billion yen. Together with the 38 billion yen of the temporary military supplementary budget decided by the previous cabinet, the total amount has reached a huge amount of 63 billion yen, plus this year's general special expense accounting amount, totaling 76.33 million. More than half of this amount has been decided to be issued in eight bonds. According to this temporary military expenditure supplementary budget proposal, compared with the 220 million yen during the first Sino-Japanese War and the 3.34 billion yen during the Russo-Japanese War, this is much larger than the 2.02 billion yen in the first year of the Sino-Japanese Incident. From this, it can be seen that the huge amount of this budget is worthy of attention. More than 70% of it is loans from the Southern Development Bank and the co-prosperity sphere, and more than 20% is public funds.

### A Glimpse of the Two Experimental County Areas of Dangtu and Jiangning Min Xian

Recently, the National Government selected five counties - Jiangning, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Dangtu, and Nanhui - as experimental county areas. This reporter, on this trip to Wuhu, made a special stay in Dangtu and Jiangning counties for several days. "Both counties are on the Nanjing-Wuhu Line." The history and area of the two counties will not be repeated. Only the sights and sounds are recorded as follows: Scenery of Dangtu

As soon as this reporter exited the Dangtu train station, he had a good impression. The roads were quite clean, and the trees along the road were quite neat. The mountains and rivers were interspersed near the road, and the scenery was pleasant. The armed comrades who checked the travelers on the road were also quite polite. There were many rice shops in the city streets, most of which were attached to a money shop. This area is a rice-producing area, and the money shop is attached to facilitate the large-scale purchase of rice. Immediately afterwards, I went to the nearby rural areas of Cihu, Caishi, Ma'anshan, etc. along the Nanjing-Wuhu Line to pay my respects, and I was able to talk with the farmers cordially. I learned that the harvests in the county have been good in recent years. Each mu of dry land yields about three to four dan, and each mu of paddy field yields about four to five dan. The lives are comfortable. The people in the cities and villages of the county also have a characteristic, that is, most of them are at ease and trust the authorities. Originally, the security in the county has been quite good since the incident. Although bandits have not completely disappeared, because all towns and villages in the county are equipped with a telephone network, as soon as there is a bandit alarm in any place, the security team will rush to eliminate them at any time. It is said that this security team is quite well-equipped, with about two hundred people, and several trucks and several speedboats. Land and water marches are very convenient. As a result, the bandits have disappeared and mostly go to neighboring counties. It is said that this equipment was created by the current Zhang, the chief of the county police bureau, who also manages the county's affairs. "Mr. Zhang has been in the county for a long time, and has been commended by the National Government and awarded a bonus of 200,000 yuan." The funds are derived from the so-called security surcharge added to the land tax. "The county has a total of 630,000 mu of farmland." The people have no complaints because they are able to live in peace. It can be seen that what is taken from the people and used for the people will surely be praised by the people. However, the education situation is very low. The county is now in the process of establishing a junior high school. Other cultural undertakings such as public education halls and gymnasiums have not been given attention, and are only for show. Because the people's lives are relatively comfortable, the gambling atmosphere is very strong. The amount of winnings or losses often amounts to tens of thousands of gold, which would make urbanites gasp. The authorities have done a good job in handling the word "security", but they seem unable to take care of the word "education". It is hoped that when the experimental county administration is implemented in the future, the three words "education, cultivation, and health" will advance at the same time. A Glimpse of Jiangning

Leaving the county of Dangtu, still along the Nanjing-Suzhou Line to Jiangning Town in Jiangning County, the town has about a hundred households. When the reporter arrived in the town at 7:00 pm, he immediately discovered that the people were uneasy. Originally, the bandits and communists in Loulan Town (also under the jurisdiction of Jiangning County) nearby were rampant, and they had been alarmed several times a night for several days. When talking with the people, most of their beliefs were shaken, which was caused by the environment. The reporter then turned to Nanjing along the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway and arrived at Jiangning County. On the surface, there was no sign of restlessness, but when talking with the people, most of them asked where you came from and how that village was. In short, if security is not guaranteed, it is difficult to correct the ideology. Jiangning's congenital nature is much worse than that of Dangtu. In the future, when the authorities implement the experimental county administration, it will inevitably take more effort. It is hoped that the authorities will implement rural construction, and take the experimental county area as a unit, or there may be other ways to remedy it.

### Developments in the Balkan Situation: Soviet Union Declares War on Bulgaria with Prior Consent from Britain and the United States

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency urgent cable) - Haitong News Agency quoted a Moscow wireless report as saying that the Soviet Union has declared war on Bulgaria. The Soviet Union has delivered a declaration of war to Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Shivimenov, stating briefly that Bulgaria has assisted Germany in fighting against the Soviet Union for three years, and is now providing Germany with a base to establish a resistance front. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to declare war on Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Minister immediately reported the content of the declaration to his government. As of 5:00 PM yesterday (Moscow time), the two countries were at war.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov announced at a press conference on the evening of the 5th that before handing over the declaration of war to the Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, he had informed the British and American Ambassadors to the Soviet Union of his intentions.

### Background to the Declaration of War

Bern, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Information obtained from sources close to the Greek Embassy reveals the following regarding the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Bulgaria: The Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria just as Britain and the United States were about to conclude armistice negotiations with Bulgaria. The difficulty in the negotiations was that the former Bulgarian government was unwilling to return Dede Agach and Kayalla, which provide access to the Aegean Sea, to Greece. Britain had promised Greece in Cairo eighteen months ago to restore these two places, and therefore insisted that Bulgaria return these two places. The new and old governments of Bulgaria held different views on this, and the Soviet Union believed that if Bulgaria made concessions to Britain and the United States, it would be equivalent to not allowing the Soviet Union to gain an exit to the Aegean Sea through Bulgaria. Therefore, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria in order to invade Bulgaria as soon as possible and obtain an exit to the Aegean Sea.

The tank convoys of the British Second Army, after passing through Brussels, have now reached the Antwerp area and the Scheldt River. Other enemy forces are advancing towards the northwest and west, pressing the German army in the obstacle positions built on the middle and upper reaches of the Scheldt River and the Lys River. Canadian forces are attacking the German obstacle positions on the Canche River, and fierce fighting is taking place. The enemy forces have made no progress in any of these sectors. The left wing of the U.S. First Army is advancing north between the Sambre and Meuse Rivers. Due to strong German resistance, it has also been unable to achieve its objective. The anti-Axis forces have recently increased pressure on the area between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. U.S. tank forces are attempting to break into the Lorraine basin and are currently encountering strong German counterattacks. Metz and Nancy were still in German hands the night before last.

### German Strategy to Defend the Homeland

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities stated on the 5th regarding the situation on the Western Front as follows: The German army on the Western Front has reached a critical juncture. The current task of the German army is to transfer German troops from France back to the homeland, to buy time, and to build positions to wait for a counterattack. As for the transfer of German troops from France, it should be done as circumstances dictate by the German command. The issue of buying time is a prerequisite for achieving the third task. Therefore, the German army's withdrawal operation should be carried out according to a very strict plan.

### German Garrison at Le Havre Firmly Refuses to Surrender

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: German military sources say that Canadian forces increased pressure on the German garrison at Le Havre on the 4th, and that all proposals for surrender have been firmly rejected by the German army. In order to avoid the disaster of war for the French people in Le Havre, the German army suggested that the French civilians be allowed to leave the war zone, but the German suggestion was rejected.

### Switzerland Implements Partial Mobilization

Bern, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Local officials announced yesterday that the Swiss Federal Council, following the proposal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Border Army, has decided to implement a partial mobilization of the Swiss Land Defense Forces.

### Portuguese Government Reorganizes National Guard to Enhance Strength

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: The strength of the Portuguese Republican National Guard will soon be greatly enhanced. This National Guard has a dual military and police nature and is usually dedicated to suppressing coups and maintaining domestic order for the government.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Haitong News Agency reports: Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar formed a new government last night. The personnel are as follows: Foreign Minister - Prime Minister Salazar (concurrent), Finance Minister - Rembrales, Army Minister - Colonel Costa, Interior Minister - Colonel Muniz, Justice Minister - Flaila, Navy Minister - Tomaz, Public Works Minister - Cancela, Colonial Minister - Gaitano (youth sports leader), Education Minister - Thermada (Minister to Vichy), Economic Minister - Pinto.

### Returning from the Soviet Union

I left the Russian capital on July 12, just a few days after the third anniversary of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. At that time, the Moscow citizens were most concerned with, and what became the center of conversation, was, "The war seems to be nearing its end..." Why did the Soviet citizens think the war was nearing its end? It was because the so-called Second Front had been opened. As a Russian proverb says, "Even with promises, one must wait three years." In reality, the Soviet people had been waiting for the fulfillment of the promise of a Second Front from the British and American Allies for three years.

The reason why the Soviet army had to continue to fight bitterly with the German army was also because the British and Americans did not fulfill their promise of a Second Front. The Soviet leaders had to painstakingly explain to the people. Therefore, upon hearing the news that the British and American forces had begun landing in northern France, they simply thought that the war was nearing its end. This was not accidental or unreasonable.

The Soviet people were so eager for the realization of the Second Front. An old woman I knew well told me with a joyful expression: "I was summoned yesterday, and I will be returning from the team tomorrow, because the Second Front has already been opened today."

The Soviet people have indeed endured hardship and bitterness in the past three years of bitter fighting. The desire to end the war as soon as possible permeates all levels of the nation, but it would be too much to think that their anger towards the enemy and their burning desire for revenge have diminished. The government whipped the exhausted bodies and minds of the people by scratching the place where the people's anger and desire for revenge were. These are all true situations.

### 15 Million Dead and Wounded

Although the German attacks were fierce, the Soviet defense was indeed good. How did the vast battlefield of the Eastern Front become a large-scale slaughterhouse? In the past three years, the total number of dead and wounded on both sides has averaged more than 15,000 people per day, totaling about 15 million people. In that vast battlefield area of European Russia, one can dig up the bodies of enemies and friends buried everywhere. As for the cities that have become fire lanes, they have almost become uninhabited ruins, and it is extremely difficult to identify the streets of the past. About 60 kilometers outside Moscow, the town of Istora was a beautiful rural town with hundreds of tiled houses before the war. However, when I returned to Moscow from Kuibyshev and revisited the old place, because the area became the target of guns and artillery fired by both sides during the Moscow defense battle in the winter of 1941, there are now no intact houses. The roofs have flown away, the walls have collapsed, and only the skeletons of the buildings remain, blackened by cannon smoke, like tombstones standing everywhere in the ruins. Stalingrad was a newly developed industrial city on the banks of the Volga River, but a certain Russian who inspected the city's misery told me, "There are only twenty-six houses in the entire city that have escaped the destruction of the war and remain intact."

### Women Aviation Soldiers and Tank Soldiers

The hills where fierce battles took place have changed color due to the indiscriminate bombardment of bombs and shells from both sides. The fierceness and misery of the situation are beyond description. The Soviet people, with men on the front lines and women in the rear, have been engaged in this fierce war for three years. The mobilization of men is most intense in the countryside. What remains in the home are either children under the age of thirteen or fourteen, or old people in their sixties or seventies. There are also female village chiefs and female household heads. Young women with headscarves, driving trucks with the dashing posture of rubber soldiers, can be seen in every village and town.

In the cities, only government offices and important military factories still have a considerable number of men of conscription age working. For example, almost all streetcar drivers are women around the age of twenty or thirty. Some people have seen them driving large locomotives that can pull five or six-ton trucks--forty or fifty cars. There are also many women engaged in heavy work such as coal miners, lathe workers, and earthworkers. Soviet women not only guard the rear, but also stand side by side with men on the front lines in the hail of bullets as aviation soldiers, tank soldiers, snipers, anti-aircraft gun teams, military doctors, and nurses. Although the exact number is unknown, experts estimate that it reaches more than one million people.

If it were not for the dedicated efforts and activities of Soviet women, which are no less than those of men, I am afraid that it would not be possible to prevent this war! (Author: Masaharu Hatanaka, Moscow Bureau Chief of Asahi Shimbun) (Xiang: Translated from Asahi Shimbun, August 18)

### Ninth Air Defense Day: Air Defense Training Procedures with Special Emphasis on Civilian Shelter Training

In view of the current tense air defense situation, the city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will soon usher in the Ninth Air Defense Day and further train citizens to pay attention to shelter training so that they can protect their lives during air raids. The following training plan for the Air Defense Day on September 9 has been formulated:

Training Alert Times (A) Training alert issuance and cancellation times: First training - Alert issuance at 9:30 AM, Air raid alert issuance at 10:30 AM, Air raid alert cancellation at 11:00 AM, Alert cancellation at 12:00 noon. Second training - Air raid alert issuance at 3:20 PM, Air raid alert cancellation at 12:00 noon. Alert cancellation at 10:00 PM. The above times will be announced in the newspaper and broadcast on the radio to inform citizens. Sirens will not be sounded temporarily. (B) During the alert issuance training, only air defense residual lights (i.e., air defense lights among streetlights) will be turned on. Lights will be turned off during the air raid alert.

Shelter Training Items (C) Training items: 1. Home shelter training, 2. Shelter training for those outdoors (including pedestrians), 3. Shelter training for large stores, banks, companies, hotels, teahouses, etc., 4. Shelter training for amusement parks, theaters, etc., 5. Shelter training for trains, ships, docks, factories, workplaces, etc., 6. Shelter training in parks, schools, sports fields, competition fields, etc. (D) Shelter essentials: Implement the previously instructed methods comprehensively according to the stated objectives. Shelter outlines are currently being drafted as a basis for guidance, but they will not be promulgated for this training.

Pay Attention to Real Alerts

(E) Others: 1. During this training, if sirens are heard, it should be known that it is not a training alert but a real alert, and measures should be taken quickly to respond. 2. Saturday, September 9, is the 22nd day of the seventh lunar month. Moonrise is at 11:52 PM on September 9, and moonset is at 3:12 PM on September 10. 3. Baojia and self-defense corps members, as well as the general public, should be encouraged to wear air defense clothing so that they can lie down and take shelter anytime, anywhere without hindrance. 4. The brightness of flashlights should be below one candlepower, and fabrics of different colors should be used to cover the light-emitting part so that the light is emitted directly and cannot be identified at any point more than 300 meters away. Under no circumstances should it be shone upwards at an angle of more than 15 degrees to the ground. The colors of the light-shielding fabrics for flashlights are differentiated as follows: 1. Red for military flashlights, 2. Yellow or orange for official (including police officer) flashlights, 3. Blue or green for civilian flashlights (including Baojia groups and self-defense corps). However, police, fire, and rescue personnel are allowed to use flashlights within the necessary minimum range in case of emergency during their duties. 5. Traffic control during the issuance of alerts must be strictly implemented.

Shelter Start Time: The shelter start time will be determined according to the assumed situation planned by each police precinct. In addition, guidance will be provided to regard Japanese training planes flying overhead at the scheduled time as enemy planes and to take shelter immediately upon seeing the plane's shadow or hearing the sound. The scheduled time for training flights is from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The locations for setting up shelters are as follows: 1. Each household should be ordered to select a strong and safe place as a shelter. 2. Each bao should be ordered to set up one or more public shelters for public use and should be encouraged to set up appropriate public shelters as soon as possible. 3. As for outdoor shelter, during the training, the public should be guided to quickly use the terrain and objects for self-help and to disperse and lie down to take shelter. 4. Large stores, banks, companies, hotels, teahouses, amusement parks, theaters, bookstores, cinemas, trains, ships, docks, factories, workplaces, and similar places should be ordered to set up appropriate shelters. 5. Special self-defense corps for various businesses or special buildings, as well as each bao area, should be ordered to set up one or more anti-air and anti-ground observation posts during the issuance of alerts. The establishment and operation of observation posts are very important, and the guiding principles for them are currently being considered. 6. Upon seeing an enemy plane or hearing the sound of a plane, the observation post should immediately use a megaphone to shout "Airplane coming!" (It is best to unify the terminology) and strike a steel gong to immediately implement shelter on all sides.

### Measures for Entertainment Venues

The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to arouse a correct understanding of air defense among entertainment venue operators and the general public and to prepare for all eventualities, convened the first dust talk meeting on air defense measures at the headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, gathering representatives of operators of racetracks, jai alai courts, dog racing tracks, etc. On the afternoon of the 5th, the second symposium was held, gathering representatives of operators of dance halls, amusement parks, etc. Yesterday (the 6th), starting at 2:00 PM, the last symposium was held, gathering representatives of operators of theaters, cinemas, opera houses, Shanghai opera, Shaoxing opera, and other theaters. It is reported that the headquarters authorities instructed the representatives of various entertainment venue operators on various points of air defense in great detail, so that once alerts and air raids are issued, the entertainment venue operating authorities can clearly understand the necessary measures to take, such as posting alert signs in the venue to inform the entertainers of how to take shelter and take measures. The symposium was very successful.

### Materials Distribution Office Formulates Special Rice Distribution Measures for Teachers and Staff; Public and Private Schools Treated Equally

In accordance with the Mayor's intentions, the city's Materials Distribution Office is now handling a special allocation of rice to teachers and staff to help alleviate the insufficiency of their livelihoods. Regulations have been formulated and submitted to the city government for implementation. The details are listed below:

### No Applications if Rice is Used as Tuition

The purpose of the special rice allocation for teachers and staff is to alleviate the financial difficulties of teachers and staff in various schools, which directly and indirectly helps promote the development of education in this city. Therefore, teachers and staff of all levels of schools within the city, whether municipal, public, or private schools recognized by the Ministry of Education or the Municipal Bureau of Education, may apply to the office for allocation in accordance with the regulations. However, schools that have already actually collected rice from students as tuition fees may not apply.

### Monthly Rice Allocation of 3.5 Sheng Per Person

Teachers and staff of various schools applying to the city's Materials Distribution Office for a special allocation of rice must first obtain an application form from the Materials Distribution Office, fill in the number of teachers and staff, as well as the name, age, gender, and address of each person, and the residence permit number according to the regulations, and submit it to the Materials Distribution Office for review and approval. After approval, an A-type coupon will be issued in accordance with the special rice allocation regulations for civil servants. Each person can purchase 4.5 he of rice per period, with three periods per month, totaling 3.5 sheng.

### Part-Time Teachers Limited to Claiming at One School

Teachers and staff who hold positions in more than one school are only allowed to apply in one school. If they leave the school, the principal of the school should immediately report it to the office and return any unused allocation certificates of the departing teachers and staff to the office. It is strictly forbidden to take advantage of the situation and fraudulently claim more. If any deliberate deception is discovered, the school's special rice allocation rights will be suspended, and the practice will be stopped.

### The Educational Characteristics of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Schools

— Ueno Taichu

Manual Arts Curriculum

Secondary schools have always attached great importance to manual arts courses. N聶中丞 Public School aims to develop manual arts education as one of its goals. The school has a well-equipped workshop where many students satisfy their urge for activity and develop a practical spirit every day. However, manual arts are different from labor. The former is at least biased towards individual, passive muscle activity, while the latter emphasizes collective, automatic hand-brain coordination. Therefore, elementary schools go a step further, seeking to link labor with other subjects. In self-supplementary materials and weaving subjects, there is a trend from "listening" in class to "doing" by hand. Of course, most of the teaching materials are self-compiled, such as the natural science materials published by the World Book Company…social teaching materials…and the intermediate common sense textbooks published by Chunqiu Book Company, which can all be linked to labor education.

Music and Art Education Secondary schools, whether junior or senior, mostly neglect subjects such as aesthetics and the expression of thoughts and feelings, and creative art and music. Even a simple school song is rarely heard. There are also few student art creations displayed in the school. Most of the school's time is spent injecting knowledge into the students' heads, and it is extremely difficult to reach the students' emotions. However, the seven elementary schools, under the leadership of the Chinese Education Department, pay special attention to this type of curriculum. They have hired experts to study and compile a music collection with three levels, low, medium, and high, suitable for each grade level. It is popular throughout the city and is still in use today. The development of the art subject, from static drawing, sculpture, model building, and other works, has progressed to live drama design. For example, the puppet shows popular in Shanghai today originated from the design and creation of the Chinese Education Department's activities. To this day, the heads of the puppet troupes are still staff members of the former Education Department.

Physical Education Curriculum

The British have always been known for their emphasis on physical education, believing that good citizens should be cultivated on the sports field. Therefore, they did not bring the whole spirit to Lian Tong Middle School. For decades, there has been no significant emphasis on physical education. There are also very few activities related to physical education. Although there are many domestic physical education pioneers teaching at Chinese Public Schools, their main job is not teaching physical education. Most of their time is spent teaching English or other subjects. After class, students are not allowed to stay in the classroom and must all go to the playground. But what do they do on the playground? Just take a walk and chat, with few collective sports. As for the uniforms that all students are required to wear, they consist of a long-billed hat and a long cloth gown. It is a bit cumbersome and inconvenient to walk in. Wearing this long uniform to the sports field, one can imagine the Englishman's intentions for the physical education of the state students. The elementary school physical education curriculum focuses on exercising children's physique and cultivating good virtues from the aspects of living habits. Sports skills are secondary. There are more collective activities than in middle schools. Scout training was also popular for a time. After the incident, due to the limitations of the school's sports field, physical education activities were mostly unheard of. It is a case of heroes having no place to use their skills.

### Coal Produced in Huainan is Transported to Shanghai Continuously

According to news released by the relevant authorities, the city's coal ash fuel has had transportation difficulties in the past, so outsiders may feel that there is a coal panic in the city, but this is not the case. Although the city's coal has relied entirely on supplies from outside in the past, coal from North China is still being transported south continuously. Although the number of train trips has been reduced, the amount of coal transported south from the north is about the same as in the past. At the same time, the Huainan coal mine, in view of the urgent need for fuel in Central China, has added employees and actively increased coal production, which is being continuously transported to Shanghai to meet the needs.

### Scheduled Passenger Ship Between Suzhou and Shanghai Begins Sailing Yesterday

In view of the recent reduction in the number of train trips, travelers have been greatly affected. In order to facilitate train transportation and benefit travelers, the business community here, after consultation with the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, agreed to establish the Shengchang Shipping Company at 998 North Suzhou Road, to operate scheduled passenger ships between Shanghai and Suzhou. It is stipulated that they will arrive in Suzhou on the same day, and the service began yesterday.

### Registration of Industrial and Commercial Firms Will Be Strictly Investigated

The Municipal Economic Bureau announced a few days ago that the deadline for industrial and commercial registration is at the end of this month. Various industrial and commercial firms in the city that have not yet registered are enthusiastically registering. In order to understand the production situation of manufacturers throughout the city, and to curb commodity prices, the Bureau will conduct strict investigations on the registration of various industrial and commercial firms before issuing certificates. As for those who have previously registered with the Grain Bureau, except for those with corresponding capital, there is no need to register. Other firms that have increased their capital should quickly go to the Bureau to register.

### Municipal Police Bureau Adjusts Police Officer Salaries Salaries of Officers in the Former First and Second Bureaus are Increased

The Municipal Police Bureau has repeatedly considered the issue of adjusting the salaries of police officers since merging the former First and Second Police Bureaus. Starting this month, the police officers of the former Second Bureau will temporarily receive double their original salaries. Starting October 1, the salaries of police officers of the former Second Police Bureau serving in the General Bureau and various district sub-bureaus will be increased to be equal to the salaries of police officers of the former First Bureau. As for the salaries of police officers in various suburban sub-bureaus, they will also be gradually doubled starting this month, and adjustments will be gradually planned later.

Strictly Investigate Disguised Gambling and Opium Dens

The Judicial Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, adhering to the authorities' intention to eliminate the two evils of opium and gambling, has recently conducted strict investigations and crackdowns on private opium and private gambling. Recently, it has been found that disguised "clubs" have been established in the urban area one after another, and nineteen of them are residential mansions, luxuriously decorated, gathering wealthy merchants and even government officials, using clubs as a cover for disguised gambling, setting up mahjong, poker, and other gambling tools, and issuing chips, with huge wins and losses. Some even set up opium couches for guests to smoke opium. Such behavior not only violates the ban on opium and gambling, but also violates the regulations on electricity use announced by the Municipal Government. The office has decided to ban them and has ordered the prevention department to conduct strict investigations. It has also summoned several club owners, severely reprimanded them, and warned them that similar gambling and opium smoking should never occur again in the future. Otherwise, once verified, they will be arrested and severely punished. At the same time, disguised clubs without licenses will be banned and sealed up.

Actively Strengthen Supervision Work Since August 1, the area covered by the Municipal Police Bureau's First and Second Bureaus has been vast, and the territory is vast. The Director of Supervision, Guo Shaoyi, and the Deputy Director, Kenkichi Ninomiya, are sparing no effort to actively expand the internal organization and strengthen the supervision work. The office has established an Administrative Section, an Inspection Section, and an Investigation Section. The Director of each section is concurrently held by the Director of Supervision, and an Award and Punishment Supervision Office is established. Each performs its duties to promote affairs. The original office building on the fifth floor of the North Building is small and insufficient for use, so it was moved to the new address on the fifth floor of the South Building on January of this month.

### Registration of Daily Necessities is Handled by the Economic Bureau

The registration of daily necessities in the city was originally handled by the Economic Office of the Former First District Office. Since the unification of the city's administrative agencies, this task has been assigned to the Fourth Section of the Economic Bureau for continued registration.

Wu Mother Scholarship Fund

Wu Renjia and Zhongren brothers, in memory of their late mother Madam Chen, wrote to this newspaper to handle a special scholarship fund. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, August 21st is the 20th anniversary of our late mother's death. We received generous gifts from relatives and friends, and we are deeply ashamed. We think that the scholarship funds handled by your newspaper in the past have greatly benefited poor students. Therefore, we will use the gift money received, totaling 141,000 yuan in national currency, and the discounted value of silk tents, funerary objects, etc., totaling 19,000 yuan, to make a total of 160,000 yuan. Except for 10,000 yuan donated to the China Relief Fund for Women and Children by Mr. Xu Lifu, the giver, the remaining 150,000 yuan will be established as the 'Wu Mother Madam Chen Scholarship Fund.' The above scholarship fund has been deposited into the Lisheng Trust Bank at 398 Jiangxi Road, and account number 6009 has been opened for disaster relief, and the Trust Department of the bank is responsible for safekeeping. We have also consulted with the bank's authorities that since the matter is a charitable act, they have agreed to a special preferential interest rate of 40% per month. We have heard that the bank will soon jointly hold trust investment with other banks and firms. At that time, the scholarship fund will be entrusted as the investment amount, in order to obtain generous benefits and increase the number of scholarships. We plan to have your newspaper select the five best female students from poor families in the first year of junior high school and the first year of high school in each application for scholarships, and provide full funding for tuition and miscellaneous fees. The above scholarship quota is completely based on excellent academic performance and poor family background as the standard. We know that small streams cannot fill a large river, but we are just doing good for our relatives and friends."

Scholarship funds received yesterday: Song Zhuozai (commissioned to handle special scholarship funds) 29,500 yuan, Lu Wanyao 3,000 yuan, Xinxingji 700 yuan, Lin Jun 200 yuan, Ying Yongyu (sent on behalf of Mr. Pan Xianrong's late father) 40 yuan, Pu Qiting 20 yuan, totaling 33,460 yuan in storage coupons, leaving a balance of 16,280,340 yuan.

### The Issue of Withdrawing the Smallest Denomination Banknotes

— Cheng Qipeng

Since the abnormal rise in prices, various items have been priced at least in units of one yuan. Therefore, jiao and fen notes have been regarded as superfluous. Initially, trams and power companies still used them for making change, but later, tram fares rose, and power companies refused to accept banknotes below one yuan. Bank businesses also refused to accept large amounts of jiao and fen for deposit due to the hassle. Today, apart from paying retail donations, they are virtually useless. Householders are using them as materials for giving children toys and as gambling chips. Therefore, the contempt for jiao and fen subsidiary coins has become even more pronounced.

The editorial in the July Economic Daily also discussed this issue. It said that in the past, during the gold standard era, the bank maintained subsidiary coins by unlimited income of subsidiary coins. Since the implementation of the legal currency policy, various banknotes have only had differences in denomination size, and there is no classification of official coins. Therefore, the issuing authorities should bear the responsibility of unlimited redemption of small denomination banknotes, in order to strengthen the people's faith and reduce the losses suffered.

Indeed, the number of small denomination subsidiary coin notes issued can also be said to be a very large number. If the issuing authorities do not implement the above-mentioned measures, wouldn't the losses suffered by the people be too great? If a large number of small notes are withdrawn, and very few large notes are issued, the losses on the issuing authorities' side can be said to be minimal, while on the people's side, accumulating little by little can still make a small difference. In addition, the credit of the subsidiary coin issuing authority can also be increased, which is a multiple win. I wonder what the financial authorities think about it?

### Social Service Mr. Jin Rongzong Donates Money in Response to Midwifery Hoping for Greater Empathy and Effort from Society

Mr. Jin Rongzong wrote: "The last time I donated to the midwifery fund, I received your receipt number 23. It was received correctly. Now I am enclosing a check for 3,000 yuan, which I still donate to your midwifery fund. It is my opinion that the midwifery fund that your office is advocating is of great benefit to society. However, the city has a large population and a high birth rate, especially among the lower and poorer classes. Due to economic difficulties, most of them rely on traditional methods of delivery, or are hastily handled by familiar women with some birth experience. The danger is unimaginable. Therefore, the number of people who die from difficult labor, contract diseases after childbirth, and die unnaturally each year is countless. There are even cases where both mother and child die at the same time. All of this is caused by unsanitary delivery methods. Is there anything more tragic in the world than this? Therefore, I hope that your office will make greater efforts in midwifery and promote it widely. Then the poor pregnant women in the city will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. My humble contribution is just to provide a starting point."

### Thunderstorm (1)

— By Tian Fengxiong, Translated by Hong Yang

During the summer of 1940, the Far East crisis was rumored at least three times. Although the rumors were very prevalent, the results always disappeared unnoticed. However, the premonition of the third time, since the summer of 1941, became more and more solidified and began to linger.

People are bewildered by weather forecasting. Those who directly suffer the premonition are the local people. Because the central government has too many meteorological officials, opinions are divided and nothing can be decided. Some even believe that the sky is a symbol of clear weather.

By October, the Third Konoe Cabinet resigned en masse. When the Tojo Cabinet came to power, it felt like a sudden burst of opportunity. However, not long after, people's understanding of the five-star flag began to fade. The sharp rise in cigarette prices on November 1 may not have been caused by the silent coercion of the ABCD joint front, but by the prevailing sentiment.

On November 14, Roosevelt declared the seriousness of the Pacific crisis at a press conference, but at that time, our Japanese Ambassador Kurusu was flying over the Midway Islands to San Francisco. Needless to explain, diplomats are messengers of peace. The ambassador and Ambassador Nomura jointly said to the American reporters who came to greet them, "Try to find a way to slow down the situation."

Soon after, President Roosevelt and Hull, who stopped Thanksgiving travel, began the first negotiation with Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu. After two or three negotiations, although it gave the general public a difficult impression, it was not considered hopeless. Nevertheless, on November 27, the U.S. Marines in Shanghai finally withdrew. Preparations for war in the Philippines were increased. Britain also increased troops in Burma and added many Indian troops to Malaya. Aircraft carriers appeared on the eastern sea of Singapore. On December 1, a fleet with the new battleship Prince of Wales as its flagship entered Singapore.

"The thunderstorm is finally coming."

Under the cloud of war, such an urgent voice came.

"But we can't draw conclusions yet! The increasingly complex diplomatic negotiations may suddenly improve. Even if the negotiations are fierce, there will not be an immediate conflict."

It seems that those who understand meteorology issued such an optimistic voice.

On December 5, the Japanese Imperial Government handed over the reply to the 7th U.S.-Japan Negotiation Meeting.

On the 7th, the newspapers suddenly published the news that the negotiations had stalled. But on this day, President Roosevelt issued a U.S. naval mobilization order.

Finally, the morning of December 8th arrived. The rain in the faint morning light shook the people of Japan. The misty smoke was completely blown away, and the people with their hair standing on end showed the murderous aura of early winter. Ah, no one will forget that calm and warm sky. (139)
